good morning hello good afternoon good evening good middle of the night I don't know where you are I don't know where I actually I do know where I am my glasses are very dirty I am now uh uh I attempting something that I've never attempted before and I will say a little bit in a minute about maybe who I am and what I'm doing here but I'm currently I turned on a live stream to three different outputs YouTube twitch and Facebook Facebook now has live streaming I'm not so sure this is such a good idea but I don't know what's currently working so I'm going to uh take a look at my laptop over here and I'm going to check the most important one is really the YouTube one which ah does seem to be working oops and I'm um uh which is good because that's the one that was giving me the most trouble before so people on YouTube people of YouTube people of Earth YouTube or alien YouTube if you're watching this in the distant future or the not so distant future in the alien YouTube thing in the archive robot let takeover time thing anyway uh let me know how the sound quality is uh is the picture quality okay I also have this whiteboard is this over here I need to I didn't actually Focus the camera I'm out of sorts I was in another foreign country on the other side of the world for a while but I'm back and I'm ready here I've got six straight weeks of doing this uh I see people on YouTube are saying things seem to be working I'm not g to I'm gonna open up Twitch just so I have it here too uh twitch uh and then I'm going to Facebook am I streaming to Facebook I don't know how to I don't know how to tell uh maybe if I go to my profile page I can see if I am oh look I am look at that uh Facebook streaming is a great idea okay there I am I'm on I'm I'm on Mom Dad I'm on Facebook is that a thing um so okay so let me give a quick introduction for anybody who's watching uh about what's going to happen here it's very warm in here today I'm going to have to I have a tshirt on underneath I might have to remove the outer layer I'm starting to feel a little the clamped um okay so my name is Dan uh schiffman I am a person who lives in New York City uh I uh work on a lot of different things uh namely a couple things I work on are something called processing and something called p5js those are programming environments I uh sometimes be on the internet to uh do lessons and tutorials and things about programming so that's where I am right now and I I haven't actually I'm doing this weekly I haven't done this in a couple weeks cuz I was away um in China lovely country pollution was not so great but otherwise I had an amazing time uh I would love to say more about that but I think I should move on um uh YouTube is not available in China I met with some folks who are suggesting maybe I upload some of my content to yuku I might do some subtitles that's another story for another time I'm here today uh trying to get back my head back into things uh and figure out what to do today so the first the thing I'm going to start with uh is that I'm currently running an online course with a company called Caden uh and um I'm going to look at the Forum post there have been some questions there with some interesting topics and I will answer those questions and do a few programming examples mostly about uh physics simulation and forces uh and then I'm going to go to my list of topics and try to pick something else uh to kind of do as a tutorial today as well well and in the future I will have these much more planned but I literally had like 20 minutes to get this set up and it's working uh and there it is so I I've like I've desperately is this is like social media addiction which I like desperately want to like look and see what's going on but I so those of you who are watching online I don't know if there is a Facebook Chat where you can ask questions or but uh the chat that I typically look at is YouTube so somebody you can you can find my YouTube channel I'm sure uh okay uh so I'm going to the YouTube channel I'm going to check the comments uh and leave Facebook alone it is evil agreed look I'm just here trying to reach as many people as possible and you know we'll see what happens uh okay so everything is working everybody's saying things are working that's wonderful I am not on the live dashboard I need to switch to a different page give me a second oh I have that over here closing this opening this do you like my n oh 42 wow this is like I've never had so many people watching at once this is very exciting and this is my least prepared day for this so this is terrible okay so the first thing I'm going to do is um uh uh okay so one thing I'll mention is so this is you're watching the current live stream I like how Google thinks I'm in Hong Kong it's gone now it knows I'm in New York uh so this live stream is me just talking and operating some computers but what I will do oh and I have to hit record uh I'm GNA hit record so now I am recording this live stream disc because what will happen later is if there are if it so happens that there are some nuggets of wisdom or some uh short 10minute spots that are useful tutorials I will edit those separately as videos and upload to Youtube um a couple just administrative things I want to talk about so I've been doing some traveling my traveling is done until July 4th so I'm going to be doing this every week for six weeks straight I'm hoping to do two sessions per week 100% I'm going to well 100% I'm definitely going to do one but I would like to do two sessions per week I have a slight problem which is that on June 8th I've been called for jury duty which arguably is actually quite a convenient time for me to do it because I have kind of nothing else going on semester is over summer this is my thing now um but so uh June 8th which is a Wednesday I I have jury duty so I'll be out for a few days doing that or longer depending on what what happens with that the other thing I'll mention is that I am going to start a patreon uh so if you're interested in that uh there'll be more information about that in some various form now if you want to get email announcements I'll just mention really briefly this is the last sort of admin thing I'll do if you go to uh shiffman domnet which is my uh website and up in the corner here there is a place where you can put in your email hit get updates usually what I typically right I'm trying to establish a regular schedule I've been saying that for like three months and I have not managed to do so but um I have been uh at some point I will but what I've been doing is it's essentially like the night before or two days before sending an email saying this Tuesday 1100 a.m. eastern standard time will be the live stream which is today Tuesday at 1100 a.m. so you can sign up to get those otherwise Twitter yada yada yada y 63 people are watching this is like we're approaching a record one of these days I'm going to get to 100 uh plus 38 and I don't I don't know if I can count the Facebook yet and uh uh it should always be referred to as the Facebook maybe that makes it less evil I'm not sure this it's all evil right I mean or it's not I mean what's what's evil what's not evil it's all evil hopefully I'm not evil uh the website again is shiffman Donnet uh okay so I'm just poking around here to see uh what's going on I see that I'm on Twitch I'm on YouTube Facebook has 47 viewers this is insane but I I guess Facebook has like an audience there uh all right uh okay I'm awkwardly ah I feel like terrified now somebody somebody magically tell me it's going to be okay uh uh um you are a lens but a person behind the lens okay so let me start by going to I'm going to do some Quest Q&A so I'm gonna go I'm running this thing now I'm running this uh course with Caden you know me personally just to give you a quick point of view I much prefer now over the past number of years of doing this kind of stuff I prefer to do selfpublishing I prefer to just sort of have my own YouTube channel make videos kind of independently try to have stuff be open and available for free experiment with different Revenue models whether crowdsourcing whether advertising or none whether just sort of being paid by a university and sort will have them let me do this but I did do an exper and I I had sort of a negative experience with the learning processing book which I could talk about on a uh which was done with a publishing company but I did decide to do a course with this company um as an experiment um there's some great people who worked for this company uh it was interesting to do sort of a collaboration I kind of do these videos on my own but there were various people to collaborate with to help with sort of scripting and editing and all that sort of stuff so anyway U that's that's um what's happening there so this course is running you can see all the videos for free and you can pay some amount of money to I don't know submit assignments and that sort of thing so what I would like to do is log in uh uh by the way I love that there's an email that pops up in my autofill that says daniel. shman plus unicorn like when did I I I was like every once in a while I need like an extra email address and at one point I must have typed in plus unicorn that's pretty great uh okay but my email for Caden is definitely this and I have no idea what my password is I totally spelled that wrong let's see if that works oh it's totally the wrong password okay I'm gonna look it up over here I have a separate computer I use uh I'm not GNA plug some password organization tool I'm going to look it up here kadenz uh and my password is uh oh my God it is an impossible to remember password good job being with my security okay this is going to be insane I'm going to read you some of the letters capital y0 z capital V uh n parentheses capital r capital Y lowercase r n parentheses capital m capital I and then three more things great now my password with knowing all of that log in oh come on oh invalid this is okay deck failure o pause pause time do I have that superpower yet no I don't it's a live stream so I can't pause time I must I either typed it in wrong or okay I'm just gonna here's what I'm gonna do right now I'm going to just look at it over on this computer because I just want to look at the questions uh and you know what may maybe it's better this way anyway um because I don't maybe people don't want their uh names if they did a forum post showing up on this live stream so now I'm going to do login uh come on you can do it this is must be riveting for those of you watching maybe I could get a Chewbacca mask and wear it and that would help um uh I'm typ in my email and typing in my password okay I must oh yeah it worked okay so I I was not able to transfer it correctly so I'm logged in now I'm going to go to the forums you can't see this but and I will read to you the questions I'm also going to check the chat um uh okay I am uh I am now in the core uh now I'm in the forums and I'm going to start looking at some questions a lot of questions there so hello now I need to check the YouTube chat because you can also if you're on YouTube do live questions if you're on the Facebook remember it is pronounced the Facebook one word I think right um uh uh um I I I don't know how to I don't know how to see I don't understand this Facebook thing maybe I should use Snapchat I should like Snapchat this is that how you do it I think that's how you do it I read an article that said Snapchat for old people how to understand it and it it sort of made sense to me um okay uh where am I YouTube I'm looking for YouTube I'm also on Twitch um okay oh a yes I'm definitely at some point gonna get a 360 camera in here because why not I mean come on okay I don't see any questions so far on YouTube I do see that there are 73 people watching which is kind of shocking to me well I I have a very I do very I like I've done several things in the past like completely have computers freeze and things which tends to send people away so I'm going to go to the forums now and I'm going to uh wow there's a lot of questions um and I'm actually going to start with a question that comes from uh Alex um and the question is um I feel like I want to speak directly to you this is very bad what I'm about to do here this way I could look at you while I'm reading I'm attempting to create a moderately functional Sid R ER using different forces and whatnot but the acceleration of my object seems immediate and abrupt going from zero uh zero to acceleration to an immediate constant acceleration yada yada yada etc etc I'm looking for advice how to simulate gravity so that jumping can be implemented such as when a user presses a key to jump a force is exerted displaying that jump okay I think I get this question this is a great programming problem I think we could spend some time working it out for those of you who might be interested and if both of you are not interested you can just turn this off I recommend probably that you turn it off um I have some uh tea here I will take a sip of that for a second I oh I I I'm not supposed to talk about drinking the tea because the last time I did that somebody on YouTube was very angry at me and wrote lots of comments about okay so let's talk about what I think we're going to program here to answer this first question so let's imagine uh this is your canvas and um you have this sort of like scene where you have this uh stick figure and the stick figure is is moving across like a platform this is some standard kind of game I think right somebody can post in the chat plat not a platform game it's like a sidescroller maybe that's what it's called and so this uh person is moving this way and maybe there are like different obstacles and what you want is for this person this character to be able to jump over those obstacles not too dissimilar from like Flappy Bird also right we Flappy Bird there's like I just wanted to see if I could draw a bird let's see my alien bird oh look with some weird crazy dragon wings or something I don't know I I I lost I got lost in my own fantasy imagination there for a second sorry so um so you can imagine this bird flying this way and you press a key and it pushes a force pushing up so one of the things actually in most of my examples and even if you go back and watch all my nature of code videos that are on YouTube or the videos that are for this Caden course generally you'll see that I have these forces being applied continuously like gravity is always there or an object is always seeking a Target so I think this is an interesting thing to to discuss what about a kind of instantaneous Force for example I'm just standing here and suddenly this great force just instantaneously pushes me up from the bottom and I jump so um how would you simulate that and of course like a key press or a mouse click could do something like that so the other thing that I think is interesting about this problem is that um you know what what's moving right this in the in the world right if I move this way I move this way right I'm right here's this pen and I'm moving oh no I can't do it I'm moving towards the pen but what's not to say that the uh I can't do this optical illusion the pen moving am I moving or is the pen moving you can see because the back the point is that was a terrible demonstration the point is what hap what if I want the background to move I want it to appear that this person is moving but they're actually in the canvas staying in the same place so that's kind of an interesting question as well so let's uh I I guess um let's go see if we can let me come back here and I I see green bars which means audio is still working um checking the chat um uh okay there's some weird things going on in the chat which I will ignore um so let's see let's figure out where we're going to program this so um one thing I should do I think is let's not start from scratch so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to uh GitHub um and uh I have a lot of code in a lot of places I don't know what that means that sounds a little weird uh and I want to go to uh repositories and I'm going to look at this one for right now so um I have a lot of different nature of code repositories for various simulation and physics examples this has some code that goes specifically with that particular online course so I'm just going to start from there uh and I'm going to uh just download it as a zip um if you're wondering about git and GitHub for only 0 and0 you could watch my GitHub tutorials is it popping up here no because it doesn't do that but I do have some get GitHub tutorials they are free you have to watch some ads I might turn off the ads I don't know what to do about the ads okay so I think I downloaded that and uh what I'm going to do is show in finder I'm going to open up this folder and uh session one session two um let's put this folder on the desktop just for right now uh over here and let's find an example to start with uh session two three examples which to begin with let's do the particles array one uh and I'm going to but what we're doing is actually quite different than these examples so I'm going to use this P5 editor even though I haven't actually been using it recently in these video tutorials I've been using adom or Sublime uh okay but let's just let's look at what this example is doing click it says here click to add particles so okay so you can see what this this is how my examples typically look right my examples typically look like okay there's a bunch of things in the screen and there are various forces one force is gravity another force is wind so I think when I click the mouse you can see that there's this wind Force suddenly being applied so in that sense a force is being applied one force is being applied continuously the Gravity Force another force is being applied only when the mouse is held down but neither of those are just like a single onetime Force but let's at least look at where in the code that's happening and then I'm going to completely restructure this example to um do this platform thing okay so uh here uh here in the sketch we can see this happening here so um there there are these particle objects and the particle objects are in a particle's array and an apply Force function is being called on each of those apply Force gravity is always being called apply force wind is only being called if the mouse is pressed basic structure for an example and uh now if I go to the particle object here is the key thing that I want to show you this is the apply Force function so I you know I I don't know who's watching this or where you're from or why you're here or if you've already left or what but just to mention briefly these examples are built on Newton's second law of motion which is stated as Force equals mass time ACC acceleration the definition of a force is a vector a thing that causes an object with mass to accelerate so if I push something with a force that object it has a mass it's going to accelerate so that's written this way Force equals mass time acceleration it can also be written as acceleration equals force divided by mass so if I go back over here to the code you'll see that's exactly what's Happening Here the apply Force function receives a force variable it divides it by mass and it adds it to the object's acceleration now there's a lot more to say about that and so if you want to kind of go back and what's a vector and how did it get all the way to this point then you could go and watch either my uh it's just like a walking advertisement for myself which is kind of weird but uh you can watch the nature of code videos that I have on YouTube or uh you better yet you might just go and watch the videos that are with on the Caden website for this particular course okay um uh oh did somebody said yeah I can't hear any some something okay stop time out I need to know if people can hear audio before I keep going so I'm going to clap I'm gonna do the Hand Jive can you hear that I hear sound I hear sound I hear sound yes okay people are saying they hear sound I I can't I can't look at the Facebook I'm afraid of it so the Facebook is happening if you want if you're on watching on Facebook and you want to interact with me you're going to have to go to the YouTube chat I can only look at one chat okay great everything's working fine um okay so where are we okay so now I need to completely restructure this example because if you're still with me what I'm trying to build is this let's make a game why not let's make a game where you're a little person or a big person or or an alien or whatever it is and you're running and obstacles are there and you have to jump over them I think we could do that I I got time I don't have anywhere to go I mean I have to eat lunch at some point I mean I don't have to I could skip lunch salad would be nice okay um so here we go so I've got a I don't know if it was so great to start with this particular example because it's got a lot of extra stuff in it but I'm going to do uh I'm going to do save as and I'm gonna um just put this on the desktop right now and I'm going to call this the running game is that a thing running game I don't know what that is I hope that's not something like weird that I just called it okay um so what I want to do here is now have a um uh person and I'm going to say uh I'm going to just say the person uh forget about this mouse press thing ah ah oh how's this font size I feel like this font size needs to be a little bit bigger uh that looks good I think you can read that let me know if the font size is okay uh wow I've never this is definitely a record that there are 80 people watching this on YouTube right now which is kind of a little terrifying okay the person is a new particle and oh I have this like I have so many things that I want to do in these videos I let's see how much time we have today it's 1130 I got at least till 1 o'clock 1 pm um then I will be attending there is an exhibition at ITP of um experimental storytelling things anybody wants to stop by and say hi uh okay it's a little hot in here um okay so now what I want to do is I'm just going to say let's um I'm going to simplify some things this particle object is going to be my person and I am going to take out this idea of mass because that will make things a little bit simpler and I am going to and I will review all the pieces of this code once uh I'm going to say uh once things are kind of going I'm going to say person. update person do is it show or display let's see what's the name of that function display person. display and um let's just see and uh the particle and let's just rename this the person uh and uh and I'm gonna say new whoops I'm gonna say then new person uh okay and let's see so what do I have now if I run this good I don't see any errors uh let's oh no uh and then I'm going to go here I'm going to just get rid of this click to add particles from the HTML file and run this okay uh that's strange didn't I delete that did I not save it there we go okay there we go okay so now I've got my empty canvas now okay so what I want this person let's just make the person a rectangle you will do this someday on your own and make this more interesting and actually I'm going to uh just simplify things and get rid of these arguments and say the person is going to be at pixel uh 50 and the location will be at Y is um uh height so I'm gonna draw this person this is I'm everything is always so tricky I'm gonna draw this person I want to draw this person just as a rectangle kind of sitting on the bottom of the screen uh so let's see so the location is am I back here yet no the location is the bottom of the screen so now I want to in the display function I want to make this a rectangle uh so a rectangle at this do X and Y is the height but let's say a height let's say the the person is 50 pixels tall so this doy minus 50 like 20 pixels wide and 50 pixels high and those should be variables but let's just see if at the very least we have I don't see the person yet so what's what's missing um let's uh let's let's get rid of um update for a second I still don't see the person uh let's see let's uh oh thisp is the the name of the variable it's a vector object not individual x's and y's of course there we go so now we're getting somewhere yay we have a little uh Square there at the bottom and I want that person to move so let's put um uh let's put sorry let's put uh update back in okay so I I I'm at a point now where I can take a moment to breathe and kind of I just had to restructure that example I it probably would have honestly been easier me just programm this from scratch but that's the example we had so the person has is an object with an update and a display function let's look at what it means to be this person the person has a position which is where that person is on the screen a velocity meaning its current change in position and acceleration which is the thing that's going to be How does its velocity change which is uh uh uh Changed by a force so let just to get a sort of experiment going here what if I were to say uh in the what the person's velocity instead of being Z 0 was is 1 comma 0 so now if I were to run this again we can see there's the person moving so we can see that velocity this velocity Vector controls um the person's movement now interestingly enough let's place an obstacle in the scene I want to kind of tackle this weird uh view Port question problem first before I get any too far into this so let's let's place an obstacle on the scene and I'm going to just say obstacle equals uh I'm going to say I'm going to make a variable called obstacle and I'm going to say obstacle equals create Vector um uh and you know what I'm just going to have the yeah um there's so many different ways I could do this um I'm gonna say um you know what I'm going to do I'm uh we're gonna I think we're going to want an obstacle object so for right now I'm going to do something totally silly which is just hard code something in so I'm going to make this nice uh some sort of purplish pinkish color and I'm going to say rectangle where this window is 640 pixels wide so let's stick it at 400 pixels uh make it uh uh 50 pixels wide and uh uh 50 pixels High uh so I'm doing the same sort of thing here um like this uh oh No 3 ah so this would be height minus 50 okay so I'm just trying to draw a another rectangle that sits at the Bott bottom and so what I want is the idea here for this example is as this thing is moving I want to press the space bar and have it jump over that obstacle this is what we're going for you guys still with me oh 94 people my my head is exploding oh my God this is totally insane this is not very good what am I gonna do okay uh it'll get better maybe or not okay so okay so here's the thing right now we see the person moving towards the obstacle what if I don't because the person has a forward velocity so I want to keep my physics kind of true to form with that forward velocity but what if I want to see the person in place and the obstacle moving instead well interestingly enough I think you know I'm kind of honestly I'm not really like a game programmer and there might there probably some very standard ways of doing these things and that I might be missing here but I might also just be coming up with these sort of things on the fly in the exactly the same way but the way that I would approach this would be rather than setting the velocity of this to zero and have giving this a velocity what I might do is just move almost our view of the scene always to be centered on this particular character and the way I can do that is with translate so the translate function I'm going to write this down the translate function and this is a kind of function that exists across most computer Graphics environments any type of opengl programming environment processing P5 open Frameworks probably like three jzz I don't know who knows they have their own way of day they with 3js 3js it whatever it has its own way of doing things um so I don't know what I'm talking about and this camera just went off because apparently I've been talking for a half an hour that's how I keep time this one's going to go off in a second there see now I'm turning it back on um okay so what translate allows you to do is move the point of origin so the point of origin by default in a canvas in the browser is the top left corner that is 0 0 so this character is drawn relative to 0 but what if I sort of think of instead of drawing the character relative to 00 but I always position the origin relative to where the character is so in other words if the character moves over here then I just want to move the origin kind of over here as well so that I always see so that I always see the character sort of staying in place now I I know that might not have been the most succinct or sensical way of explaining that but hopefully that made some sense to you um and uh oh my God I think I might actually hit the 100 people today um and so what I think I can do here is right here I can add a trans so let me just show you what I mean by this what if I were to just say translate 100 Zer so I move the origin negative 100 pixels to the left what does this do to our scene well everything is shifted over you can see how right let me do that again so um and I'm going to make this a variable I'm going to do something crazy uh yeah I'm going to show you some wacky JavaScript debugging craziness because I just I'm feeling like this is whatever today I'm just I'm warming back up to doing this on a weekly basis I answered one question for about a half an hour I'll probably be answering this question for another hour but I will go through the other questions uh I'm getting a lot of friend requests all of a sudden on Facebook okay I can't look at my phone during this thing okay um it's terrible unless unless I'm that's the universal symbol for Snapchatting I don't I really don't know what Snapchat is it's very embarrassing it's because I have gray hair okay uh x equals um x equals uh zero so I'm just going to put a translate here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to run this and I'm going to go to this little gear icon here so that I have a nice little JavaScript console and right now if I say x equals 00 you can see how I'm shifting things over right so I I'm a I'm live updating that of x to kind of move where that origin is to move my view of the scene like I need to move the C it's kind of like moving the camera over so I think a nice way of doing that wasn't the greatest demonstration I thought it was going to be much more interesting um um I think what what would work really well here is what if I just say person. position dox what if I always just offset the view by that person's Exposition only not its Exposition negative it Exposition because as that person's moving I want to offset the view further back so let's do that let's run this and you can see look at that now the um obstacle is moving so the physics haven't changed right the physics of this scenario are 100% the same it's just our view is changing and I could do like weird stuff like I could say like times. five and then you kind of have this like weird like the view is is like the camera's moving but not as fast anyway that's kind of that's kind of crazy it's sort of hard to see it just looks like they're Crossing but if there are multiple things moving at different speeds you might even get some kind of crazy Parallax effect but anyway I'm going to keep things simple right now and just keep this only I don't want the person I think all the way at the left I like them kind of shift it over so I'll just shift it over by like 50 pixels so you can see this is now my view of the game and what I want now is when I press the space bar for the the um user to jump and guess what this is actually super easy um it's not super easy in general but it's super easy because all of the work of building a kind of mini physics engine into this example is already there now admittedly I haven't I didn't do that work in today's session but if you're following along in the other materials you're kind of that's you're sort of ready for that so in other words we are this is easy because I already have this apply Force function so I have a mechanism for saying here's a vector stick that Vector in the object and normally that Vector is put in um normally I don't know what normally means but as you saw in my other examples that Vector you might be uh put in draw so for example ex Le if I were to say uh a force is create vector and I'm just going to give it like a little push to the right so that it goes faster um actually let's have it let's give it a little push to the left so that it slows down this will be interesting and then if I say person. apply Force you can see now the person is slowing down and suddenly moving backwards and it's weird because it really looks like that other thing is moving so hard to like get your I think get a like more complex scene with lots more things you would have more of the sensation of the of this particular character moving um but you can see here now if I could also do something like if Mouse is pressed only then will I apply this Force so here the person is moving ah I want to slow down slow down slow down slow down go back up back up back up back up you know what it would also help if the person was a little animation of like a running person um you know obviously there's visual cues you could add to this to make this better okay so you can see this is how we apply a force now now what I want to do is apply not a continuous force in draw over and over again but a force only when a certain event happens so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a function um this is something specifically the p5js library that function is going to be called key pressed ah I can't boy I'm usually such a good typist and today it's just a disaster um and what I want to do is I'm just going to check like if the key is the space bar that's a really easy way of just checking like what key was pressed if the key is the the character space then this is where I'm going to apply this Force so what should that force be and I'm going to call that that a variable jump and I'm going to say create Vector now I want the user to do what jump in the air straight in the air so I'm going to just give it a force pointing up which is zero comma some some negative number now normally if you normally in a lot of my other examples you'll see generally forces have very small amounts 0.112 3 7 9 841 um I had a joke there that I forgot to do but I I'll make it happen later um it was a terrible joke anyway um so I just like lost my breath for a second train of thought um okay so normally you want sort of like a small number because if a force is something being applied continuously that thing is going into the object's acceleration continuously and numbers can get out of control very fast in a kind of canvas animation environment things going crazy but this is an instantaneous Force for it to have an effect it needs to be something rather large so let's make this a negative one and then I just want to say person. apply Force jump okay so let's see if this is enough for us okay here it comes uh there we go I'm jumping now interestingly enough I win I fly to the heavens that was an easy game on no obstacle will ever hit me again so why did that not appear to do anything like you might imagine it should well remember if if you apply a force to something moving up it's going to move up and if there's no Force to push it back down it's not going to move down that's like Newton's first law of motion um so we need to have gravity in this world and so in that is a force that should be applied continuously in the opposite direction so I'm going to create a vector and I'm going to make this sort of a small vector and I'm going to say person. apply Force gravity so now I want to continue continuously apply gravity oh I hit 100 people that's very exciting 103 people are watching YouTube I should check the chat is it still working uh okay now ah so look at that what happened now oh no right we've got a problem gravity was applying and there's apparently this is a quicksand simulation right so I don't have a sense of the ground here now this is where we get into a lot of trouble with our wanting to be true to the physics of the world you know in truth gravity is a force on me so my body is applying a force to the floor and then there's like this like the third lot of motion with the equal and opposite and there's you know tension force because the floor is attached to some be I don't I'm lost already but I think this is a scenario where hello it's just a rectangle on a screen so I think we could probably just say you know what don't go below the bottom so in that sense one of the things we could do and I'm this this particle this person object actually from the previous example has this edges function and so let's use that function and let's forget about this uh this aspect of it let's just say okay what do we do if this object is going below um falling below the uh the window itself so this old code here this old code Like This Old House anybody ever watched This Old House on PBS I kind of is this kind of like this old code instead of coding rainbow May should just called it this old code anyway let see if anybody gets that reference I don't even know if I do it's just sort of like this weird childhood memory that like popped into my head um so this old code I did have a point here was a bouncing code so something is falling its velocity reverses Direction and turns around so it's for bouncing but I don't really want bouncing here right now I mean I might want bouncing what I want is jump and stick stick The Landing kind of gymnastics stick The Landing so um so what I'm going to do actually is I'm just going to multiply its velocity times zero meaning if it hits the bottom its velocity multiplying its y component of its velocity makes its y velocity zero meaning it's instantly stuck to the bottom that's like the least accurate physics simulation thing I could ever possibly do but I think it will work in this case and then I also just want to like let's keep the position at the height so let's not get into like a weird thing where it's like a little bit below if it goes below at any point stop it from moving set it back to the bottom so now if we run this oh okay person is not defined so I must have a syntax error somewhere uh uh so this is this is a good thing to happen because this will happen to you um let's look what did what what did I add let's uh oh I think I oh I added I think I lost a curly bracket that's all I did so look this this closes this curly bracket this closes that Curly bracket and the I needed a curly bracket for this whole person Constructor function okay so let's run this now oh bye the quick sand is still active Okay so I think we have a problem which is uh that I just didn't call that edges function here so I also uh want to after I update I want to call edges to do that test for the edges and you can see the person is not falling more now I could press jump oh boy so that force is way too weak I'm not making it over that square anytime soon so let's kind of just play with some numbers here let's give it like make it 10 times as strong there we go whoa that was a really high jump oh quick uh okay so that worked um so you know know uh maybe let's try half split the difference it's pretty good I might have to actually time this correctly that was perfect okay that was very exciting okay so that's kind of the basic idea I kind of want to go further with this because I should add an array of obstacles and I should do a collision detection test I think maybe I'm going to kind of like pause here for right now maybe I would come back to this example a little bit later because I think there were some other questions that I wanted to look at I also I feel like maybe I just need like a moment to breathe um uh and um and uh kind of catch my train of thought so this is the basic idea you know there wasn't really a lot this is a kind of very I I would love it if some of you watching this perhaps when I post this code later uh take this code and kind of um um kind of put your spin on it add an animation add a character add a sound add uh multiple obstacles maybe think about the view the view is like a little bit uh we weird right now um but um anyway so uh okay so I'm going to just check this chat here to see if there's any questions uh okay um wow there's lots of people watching um let me go over to uh here let's see am I still streaming on Facebook with 70 viewers this is insane uh okay this is definitely the most people I've ever had watched live and there are 10 people on Twitch and um okay great uh all right um all right so let me okay so let me go back to the uh kadenz Forum I probably should put the questions here but I'm gonna I'm going to look for another question to answer and once I get to one hour so I'm at so I'm my my sort of plan I'm GNA have a little te here my plan for this was to do this for about two hours from 11 to 1 um again if those of you who are just sort of tuning in late so to speak I'm going to be doing these once a week or twice a week like I might do this hopefully do this again on Thursday or Friday this week um and I do have a long list of topics and various tutorials I'm kind of just getting back into the groove of things today so this is a little bit haphazard but I I do want to have a sort of longer term view of of topics sound being a big one sound in the browser p5js Sound Library um more connecting computer vision uh more git and GitHub uh Chrome extensions um some more service side programming with node stuff oh I have this crazy Minecraft tutorial idea because you know I'm trying to see if I can I don't know I'll talk talk about that later I'm too embarrassed to talk about it right now uh okay so let me go back to um the forums and I did post a uh thread where I ask people to ask their questions to the thread um ah okay so I'm what I'm going to do right now is kind of just um answer some of these questions a bit more uh rapid fire not necessarily um program them uh by the way I'm just curious um if this would interest people uh if I I was thinking of doing a coding challenge today of the and do reaction diffusion uh so I'm going to just do an image search so um reaction diffusion is a kind of um chemical reaction type simulation that you can do with all sorts of patterns like this and I was thinking of doing that as a kind of 15minute coding challenge toward the end of this session so if people are interested in that I got one request of a couple requests of that and I was like oh I've done that before I haven't done it in over a year or uh like uh so I have to like review it and look back at it so it'll be somewhat fresh but um but I do know it's possible I I have a processing example that does this so that's what I'm sort of thinking um okay uh okay so the question I'm um uh where are we here uh H so people seem interested yes people are saying good reaction diffusion okay so I'm going to answer a bunch more questions and then I'm going to uh do the reaction diffusion okay so let me read you a question uh taking for example 01 drag Force how to use shapes different shapes for liquid objects triangles or circles okay this is a great question so let me first show you this example uh and I'm going to go back to the P5 editor so one of the examples that I have in the nature of code materials is a drag Force which is like a air resistance or fluid resistance force if I run this example you'll be able to see this uh quite easily here so what do I have over here I have a scene with these falling circles one of the things interesting that you can see is that objects fall at the exact same acceleration due to gravity right it's that number that you could look up on Wikipedia that I can never seem to remember the acceleration due to gravity it's because even though acceleration is the acceleration of an object is it's ma the gravitational force divided by mass so you would think like well if a something's more massive it's going to accelerate less but remember gravitational force is scaled by mass so that Mass gets canceled out that's why you drop two things from the leading Tower of Pisa or whatever Galileo or whoever experiment that was they fall at the same acceleration now obviously air resistance and other funny factors can play a role and this demonstrates that precisely here because what happens when these two objects land in something like water the fluid resistance is going to cause a much greater acceleration on the smaller one which the less Mass so greater acceleration means greater acceleration in the reverse Direction meaning it slows down more and you can see the bigger one slows down less so this is an example I have and the the question really gets that you know the the example is really about how to calculate that force and just um you know in here in the there is a liquid object and you can see that force is calculated in here it is a constant coefficient of drag uh it's also it's also weighted according to how fast the object is moving the object is moving faster the force is greater the the speed squared actually but that's sort of the interesting bit really but I think if you want to be creative about how you use this um you might think about well what can be regions on the screen of resistance so you could imagine a where you're sort of have to steer around and you want to avoid you know pockets of mud or maybe there's some Icy patches that cause you to speed up you could actually even build that into the floor of that sort of jumping simulation we just did so um so anyway but this does a very simplistic thing which uh if I come back over here to the Whiteboard I really don't want to erase my picture of this bird somebody screenshot this and save it forever don't really do that uh um this eraser is not good but it will do for right now um so um okay so if we have a rectangle and if we have a circle how can we determine if the circle is inside the rectangle now I've did it in a very simplistic way I actually am not I bet you in my example I'm not taking into consideration that Circle size which is a key factor I'm just looking at this XY point right and it's very easy I can say if x if this is the liquid's X and this is the liquid's W and this is the uh particles position and it's positiony all I need to check is is position dox greater than x meaning it's on this side of the boundary is positionx less than X Plus width meaning is it on this side of the boundary and the same for y so I'm doing just a boundary test now really I should do something more sophisticated by thinking about uh um the radius with this circle to see if even if it like touches it slightly but you know in a lot of cases it doesn't really matter so um something you could do uh If This Were uh a for examp so this would also be not so hard If This Were if the sort of liquid area was a circle and this circle was moving toward it what I could do is just do a distance calculation P5 has a distance function so a distance calculation between those two uh elements and if the distance is greater than the sum of the two radi then they're overlapping then they're not overlapping if the distance is less than they are overlapping so you'll actually see this I've done this I feel like in the last month like in countless examples that I have in sort of basic intersection test somebody hopefully can maybe find a link to one of my videos that actually implements this but it's really just comes down to a geometry problem working with squares and circles is pretty easy uh any type of arbitrary geometry gets much more difficult however there sometimes a trick you can use so one thing I'll mention so you know we could sit here and be here all day to be like now let's look at a trapezoid with a triangle and I I just I don't think I it's a good use of the time to go through every one of those scenarios but um I would love to to do a bunch more but anyway but I do want to just mention I think what can sometimes be a useful trick I'm going to see if this paper towel which even though it's not very good for the environment I'm going to use this I'm going to reuse this single paper towel as many amount of times as possible but it works a little better to erase here's something that I might suggest you do so let's say you have the scenario where you have a a map of um of a of a continent and I'm going to try to draw like sort of Africa so let's say this is can you see that wow it's so light um I got to get some I got to get some better marker whiteboard stuff here so let's say um this is going to show my lack of job I'm not going to attempt to do any real geography um so let's say you have a bunch of I was just trying to not be us Centric picking a different continent than North America um so let's say you have some map and you're about to have a particle move through this map and maybe you're doing some kind of crazy data visualization where you know some type of data population data or you know um environmental science data is related to the kind of drag force that these regions have so you could start to think oh my God I need to know all of these vertices ah vertices so many vertices then I got to do this elaborate computational geometry math and blah blah blah to figure out is this circle in this one or this one here's another thing you could do what if you secretly or not so secretly had behind the scenes an image like a PNG file or a JPEG and that jpeg had exactly that same map with exactly the same dimensions that as the one that you're viewing on the screen now you could actually be the exactly the same one and what if all of the countries all of the regions on that map had a unique color so this is something you would make in like Photoshop or you would find you might just make this hard manually make this you can obviously make it algorithmically as well so each one of these had a absolutely completely unique color so what you could do is say I'm I'm a circle moving around the screen and I have an XY and wherever I might be I'm going to take my XY and look up that point in this offscreen SE secret image and I'm going to look up the pixel color and if that pixel color is that perfect beautiful pink that I've always loved then I know I'm over that country so I I think using pixel colors as is a nice way if you know this only works if this thing is static you know if it's changing then is your secret like color mapping thing also changing but this is I often it's useful to think is there a way that I can create this effect or use some sort of other type of data to help me through this problem so maybe one of you will now do this project which is a ma data visualization with uh things particles moving through it and the uh the uh drag force that each country or region applies to the particles moving is related to some piece of data I don't know if that would be interesting or not please try that to share it with me uh I don't I sometimes I have an idea it's usually my ideas are terrible but I never Implement my ideas so at least I could say them on the Internet on the Facebook and um somebody might uh make them okay uh I should really look at the YouTube chat I've been highly neglecting the chat uh and uh I I can't believe that I'm actually gaining viewers today I usually just lose viewers um okay so uh I don't see um um okay so I don't see uh any other uh comments in the chat right now related to that so I'm going to move on and go back to this forum so I'm going to read the next question which comes from Peter one thing I'm confused about is just sort of a general life thing I'm on the internet here and people are asking questions and sometimes they have like a handle like uh you know unicorn 57 um and then I'm happy to just say unicorn 57 writes in and ask and sometimes people have their actual name and even like an image so I don't know is it appropriate for me to pull up something that somebody wrote and their name is here or their image is here say their name it's nice to acknowledge people but I don't want I want to invade people privacy I never know what to do about that so I'm just using first names Peter writes um p5js editor on MacBook question I'm wondering why when I open up a I should like read these in voices or something not I can't do voices um like a British accent or a French accent would that be like obnoxious probably be obnoxious okay p5js editor on MacBook question I'm wondering why when I open up a project again it only shows one tab I can open each JavaScript module but I end up with several editor windows for one project how do I put the tabs back together yeah so you know you might be experiencing so this is a good question so one thing I should say is that um this this p5js editor is a pretty new project it's only maybe had a year of development it's also something that I think that we as a processing Foundation as an entity are questioning whether we're going to be able to maintain and support it in the future it takes a tremendous amount of time to maintain a desktop application that works across multiple um operating systems now of course we're keeping this up and using it and I'm using it in these videos in a lot of courses and people are using it right now but one of the things we're looking to do is actually develop a browser browser based editor as a more kind of sustainable model for p5js as a project of having a kind of beginner friendly editor so I could say a lot more about that I just wanted to sort of mention that but probably the best place for this question or discussion would be on GitHub itself um and uh I'll just show you guys where you can so if I go to github.com processing so I'm just going to show you this URL really briefly this URL github.com pressing this is all of the GitHub repositories for all of the processing Foundation projects um and you can see here uh processing p5js website processing docs which is like the reference and examples P5 J editor that's the one I want to go to for a second Library so the P5 J sound there's a lot of repositories here so if you're finding a bug or something confusing you can try to find the repository associated with that particular project and this is very confusing if you don't know which one tweet me I will help you uh so um uh don't the Facebook me though I I don't I'm afraid of the Facebook okay so um so p5g has editor I'm going to click on that and I'm going so first thing you could do by the way is you're really not sure if if you have a question or a bug is you could actually just go to forum. processing.org you know you could ask me this is the point you've you've done the right thing you've asked this question to me so um but I'm just kind of I'm very bad at answering questions succinctly I'm W gone off of the stent but I should mention that there are uh several categories here about p5js so on the processing form for p5js programming questions this is a good place to ask as well um and now but a bug would go here under issues or a feature question so this is a place and this can be you know this is an intimidating scary place there's lots of technical posts it seems like oh there's all these Advanced super programmers who are going to be you know think my question is stupid and I am telling you I've said this again in previous live streams it's just important to say this always that um the goal of the processing Foundation is to be a completely welcoming environment to to people of all skill levels and all backgrounds and all ages and you cannot do anything wrong here and we our goal and if and if something if youve felt that you did something wrong please let me know so I can help resolve and make it a happy friendly place a welcoming place an accessible place for everyone um but this is a place where you would post like I think I found a bug in the editor um and you would do that by clicking new issue so um but it does feel intimidating and I'm I'm here to help with that if it's an issue for you um so you might look around there might actually be a discussion this but one thing that you'll notice about is so this is my example right now 01 drag force and I'm actually operating with two tabs right here particle. Js liquid. Js so uh there are two tabs guide my code in two places so if I were to now quit the editor completely quit the editor and I were to go back and find that example which is this one 01 drag force and I were to just uh take that folder and drag it onto the editor it's it's going to open it up again it's opening it only on particle. JS now yours might actually look like this uh I'm doing something really quick show cyar off right it might actually suddenly open up like this and you think oh I lost liquid. JS but you didn't actually lose it it's just the editor is not currently not smart enough to remember which files you had open as tabs and reopen those for you so if I go to the finder those files are all there in the directory but the editor by default is kind of just picking one file to open I don't even know which logic it is so if you're seeing this the first thing to do is go to settings and go down here to show sidebar and turn the sidebar on because now you can see the directory structure here and if I were to click on liquid. JS I've got it back here so that tab is now here audio is still working everything's still working okay so that's how to get that tab back in view however there's more to this story so let's say what I want to do now is also add another tab so I'm going to use this little oh camera went off um am I back I'm back I'm gonna use this little plus sign here I'm gonna click that and I'm going to say um a particle and a a liquid and now we're going to have a rain rbow so I'm going to add a tab called rainbow. JS and I'm going to just in this tab write a function called rainbow and I'm going to say console.log rainbow okay so I just added some code that I want to make use of in my project so what I want to do is go back to uh sketch.jpg run it and all I'm going to get is this very sad error rainbow is not defined and I say to you world there is such a thing as a rainbow out there Rainbows are defined I love rainbows I'm a bit weird I know but uh rainbow is defined I defined it right here in this tab rainbow. JS look there's its definition so what's the problem here and I have gone over this before but I think it's worth mentioning because a lot of people have been asking this in Forum posts if you are at creating new JavaScript files what's the thing that's actually loading in the browser your JavaScript files aren't loading in the browser an HTML page is loading in the browser what page is loading in the browser this page index.html Why does it know about your JavaScript files is because the HTML page has a reference to each one of them has a reference to particles.js liquid. Js sketch. Js so this is a place where if you're adding new files you also need to make sure that there is a reference to them and so now I can reference that rainbow. JS file and I can uh run this again again and we can see there now is a rainbow rainbow is defined okay let me check the YouTube chat to see if there's any questions uh oh good I'm Hope Oh Peter did I answered your question how wonderful okay uh great now here's the thing I um yeah okay uh okay so I was gonna say something else uh okay so let me where am I I'm back in the form let me look at the next question okay so I'm um sorry I need a moment here I've been doing this for now an hour and two minutes straight this is a lot a lot hard I teach classes classes are like three hours long but the thing about this online live stream thing that I feel like there is no moment to breathe like I can't have dead air or be doing some other weird thing so it's definitely takes more different kind of energy I'm realizing uh okay um llan asks I was just wondering I haven't actually read these I should read these questions in advance I need like a screener question screener like Brian L I love Brian L do you love Brian L okay I was just wondering if using a gravity well or two and a particle class it would be possible to make a Spyro graph with the principles you covered in session two oh boy this is a hard question let's Google spirograph and look at some pictures I think that'll help this is this is going to be a good uh coding challenge so yes so look at this interesting so these are great how uh 100 yes yes yes yes and yes and in fact uh P5 art on Twitter um what I would recommend to get some effects like this is look at the attraction ex the gravitational attraction example so the gravitational attraction example Works let's try this blue pen uh with this idea of an attractor and an object so if the object is attracted to the center it's just going to move like this it's going to get pulled into it then it's going to go past it and then it's going to get pulled back it's going to go past it then it's going to get pulled back almost like a spring now I'm not actually simulating a spring Force although that would also be a great thing I would love to do that as an example today um but what if you give and this was a question also asked on the Forum so you're the effect that you're going to get of this object moving is just going to be in a straight line back and forth with gravitational attraction and actually why not let's go um let's go let's go actually do this so I'm going to grab my um gravitational attraction example and I'm going to open this one up in the editor let's just go to the editor and do command o and go to uh gravitational attraction and run this okay so you can see what this example is doing by default it's showing you um this kind of object orbiting in a way this particular circle now this appears much like planetary orbits and you know the formula for gravity is in there much like that formula for gravity is in there in the universe but there's many things about this that are highly inaccurate in terms of an actual you know true to life physics simulation it's you know but it's it's kind of along the way there but it's let's let me go back and uh to this example and what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at this particle object and I'm going to change its initial velocity from one comma 0 to 0 comma 0 so it has no initial velocity to start and let's run it again so this is what talking about with no initial velocity it's just going to move back and forth because and it's you know it doesn't it's it's eventually probably going to it's doing some kind of crazy thing like it goes much further on one side and you know there's all sorts of rounding stuff and I'm using some strange constraints so who knows why all this is happening but you can see that it's kind of moving back and forth so that initial velocity if I come back over here gives it a place to move to start so that as it's being pulled in it's kind of doing this so now I'm not doing it drawing it accurately but you could imagine what if you give it an initial velocity and let's give it a much bigger initial velocity to start right uh or or um that's fine just leave it let's you know you can see this is what it's doing now it has that initial velocity so it's kind of orbiting so what I would suggest you try to do is number one is uh draw Trails so you could do that by not erasing the background so it smears and I could actually really uh quickly um just make that happen for us by putting the background in setup and we can kind of see what sort of pattern are we going to get um so that's sort of option number one is you can kind of not erase the background other thing you might try is you know what's a good initial velocity what's a good uh What are some good constraints um what happens if you do multiple ones of these what happens oh you're going to get really really nice patterns if you have multiple attractors in different places um so um and uh what there have been a lot of projects uh in along this vein this is a quite an old project I'm going to say I think it's by Tom Carden Metro and and probably collaboration with some other people uh metropop denim I'm going to pull this up let's see uh um so this is a project that was kind of a process I think it was done I'm pretty sure it was done in processing because I seem to remember it being on the processing exhibition but uh right um so I'm just going to look at this image and kind of zoom into it so this is the result of I you know I can't speak to 100% exactly how this was done but my impression of this is this was using attraction forces with multiple invisible attractors everywhere and releasing a lot of particles into the system and just seeing their Trail and drawing nice sort of alpha Blended line Trails all over the place so you might sort of see and then this was combined with a fashion photography uh and so if I go back to that uh Google image search you can see how um uh you can see some of these images here with different fashion photography but it would be interesting to think about what if you you had sort of a a dress or a shoe or some item of clothing or some other pattern and you actually placed or a person's silhouette and you place those attraction points along Contours or on the tips of fingers what type of kind of or you know you did this in real time with a connect so as you're moving your hands your hands are the attractor see go and make these projects see if they're interesting um so there's a lot of Rich possibilities there I would however recommend that if you're doing this and wow it's kind of amazing to me how stable this particular uh orbit is I I assume it's going to get off over time like if we watch this if I set this running for 24 hours it's eventually going to like sort of fill in the whole screen um but one thing I would recommend is looking into not using this not erase the background technique so and I actually have another example there's a tutorial it's on YouTube If you Google you know shiftman object Trails um what if you actually have the particle store an array of all of its historical positions um you know it sort of depends what you're doing if your goal is to make a static image like a big poster then just not erasing the background is going to be fine but you have a larger animated system with other things moving and you want to see trails you're going to need a more flexible way of doing that okay um great I think that answers that question where am I let me check this chat uh uh okay um yes so by the way um so some people in the chat are rightfully mentioning that you could could absolutely just do this with uh uh oscillating simple harmonic motion and oscillating Behavior so using S and cosine functions and I have I do if um I have some other YouTube tutorials that do that as well and um um yeah okay um let me check how life is going here on the internet so let me go back uh comment was deleted let's go down okay so there's one more question on this thread that I think I'll get to um and then we'll see if have questions in the chat and then maybe we'll do the um diffusion thing my brain is starting to melt like talking straight for an hour and uh 10 minutes okay how's audio video picture I don't look too like red and sweaty a little bit hot in here okay um let's see now where where's the world where in the World is Carmen San Diego go my brain uh okay one more question uh okay so this comes from Luca uh uh by the way I think I'm getting a bald spot can you guys see it maybe you can't see it um uh why sometimes the speed of our programmed objects seems to suddenly go crazy objects go out of control and we have to use function like limit is it just a float number is it just a floating uh Point numbers approximation problem okay I'm going to read the whole question that's part one of the question as this strange Behavior can sometimes happen while a program is running is it safe to always constrain velocity in our physics engine simulations how do we choose the limit is it purely an empirical trial and error approach or is there a better way this is a great question um and this is like this is like a I love this question because it's like a philosophical question like I almost don't have to type any code or I mean we could start opening up examples and try different constraints but it's really a sort of pH philosophical question and I think there is this sort of Continuum um you know I am my name is Jane and I am working at Nasa and we are trying to figure out how to get this rocket to you know properly go around this asteroid and uh do some important scientific thing you know my name is fr FR Francis I'm coming I know I need these names whatever I am a happy golucky person sitting at my computer making some goofy algorithmic art I think the answer to that that question is very different for those two different people you know there might certain scenarios might require a more significant amount of rigor in and I I really hate that word rigor but I think it's probably an appropriate use of it here in terms of the level of scientific accuracy um you know by definition the way I am doing my examples is scientifically inaccurate there is no way for me to make it accurate because there's no such thing as like a flat twodimensional I mean there isn't theoretic okay let me even let me put it a different way the draw Loop is frame by frame animation so I'm showing you a picture then I'm taking a break for one 160th of a second and showing you another picture then I'm taking you a break for one 160 a second and showing you another picture much like a flip book here here I'm gonna juggle here is a demonstration of juggling these are kind of hard to juggle but it's working I just showed you like an animation you're watching it as a video but in real life that's happening continuously I didn't toss this thing and take a break and wait and then it moves a little more so that fact of this it's called Oiler integration this this model of physics of this step by step this time increment being 1 160th of a second is by definition makes everything wildly not like the real world but are you really complaining when you're watching this not so much because it's kind of doing the things you want to do now this the fact that we're starting from this place of inaccuracy means there's all these moments where um you know things aren't going to behave like we might expect or don't have the feeling of the real world so we do things like say velocity. liit or constrain this or like add this fudge Factor here and personally from my standpoint these are all excellent things to do in the scenario of I'm making an experiment an interactive exhibition I'm just trying out an idea I'm learning about programming um you know a lot of times I'll hear people say to me okay well I did this and it looks great but I cheated and if it looks great you didn't cheat you did it it's all cheating right it's all none of this is real there is no wizard behind the curtain or there is just wizard behind the curtain and The Wizard is you right it's all cheating so um I think in that case it's it's good practice to learn about these sort of limitations now sometimes the limitations will cause you other problems like in my jumping program I just have it stop immediately but what if I want you know it's actually suddenly there's like a water and so when there's water it goes through now I need to add some other code so sometimes the limitation will cause you another problem down the road and so it's just this kind of um Balancing Act and you it's a lot of back and forth so my General answer is there is no answer it's Case by case basis give it a try you need that now again though in certain scenarios you know U you need a higher level of accuracy and in that case it might be you could make the argument that JavaScript in the browser isn't the place for some of these more kind of rigorous scientific simulations and you know you might really need to apply the sort of more time uh calculus formulas to not have this kind of like step by step anyway so you go down that road but I I don't I don't ever go I don't you know I just I don't go down that road I sometimes maybe I do maybe maybe it's it's it's it's beautiful down that road and I should take a peek down that road and I I think there are lovely people down that road and sometimes you might need to go down that road but the context of what I'm doing here in the sort of coding rainbow world is to kind of generally find the sort of quick and dirty uh um uh um solutions for these kind of problems that create the feeling of the real world simulation rambling rant over let's see I bet you I lost just like 15 viewers during that uh yeah I did but they still have above a 100 people so um okay uh um all right so that was that question um I'm checking um I'm checking the world of uh oh gain to the m oh so some people maybe on Facebook it's quiet the audio is okay for people I I'm I'm afraid to make it louder so I'm just seeing some comments um I don't know if is there a live chat there's I'm sort of curious but I'm going to not look right now okay um okay so I think now I'm at an hour and 15 minutes I think it would be a good time today so what I want to do now is I want to look at my I I got through I think a good amount of questions I'm sure there are more I will answer them in the Forum by typing but what I want to do right now is a couple things one is I want to close out out this and I want to go to a URL that I keep which is my list of topics so this here is uh where I'm kind of keeping a list of topics as people send me suggestions uh and I think the one I'm going to do today is reaction diffusion which is right down here I have smaller topics I think I did uh I want to do K you know a lot of these U Google Maps ap5 Voice synthesis different editors sort of did that Twitter Bots there's some more stuff Chrome extensions Raspberry Pi neural networks more uh text stuff and node more computer vision other topics oops this GitHub for poets thing oh GitHub Pages I've got to do okay so this is my list of topics I I'm just sort of scanning this through because I would um love to hear feedback from you guys and uh and suggestions always uh but I think what I'm going to attempt to do is do the reaction diffusion algorithm and I'm going to do it as a coding challenge meaning um I'm going to kind of get myself up in I'm going to I'm going to take about 10 to 15 minutes right now to kind of find my old code for it look at it look at some web pages that have nice documentation of the algorithm uh kind of refresh my brain about it a little bit understand the code talk to you about it answer questions and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to stop and I'm going to just like clear everything and I'm going to um then program the whole thing from scratch in what I hope will be about 10 to 15 minutes and that's that will be a standalone video tutorial that we'll Live on YouTube that's my plan uh and I'm going to keep the uh YouTube chat open here um um and there okay so um you know these kind of classic generative algorithms tend to work really well for these coding challenges I still really need a haircut hopefully today I can get a because I feel like I like to look nice for these live streams I don't know how I don't know how possible that really is but you know to some extent uh by the way everyone keeps asking me for this a agario.io what is that some game no what is it agario agar.io oh yeah the Smash Hit game this is some game everyone keeps I gota I'll take a look at this later um okay so let me do a few things here let me first open up processing and um oh uh yes do want processing so I'm opening up processing I am going to I need like a short a short break here just sort of like mental break here so I'm going to uh clean the Whiteboard how's the light over here I'm just curious is the like can you see stuff on the Whiteboard does it seem like weird and shadowy I'm gonna clean this because I'm sure we'll need a diagram um you know some other topics that I've thought of that I really need to get to at some point are um how to deal with multidimensional arrays in JavaScript because it's really weird compared to how because Java array JavaScript arrays are these kind of like fungible flexible things um and so how to deal with that as opposed to like in processing your Java where it's much simpler another topic that's come up a lot recently that I want to get to and maybe I would do today I only I have about a half an hour left so I definitely need to uh I want to do today at some point is um how to deal with optional arguments to function in JavaScript have I done that before I don't think so okay so do I have processing open now I do oh I should get the update what am I in 3.1 there's a 3.1 and there's also now a 3.1.1 which actually had some key critical bug fixes in it but I'm I think I'm just going to uh to save time right now I'm not going to download the new the newer version I'll do it afterwards so I'm going to go to um uh Hollow so um hollow hollow Hol Hollow is a um creative coding magazine that's coming out soon and I did some images for them and one of them was reaction diffusion so let me open this up and let me run this okay so this is my existing example that I made a little over a year ago that is doing the reaction diffusion algorithm and you can see that okay so what's going on here is that there is a window it's a grid of pixels those pixels have a grayscale color and they're colored according to an algorithm that algorithm being this reaction diffusion algorithm so um now the way that the what this what this is like is you can think of let's say this table is my processing window and I I have some sort of chemical a in here so I'm going to pour chemical a onto the table and maybe the table is filled with chemical B so reaction diffusion refers to the reaction between those chemicals and how like chemical a also diffuses so which how is chemical a taking over is B taking over or is a kind of going away and dying or is B going away and dying so and you can really think of it almost as just like one if there's a lot of chemical a we have black if there's no chemical a we have white and if there's some amount in between we have grayscale and you can see that this particular kind of chemical reaction simulation creates these kind of Labyrinthian like um images and so this is like incredibly the sort of like Drop Dead standard classic result but you can modify this to have it behave in different ways how do you you know uh you could seed it again with the Contours of a human body to create this sort of like portrait of somebody you could alter the color in different ways so my hope for you if I can get this tutorial done is that you can um uh find creative twists off this algorithm but for me I'm going to just sort of do the sort of classic one um Okay so so let's look so I this says written entire whenever I did this over a year ago written entirely based on this so let's go to this URL and let's read over this URL to help um jog my memory and uh let's see if it matches with what I had just sort of said so let me make this a bit bigger reaction diffusion tutorial this is great thank you Carl Sims for this page that I'm now using in this video tutorial a simulation of two virtual chemicals reacting and diffusing on a 2d grid using the gray Scott model okay so that's an important thing that I should mention this idea of reaction diffusion is totally generic this idea of chemical a being fed in at some rate so there's a feed rate that's a key concept um B's get converted into a if B reproduces using a as food so chemical B is removed at a kill rate so this sort of like feed and conversion is the reaction and the kill rate the sort is the kind of diffusion um and so there are different models give different kind of chemicals that'll produce different kind of results one of them being gray Scott which I assume is named for some people with the names gray Scott and we could go read about that I'm assume we get further along there might be more of the formula okay so diffusion refers to both chemicals diffuse so uneven concentration spread out across the grid so this is really by the way a cellular automata simulation because it's a grid each cell having a state the state you know if you looked at some of my other videos about cellular automata like the states are zero or one white or black and we get these kind of nice patterns here it's a kind of state That's a Some number between zero a floating Point number between zero and one so um how much of chemical a how much of chemical B um okay the system is approximated by using two numbers at each grid cell so you can see here that there is some amount of chemical a and some amount of chemical B and we'll kind of normalize those values between zero and one and when a grid of thousand of cells ass simulated larger patterns emerge and you can see here that the color the amount of yellow the amount of blue is probably being determined based on the amount of A or B uh I'm looking um to see if there are any questions okay so ah this is where we get to the sad place okay let's everybody take a deep breath oh okay we're gonna look at this thing called the lassan formula and we're gonna just everything's G to be okay I don't remember it I understood this at one point hopefully it's my brain is going to come back so the grid is repeatedly updated using the following equations to update the concentrations of A and B in each cell and model the behaviors described above okay so here's the thing so what we need to do and let's use the Whiteboard for a second is let's think about what it means means to be a given cell I'm going to by the way I'm going to do this all again just uh I'm kind of like warming up to it and then I'm going to like record it uh so let's say we have a given cell and it has some concentration of a and some concentration of B oh sorry some concentration of B and we have moments in time we have time zero time one time two so has some concentation of a at Time Zero come some of B at time zero so what we need to figure out how to do is calculate the concentration of a oops sorry at time one and this is going to be I can't believe I'm about to use some sort of math notation here because I generally try to avoid that and I'm afraid of that it's going to be a function of the concentrations of those chemicals at um at time zero so this cell's new concentration of A and B is some for formula some mathematical thing that we're going to put our code of the previous generation so we have this idea of generations um frame by frame by frame that's why you're seeing this kind of spreading out now there's more to it than this though because I'm pretty sure and this is where the lassan stuff comes in that we also have this thing where this cell that I'm talking about here is like this cell here that lives on a grid so not only is it a function of its own previous chemical state but it's also a function of the chemical states of the neighbors around it because all of these chemicals are moving and combining as sort of neighboring ways so that's what we need to figure out how to solve okay so um so this we can understand this formula now the new values are equal to the old values plus d so those are diffusion rates those are going to be constants numbers we make up now these are 2D laian functions which give the difference between the average of nearby grid cells and the cell okay we can handle that two D Lan functions would give the difference between the average of nearby grid cells in this cell so what does that mean all right here's my grid let's just think about a let's say the cell that we're on has like an a value of 0.2 and this has like 7 and 0.9 and 0.1 and 3 and one and zero and z and zero so conceivably what this means is let's add up all of these neighbors and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and then divide by eight so we want to get the average of the neighbors and then have take that minus the current and that's the that's the difference the Lelo function the difference between the average of the neighbors and the center which makes sense it has to do with like what's the chemical reaction is based on my I'm a cell what's my uh amount of chemicals and what's happening in my my neighbors and what's the difference between those two things is going to cause a reaction so I think we can put that and then back here a * b ^ 2 we see that this is the same this is the just the current and then plus F now what's f f is a feed rate so that's also some constant that we're going to put in and then uh K is the kill rate which is also some constant that we're going to put in and then uh and this is the reaction but it's really just this formula um and that's really it and then delta T so this is really key delta T again this goes back to something I was talking about earlier which is what's the unit of time right from one moment to the next and for us that's really every frame um every frame of Animation 160 every 160th of a second so I think we can get this formula in our code so and then uh and then you can see here here are some typical values so these are the typical diffusion rates here's a typ typical feed rate here's a typical kill rate so you can see the these are probably the rates that I'm using in my code and uh and then the lassan is performed with a 3X3 convolution 3x3 convolution that is this thing over here 3x3 my phone is buzzing oh is is the audio no the audio is still working okay I got whenever I start to hear my phone buzzing a lot in the past that's meant that um that's meant that um uh that's meant that something went wrong but uh nothing seems to have gone wrong now by the way um maybe I was in okay so the convolution center weight in negative one adjacent neighbors 02 oh interesting and diagonals 0. five so one thing it's saying here about this okay oh world oh life you are you are ever so more complicated than you seem to be we're we're going to be able to do this though um so let's talk about what a convolution is for a second because this is actually this is how things work in image processing so um let's think about this for a second a 3X3 Matrix is here and a convolution is an operation where you take every single value in this entire Matrix apply a weight to it multiply by a weight add them all together to get a new value for that Center let me try this side for this Center oh that's better for this Center uh element so let's say you're doing image processing and you're doing a blur the weight for each one of these would be one nth because you're taking an average there's nine cells and you want one nth of each or add them all together divide by nine get the average a sharpening filter would be like a negative weight to the center and positive weights to the outside because you want a pixel to be more different than its neighbors a blur you want to be more similar to its neighbors so this same type of operation is used here it's a convolution and what it's saying is if I go back here that the weights are where did it have it um uh Center weight is netive one meaning we're doing the difference we're subtracting out the center adjacent neighbors 02 and diagonals 05 so that means we give 2 2 2 2 05 0.05 0.05 0.05 and then the center is negative 1 so those are the weights so we take the chem the amount of a here and multiply it by that the amount of a here and multiply by that the amount of a here and multiply and add everything together now interestingly enough I hope and I'm almost sure that these will all add up to one right um add up to zero actually so 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus2 that's 08 right and then this plus this is 0.1 plus this plus this is 0. 2 so we get one and then negative 1 is the center so we get zero so all of these together those weights all add up to zero which makes a lot of sense perfect okay so that's what this lloan function is going to do uh and that's really it and then it's just a matter of figuring out how to color the cells based on the amount of a chemical and you can be pretty creative with that and um so and you can see here through this page I encourage you to continue and look uh at how you can get these sort of different patterns okay deep breath here so I think I I now have a sense of this and I'm curious what your questions are um and then we're going to then I'm going to kind of do this again but kind of gloss over some of these details a bit more and just get to the programming but let's look at the processing version um which by the way you can see what it ended up with now um and let's look at the code for a second just to see how I did it oh dear Deary me okay so there's so many different ways you could do this um so I have made a twodimensional array which is the grid and I need two of them because I want to store the previous generation of chemical values as I'm calculating the next so I have this snapshot of what the screen looks like now and I'm filling in all the new values in the next one and then I update the window with the next one and then I kind of Swap and make the old array the next one that sort of thing so I have two and then uh each one of these things gets to be a a cell object so the cell object is actually just an amount of chemical a and chemical B so in jav I'm going to do this in JavaScript I think um I don't know how slow it's going to be we'll find out um but this is such a simple object I won't even need to do this whole like class thing that'll be nice now here we can see look at this these are those constants I'm using that came directly from Carl Sims page I've got the diffusion rate for a the diffusion rate for B the feed rate and the kill rate so these are just constant values and you can see like what happens if I so if I run this you can see that uh this is it running but like I could just be like hey let's change the feed rate to that and you can see like nothing happens so there are sort of like known values that will do certain things and a lot of them probably just tend towards nothing and then here in update uh one thing I'm doing is skipping the edges so that's like kind of a simple way of doing stuff and then I I have to look at the previous um in order to get the new one and then I get the previous values now I'm doing boy am I doing this in a silly way but this works so this is that llas function I take all of the neighbors and I'm not I could do like a nested Loop here which would be much smarter but this is very explicit where I'm saying add the center value time ne1 I + 1 is the one on the right times 0 2 IUS one is the one on the left time 0 2 so I add those all up then I add up all the B's and then I do this exact formula so this is the exact formula that is whoops that is written right here it's here and by the way this is my unit of time one what happens if I increase the unit of time woo wacky what happens if I decrease the unit of time just probably the same thing but my much slower maybe anyway uh and then I'm doing then I then I um this is my fudge Factor I'm just kind of constraining the values between zero and one in case they go off and then I'm just drawing and I'm setting each pixels to a color which is based on a minus B * 255 that's weird why a minus B uh interesting um I I think I just like probably picked that arbitrarily is a always greater than oh because if it's Le if that's less than zero it'll just be black um yeah so anyway but I could do like B minus a and that's the opposite I could just do a that's the amount of a so anyway so how you do the coloring I I don't remember I must have come up with that or I got it from somebody else okay so that's the idea I think I'm ready for this now so uh I'm going to I need to take like a two minute kind of just like headspace Break um to get it set up for this um and uh I see some people asking about 3D which is interesting um and then so I'm going to get set up to do this example oh one thing I have to figure out like why do I have this pattern so what did I do at the beginning at the beginning uh ah I picked 10 random spots to give a starting amount of B so they all start with one zero so everything starts with full chemical a and then I add chemical b in a bunch of different spots 10 random spots so that's that's useful to see as well um okay so that I think everything's here so um okay so I'm gonna sort of uh pause for a moment um not pause I mean I'm still going to be here but I'm going to check I'm going recycle the cameras I'm going to check to make sure the microphone batteries are still working I'm going to drink a little water I'm going to get get my p5js setup going um and etc etc so give me a minute here I'll leave this minimized Talk Amongst yourselves I'm starting to feel a little this is bad to do the coding challenge it's 1248 the very end I should have done this at the beginning because I I feel a little brain dead right now but we'll see how this goes okay so I'm going to close all this um let me close this um let me do you hear that stomach Rowling sound uh let me uh what I'm actually going to do right now is I'm just going to go to just to make sure I have the most recent p5js I'm going to do this and it should come with uh if I download it it should come with this thing called empty example which I'm going to put onto the desktop and I'm going to call this um reaction diffusion and I'm going to minimize this and I think I'm going to use should I use adom or I'm either gonna use adom or Sublime a little more comfortable with Sublime Text but I've been trying to use Adam more recently I'm going to use Sublime just because I'm a little more comfortable with it uh and um the best way to get comfortable atam to use it I'm going to desktop desktop desktop reaction diffusion whoops reaction diffusion open okay so now I need sketch. JS perfect uh now I need to run a little local server I'm going to just run this in Chrome uh uh so let me open up terminal if you're wondering what I'm doing right now I do have a video tutorial about this which is uh a way of let me make this uh bigger for you guys so you can at least see what I'm doing uh a way of running a local python server on your machine to do um local development uh and I want so now I need to go to the desktop and reaction and do python DM a simple HTTP server so I should be able to minimize this now and do Local Host and open up the console that doesn't matter that would go away it went away and then if I say create canvas 400 400 I'm also going to say pixel density one I'm just going to add this in here I'll mention Y in a second background 51 great um okay uh okay so now I'm ready this is let me let me do it lower resolution because I I'm just concerned about speed because I can always oops I can always do this okay and then I think that's good I think I'm ready to program this from scratch which is a little bit scary but I think I'm gonna do it okay um um people are asking to send Pizza by the way I don't I don't eat pizza I'm nondairy I'm lactose intolerant don't don't say anything it's very kind of you um just if you want to do something nice spread the word uh you can you can support my patreon when I start that up um but it was nice of people okay so I'm checking okay so this microphone only has two bars which concerns me a little bit this one has two bars as well okay I'm gonna um I'm going to mute sound for a second um because I don't want to blow out your ears so I'm about to mute sound I'm going to replace the batteries here e test test test I think I'm back but it's so much cooler in the other room it's very hot in here but I'm coming to a close today I'm at an hour and 45 minutes this is probably going to take a half an hour although I you know I really want these videos when I do these sort of like short nugget algorithm videos I really want them to be less than 20 minutes so we'll see see how that goes um I'm going to um clean this whiteboard again I will probably draw some of the similar diagram okay okay so let me get now this pen is the good one the good side um come back over here it's amazing that I haven't had to pee this whole time I always have to pee in the middle of these but somehow even I'm drinking all this tea I said that I'm totally gonna have to go okay um okay I think I'm ready now so what I need is also uh this I can close this I can close this I can close I need that Carl Sims link um right I was just there here it is okay uh oh yeah one thing I wanted to look up was Grays Scott I I wanted to just just understand the I mean I might not mention this but I wanted to get the sort of historical um the his historical origin of the gray Scott but oh there's some interesting other this is a nice way to look at the formula as well um this doesn't seem to be coming up with anything uh here we go well I'll look this up later not doesn't really matter well so this is interesting you can see different ways of coloring stuff and different other models I I hope that people do some nice variations of this you could do this in like webg and shaders all sort of fancy way we're just going to do the very basics in p5js oh great Scott yes coding challenge okay F Al here we go everybody let me cycle yeah I know the elevator music I got to get the sound system going in here um that's really you know one of my issues is that I whenever I have time I just want to like record more videos but I need just a day where I do things like get organized get the connect set up get the Raspberry Pi set up to be able to use those in the videos I need to spend a day like getting the sound system in here working better but such is life um hopefully I'm going to have some more time now that it is uh the end of May and June is coming up um jury duty is going to be a problem though okay uh all right here we go um reaction diffusion gray Scott model we're gonna do this in 15 to 20 minutes and then I'm going to say good night and goodbye or good afternoon good morning whatever time it is some of you if you're watching this must be getting to the evening if you're in Europe if you are you you probably can't watch this unless you're on a VPN in China but it would be 100 a.m. for you I just there I'm I think I'm over my jet lag though nobody cares about this okay uh so reaction diffusion oops Local Host we go and Sublime is up okay and here we go coding rainbow take one take two take three hi everybody okay mental note do the complicated algorithm coding challenge at the beginning next time okay I'm going to do this this is going to happen I don't need to press anything just need to start okay okay so if the um I'm gonna keep this chat kind of view open to see it in the corner of my eye if there's an audio problem or an issue um put like just like flood the chat with like tons of crazy emojis but don't do that otherwise that and I what I'm going to do is I'm gonna uh I'll actually make it much bigger this is going to be my new system oh actually no this is not working hold on comments below okay okay here we go so I I'm not looking the good news is I'm not looking at my video because that always distracts me I just see the chat there and um so if the sound goes bad oh okay well hold on before I start somebody is saying the mic seems a bit quiet can you all let me know I did just swap out the battery so it could have changed something oh you know what it is quite low compared to usual let me move this back up I'm making this louder just to warn you guys okay I I made okay so don't Emoji now okay is is everything fine is there any dist Distortion in the Audio I actually just turned it up because I I didn't realize I had it turned down quite a bit um yeah so I think it should be better now okay Mike is fine yes okay here we go everybody stret you know I was at this uh construction site yesterday and they had this poster of different stretches I think everybody take a moment and stretch stop and stretch gonna stretch the good news is I do these standing up so I feel like if I was like sitting down for like hours in these tutorials kind of like moving around a lot you should if you're watching sitting down you should stand up and move around for a little bit okay like let me let me fix my hair makeup makeup nobody's coming right where's my hair and makeup Department okay okay you have a standing desk okay I'm now I can really see by the way this is brilliant for what I just did with the chat I just zoomed in on and have like a huge font so I could just read it easily from over here I what I W really want to do is put the chat like up here so that I can look at the chat and still be kind of like looking at the camera because I kind of do this a lot okay I got to just do this here we go hello welcome to another coding challenge with me Dan okay in this today's coding challenge I'm going to look at the reaction diffusion algorithm it's a pixelbased algorithm that allows you to generate interesting patterns that look like up top and it's what it's uh uh what it's doing is it's modeling a chemical reaction so it's this idea of having in your canvas let me just start over kind of like what am I doing here at the beginning I kind of want I I want to have um I think what I would like to have open is did I I want to have this as a visual reference open yeah so I'm going to have this running right here okay oh it's going to run really slow in JavaScript I bet but we'll sort of see okay um so I'm going to put this here and I'll zoom in a little bit okay must have proper Opening screen okay here we go again everybody just I'm gonna do the camera one more time so I think I wasted so much time there I'm excited for this one okay make the same bad joke with me Dan whatever hello and welcome to another coding challenge uh in this coding challenge I am going to look at the reaction diffusion algorithm so I have a version of it running right over there that is a processing sketch that is implemented the reaction diffusion algorithm I'm going to implement it in Javas script uh do it from scratch in this video and you can see that this allows you to create this interesting kind of Labyrinthian uh uh visual in your canvas now there's a lot of different ways that you can apply colors and get different qualities to the image but I'm going to look at the sort of core classic reaction diffusion algorithm using the gray Scott model I will include some links below to reference Pages the one that I will build the code based on is right here in the browser the Carl Sims a Carl Sims tutorial page um and so the idea here is that I'm going to just sort of look at the drop dead simple classic algorithm black and white pixels only and then hopefully you after watching this and using the code might come up with some other creative uses and applications of it so let's try to understand first what this algorithm actually is and so I'm going to close this window out and look at this diagram so the idea of reaction diffusion is kind of like you have your screen and you're about to pour some chemicals into it and those chemicals are going to react and there's going to be a lot of chemical a and then less of chemical B and they're going to react and diffuse and that's ort of thing and then based on the how those chemicals are arranged in the screen in this sort of like dish petri dish of your canvas I'm going to we're going to set a color so if there's a lot of chemical a we're going to make the pixel black if there's no chemical a we're going to make the pixel white and kind of everywhere in between so that's the idea here now there are a lot of different um kind of key pieces here and let's just look at this quick diagram here thank you again Carl Sims for providing the diagrams for this video um chemical a so um the way it's going to work is the canvas is going to be filled with chemical B and then we're going to start to pour chemical a into the canvas the reaction aspect is chemical A and B reacting and maybe a is turning into B and the sort of diffusion in this way is that chemical B is also going to get kind of like removed uh from it so there are some there are some key constants in the system that are numbers that you're going to see in the code one is the feed rate which is how fast are we pouring in chemical a and then another is called the kill rate I wish there was a nicer name for that but that's what it's called which is how what is the rate the chemical B is being removed so this is the idea now um so and you can see here what we're going to do is each each cell is going to have a certain amount of chemical a and amount of chemical B and those values are going to have a range between zero and one uh one being a lot of chemical a zero being none and then that amount is going to be used to set the color for a pixel and so you can see here uh how this how this kind of works we're going to all this in code now how look at this now we have this like terrifyingly scary looking formula but we can tackle this formula I'm gonna right here I'm here with you to tackle this complicated looking formula so let's put putting that aside let's kind of make a quick diagram so the way that I'm going to build this in code is I'm going to have a twodimensional array meaning I'm going to have a data structure that's going to keep track of uh each spot in that data structure is going to keep track of an individual cell call that a cell each cell is going to have an amount of chemical a and an amount of chemical B so what I need to do is understand uh if CH if there are moments in time there are Generations This Moment In Time next moment in time so Moment In Time a z moment in time b0 what I need to understand is how do I get the amount of a for Moment In Time One based on some function of the amount of of a and the amount of B at time zero so this is what we're looking at and in fact over here that's what this formula is showing you the new value of a equals all this stuff based on the previous value of a and b and some other constants so this is what we need to do but there's a bit more to it than this so you know I could say like oh A1 equals the average of a0 plus b 0 you know divided by two this could be our formula this would be a lot easier to implement so that formula is just like this but a lot more compliment complicated so now but there the reason why there's more to it than this is because we have this scenario here of an individual cell we have to apply something called a convolution you're going to see I'm going to show you in a moment it says a convolution of a 3X3 Matrix all this scary sounding stuff so here is a 3X3 Matrix and this is a given cell and what I want to know is what is this cell's new values of A and B based on its previous value of a and b but not just it I need to know also based on its neighbors so these chemicals are reacting and combining in a given cell also with what are the chemicals next to it so the con a convolution means take every single one of these cells and multiply it by some weight so if I were blurring an image for example I could use a blur as blur meaning the average of a convolu of of a of a 3X3 Matrix of pixels so the new pixel color is going to be an average 1 nth of this color plus 1 nth of this color plus 1 nth of this color plus one nth of this color so I take all of the colors and multiply them by 1 nth add them all together and I have the new color but we have a different um convolution here and it's described in in the diffusion uh in the reaction diffusion algorithm so this is the basic idea I need a twodimensional array each spot is going to have a certain amount of a and a certain amount of B I need to have a formula that for each cycle each frame through draw I get a new value of a and a new value of B and then a new value of a and a new value of B and the math formula is going to be something like this but more complicated because it's also going to involve all the neighbors so let's start setting this up now hopefully this is the basic idea let's start setting it up to program it okay so now I'm back over here uh I am back over here ah oh was I not over there the whole time I think I was over there the whole time hopefully this was right uh somebody in the chat tell me was I in the on the Whiteboard while was showing that um okay so if I go back to I have this blank uh code here um and uh I'm going to go to my uh canvas here and this is my canvas so the first thing I need to do is create okay I was good the first thing I need to do is create my uh twodimensional array to store all the amount the the amount of chemicals in each spot in the in the grid okay so twodimensional arrays in JavaScript are kind of a funny thing uh not funny haha funny a little bit weird because um arrays in JavaScript there's just so many different ways you can make them but ultimately what a twodimensional array is and let me kind of describe this to you briefly I'm going to make an array called grid and you could imagine like what if I did this um I'm gonna write something like this I'm just gonna kind of type something out for a second just to explain this this my friends you are my friends indeed is a twodimensional array I I kind of space it out like a grid but really what it is is just an array of arrays to see how it's an array open square bracket and square bracket and then it's three arrays inside of it but I could but so really a twodimensional array in programming is just an array of arrays so what I need is one array to keep an array for here for here for here for here right so I need the first array to be the first row the second array to be the second row the third array to be the third row that sort of thing but I I'm not going to type it out manually for 3x3 I could type it out manually what I need to do is kind of um is actually make it um uh make it in code okay everything's gonna be fine so I'm gonna create that variable and I'm gonna do it I'm gonna use a particular style I'm gonna do it different I'm gonna do it a different so what I'm going to do is I'm first just going to say grid is an array it's an empty array and what I need to do is I need to Loop xal 0 x is less than the width of this canvas and let me Zoom back out x++ so for every X and for every y right for every X ah stop oh I can't ah I'm waiting for my auto format that's not here um for every x what I need to do is say grid index X is an array so I start with this array and then I say hey let's make an array and then what am I going to put here grid XY equals now what do I what do I need in each spot in the grid now if I were just if I only had a single chemical if I only had a single chemical I was just putting a single number in each one of these but I have two chemicals I have an A and A B so let's actually I think this is a place where I could just make a literal JavaScript object and say a is you know there's zero of a and there is a zero of B so uh and you know I I don't think I need to be so long winded about it this is such a simple object I'm going to do this so I make each spot in the grid each spot in the grid for every X and every y there's an A and A B with zero of each chemical and I'm going to need to change that eventually but we're going to start there so this is good I now have my grid yay now here's the thing in order to make this work right the whole this whole is all all built on this idea of I need to get the Next Generation amount of a so I can't be me if this grid is the snapshot of all the chemicals in a current generation I need a completely separate grid to start filling in the new values because if I were to use the same grid if I start overwriting the values in that grid while I'm checking other values neighbors everything's going to get all messed up so what I should do is I'm also going to create a variable here called Next and I'm going to be kind of silly about it and I'm just going to make two of these and I'm going to say next so I now have two twodimensional arrays and I think I just want to briefly mention that um I could have done this so grid is going to be the current and then next is going to be the next one so I could have done this by also using new array in JavaScript to create a sort of fixed size but I know my array should have a width and height as kind of the number of uh columns and rows okay so now we're in good shape so what I can do what I want to do is just sort of see that the basic idea of this is working so what I need to do is draw a color a pixel color in the window based on each value in that grid so by the way we're going to need this double double nested Loop like a zillion times so I'm going to just copy paste that down here and one one thing I'm going to do at the very end is I'm going to say load pixels and then I'm going to uh say update pixels and what I'm going to do is I'm going to uh create a color let's just make sure I'm going to just make a nice you know pinkish purplish color just to make sure this is working and I'm going to say pixel index oh boy so guess what everybody I have a whole video that goes through the pixel array I should link to that from here the pixel array in Java in p5js in the JavaScript canvas is a pixel array that has four spots for every pixel so I need to figure out and it's onedimensional so I go through the derivation of this formula but I'm going to say pixal x + y times uh width Time 4 and then I'm going to say pixels pix plus 0 equals uh 255 and I'm going to this I don't need and I'm going to say zero and I'm GNA say 100 and then and this is uh one one two and three so what I've done here is I'm using a formula to find the right spot in that array for every single Pixel every width every column in every row and then I'm saying make its red 255 make its green zero make its blue 100 make its Alpha 2 55 so I just want to see that this runs okay great so I filled it with a color so I do have a way of setting every pixel color now what I want is for these colors to be based on the grid so I'm going to say grid X comma y. a and I'm going to say grid XY dob so um so I'm going to do the red and the blue as coming from the twodimensional array itself and we should see all black but if I give everything a uh random amount we should see uh okay so what am I missing here so I gave the grid a random amount of a and a random amount of B and uh what's missing oh I I did a random between zero and one so I what I want to do is multiply these by 255 there's there's lots of ways I could use color mode or get around this but I'm just going to multiply that by 255 oh and I'm gonna have to say floor because it has to be an integer I bet uh okay so I probably could have done a better job at this but there we go so you can see that this is working I have a mechanism by which based on the amount of chemicals I get a pixel color this is the core thing that we need so now all we need to do is say like okay let's put this formula in great so let's unpack this formula right because right now and and actually before we even do that let's let's actually just get the structure going so before I put the formula in let's do something let's put this nested Loop in again and what I want to say is now I need to use this next right next index XY equals and let me just do something like I'm going to make up a formula this isn't the actual reaction diffusion formula but what I'm going to do is where's the camera where's the screen I'm losing my mind I'm going to say grid X comma so next. a equals grid xy. a you know times 0.2 and next the the next B is the grids B * 1.2 so I'm going to do that so this is this again this isn't the correct formula we're going to have to actually put in the reaction diffusion formula but I'm showing this this is the structure by which I say the next generation will be that so now if I run this again we come back to here well it doesn't seem to be animating or changing why so it's not animating or changing because I'm still drawing it based on grid so maybe what I actually want to do is draw the next one and I did get something strange happening here so it looks different and let's actually um not let it go o the values go over me so you can see that it is actually doing something like the values are different but importantly here I don't see anything animating so one of the major things that we need here is and let's think about is something called a swap are you with me are you still paying attention I would understand if you weren't okay so I need a swap so this is a very common technique in seller automata systems and other types of Generation by generation systems what I have here is I have oops wrong side of this marker what I have here is I have a twodimensional array called grid and then I have one called next so grid is all my starting values then next is calculated and then next is drawn to the window well what should next should then become grid again so I can get a new next and draw that to the window so what I need to do is swap them what I need to do is say let me put next back into grid and then I have a new blank one to write on and I could just pull grid over there because it's the old one I don't need it anymore so if I if I want to have this continuous generation I have the old and the new so new gets calculated then new becomes old and I could just use that old one that I had to be the next new one and then new becomes old then then new gets calculated then new becomes old again so I need to have a swap so I'm actually going to write this as a separate function so at the end of every oops after I draw I'm going to call a function called Swap and I'm going to write that down can you see this I'm going to write this down oh somewhere down here so I'm going to write a function and called Swap and so what's going on here next I want grid to be next and I want next to be grid I want grid to be next and I want next to be grid I want to swap them oh but this is no good if grid is next and then next equals grid well then next is next because grid is next we've got a problem here so in a swap what I need to do is I need to have a temporary variable that keeps track of the old grid so now grid can become next and next can become that old grid temp so this is a very simple swapping algorithm to swap the values of two variables um and that'll do the trick for me so now if I swap them this will get applied over and over again so let's let's do 0. n and 08 just so we see something happening here and you can see it it went down to zero very quickly um and I could um you know I could say 0.95 and I could try doing 1.01 so you can see it's going towards it's going to go towards blue eventually so we can see we have the system going now again this isn't this is the like shiffman rainbow reaction diffusion algorithm which isn't very interesting at all so we have the guts here we have the foundation we have the twodimensional array each spot holds the amount of each chemical the screen is colored based on those chemicals and I have some formula to calculate the new chemical value based on the old chemical value so I don't know how long I've been doing this for but we're so close now all I need to do is actually go and get that scary formula uh from that web page and stick it in the code and we're done so let's go take a look at that this is going to be a bit more difficult than I might have imagined but let's see how it let's see how it goes so now we're back to here so let's look at all of these things okay a the of the new a equals what a so let's start putting this in uh so this we can do difference of a equals new a so I'm going to go back and um I'm G to probably need a lot more space here so um and I'm just going to do a for a second the new a right equals what the old a now I'm going to go back to this formula plus plus now what da what is da oh I can't operate the computer sometimes I went back by accident da is a diffusion rate so where are those here we go these are some typical values so this is by the way is something that you're going to after you watch this video and use this example you're going to want to like play around with these values yourself or go look up other values the different values will produce different kind of results so diffusion rate of a is one so I'm going to in my code I'm going to make these uh Global variables da equals 1 let's see what else we got uh DB equals 0.5 diffusion rate for B the feed feed is how fast are you feeding in chemical a is 0.55 I'm going to call that feed just to because F can mean other stuff in programming 0.055 was that it yep and K is 0.062 uh our k equals 0.062 that's that's sort of the the the kill rate how how fast is a b being removed um so these are the values that I'm going to need in that particular formula so now I can go back here and say uh plus the diffusion rate of a times La PL upside down triangle PL 2D function okay so let's let's make that something temporarily that we're going to deal with in a little bit so I'm just going to say right now I'm going to say la plus I'm going to make that a function La PL a we're going to deal with that later and uh times a times and you know what I should do to make this shorter I think something that can make things a little easier is I can say a equals grid XY a so that way I don't have to every time I need that a value I can just put a time a times uh uh oh no minus minus what a * b^ 2 uh so a * B * B and I'm going to I need a variable for a boy this is a lot of typing here guess you could fast forward now or put this on two times speed if you're watching this still uh I kind of want to like put this on multiple lines also just so you can see it so uh whoops no this should be here I'm going to do each piece of this formula on a different line uh I don't know if this is making it uh um a minus a * B * so we have a * the diffusion of a plus this lla thing I have to get to time a minus a * B * B and then now we have plus the feed multiplied by 1us a so plus the feed multiplied by 1 minus a did I get that right plus the feed multipli by 1 minus a and I'm going to put parentheses around these things I think I'm sure it's right anyway but this I think will help us a plus d a that doesn't seem right A Plus da times llas so I I so I'm gonna um just to be consistent here I'm G to move this down here and uh I think I now have all the components of that formula a plus da time LL time a minus a * B * B plus feed * 1 A does that look right somebody watching this in the live stream will correct me I think I've gotten this right um and we will uh yeah da lass time a okay so hopefully I got this right I have to do the same thing for B why not just do it right now that we're here so B is B plus uh the the diffusion rate for B and I'm going to make a lass B function which is a little bit silly what I'm doing here but I'm going to do it anyway um uh times B and then it is plus ab^ 2 plus ab^ 2 minus uh minus k + f * B K plus feed times B okay we're in good shape here I put parentheses around this just to be consistent so I think I now have um so I think I now have these formas now I I did miss a crucial point if you come back to this you'll see delta T delta T is the change in time for each iteration what does that mean well the way the world works is that Time Marches forward on and on and on the way that computer programs and animation programs work is Time Marches forward in time steps lock step and how and we're doing this calculation in this sort of like stop calculate Weight stop calculate Weight stop calculate so we can sort of scale the amount of time that's passing scale the calculation according to I'm going to leave that as one and basically my time scale is going to be the 60 frames per second that I hope that the um that the uh algorithm uh that I hope that the animation plays out at but you can really sort of change the quality of what you're getting and the degree of accuracy that you're getting by having a smaller time step so you might try 0.1 015 and see what you get but I'm going to kind of just leave that out for right now for the for the case of Simplicity Okay so we've done everything now except for this leian thing and so I'm realizing by the way that this is leian a this is not multiply by a this is the lassan a thing so one thing I can do is get rid of this times a and this times B um so what is that this is the convolution so this is this particular thing what I need to do in the lass function is look at the every single amount of a in all of the neighbors I need to multiply a weight and then add them all together to get the new value that's the Lan function the convolution so if we go back here let's go back to this page and here it says um the leian is performed with a three now there's different ways you could do this but this says with a 3 by3 convolution with a center weight of negative1 adjacent neighbors 2 and and diagonals .5 this means the following so I need to in this function look at every single cell and apply a weight 0.52 052 Point uh this is the center one negative 1 and then 2 05 2 05 the diagonals get a weight of 05 the adjacents get a weight of 0 2 and the center gets a weight of negative 1 we're trying to determine the difference between that Center cell and its neighbors and you notice it's in a way these have higher weights because it's like the adjacent ones are closer to it than the diagonals so those chemicals are going to play a larger role in the reaction you could try messing around with different values now there are all sorts of fancy ways I could write another nested Loop and kind of use some sort of other twodimensional array to keep track of the weights I probably should do that but I'm going to be a little bit lazy right now and just do this in a very hardcoded manual way so let's look at how I might do that um so if I come back here first of all let's just write um so down here I'm going to need a function called llas a and I'm also going to need a function called llas B and I'm just going to do something right now I'm going to just say they return the value one which is obviously like wildly incor oh boy I'm not here uh so I need to add these two functions sorry I lost I didn't get back here I need to add these two functions and I'm just for right now for Simplicity to make sure my code runs just say that they return the number one so that this should do something and I should get something um and I should get something so let's run this and you can see okay so something's working and you can almost even like see it oops see it like Flicker and do something weird and interesting for a second so that's good the other thing I want to change by the way and I'll deal with this later though let's leave that now okay so but now I need to actually do the correct llas function so what I think I'll do is pass into llas the function the current X and Y and then I'm going to do the entire calculation in that function and I need to do it with the grid right so what I need to do is say something like the sum for a is zero and then what I need to do is say sum a plus equal okay what's the center the center is grid XY times that weight1 so I need to do this like nine times for all nine neighbors 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine so the adjacent ones are all multiplied by 0 2 so adjacent to the left is x minus one adjacent to the right is+ one so these get multiplied by 02 then uh above and below is y + 1 and Yus one those get multiplied by 0.2 0.2 now I need to do all the diagonals again this is like a kind of terrible manual way of doing it but it's and I could do this in a loop and a much nicer way but I think this is good for figuring it out uh minus1 minus one 0.05 that's up and to the left + one minus one and I just need the same value for each one of these uh uh okay then I need uh I need plus one plus one and then minus one minus one does that seem right to you did I get oh no no no no I already did minus one minus one + one so I have oh boy I've been doing this for a half an hour that's that's not good um okay look this is turning out to be a very long video I should have done it in multiple Parts but it's too late now okay so uh minus oneus minus minus plus minus plus plus minus plus that's all four so I think I've gotten this right and then I just need to return and I need to get those X Y values as arguments and then I need to return that sum a uh and then oh and I'm not returning that whole object I'm not adding that I'm adding the a amount for each one of these and you know so I could do this in a more clever way by also having a B1 function to add these objects together so now I'm just going to do the and I could even like do a function that knows whether it's doing lla for a or b but again I'm just going to do this completely the totally manual way and we can do another video I'm going to I can make this just a few lines of code and I'm just going to be sitting here here ah come on Sublime it's try it's trying to be way too smart for me I just want to I don't want you to give me suggestions sometimes I want suggestions sometimes I don't want suggestions and this is silly now that I called it this but I did so I'm going to go I'm going to go all the way through with it okay so now we should we've got these llao functions I'm doing the convolution for every X and Y I'm adding up all the neighbors and the weights so that should go right into this formula and honestly I think we might be done I'm going be shocked if this actually works we're going to have to debug what we missed but let's run it I I I know this kind of okay so sketch ah great I love what just happened here so what just happened here cannot read property zero of undefined so I have I I could kind of try to figure out what's going on let's look at sketch. JS line 65 um so down here there's an issue here's the issue x one when is x one going to be a completely in valid spot in the Grid it's a completely invalid spot if x is zero because there's no negative one so I could do some sort of wraparound thing or whatever but I think what would be easiest here would just be to say hey you know what for this calculation I'm not going to do the edge pixels I'm going to start at one and I'm going to go to width minus one and height minus one so I'm actually going to ignore the edge pixel so I don't have that issue so that should fix that now I'm going to run it and look at this something kind of crazy happened so I think I've got the algorithm going here I I'm a little worried to have a mistake but the most mostly the problem right now is that I haven't really seated this this in a way that makes sense so I think the traditional way these are done let's look here is right I'm giving the grid all random values is what I think would make sense would be to fill it with B right I want to fill the grid with B let's run this it's blue and it uh or it kind of turned red that's interesting that's not what I expected to happen but I'm going to just leave that that and then what I want to do is I want to give one spot like I'm going to say I'm going to override that I'm going to say like uh 100 100 a actually has a bot out of a in it so I fill the grid with b and no a and then I give one spot I I pour in a little a in that one spot why am I getting this that's so interesting that I'm getting this weird Square thing so I must have messed something up this is probably where this video is going to like pause and there's going to be an edit point when it gets posted later CU now I have to figure out what did I do wrong I probably got something wrong in this formula so I'm going to have to examine this formula I also fortunately have that working processing example so I can compare it but let's try to debug I clearly did something wrong so one thing I want to do by the way is I'm going to just look at the way that I colored it in that old processing example um so I had this processing example that I showed you at the beginning and uh um the way that I did the color is I took the difference between a and b I just made a gray scale and multiplied that by 255 so let's actually just do that um and I'm gonna also going to do VAR a equals next x y * a uh VAR b equals next XY dob and then I'm going to do the color is what did I say a minus B * 255 oh oh I know it a minus B * 255 uh and let's floor that uh and I probably also need to let's leave that and so let's let's make that the grayscale value for each of these spots I I I think I know some things that are wrong um so I'm going to make I'm just going to do Grays scale right now I was trying to be fancy by having different colors for a and b and that'll be kind of simple I also want to say this C equals constrain between 0 and 255 um so I want to keep that constrained let's run this now and see what we get I'm interesting that I'm getting this like weird square like I must have a mistake in the formula I'm going to keep going here but one thing I also think that I should do is that I believe that I um is just to be safe after I do this I also want to constrain um I also want to constrain that new value uh between zero and one I'm just going to be like really over I'm going to overdo it in terms of the constraints here so that the my ranges stay reasonable let's see if that does anything different interesting did I uh what did I miss here constrain next between zero and one that seems reasonable right I'm getting these new a values uh I gave this an A so I'm going to take a look at these formulas here and let's double check them and see where I might have gotten it wrong a oh let me look at it over here A plus the diffusion rate times the laass of a hopefully I did that right minus a * b^ 2 plus feed * 1 A that seems good b equals B plus the diffusion rate of B plus times llas does have to be um XY plus a * b ^ 2 minus k + Fe * B so those formulas look right let me look in my processing sketch and see um uh let's see um what's going on here A plus this times l a A plus feed 1 minus a so these look right um now I bet you I messed something up in the lass function so I'm just looking I'm just scanning these here to see if this looks the same spot new spot um yeah grid next previous I used previous and grid which is a little I uh tricky and I did did a constrain as well everything looks the same right anybody see anything is brackets messing with the order of operations it's a good question so let's look at this let's look Also let's look at like my L Bloss function uh X grid minus 2.2 y + 2.2 and adding all those up then I do minus minus plusus plus plusus plus that looks right did I get it right with B also how did I and then let's see how I initially so these I expect to be right as well minus one minus one how did I the formulas looked right uh I don't I don't know if any parentheses or off I don't think they are um this is right then I get the next next and I'm looking at grid right not in next here and then I swap I'm drawing grid okay so let's now the other thing is I um let's look at how I seated it so in processing in the beginning I oh I started with all a and no B well let's try that and then here I give a little bit of B maybe that's what I just needed to do because uh that's and now I can go back here uh come back and let's see what happens who craziness that was kind of interesting now time scale wi now let's let me check these numbers let me make sure those numbers are right this is what I had here in processing those look the same right uh uh yeah okay everything looks identical let's be like so what I actually did here was I gave it object should be the same wow it really looks identical um I'm sure there's something I'm missing here the way I'm doing the color pixels pixels update pixels swap swap my swap is Right Temp is grid then grid is the next one and then next is temp that should work these are right this is me adding everything together these formulas seem right AB a Ab XY uh ab ab xyxy oh oh no that's right 100 100 B that's right should be fine with just one spot right because one thing I can do here just to like simulate it oh no that shouldn't matter though this shouldn't M oh I wonder because of the swap do that do I need to like that shouldn't matter though so I'm not you yeah that doesn't matter um let's let me just out of curiosity make these identical now um and uh that should be the same now 200 200 just making sure this one works Works whoops oh oh is that not enough maybe that's the problem uh hold on all right that's interesting can I not just start with one spot what did I this was working right did I mess something up here put this back oh wait no no run this again okay hold on a sec everybody let's take the algorithm I used here to seed the system over here maybe just one SP oh whoops oh no that should be fine because a is already okay hold on let's do this though so n times I'm G to pick a random starting spot and then oh I realized oh my goodness okay I realized what the problem is I know what the problem is to go back this was a nice idea okay I I don't know if this is going to fix it I should probably go all the way through with this but I know what the problem is so hello I'm back I don't know where I that's going to get edited somehow um so here's the issue I just I I wanted to add like a little bit of B like I filled the whole thing with a I actually switched that from when I was maybe last in this video so I filled the whole thing with a and then I want to add a little bit of B but that's not going to work just like a one little droplet of be on one pixel not going to get enough reaction diffusion to make anything happen I actually need to give it a block a block of like I need to pour a lot more in so I need like a little area of so what I think I'm going to do is I'm I'm going to say uh for I'm going to use I here just to use a different like I equal 100 I is less than 10 I ++ no I is less than 110 i++ now how you seed the system is like super interesting and I'm doing this not in a very interesting way but I'm going to use J uh j++ and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a whole area and give it some B like a little 10 by1 pixel area so every pixel from between 100 to 110 is going to get some B right every pixel is going to start with a lot of a and no B and then this little 10 by10 area is going to start with a and what I'm actually going to do is just for a second comment this out so let's just see what this looks like now why am I I'm getting this crazy flickering you can't see that actually interestingly enough I don't think the flickering is showing up because I've done something wrong with my rendering but you can see though that whoa oh now you're seeing interest I don't know what you're actually seeing on the stream um oh boy this is a really this was a much harder one than I imagined but I'm going to put this back in I got to figure out what the flickering is there why the flickering is happening okay so you can see this is now finally working um I'm getting a weird flickering around the edges oh oh I know what the problem is I know what the problem is because I'm not updating the edges the edges need to make sure they're seated with the original amount of stuff there we go finally we're good so it took me a little while there but the issue was that I needed to place an area of of pixels um in order to to to seat it with some chemical B so uh this was this was much this would have been good this would have benefited from this will benefit from a second run like I could just do this whole thing again and probably get through it a lot faster with less hiccups but hopefully this helped you can see now I now have the reaction diffusion simulation you can see this is one little area of pixels um and you know what happens if you give it like like a circular area of pixels or start stuff with like random values what kind of patterns might you get and you can see the reaction diffusion algorithm is kind of blossoming into this nice little flower we can let it run for a little bit I'm curious about the frame rate I I'm it's JavaScript is handling this pretty well this is only 200x 200 pixels um so it isn't um it is isn't a tremendous amount of pixels for it to work with but so you might run into some serious performance issues if you do this in the browser it's going to run a lot faster in processing of course I'm sure there's like fancy Shader web gel ways of doing this super super fast but um I think this kind of wraps up this tutorial so to recap just now that we've kind of like just want to use this last few minutes to kind of recap what I've got is uh here we started out with uh in the code which to walk through all the pieces of the code now there is the grid which stores the amount of A and B chemicals across every pixel there are all these constants which are associated with the gray Scott inter implementation so there's a an amount of diffusion for a an amount of diffusion for B there's a feed rate and a kill rate so you can look up different values for those like known values that produce different patterns you can also just play with those yourself then I have to create these two dimensional arrays I need a current and a next because I got to calculate the Next Generation and then use the current as the Next Generation then use it as the next I've got this cycling going on and I'm starting filling it each spot with all chemical a and no B then I start a little area of pixels a 10 x10 area of pixels to put some chemical B in and this is another place where you wanting to play with this code you should try something different like what if you fill in around the Contours of a silhouette and you start getting this like silhouetted person reaction diffusion pattern then in draw I do a bunch of things number number one is I just actually Implement that reaction diffusion formula I need to calculate the next amount of A and B based on the current amount of a the diffusion rate the feed the kill rate all of that stuff as well as this sum of all of the neighbors so the sum of all the neighbors happens in these llas functions and that is lower down in the code again I would suggest and I'd be happy to do this and post this at some point if someone wants to remind me modified version I could condense this into one function and I could also make this happen in a loop but I think this really shows exactly what's happening and these weights again are defined by The Sims uh page you could use you could weight things or you could have a 5x5 Matrix you could do different things there so that's calculating all those next values and then here the only thing that's happening here is I'm Now setting every single Pixel in the window a color based on the amount of a and the amount of B and I'm just using black and white so it's up to you I think I could go back you could say well the amount of a could be the amount of blue the amount of B could be amount of the green you could you could create Rainbow cycling color somebody make a rainbow reaction diffusion thing um there's a lot of possibilities there for how you can play with this but this is all of the code I think this is probably a 40 to 45 minute video I'm assuming at this point um and so uh please play with this uh send me your feedback send me your comments and um let me know how it goes thanks for watching okay live stream Watchers I I I'm guessing I've got like 50 people watching now let's see uh let's see I oh 95 people are still I guess people um okay so the I can't believe that I've done this live stream now for 2 hours and 40 minutes I did take a couple breaks um I think this really uh um draws to a close here I'm quite pleased with this result I think this worked out well you can see it's sort of asymmetrical because my pixels weren't picked actually in the center of this so you you might sort of see what happens you get this I I completely I'm completely brain dead right now I need to go drop by ITP and eat some lunch and check my email on my phone make sure there's no important messages um so oh yeah so people are asking I might as well just try it right now just for fun real quick um let's just see if I right here go back and say uh a * 255 and B um B * 255 and I'm GNA add floor so I can quickly just to see what happens if I add the colors in uh and I think that should do it so you can see I've got what should hopefully be a nice combination of Blues and reds and pinks and purples as so it's very slow going and I probably could do something to calculate it more quickly behind the scenes and somebody suggested using web workers there's all sorts of possibilities here but you can kind of enjoy this and play with colors in different ways okay I'm GNA um stick around here for a minute or two to see if there's any questions I'm I'm going to return this week on Thursday our Friday I'm going to try to set up a patreon this week so um please help me uh spread the word about that if you're enjoying this stuff and you feel so inclined um oh this will definitely get archived for YouTube I think I'll probably cut out about 5 to 10 minutes of the debugging uh and when I say I have I've one of the reasons why I want to start the patreon is I've hired a a wonderful person um who lives in Canada who's been helping me maintain the descriptions and the tags and edit some videos so if you have suggestions for how things could be organized better for how things could be edited for how things could be tagged to improve search uh please let me know um and so this this whole stream will be Arch as soon as I hit stop this whole thing will be archived all 2 hours and 40 minutes will be archived on YouTube but I think I don't know I might take like the jumping thing as like its own Standalone video not so sure about that some of the question answer stuff might get archive too um um so I'm going to kind of scroll back uh I'm just going to see if anybody has any questions uh make it faster that's something to do why you used VAR over let uh VAR is just sort of like um this JavaScript style that I'm using it's what I'm used to I didn't know that you could use let in JavaScript maybe you can um JavaScript is so flexible um that was that was one question I'm curious I'm not while I'm here I'm just going to look at twitch for a second seven people are watching um uh oh oh let me mention a couple things while I'm here because I I want some uh feedback about this oh I think I'm off Facebook Facebook wow Facebook couldn't maintain it uh oh it says it's also said it's end that's interesting I wonder if Facebook was like you can't stream for 2 hours and 45 minutes you crazy person um so one thing I want to talk about is that um I so I um I have two kids and they like to they both like to play Minecraft or the the the four almost 5yearold is a little too young for it my sevenyearold is is really kind of obsessed with it and I was I've been researching and trying Minecraft modding for a while and it I kind of was like excited about that I was going to make a processing addon for it but I Goan l over the weekend suggested something called computercraft to me which is a Minecraft mod which allows you to um this is not the page I'm looking for I was kind of looking for the wiki um here this is a nice page it allows you to create these uh blocks in Minecraft if you're not familiar with Minecraft you just shut this off right now or um which allows you to write Lua code into it and so I was thinking of doing some interesting tutorials of try and it let you create these like turtle blocks which allow you to like build structures in Minecraft and I was thinking taking nature of code algorithms and programming these Turtle blocks to do like L systems or different like fractal or maze patterns in Minecraft and honestly one I was thinking of doing this because it kind of interests me the other reason I was thinking of doing this honestly was because you know you look at YouTube and you see some of these uh Minecraft videos have you know millions of views and millions of subscribers so there's an interest level for that could I combine programming education Minecraft you know I realized Minecraft is commercial software I try to use like open platforms but um so I'm thinking of doing that my concern is is that too much of a distraction from this kind of core audience that I have of people interested in JavaScript and processing and creative coding so I uh I'm curious for your feedback um I don't know whether that should be a separate Channel or the same channel or I shouldn't do that or I should do that but if you have suggestions or thoughts about that I don't have a good way of Twitter would be a way to communicate with me or write in the YouTube comments I guess on this particular uh on the archive of this video um but uh am I still streaming on YouTube by the way because Facebook said it ended yeah I see myself there so uh I might look in the chat to see for a second but um ultimately what I'm thinking of doing with this patreon is creating a a private slack for uh people who subscribe to the patreon so and that will be a place for discussion and question answering and I'll still answer questions on the YouTube comments and the Kaden forum and the processing Forum um and I and I don't ever have an intention of making videos that aren't always open and available but I do um you know I do think I need to look into some uh uh Revenue different Revenue economic experiments for this stuff as I'd like to buy some new equipment and pay people and pay myself U Beyond just you know this is anyway so that's kind of a discussion I reference it almost every time I do a live stream and it just honestly like it's to me I'm like oh I could spend the day setting up the patreon or I could just do another live stream and I usually just choose to do the live stream but we'll see what happens next time um so uh ah so people are talking about uh uh they'd like to see genetic algorithm stuff actually one thing I'd really like to do is see if Caden would let me license the videos and include them in my YouTube stream because I just I did all these genetic algorithm videos with the Caden course you could go to their site and watch them and open I can think of a million I can think of several reasons why they wouldn't want me to do that but um I sort of I feel like am I really going to redo all these genetic algorithms tutorials when I did it for the Caden course so I'll think about that you know um but I do those haven't come out yet so when those come out they'll be available there um I'd be very interested to see if anyone tries this s of reaction diffusion stuff in 3D it would all kind of work the same way um can you point me in the right direction to turn these sketches into interactive screen savers um so if you want to use um a a pro you can use processing you can make a application it really depends a processing you can make a Java application out of it if you can turn a Java application into a screen saver then you're done uh with JavaScript you need something that will wrap a web page into a screen saver and there's stuff like that for window windows and for Mac um OS um uh the 3D would be the same idea with 26 neighboring cells yes that's right uh what you're doing is quite interesting I'm jumping into python is there a similar starting point compared to your book um actually um I don't know this isn't necessarily the the best python starting point as like learning the language Python and what python is generally used for and and but if you're interested in kind of creative coding and processing python then um Allison parish is working on a version of Casey Reese and Ben Fri getting started uh with processing do I I believe I can't remember if it's out yet or not so I'm going to Google it and find it on Amazon um and um there it is does this look out preorder so you have to preorder this but this would be a starting point by the way I'm just like now I'm just uh if you're ever interested in ordering stuff on Amazon and you want to throw a few dollars my way if you just go here to like natureof code.com and click on Amazon even if you don't buy nature of code you you move around and buy other stuff it's going to do an associate uh fee to me better yet though I just want to give a plug to Amazon smile processing foundation so you can actually have all of your purchases uh support processing with amazon. smile so Amazon donates processing is a registered charity a processing Foundation okay um uh can you make a tutorial about P5 Jess and touch devices let me make sure that's on my list because I definitely want to do p5js and mobile yes it's on my list uh video I did by the way I don't know whether I completed it but I'm going to check that oh I'm not logged in so I'll check that later but mobile is on my list sound is on my list that sort of thing um okay I think uh two hours and 48 minutes is pretty good for a live stream I'm going to go now um it's it's um uh I've been taking piano lessons with my son we take it together and we um at the end of every piano lison we sing a song going to sing the song I can't believe I'm G to do this I'm going to go now byebye I'm going to go now byebye see you later see you later see you on Thursday or Friday or maybe next week so stay tuned if you want to find out when my next live stream is can't believe I just did that um you can I'll obviously update on Twitter but uh on the top right here um it's because I'm not streaming to the Facebook anymore so uh you can put in your email here and I send out updates and I'll send out updates about the patreon and that type of thing I mean unsubscribe if you don't want to get emails from me but that's a place on shiffman Donnet um Android mode n Android mode I'm afraid of but I I would like to I could try that at some point okay everybody so I'm gonna do two things one is I'm gonna click this record button so I'm now I've stopped recording this so that's my like archived backup of this whole thing and I can't believe I had no technical difficulties today that's pretty good and now I'm going to click the live stream end button which they will end now uh it will take probably YouTube an hour or two to process it then this full archive will be there and then sometime by tomorrow or the next day the description will include time codes to where various things in the video are as well as definitely the diffusion thing as a separate Standalone video and possibly um the platform jumping thing too okay thanks everybody thanks for watching I really appreciate uh how many people tuned in today that was kind of amazing
