hello in this video I am going to look at how to deploy your Bot written in node.js to uh a server and that server being one that runs on a service called Heroku so let's take a look at the pieces so you can see here I have my browser open to my test account A2Z ITP which uh I most recently just tweeted a bot tweeted a random number 39 and I have the code for that bot open right here you can see it in Sublime it's very simple it has a single function that tweets that random number number uh and then I also have my terminal open to that directory and I could just really quickly test to make sure that bot works the bot is starting it worked let's go back to the browser I'm going to hit refresh and we can see now I got random number four so everything is working the point is in this video is I want to say this bot that's running right over here I don't want to run it from my laptop I want it to run autonomously on a server somewhere that I can set it to go and never think about it again so let's tweet it again let's quit it um and look at how we can do that so the site that I'm the the service that I'm going to use in this particular video is Heroku so um you'll need an account so you know if you're watching this video and you don't have a Heroku account go to uh Heroku dcom Heroku spelled this way.com and you can see here I went there now now I'm already logged in so it went straight to my my dashboard and you can see that I have all these things already listed on my dashboard because apparently I've tried to make a variety of I've tried to do this a whole bunch of times test this test that delete soon Etc so what are these things these things are referred to as dinos I think that's right not dinos D NS dinos Dy NS like a dynamic thing that's running it's a process that you're running so what I need to do is create a dyo to run my bot so the very first thing that I'm going to do is go up here to this plus sign up in the top right and I'm going to say create new app so app is really what I'm doing I'm going to create an app I'm going to call it uh coding rainbow uh demo uh should only contain lowercase letters okay rainbow demo uh it is available I'm going to create it and it is now there so there's a whole bunch of things I need to do here and one of the things about using Heroku is Heroku is kind of its own animal it's not really an animal it's a web server but whatever it's it's its own it has its own way of doing things and the way that you send things to Heroku and get things back from Heroku is two ways one is you use git what is git oh boy if you don't know what git is stay tuned for my upcoming set of git and GitHub tutorials but for now if you don't know what git is is um you're going to be you'll still be able to follow this but you're just going to have to verbatim kind of copy I heard a noise there's a person somewhere nearby I have to keep going anyway okay um uh you can just sort of verbatim copy um some of these uh commands um okay so now I'm waving to somebody who uh it's my my neighbor Joe I love Joe he's a great CR uh he came and said hi the other day okay I got to keep going here so um so you can see here that on the Heroku page it's even giving you some sort of commands that you can follow we'll worry about that in a moment but we're missing one other aspect here the first thing that it's saying to do is saying Heroku login meaning log into your Heroku account from terminal somehow so if I go over here and I type in Heroku login it says command not found so one of the things you need in order to work with Heroku is a piece of software called the Heroku tool belt so I probably should have pre installed that but I'm just going to Google Heroku tool belt I'm going to click on the first thing that comes up and I'm going to download it and I think it's GNA this is going to happen quickly enough that I can just do this I'm going to install it continue continue install uh password and there there we go I'm installing it I do my installing dance I don't know I I didn't I like the weird thing about me doing this dance while this video is going I have a preview screen I'm like watching myself over here I supposed to just dancing to the camera that was very weird I will edit that out that no one that someone will make a weird gift out of that or something okay so now I should be able to go back and type in Heroku look at that oh install tool I didn't even know it was going to do that so maybe you have to do that I was about to just say Heroku log in but I just was typing Heroku to make sure it works apparently I have to do another dance because it's installing a bunch of stuff oh that was I don't have to dance okay so now we can see um I should be able to say Heroku login and it should ask for my credentials my account is under my email my password is I'm logged in so now that I'm logged in I can actually start to do things which would allow me to deploy uh from terminal here all the stuff for my bot to Heroku itself so let's go back now to this page and uh oh actually this page no this page sorry and we can see here now now that I've logged into Heroku the next thing I need to do is make my uh bot into a git repository again the what git is if you're not familiar with it is out of the scope of this particular video but it's a Version Control software and uh what it's going to allow me to do is once I turn it into a git repository meaning all the code for my bot is in this folder it's going to allow me to push that git repository to Heroku because everything that lives on Heroku is also a git repository so I'm going to be able to follow these commands the first thing I'm going to do is say get init get init and it initialized an empty git reposit now if you get if I type got by the way instead of git it's going to say got command not found if you get this error meaning git command not found this just means you need to download and install git so if I Google git the very first thing that comes up is this particular website g.& I can just uh somewhere here uh H right right here I can download for Mac or for Windows or whatever it is you're so you can download and install git and and if if for some reason you didn't have that already okay now that I've done that the next command that I need to go to is this Heroku get remote a so what what I'm doing is I'm saying I want my git repository this thing that lives on my computer I want it to be linked to a remote place that remote place far off in the distance is Heroku and I not just want to link it to Heroku but I want to link it to my app that's coding rainbow demo so I can just take exactly this here and I can type put that into terminal I see it over here on my preview screen and there we go it's all set now and then I can go here and I can say the next thing okay so the next set of commands here is now I actually want to send the stuff to Heroku the way that you send stuff to Heroku is with a command a git command called push in get push means send pull means receive so there's a there's there's a lot to there's a lot to this but I first thing I need to do is like add and commit and so I'm just going to follow these commands I someday this will link to my get tutorials which will explain all these commands so I'm going to say get add and then I'm just going to use exactly I'm going to say commit get commit D am make it better this I could put my own comment in here I'm going to say uh oh and you can't this needs to move like a little bit over here I'm going to say uh uh this is my bot and it did that and then I'm going to say get push Heroku Master get push Heroku Master which will send it so now it's sending it to Heroku and it's going to do all sorts of stuff to try to run it the thing is I missed some steps so these would have been the steps if I had a kind of traditional oldfashioned uh web application you know I made some sort of server it serves up web pages people log onto my server they see the web pages but that's not actually what I made I made this bot which is just this process that needs to run behind the scenes uh with no there's no web server there's no place there's no URL for anyone to go to I just want this thing to run on the server so I have over here I'm just want to make sure I get the syntax right my notes um and uh okay so in order to do this I'm missing a particular piece so first thing I want to do actually by the way I really should have practiced this in advance but this is fine so there's so let's here we are we' kind we've got okay what have we done so far we wrote the code for our bot we pushed it to Heroku and we and it even just sort of said verifying deploy done it didn't give me any error messages so let's actually go and look now I'm going to go back to uh my dashboard and I should see here I should be able to find oh yeah sorry whoops I should be able to find coding rainbow demo I'm going to click on that and we're going to see um it says sleeping so it's not really working it's not really doing anything yet the reason it's not doing anything yet is because it is listed as a web app I need to change this to be what's called a worker app and that's what I was talking about a worker is a web app is something that serves up web pages a worker is something that just works behind the scenes with its own process and that's what the bot is so in order to do that I need to go back to my code here and I actually need to create a new file so this is my folder with all the stuff and I need to create a new file and I need that file to be called I'm going to save it uh P file proc file this is the process file it's a configuration file that Heroku will look for to know what is it that this thing is supposed to do so I'm going to save that and in that file I'm going to say this thing is actually a worker not not a web application and it its job is to run node bot. js so I'm going to save save that in there and then I have got to go back and this is again um if you're unfamiliar with Git I here's the thing I need to I made some changes to my project now I need those changes to go onto Heroku those changes are only locally on my laptop so to do that I need to say get add dot this is adding my changes and I need to say commit which is giving a message to those which is adding the proc file you can following those this is the same things I did for the first one and then I can say get push Heroku Master this is sending it to Heroku Master Heroku is our Master uh and now that done it's finished uh as I do my little dance I have to wait for all this to finish launching verifying deploy Etc now I should be able to go here and hit refresh and I see now I see look at that it says worker node bot. js and this I want to turn off I need to hit edit I want to turn off the web the web process confirm and I want to turn on the worker one confirm and now as far as I know oh my goodness boy we we sent a lot of tweets um you can see now it's uh you can see it's it's running now so it was probably running it's interesting that it actually worked maybe earlier but now it should be running every 20 seconds it should um post a new tweet and we should be able to see this by the way uh if I back here say Heroku log uh oh what I meant log is not a command perhaps I meant logs and in fact yes I meant logs uh Heroku logs and you can see by the way this is running because there's two new tweets uh and here uh it worked right so um this is oh yeah so you can see by the way there's a bunch of things going on here because I let it run as a web thing the first time and the web thing has an error it's stopped but you can see the worker thing is just saying it worked it worked it worked so I don't know if 20 seconds has passed but if I do this again look at the logs you can see the worker is still going so um I'm actually going to shut it off um because I have it set to like tweet every 20 seconds which is pretty often but you can see that this works so now my bot is deployed on Heroku and by the way free account free Heroku account um to to do this so um so you don't this you do not need a paid Heroku account to Simply run run a an app with a worker process so hopefully this was helpful to you this is about 15 minutes of the steps um what I'm going to do in the video's description is uh kind of paste links to all the pieces you need to download uh I'll have links to all the pieces you need to download I also have this thing that I ran through as a written tutorial so I will post a link to that as well um and uh but before I go away I'm just going to show you how I could shut it off if I want to so I could hit edit here I could turn this off and hit confirm so now my bot uh even though it did four more random numbers it should have stopped now and it won't do any more random numbers I've shut it off right now so uh that was that concludes our discussion of how to deploy your no Dutch ass bot to Heroku over here I'm going to
