hello and welcome to another coding challenge this challenge is going to happen in three parts the goal is to eventually inprocessing make these 3d super shapes so there's like these weird crazy formulas that you can find this is my reference that there'll be a link to it in in the video's description on Paul Bork net which goes through the math behind these super shapes and what they look like when you render them with different variables but I'm going to start way back I'm going to go way back into time into a much simpler place and rather than make a 3d so the last piece is 3d super sheet shape the second piece is 2d super shape but the first piece is actually just something called the super ellipse the super ellipse is going to be a simple example to show you how to build a shape that satisfies a particular formula and that particular formula is right here sorry on Wikipedia it is this particular formula right here so let me talk to you a little bit about the origins of this super ellipse formula okay so you might be familiar you might remember this shape from my previous video polar coordinates and trigonometry it is called a circle so a circle is a shape that has a center point and a radius and you can think of describing any point along the outside of that circle by that radius and some angle of rotation but you can also think of it as sorry oh wow x and a y and so we know through the Pythagorean theorem that with a right triangle a squared plus B squared equals C squared or x squared plus y squared equals R squared we also know through the definition of what sine and cosine mean sine being opposite over hypotenuse cosine being adjacent over hypotenuse we can solve for x and y based on R and theta so x equals R times cosine of theta and y equals R times sine of theta so knowing this we can actually use these formulas to set a whole bunch of vertex points and draw a circle without the ellipse function with begin shape and shape and vertex let's actually go do that really quickly right now in the code and we're going to come back so we're going to go do that and I'm going to come back to this formula and show you show you what happens to that particular lips so if I go I've got a blank whoops excuse me a blank code example right here it's running in the browser it's doing absolutely nothing but I can in draw I can say okay let's make a so let's make a loop I'm going to say for VAR a equals zero a a is less than 2 pi a plus equals some amount like zero point one I'm going to say okay I need to solve for X and I'm going to have an R radius R equals 100 or 200 100 is fine so x equals R times cosine of that angle and y equals R times sine of that angle so if I just draw a bunch of points at those X's and Y's and if I start also by translating because I want the origin point just for this example to be in the center of the window if I run this and maybe I need to say a stroke to 55 so you can see those points you can see they're all the points along a circle for every C I'm incrementing an angle and I've got all these points along the circle now I could connect them by saying here begin shape and I could say n shape and instead of point I could say vertex and then now you can see I've got a circle it's actually even filled in but just just so you can see I could say no fill and you can see this now you notice there's a little break point here it's because my last point doesn't actually equal my first point and I could be more thoughtful about this but I could also just say n shape close so if I say and she had closed there then it's now closed so there's the circle so this is me this is like we're just using into this this is not a super ellipse it's an ellipse and it's entirely based on this particular formula now the super ellipse formula looks a little bit different it looks like this X divided by a to the nth power plus y divided by B and by the way the absolute value of those whether X is plus or minus to the nth value equals one so you can see this is actually short I'm sorry this is actually a particular case of this formula what if a equals R and B equals R the wrong side of this pen or maybe I'm not this kind of just getting worse if a equals R B equals R at N equals two what is this formula this is X divided by R squared plus y divided by R squared equals 1 or x squared plus y squared equals R squared the absolute value doesn't matter because a negative our positive is squared it becomes a positive so this formula is actually just a simple case of this formula and in some kitten in the same sense there this is a simplify this these are the ways to calculate the x and y based on theta for this particular formula so a circle is actually all the X&Y points that satisfy this equation x squared plus y squared equals R squared a super ellipse excuse me I'm falling over here I don't have I have superpowers of clumsiness a super ellipse is all of the X and Y's that satisfy this particular formula what if it's n to the fourth power what if you have a different a and a different B what kinds of shapes can you get if you plug different values in so the question is though what are the equivalent polar to Cartesian transformation forms how do you get from theta all the different angles to the X and the y that's how I did it code wise over here write these two formulas were rather simple how do I get the equivalent formulas for the more general super ellipse shape so I could try to derive it but I'm just going to look up the answer for the on Wikipedia and and implement that answer here in this particular code example and perhaps if people are interested I could to another video we could try to look at a bit more behind the math or maths but depending on how you like to say it behind this so let me go back to Wikipedia and I can actually look right here you can see by the way you get different kinds of shapes based on what the value of n is but this is really the formula that I care about so what I care about is how do I solve for x and y as a function of theta function of the angle and here I can see X as a function of theta is the absolute value of theta to the two over N power times a times some function called sine of cosine of theta okay so let's at least see what happens can I copy paste this into my code I can't even select it so I'm going to try to remember this will go back and forth between it so I'm now going to change this to be super lips to comment that out and I'm going to go down here and I'm going to say VAR x equals I've already forgotten the absolute value of cosine of that angle and now I've got a little awkwardness because I've got these variables called a and B here and I want to keep that so I'm actually going to just change this to angle I'm going to use the word angle here just to be a bit more explicit there so I want an absolute value of cosine of angle two and I want to take that and put it to what the the absolute value of cosine to the two divided by N's power so let's make a variable called na which is going to be two divided by n so to the NA power so X is I know the absolute value of cosine of the angle to the two over ends power times what a times what some function called SGN which i will make up myself SG n of cosine of that angle so this I don't have a lot of space so I'm going to move this out so now you can see it you can see this entire this is me implementing that exact formula the absolute value of cosine of the angle to the two over N power times a times this function called sine of cosine of angle which I'll get you and now I need to do why is actually the same thing but change this to sign change this to B and change this to sine so and this is why so we need a few more variables here instead of our I need a and B so I'm going to I'm going to make them both equal to 100 right now and I need an N and I'm going to make n just for right now equal to 2 so if n is equal to 2 this should actually get us just that original plain old circle right because what's 2 divided by 2 is 1 to the 1 power is just cosine of angle so now how do we deal with this sine function so the sine function is actually a special function that just says that you want the sine of whatever any number that you pass in there if that number of positive I should get the value 1 if that number is negative I should get the value negative 1 and if that value is 0 I should get the value 0 so the sine function is just a function that takes any value and tells you whether it's positive or negative so we can actually write a function in p5 that does that for us so back over here if I write a function and call it s GN and it gets some value all I have to do is say if value is greater than 0 return 1 else if value is less than 0 return negative 1 else return 0 so this is a sine function it receives a value and this is very longwinded I'm sure you could come up with some clever condensed shorthand way of writing this but I'm being very explicit greater than 0 give me a 1 less than 0 give me a negative 1 or L 0 this is actually going to kind of tell us what quadrant Rinne in that super ellipse so we should now we have the formula in here we should now instead we're not using this simplified version anymore we're using this formula now we should be able to get a nice super ellipse so let me go back here whoops and hit refresh I see the regular old circle that's good so let's get a little crazy and let's put like the number four in here and see what I get ah you can see now I have a rounded rectangle kind of almost so let's make a slider for n so I'm going to create a slider and I'm going to say slider equals create slider slot when you make a slider you for arguments what is the minimum value what is the maximum value what is the starting value and what is the increment and what I'm going to do is in draw I'm going to say N equals slider dot value so now whenever I tweak that slider I should be able to change feel it so that's N equals two and you can see as I move the slider what I get with now that was like really hard to see but you can see as I move so I'm getting all the different possible super ellipse shapes now I could also change a and B like for example what if I make a 200 and B is 100 you can see that's just an ellipse now and I get other kinds of shapes with that so you can see this is the beginning of the super formula it's just the super ellipse I have a single angle I have some weird sort of conversion that I need to do to get an x and y and then I have a begin shape and end shape so in the next video what I'm going to do is instead of showing you how to do this with just let me come back how to do this with just this particular formula the next formula I want to approach is how do I get all the X and Y's that satisfy I'm going to scroll up to UM put this particular formula so when I use this particular formula which just has a lot more math in it but essentially the codes going to be exactly the same I'm going to you're going to see how you can get all a variety of these different kinds of shapes and then at some point once we get to there we should be able to then take this formula and move it into 3d to create volumes so I actually have never done this part before I've done the one the super ellipse and the 2d super shape and this that'll come in the next video which I'll release some point from now and then move into 3d so I hope you enjoyed watching the super ellipse video give it a try try adding some colors in it can you make a super rainbow I don't know what that would be try making that and see what you get what other kind of interactive features can you do what kind of questions do you have about the math and let me know how that goes thanks for watching
