Gordon okay so I've got another topic here about HTML CSS and JavaScript that I'm excited to talk about and I think this same diagram in a way applies but it applies in a different way I totally forgot to like prepare an example let's do one together so over here I'm gonna actually just gonna make a totally new project and I'm gonna save this I'm gonna call it parentchild and I am a child and I'm also a parent that has nothing to do with this video but it just popped into my head my children are very entertaining I do not they are not Dom elements it would be weird to have Dom element children perhaps in the future we will all have strange robotic Dom element children that is not now okay I was saying something so let's let me let me add a parent and child I am a parent and a child so I'm making a web page here that has a header on it and a paragraph and now I am going to do something I am going to say create canvas 400 400 and here I'm going to say background 0 and ellipse you know 200 200 random 100 random 100 I don't know what I'm making here but it's the greatest sketch I have ever made and here it is so look here is a page I made to elements in the HTML file a header and a paragraph and then I made this canvas in p5 that's animating and what I really want desperately is I want the canvas to be in between those two things now this is not a particularly interesting problem but it is the essence of a problem and not really a problem but a a thing that will happen to you in your life where you have this elaborate layout that you've figured out in HTML and CSS and you want to insert Dom elements that you're making in JavaScript into the elements I feel I'm a little getting a little tired so like doing a little bit of dancing I think helps you want to insert those elements into the page in a particular spot or and I've got actually a really great I've got another another example in mine which I think I will do in this video that I think will work well as well but let's just start with just this particular problem so if I come back to here this is where what I'm saying like you're calling create canvas in p5 and it makes this canvas element which as it gets attached to the page it's always appended to the HTML body which means it appears at the end of all the things that might already be there but what if you want to put it in here so let the way that this one a way of solving this particular problem is by first reminding yourself about how an HTML page is structured if you recall you can think of an HTML page as this tree the root of the tree is the HTML element a child of that tree is the body element then perhaps the children of the body element or our paragraphs and inside some of those paragraphs there might be an image as well as an anchor link you could think of this tree so what I want to do is say hmm when I create this canvas what if I could say attach it as a child to this particular paragraph and that way it will appear in between these two paragraphs right this is P 1 P 2 P 3 which might appear on the page like this and if the canvas it becomes part of P 2 it's going to be inside that paragraph as opposed to just being here and the way that you do that is with a function called parents now how do you assign that this particular element as the parent of this canvas how do you refer to one specific element in an HTML page by it I just like like ID I feel like a pose like you want to do it by the I'm just I'm like just acting silly for no reason today but that's I guess the how I am everyday that's just what I do no reason for acting did I do I was talking about something the ID write this paragraph and since paragraph is an ID I can say make the canvas the child of this element the element with this particular ID so let's go look at how you do that and I'm gonna do it in a sort of a strange way what I'm gonna do is I'm going to add a particular I'm going to add a new paragraph and I'm gonna call it canvass P and this is I'm gonna say this paragraph should include the canvass and I'm gonna look at this now and you can see and I spelled should wrong but you can see that paragraph is there and it has an ID canvass P so how do I refer to it now well if I save our canvass equals create canvas and I say canvas parent what what do I say what's the parent the parent is canvas P so remember canvas P is this particular element I want the canvas not to appear at the end of the body but inside that paragraph which is in between the header and the h1 and the other paragraph so now if I do that you can see look at that this paragraph should include the canvas and in fact it does and now this is after so this is how I take an element made in JavaScript and insert it into a particular place in that HTML page with the parent function now one thing you might notice here is didn't we say at one point in our lives that when you refer to an ID you need the pound symbol right the pound symbol right a tag is referred to as just the tag class is referred to as dot the name of the class and an ID is referred to as pound canvas P well in fact this will actually work also in p5 but here in this case the pound is essentially assumed because the only thing you can't say make this element the child of these five other elements I mean that sort of works in the biological world in a certain ways I don't know what I'm talking about psychic into that but in the in the Dom element in that in the in the Dom an element can only have one parent it can't have multi can have grandparents because an element could have a parent and that element could have a parent which is interesting and sort of things like elements are nested but if I'm inserting it I need to know which element is its particular specific parent and in that case so the pound is assumed so you can you can put the pound in there if it makes you feel more comfortable with you for life but here it works it's assumed ok ah so I had another idea for this which I think I will let's so this was the act you can stop watching how this is like really where I should stop so nice like seven minute video that child by the way the child function I could also I could also do by by selecting the pair of I by selecting the paragraph and saying paragraph dot child came the child function is just the inverse of hats I was doing so well until I started st. John but you get the idea try it that'll be your exercise ask questions in the comments but I think I want to just like add one more example here which I think would be a useful one let's make an example let's design a page so this is what I want the page to look like I want the page to have a list a list of happy things list of happy things and I want to get one of those bulleted lists with items and I want to have a button that whenever you click it adds something to that list so first there's a header then there's a button and the list is in between those two things but I need to make the elements that are going to go on the list in JavaScript cuz they won't there in advance so let's look at how you might do this let's make this example I'm gonna I'm gonna do say we're just gonna make this together I mean I'm sitting here by myself but and yet cameras probably gonna turn off because I forgot to reset it before I start of this video but I'll fix that when that happens Parent Child too so first let's design the page and I'm gonna say this page is a list of happy things and then a particular kind of HTML element is called an unordered list which is like a bulleted list you can also make an ordered list which would be a numbered list oh let's make an ordered list and then an element would be you know rainbow that's a happy thing and so now if I look at this page you can see then there that is rainbow is the first element that appears and the next element if I say unicorn unicorn is the next thing that appears you can see that these elements are sort of styled and numbered automatically but I want this to be empty nothing's in there and in instead what I want is a button make a happy thing oops that's not that's the ID button make a happy thing so now and maybe I will now let's look at this so look at this here is the page there is and let me just make this so you can see this better here's the page right I want to when I click on that button I want to see new happy things get added to that list and the list is a thing that I set up in HTML but I want to add the content in JavaScript so first what I'll do I think is let's just make an array a happy array rainbow you I can't take credit for the use of the word unicorn somebody said you have rainbows but no unicorns and you're like ok buying unicorns purple is something that makes me happy it's I really like the color purple I know I was gonna say cheese like cheese makes a lot of people happy but I've left like a lactose intolerance thing dark chocolate I don't know oatmeal this is like terrible probiotics I think feel like the bacteria that's like a good thing bacteria is a good thing it's a happy thing bacteria all got a like push our society forward and figure out how to fix our bacteria I have problems with my bacteria old and new rainbow unicorn purple whatever bacteria so the point of what I'm saying is we don't need this canvas I don't need to draw a function what I want to do is what when first of all okay so we can run look at this first thing I need to do is I need to get access to that button how do I get access to that button select by ID so I want a button I want to access that button remember the button in the HTML page I gave it the ID button which means in my code I can access it with the selection by pound button now I want to assign a callback to when I press the button so when I press the mouse on the buttons assign the callback add item now I can say add item and what do I want to make well first of all let's pick a rate let's pick something from that string of happy things so I'll pick a random number between zero and the length of the array I've mentioned this before in previous videos but the random function gives you a flow a decimal number but I need a index into that array so the floor function deletes the decimal part so three point seven nine is just the value three so what I want to do it I could say something like create P and then happy index R so here I'm creating a paragraph element that'll just be on the page so let's do that make a happy thing hello just bacteria that's terrifying and you can see here right as I click I'm getting all those happy things but that's not what I wanted want to make list elements inside that list so first of all is there a list element by the way is the tag Li and Li is a list element so I can actually use the generic create element and say Li so now I can make a list element from that with a piece of text from that array and you can see those list elements are populating but they're not actually inside that ordered list that I set up I want them to be inside this empty HTML element I want to parent them into that element how do I do that ID oops ID equals happy list and then if I store that particular element in a variable and say Li parent happy list now as I make those elements right every time I click the button they are going inside that particular ordered list now I think I have some interaction design issues for the button keeps getting pushed down which is kind of interesting but you can see there's my list of happy things I don't know what's going on anymore in life other than the fact that I actually should just made like videos about programming is that happy thing I think so so here you go this is just another scenario I think that kind of shows you why you might want to use this idea of parentchild in to be able to make Dom elements on the fly in JavaScript and insert them into various parts of your HTML file that have already been created with with the with the elements that are there so I'm really forcing like trying to make these videos like more interesting the cameras go excited shutting me down it's like stop it with the brain bows and bacteria already so and I would suggest to you create a scenario for yourself where you need this design a page maybe make a part of the page where images should get inserted or a part of a page where you should make sure you want to put the canvas or and when you like click on the canvas it makes other elements on the page create a scenario for yourself like this this really was my exercise for you was to like and I kind of did the solution but try doing something similar like this and see how it goes for you and I've got a couple more videos that I'm gonna make and I'll be closing out this section on the Dom
