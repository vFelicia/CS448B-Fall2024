00:00 - hello everyone my name is Ali and
00:03 - today's video is in partnership with
00:04 - girls who code right now I'm going to be
00:07 - joined by one of my dearest friends and
00:09 - a very special guest Frankie hi guys I'm
00:13 - Frankie and I'm 14 years old and I've
00:14 - known Alli for eight years so basically
00:19 - in today's video we are going to be
00:22 - answering some questions that girls who
00:24 - code gave us and talking about our
00:27 - friendship and ourselves so yeah the
00:31 - first question they provided us with was
00:34 - how did you get started in coding okay
00:37 - so we first started in science class in
00:39 - fifth grade when we were asked to build
00:42 - a robot so we built our robot and
00:45 - entered it into our school science fair
00:47 - and the thing that it did was the
00:51 - cha-cha slide and we made a music video
00:56 - for it that's my thoughts on coding is
01:01 - that a great way to just start thinking
01:04 - more logically and I think it's great
01:07 - that girls who code is helping girls get
01:09 - into coding what are your thoughts in
01:11 - coding Frankie um so I really like
01:13 - coding it's sort of like a logic puzzle
01:16 - that you have to that you have to unlock
01:19 - run code cuz sometimes you do something
01:21 - and you'll get it right but then you'll
01:23 - do the exact same thing and it may be
01:25 - wrong you have to sort of find out what
01:26 - to do well the next question is why
01:29 - don't you think there are as many or why
01:31 - do you think there aren't as many girls
01:33 - in computer science as guys I think
01:36 - that's because in the media definitely
01:38 - um jobs like that are in the realm of
01:44 - maybe more difficult or maybe a little
01:46 - bit more like brain engaging I think
01:51 - they're typically sort of aimed so it
01:54 - doesn't look like girls can do the same
01:56 - things um and I feel like we can and
01:59 - that's probably why yes so next I'm
02:02 - gonna tell you some experience that I've
02:05 - had in coding over the past few years so
02:08 - last year I took a girls who code class
02:10 - and what we did was made a whole website
02:12 - on girls
02:13 - Powerman so we had times you could go to
02:16 - the woman's March and stuff and then we
02:17 - had a bunch of different famous women
02:18 - like Rosa Parks and we wrote all about
02:20 - them so yeah that is super cool so if
02:23 - you're interested in doing that you
02:25 - should totally sign up um so the most
02:29 - fun parts of coding are definitely when
02:33 - you finally get it right after trying
02:35 - and trying and trying and we're doing it
02:37 - and we're doing it I'm making sure that
02:40 - the code is perfect and runs smoothly
02:41 - that's probably the best part yeah I
02:43 - agree
02:44 - yeah definitely okay we need to change
02:53 - basically the question next question is
02:54 - why do we need to change that which is a
02:56 - follow-up of the question of why do you
02:58 - think there were guys and computer
03:00 - science and girls so um do you wanna
03:03 - answer this one sure so I think we
03:05 - really needed to change that we need to
03:07 - change the stereotypes against remain
03:09 - that they can't really do anything or
03:12 - aren't smart enough because we know we
03:14 - really are and that we can really make a
03:16 - difference in the world yeah um well
03:18 - said Frankie anyway fun facts so fun
03:26 - fact about Ally is that she is a bunny
03:27 - named Chester who's right here he's been
03:31 - sitting on my lap the whole time he's
03:33 - very jester this part of the video he's
03:36 - he just he's not biting me don't worry
03:38 - he's licking because he licks and he's
03:41 - just so sweet a fun fact about Frankie
03:44 - is that she absolutely adores unicorns
03:46 - I'm wearing a unicorn necklace right now
03:48 - I'm not kidding this is like really cool

04:00 - interested in going to one of these
04:02 - camps um you can go to WWE my campus and
04:08 - email campus at girls who coat dot-com
04:12 - um again the six cities are DC um New
04:17 - York City LA Chicago Denver and
04:20 - Minneapolis sign up fast
04:23 - spots are limited there are many amazing
04:27 - girls in the world who want to code yes
04:30 - go girls
04:31 - yes go girls go girls go girls go girl
04:35 - uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
04:39 - anyway we hope you enjoyed the video
04:41 - give it a thumbs up if you liked it um
04:45 - and yeah
