00:03 - my name is Liza and I am Annie textile
00:07 - practitioner and educator so wearable
00:14 - tech is a in my opinion it's a big term
00:17 - because wearable tech can basically mean
00:19 - anything that is technology that's worn
00:21 - on your body like in some ways you could
00:23 - even clean your phone is wearable but
00:26 - usually people think of things like
00:27 - fitness trackers that you wear on your
00:29 - wrists or Apple watches right but
00:34 - there's also this whole other side of
00:36 - wearable tech that involves what you
00:39 - could call soft circuits or electronic
00:41 - textiles and this is where you take
00:44 - these new smart materials and you embed
00:47 - them with electronics into fabrics to
00:50 - create garments or other objects and
00:52 - accessories that you can actually wear
00:55 - [Music]
00:58 - so I got involved in the wearable tech
01:00 - field because I was in a graduate
01:03 - program at person's called design
01:05 - technology and I went there with
01:08 - absolutely no background in technology
01:10 - and I had to take a bunch of coding
01:13 - classes and my second semester I took a
01:17 - physical computing class which is
01:18 - basically where you program electronics
01:20 - small computers and a soft circuits us
01:23 - where you work with conductive fabric
01:25 - and conductive thread to build your own
01:27 - sensors and circuits and all of a sudden
01:30 - it clicked for me that I could actually
01:32 - take this practice that I had around
01:34 - sewing and craft and combine it with
01:36 - technology which blew my mind and opened
01:40 - this
01:41 - to me of what was possible at the same
01:44 - time there was a whole other community
01:45 - all around the world that was also doing
01:47 - this and so I researched around so what
01:50 - these folks were doing got in touch with
01:53 - them looked up their work and eventually
01:55 - you know started making work with them
01:58 - and it's been an incredible community to
02:00 - be a part of so I think the first thing
02:08 - that makes it different from me is the
02:10 - physicality of it so usually when you're
02:12 - programming on the screen for for a
02:16 - screen it's something that's a little
02:18 - bit more abstract and you can't really
02:19 - touch it with this field you're talking
02:22 - about programming things that live long
02:24 - textiles or you know because they live
02:27 - on the body you have to be aware of what
02:30 - that feels like
02:31 - and you're also working or with
02:32 - electronics it's also physical so I
02:34 - think that changes the way that you can
02:36 - approach coding with it the thing that's
02:39 - exciting about this field is that it is
02:41 - still emerging and it is still
02:43 - relatively new and people don't really
02:46 - know what the entire field is gonna look
02:48 - like so there's a lot of opportunities
02:50 - there's only a ton of experimentation
02:52 - that's going on right now and there are
02:54 - a lot of issues being brought up as a
02:56 - result of this because you know when you
02:59 - put something on your body that has to
03:00 - do it
03:01 - and technology you start to think about
03:03 - privacy when you're working with
03:06 - materials that are textiles and and
03:09 - waste like electronics that creates a
03:12 - waste you start to think about
03:13 - sustainability so there are so many
03:15 - really fascinating questions that are
03:16 - happening right now on this field so
03:23 - learning to code I think the most
03:26 - surprising thing to me was how much I
03:29 - liked it first of all it was magical
03:31 - when you program your first led to light
03:35 - up your entire world changes because you
03:38 - just need that things like you did that
03:40 - and then all of a sudden you start to
03:43 - think about other ways that you can make
03:44 - things in the world interact with you in
03:47 - a different way it was definitely a
03:51 - struggle at first learning to code which
03:53 - is dies and it was interesting and
03:55 - surprising to me also how much I had to
03:57 - sort of paint program myself or the idea
03:59 - that I couldn't be good at this
04:01 - and once I overcame that or I'm still
04:04 - overcoming it cuz that's what happens it
04:06 - really just changed the way that I
04:09 - thought about what I could do and how I
04:10 - could create
04:14 - I am most excited to introduce these
04:20 - girls to a whole new set of tools
04:22 - because when you think about if you're
04:25 - an artist or a programmer or a
04:27 - mathematician whatever you are
04:29 - interested in you have a set of tools
04:31 - that you use to help you realize things
04:33 - and put them out realize ideas and put
04:35 - them out into the world so I think when
04:37 - you have a whole new set of tools it
04:39 - generates a whole new way of thinking
04:40 - about the world and so I'm just really
04:42 - excited to see what they design and the
04:44 - stories that come out of those designs
04:46 - and the way that they use systems so
04:52 - here's the advice that I would give to
04:54 - girls who are looking to merge their
04:56 - creative endeavors artistic expression
04:58 - with technology my top ten list ready
05:02 - number one great things to see how they
05:06 - work do not be afraid to take things
05:08 - apart just open it up see where the
05:10 - wires go tinker with it break it number
05:15 - two harness your curiosity don't ever be
05:18 - afraid to ask a question there is no
05:20 - stupid question I know it sounds trite
05:22 - but always ask you'll be surprised with
05:25 - to learn number three embrace failure
05:30 - and learn from failure is totally fine
05:33 - just iterate on it right do it again see
05:36 - what works better number four experiment
05:41 - with simple and complex ideas you might
05:44 - be surprised by what you find
05:47 - number five being patient learning these
05:50 - skills takes time and that's okay number
05:55 - six find a community who shares your
05:57 - interests you can learn from that they
05:59 - can learn from you and you can support
06:01 - each other number seven don't listen to
06:05 - haters and trolls you are the one who
06:08 - determines the type of feedback that you
06:10 - get around your ideas in your projects
06:11 - and following from that number eight own
06:16 - your voice your voice is incredible and
06:19 - so are your ideas number nine it does
06:24 - not have to be complex to be awesome
06:26 - the most simple or the simplest circuit
06:29 - involving just a button in an LED can be
06:31 - incredible in the right context and
06:35 - finally number 10 have so much fun with
06:39 - it
06:39 - this is fun just go crazy go wild be
06:42 - fantastic
06:47 - [Music]
06:53 - you
