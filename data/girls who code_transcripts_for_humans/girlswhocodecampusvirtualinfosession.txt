00:06 - hi my name is Emily moss I'm the
00:09 - director of student recruitment for
00:11 - girls who code campus today we're going
00:13 - to talk a little bit about our newest
00:14 - summer program a series of two-week
00:16 - courses for girls ages 10 to 18 we're
00:20 - going to talk a little bit about the
00:21 - organization girls who code we're gonna
00:23 - give an overview of campus we'll need
00:25 - some of our girls and we'll talk about
00:26 - how to apply so the mission and history
00:30 - of grosu code is pretty simple girls who
00:33 - code programs work to inspire educate
00:35 - and equip grows with the computing
00:37 - skills to pursue 21st century
00:39 - opportunities our vision is to reach
00:41 - gender parity in computing and
00:43 - technology sectors we're going to talk a
00:45 - little bit about what that means there
00:47 - are about 500,000 open jobs in computing
00:50 - right now but only 40,000 computer
00:52 - science graduates every year and what
00:54 - that means is that there's a whole host
00:56 - of opportunities for girls that are
00:59 - competitive and ambitious and creative
01:01 - and want to take those jobs and when we
01:04 - talk about jobs in this field yes there
01:06 - are software development jobs yes there
01:08 - are coding jobs but it's also broader
01:10 - 21st century skills around collaboration
01:12 - critical thinking computational thinking
01:16 - and all of the skills adjacent to
01:18 - computer science like product management
01:19 - and project management and user
01:21 - experience design so the real big issue
01:25 - that we try to tackle at gross with code
01:27 - is the percentage of women in the
01:29 - computing workforce and you might think
01:31 - that this is a number that goes up but
01:33 - actually historically over the last 20
01:35 - years it's been going down in 1995 it
01:38 - was 37% but today it's only 24% why do
01:42 - you think that is there's a couple of
01:45 - really interesting reasons that we've
01:47 - seen that number go down one of them is
01:49 - sort of the rise of video games and the
01:51 - ways that kids get excited about coding
01:53 - when they're young which leads them to
01:55 - careers in computer science and studying
01:56 - computer science at school and since a
01:58 - lot of computer games are marketed and
02:00 - targeted at boys we've seen girls not
02:02 - starting quite as young but another
02:04 - piece of it is around role models and
02:06 - there's this great saying you can't be
02:08 - what you can't see and girls right now
02:10 - are looking up at leader
02:11 - in the tech industry and they're not
02:13 - seeing women that look like that and
02:14 - they're not seeing role models and
02:16 - inspiring figures so if you think about
02:18 - when that started you think about the
02:20 - tech leaders of today they were the the
02:22 - early the early leaders in the field and
02:24 - girls now don't have anyone to look up
02:26 - to so what are we trying to do we are
02:30 - trying to fill this pipeline when you
02:32 - think about why there are not very many
02:33 - girls in tech and women in tech there's
02:36 - a million different places on that
02:37 - pipeline that we start to go wrong it's
02:40 - early stuff about who gets which toys
02:42 - and how programs and toys are marketed
02:44 - to kids in stuff that happens in high
02:46 - school about girls not wanting to be the
02:48 - only girl in a computer science class or
02:50 - club it's things that happen in college
02:52 - about how courses are structured and
02:54 - who's recruited into what major it
02:57 - happened later on in life when girls who
02:59 - are working in the field women who are
03:01 - working in the field don't see
03:03 - themselves getting promoted or hired or
03:05 - trained and there's sort of a hostile
03:07 - work environment so this is called the
03:09 - pipeline and we look at a lot of
03:10 - different ways that we can adjust that
03:12 - and so where girls who code steps in is
03:14 - middle school and high school girls and
03:16 - we are trying to fill that early stage
03:18 - in the pipeline so that by the time
03:20 - cross gets of college there's lots of
03:22 - them in the classrooms they don't feel
03:24 - like the only one they have friends and
03:25 - peers and they have lots of role models
03:27 - so you can see here that over the last
03:29 - five years we've had forty thousand
03:31 - girls go through our programs so
03:34 - speaking of our programs what do we have
03:36 - to offer we have our clubs program that
03:39 - is during the school year it's
03:41 - nationwide it's a free program and
03:42 - school of libraries and community
03:44 - centers were organized after school and
03:46 - weekends sort of a low commitment once
03:49 - or twice a week dip your toe in get
03:51 - excited meet other girls and then at the
03:53 - bottom in the green you'll see our sort
03:55 - of intensive summer immersion program
03:57 - this is just for eleventh and twelfth
03:58 - grade it's about getting ready for
03:59 - college thinking about whether computer
04:01 - science could be a major or minor for
04:03 - you and it's seven weeks long so it
04:05 - fills up your whole summer in the middle
04:07 - this is our new program this is what
04:09 - we're talking about today it's gross
04:10 - will code campus this is for six to 12th
04:12 - grade so a nice big age range
04:14 - we're in select cities and it's only two
04:16 - weeks long some of the feedback we got
04:18 - about our summer immersion program is
04:20 - that lots of kids although they're
04:21 - excited about gross who code can't come
04:23 - to seven weeks so what we've done is
04:25 - created two week courses that dive deep
04:27 - on exciting new topics our stuff is
04:31 - working over the last five years in the
04:33 - history of grocery code we always ask
04:35 - our girls you know are you considering
04:37 - study in computer science you consider
04:39 - majoring or minoring in a closely
04:41 - related field and the numbers are really
04:44 - strong now our program is only five
04:46 - years old so our oldest students are in
04:48 - college now but we are seeing them in
04:50 - computer science courses picking this
04:52 - major and minor or even being involved
04:54 - in computer societies women in computing
04:57 - groups leading other girls into computer
05:00 - science and really growing that pipeline
05:02 - so what is campus this is our newest
05:05 - program it's in this summer 2018 here we
05:08 - go I'm going to play this little video
05:10 - from our tiny pilot program last year so
05:12 - you can see with the girls themselves
05:16 - [Music]
06:03 - [Music]
06:19 - so that's a little bit from our test
06:21 - pilot last year where we worked on our
06:23 - curriculum hired amazing instructors and
06:26 - made sure that campus was going to be a
06:27 - great program this summer of 2018 we've
06:30 - expanded here are the basics about
06:32 - campus campuses beginner and advanced
06:34 - coding courses for middle and high
06:36 - school girls in a condensed 2-week
06:38 - timeline we really want this to be
06:39 - available to gross who also want to
06:41 - pursue music or sports or other exciting
06:44 - summer camps maybe travel with their
06:46 - family or work so the sort of four big
06:49 - things here is you are going to learn
06:50 - computer science fundamentals and dive
06:52 - deep on really exciting new topics we're
06:54 - going to talk about our courses in just
06:56 - a minute
06:56 - but all of our curriculum is grounded in
06:58 - computer science teaching fundamentals
07:00 - you're going to gain exposure to tech
07:02 - jobs so there's what's out there learn
07:04 - about the universe of jobs that are open
07:06 - and available and are waiting for girls
07:07 - like you build 21st century skills like
07:10 - bravery confidence and resilience
07:12 - joining a supportive sisterhood this is
07:15 - so important there are 40,000 other
07:17 - girls that have been through girls to
07:18 - quit programs you will bring your
07:20 - sisterhood with you when you leave the
07:21 - program you will have girls to ask
07:23 - questions of to get support from to
07:25 - participate in other programs with when
07:27 - you go to college you'll find other
07:29 - girls that did girls who code when you
07:30 - get to campus and lastly this is summer
07:33 - it's important that you're there to make
07:34 - friends and have fun our curriculum is
07:36 - designed to be fun and hands-on
07:38 - project-based so you can bring your
07:40 - ideas and work with other girls to make
07:42 - projects come to life where is campus so
07:46 - we are in seven metro areas this summer
07:48 - and our programs are hosted on high
07:50 - school and college Campion excuse me on
07:53 - high school and college campuses we're
07:55 - in San Francisco in the South Bay we're
07:58 - in Los Angeles we're in a couple of
08:00 - different schools in the Denver Boulder
08:01 - area we're in the Twin Cities Chicago DC
08:04 - and Baltimore and New York City so what
08:08 - are we offering we have four different
08:10 - courses this year starting in the top
08:12 - left this green course this is our
08:13 - introduction to computer science it's
08:15 - for girls ages 10 to 14 we use scratch
08:18 - and making me
08:18 - to explore computer science basics this
08:21 - is great prep if you're new to coding or
08:23 - if you've done a grocery code club but
08:25 - you really want to cement those
08:27 - fundamentals then moving to the right in
08:30 - the red box website design and
08:31 - development so this is a little more
08:32 - advanced but it's still totally
08:35 - appropriate for someone who's new will
08:37 - move quick through concepts but there's
08:38 - lots of support this is using javascript
08:40 - HTML and CSS our bottom two courses are
08:44 - the newest courses they're specialized
08:46 - and they're more advanced we have
08:47 - wearable tech and fashion design so if
08:50 - you've ever think about things like
08:51 - fitbit's or other devices that are on
08:54 - your body healthcare devices medical
08:56 - devices but also fashion how do you
08:58 - incorporate tech and hardware things
09:00 - that will literally sit on your body
09:01 - this is going to be a really creative
09:03 - hands-on class if you like working with
09:05 - your hands and digging into robotics and
09:07 - using a lilypad arduino which is a
09:09 - circuit board kit this is the right
09:12 - course for you and then we have an
09:14 - iPhone app development course because
09:15 - everyone has ideas for how to make apps
09:17 - things that they want to see in the App
09:19 - Store so this course will be using Swift
09:21 - and Xcode and you'll be actually
09:23 - brainstorming and building apps
09:24 - throughout the class so who teaches
09:28 - these code these courses grocery code
09:30 - instructors and teaching assistants it's
09:32 - really important to distinguish that
09:34 - these are not camp counselors or
09:37 - babysitters we hire seasoned teachers
09:39 - and tech industry professionals people
09:41 - we hire have both technical experience
09:43 - and teaching experience so that you have
09:45 - a really amazing experience on campus
09:47 - now we also will have TAS on campus
09:50 - graduate and undergraduate students in
09:51 - computer science and they'll also be
09:53 - talking about their experience studying
09:55 - computer science in college all of our
09:58 - instructors will go through a grocery
10:00 - code training program so we're not just
10:02 - throwing people into the classroom we're
10:03 - making sure that they're equipped and
10:05 - ready to teach one other important note
10:08 - that a cross who code at least one
10:09 - instructor in every classroom will be a
10:11 - woman we think that's so important for
10:13 - girls avaible to see women in this
10:15 - profession studying this subject that
10:16 - they can look up to and ask questions of
10:19 - so here are two examples of our
10:21 - instructors Galen on the Left here is a
10:24 - professional software engineer at a
10:25 - telemedicine start-up she's super
10:27 - excited about breaking down these
10:29 - stereotypes especially around
10:31 - that coding is quote-unquote dry and
10:33 - uncreate if she can't wait to show girls
10:35 - how exciting and creative coding can be
10:38 - Robin is a PhD student in mathematics
10:41 - right now and she is new to teaching
10:43 - campus but she's actually been a lead
10:44 - instructor with pros who code over
10:46 - summers past working in IBM and
10:48 - Microsoft she's just so excited to bring
10:50 - the sisterhood component to this course
10:53 - so what's a campus day like week one
10:56 - you're gonna spend time doing hands-on
10:58 - activities and tutorials using our
11:01 - platform HQ so this is sort of the
11:03 - platform you'll be using to get new
11:05 - activities to get help and guidance
11:06 - everything is created by us here at
11:09 - grows who code there's also stretch work
11:11 - for people who are a little more
11:12 - advanced there's more support if you
11:13 - need more help and you'll be mixing up
11:16 - solo work and group projects your
11:18 - instructors will also be on hand to make
11:20 - sure that you're getting these core
11:21 - computer science fundamentals so that we
11:22 - can build on that as the session goes on
11:24 - we have women and tech spotlights so
11:27 - you'll learn about different avenues for
11:29 - exploring technology the intersection
11:30 - with tech and your other interests maybe
11:32 - art music science sports healthcare and
11:35 - occasionally we will even bring in
11:37 - speakers for you to meet - in the second
11:40 - week you'll work on capstone projects so
11:43 - after building all these fundamentals
11:44 - you'll brainstorm and create ideas for
11:46 - things that you want to make whether
11:47 - it's an app or a game or a website and
11:49 - then you'll actually put it into
11:51 - practice we've got a lot of questions
11:53 - about what kinds of projects students
11:55 - make here and it can be any number of
11:57 - things we really encourage growth to
11:59 - think about issues and how they can use
12:00 - tech to solve problems in their real
12:03 - lives whether it's cyber bullying or
12:05 - protecting the environment or drawing
12:08 - attention to international issues or
12:10 - maybe it's something fun maybe it's a
12:12 - game maybe it is a tribute to your
12:15 - favorite musician that involves sort of
12:18 - an amazing website we've seen all kinds
12:20 - of projects so what do you take with you
12:23 - after campus first and foremost your
12:25 - friends this sisterhood among other
12:27 - girls is one of the key components of
12:29 - campus and all of our girls who code
12:30 - programs it's to make that real and
12:33 - tangible you will get access to loop
12:35 - which is our alumni network and hire me
12:37 - which is our internship and job platform
12:39 - for older girls so these are ways you'll
12:41 - keep in touch with the girls in your
12:42 - program and
12:43 - other girls from gross who code you'll
12:45 - bring your projects with you if you are
12:47 - getting ready for more advanced courses
12:48 - or thinking about college applications
12:50 - you'll have some projects to speak to
12:52 - you'll also get to keep any of your
12:54 - materials so for example the Arduino kit
12:56 - that you'll use in the wearable project
12:58 - and lastly a certificate of completion
13:00 - that documents your work these are some
13:04 - of our amazing girls you have no idea
13:06 - how smart and creative and ambitious
13:08 - they are you will work with these kinds
13:10 - of girls across your projects in our
13:14 - pilot program last year we got some
13:16 - testimonials from girls that
13:17 - participated and helped us develop this
13:18 - program one of the things I want to call
13:20 - out from Sara who was in New York is
13:22 - that it was about the coding but it was
13:24 - also about confidence learning to try
13:26 - new things to make mistakes to share
13:28 - work to get feedback and that's
13:30 - something that everybody struggles with
13:32 - but if you want to learn to code it's
13:33 - one of the key skills you have to build
13:35 - I also want to call out Jocelyn who is
13:37 - part of our Boulder Colorado program we
13:39 - talked about how meeting her instructor
13:41 - and learning what she did things like
13:43 - hackathons competitions being part of
13:45 - coding communities was a big takeaway
13:47 - for her from the program so let's get
13:50 - into the details the campus classroom
13:54 - student-teacher ratio is going to be 10
13:56 - to 1 or less we want to make sure you
13:57 - have a great experience with your
13:59 - instructors and TAS so about 20 kids per
14:02 - class at most each course is two weeks
14:04 - long runs Monday to Friday and keep in
14:07 - mind campus courses are like day camp
14:09 - they're from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. it's not
14:11 - an overnight program and we don't
14:12 - provide housing students will bring
14:14 - their own lunch and we are sensitive to
14:16 - allergies and we'll make sure that
14:17 - everybody has stuff that works for them
14:19 - tuition varies by market and course
14:22 - between $14.99 and $21.99 and then we
14:25 - also of course have full scholarships
14:27 - available so you can apply if your
14:29 - family qualifies for a full scholarship
14:31 - and take one of these amazing courses
14:33 - lastly if you're watching this video as
14:35 - a little bit of an incentive we've got a
14:37 - code for you to use virtual to save a
14:39 - hundred dollars dates and details so
14:43 - every city is a little bit different but
14:44 - each session is two week long and they
14:46 - these are sort of the typical dates from
14:48 - June through the middle of August you
14:50 - can find the full schedule of courses in
14:52 - your city at girls who code
14:54 - komm slash campus registration go to
14:58 - that same website girls who code comm
15:00 - slash campus to register and a few quick
15:02 - notes there are multi session and multi
15:05 - student discounts that are available so
15:06 - if you and a friend or you and a sister
15:08 - want to register together or you want to
15:10 - take two courses we have a small
15:11 - discount available there we've got this
15:13 - special code for you for watching this
15:15 - video virtual to add a little extra
15:17 - sweetener to the pot and I should
15:19 - mention that enrollment is limited this
15:21 - will be filled first-come first-serve so

Cleaned transcript:

hi my name is Emily moss I'm the director of student recruitment for girls who code campus today we're going to talk a little bit about our newest summer program a series of twoweek courses for girls ages 10 to 18 we're going to talk a little bit about the organization girls who code we're gonna give an overview of campus we'll need some of our girls and we'll talk about how to apply so the mission and history of grosu code is pretty simple girls who code programs work to inspire educate and equip grows with the computing skills to pursue 21st century opportunities our vision is to reach gender parity in computing and technology sectors we're going to talk a little bit about what that means there are about 500,000 open jobs in computing right now but only 40,000 computer science graduates every year and what that means is that there's a whole host of opportunities for girls that are competitive and ambitious and creative and want to take those jobs and when we talk about jobs in this field yes there are software development jobs yes there are coding jobs but it's also broader 21st century skills around collaboration critical thinking computational thinking and all of the skills adjacent to computer science like product management and project management and user experience design so the real big issue that we try to tackle at gross with code is the percentage of women in the computing workforce and you might think that this is a number that goes up but actually historically over the last 20 years it's been going down in 1995 it was 37% but today it's only 24% why do you think that is there's a couple of really interesting reasons that we've seen that number go down one of them is sort of the rise of video games and the ways that kids get excited about coding when they're young which leads them to careers in computer science and studying computer science at school and since a lot of computer games are marketed and targeted at boys we've seen girls not starting quite as young but another piece of it is around role models and there's this great saying you can't be what you can't see and girls right now are looking up at leader in the tech industry and they're not seeing women that look like that and they're not seeing role models and inspiring figures so if you think about when that started you think about the tech leaders of today they were the the early the early leaders in the field and girls now don't have anyone to look up to so what are we trying to do we are trying to fill this pipeline when you think about why there are not very many girls in tech and women in tech there's a million different places on that pipeline that we start to go wrong it's early stuff about who gets which toys and how programs and toys are marketed to kids in stuff that happens in high school about girls not wanting to be the only girl in a computer science class or club it's things that happen in college about how courses are structured and who's recruited into what major it happened later on in life when girls who are working in the field women who are working in the field don't see themselves getting promoted or hired or trained and there's sort of a hostile work environment so this is called the pipeline and we look at a lot of different ways that we can adjust that and so where girls who code steps in is middle school and high school girls and we are trying to fill that early stage in the pipeline so that by the time cross gets of college there's lots of them in the classrooms they don't feel like the only one they have friends and peers and they have lots of role models so you can see here that over the last five years we've had forty thousand girls go through our programs so speaking of our programs what do we have to offer we have our clubs program that is during the school year it's nationwide it's a free program and school of libraries and community centers were organized after school and weekends sort of a low commitment once or twice a week dip your toe in get excited meet other girls and then at the bottom in the green you'll see our sort of intensive summer immersion program this is just for eleventh and twelfth grade it's about getting ready for college thinking about whether computer science could be a major or minor for you and it's seven weeks long so it fills up your whole summer in the middle this is our new program this is what we're talking about today it's gross will code campus this is for six to 12th grade so a nice big age range we're in select cities and it's only two weeks long some of the feedback we got about our summer immersion program is that lots of kids although they're excited about gross who code can't come to seven weeks so what we've done is created two week courses that dive deep on exciting new topics our stuff is working over the last five years in the history of grocery code we always ask our girls you know are you considering study in computer science you consider majoring or minoring in a closely related field and the numbers are really strong now our program is only five years old so our oldest students are in college now but we are seeing them in computer science courses picking this major and minor or even being involved in computer societies women in computing groups leading other girls into computer science and really growing that pipeline so what is campus this is our newest program it's in this summer 2018 here we go I'm going to play this little video from our tiny pilot program last year so you can see with the girls themselves so that's a little bit from our test pilot last year where we worked on our curriculum hired amazing instructors and made sure that campus was going to be a great program this summer of 2018 we've expanded here are the basics about campus campuses beginner and advanced coding courses for middle and high school girls in a condensed 2week timeline we really want this to be available to gross who also want to pursue music or sports or other exciting summer camps maybe travel with their family or work so the sort of four big things here is you are going to learn computer science fundamentals and dive deep on really exciting new topics we're going to talk about our courses in just a minute but all of our curriculum is grounded in computer science teaching fundamentals you're going to gain exposure to tech jobs so there's what's out there learn about the universe of jobs that are open and available and are waiting for girls like you build 21st century skills like bravery confidence and resilience joining a supportive sisterhood this is so important there are 40,000 other girls that have been through girls to quit programs you will bring your sisterhood with you when you leave the program you will have girls to ask questions of to get support from to participate in other programs with when you go to college you'll find other girls that did girls who code when you get to campus and lastly this is summer it's important that you're there to make friends and have fun our curriculum is designed to be fun and handson projectbased so you can bring your ideas and work with other girls to make projects come to life where is campus so we are in seven metro areas this summer and our programs are hosted on high school and college Campion excuse me on high school and college campuses we're in San Francisco in the South Bay we're in Los Angeles we're in a couple of different schools in the Denver Boulder area we're in the Twin Cities Chicago DC and Baltimore and New York City so what are we offering we have four different courses this year starting in the top left this green course this is our introduction to computer science it's for girls ages 10 to 14 we use scratch and making me to explore computer science basics this is great prep if you're new to coding or if you've done a grocery code club but you really want to cement those fundamentals then moving to the right in the red box website design and development so this is a little more advanced but it's still totally appropriate for someone who's new will move quick through concepts but there's lots of support this is using javascript HTML and CSS our bottom two courses are the newest courses they're specialized and they're more advanced we have wearable tech and fashion design so if you've ever think about things like fitbit's or other devices that are on your body healthcare devices medical devices but also fashion how do you incorporate tech and hardware things that will literally sit on your body this is going to be a really creative handson class if you like working with your hands and digging into robotics and using a lilypad arduino which is a circuit board kit this is the right course for you and then we have an iPhone app development course because everyone has ideas for how to make apps things that they want to see in the App Store so this course will be using Swift and Xcode and you'll be actually brainstorming and building apps throughout the class so who teaches these code these courses grocery code instructors and teaching assistants it's really important to distinguish that these are not camp counselors or babysitters we hire seasoned teachers and tech industry professionals people we hire have both technical experience and teaching experience so that you have a really amazing experience on campus now we also will have TAS on campus graduate and undergraduate students in computer science and they'll also be talking about their experience studying computer science in college all of our instructors will go through a grocery code training program so we're not just throwing people into the classroom we're making sure that they're equipped and ready to teach one other important note that a cross who code at least one instructor in every classroom will be a woman we think that's so important for girls avaible to see women in this profession studying this subject that they can look up to and ask questions of so here are two examples of our instructors Galen on the Left here is a professional software engineer at a telemedicine startup she's super excited about breaking down these stereotypes especially around that coding is quoteunquote dry and uncreate if she can't wait to show girls how exciting and creative coding can be Robin is a PhD student in mathematics right now and she is new to teaching campus but she's actually been a lead instructor with pros who code over summers past working in IBM and Microsoft she's just so excited to bring the sisterhood component to this course so what's a campus day like week one you're gonna spend time doing handson activities and tutorials using our platform HQ so this is sort of the platform you'll be using to get new activities to get help and guidance everything is created by us here at grows who code there's also stretch work for people who are a little more advanced there's more support if you need more help and you'll be mixing up solo work and group projects your instructors will also be on hand to make sure that you're getting these core computer science fundamentals so that we can build on that as the session goes on we have women and tech spotlights so you'll learn about different avenues for exploring technology the intersection with tech and your other interests maybe art music science sports healthcare and occasionally we will even bring in speakers for you to meet in the second week you'll work on capstone projects so after building all these fundamentals you'll brainstorm and create ideas for things that you want to make whether it's an app or a game or a website and then you'll actually put it into practice we've got a lot of questions about what kinds of projects students make here and it can be any number of things we really encourage growth to think about issues and how they can use tech to solve problems in their real lives whether it's cyber bullying or protecting the environment or drawing attention to international issues or maybe it's something fun maybe it's a game maybe it is a tribute to your favorite musician that involves sort of an amazing website we've seen all kinds of projects so what do you take with you after campus first and foremost your friends this sisterhood among other girls is one of the key components of campus and all of our girls who code programs it's to make that real and tangible you will get access to loop which is our alumni network and hire me which is our internship and job platform for older girls so these are ways you'll keep in touch with the girls in your program and other girls from gross who code you'll bring your projects with you if you are getting ready for more advanced courses or thinking about college applications you'll have some projects to speak to you'll also get to keep any of your materials so for example the Arduino kit that you'll use in the wearable project and lastly a certificate of completion that documents your work these are some of our amazing girls you have no idea how smart and creative and ambitious they are you will work with these kinds of girls across your projects in our pilot program last year we got some testimonials from girls that participated and helped us develop this program one of the things I want to call out from Sara who was in New York is that it was about the coding but it was also about confidence learning to try new things to make mistakes to share work to get feedback and that's something that everybody struggles with but if you want to learn to code it's one of the key skills you have to build I also want to call out Jocelyn who is part of our Boulder Colorado program we talked about how meeting her instructor and learning what she did things like hackathons competitions being part of coding communities was a big takeaway for her from the program so let's get into the details the campus classroom studentteacher ratio is going to be 10 to 1 or less we want to make sure you have a great experience with your instructors and TAS so about 20 kids per class at most each course is two weeks long runs Monday to Friday and keep in mind campus courses are like day camp they're from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. it's not an overnight program and we don't provide housing students will bring their own lunch and we are sensitive to allergies and we'll make sure that everybody has stuff that works for them tuition varies by market and course between $14.99 and $21.99 and then we also of course have full scholarships available so you can apply if your family qualifies for a full scholarship and take one of these amazing courses lastly if you're watching this video as a little bit of an incentive we've got a code for you to use virtual to save a hundred dollars dates and details so every city is a little bit different but each session is two week long and they these are sort of the typical dates from June through the middle of August you can find the full schedule of courses in your city at girls who code komm slash campus registration go to that same website girls who code comm slash campus to register and a few quick notes there are multi session and multi student discounts that are available so if you and a friend or you and a sister want to register together or you want to take two courses we have a small discount available there we've got this special code for you for watching this video virtual to add a little extra sweetener to the pot and I should mention
