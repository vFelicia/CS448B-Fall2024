00:09 - I think getting out of bed every morning
00:16 - and changing the perception of what it
00:18 - means to be a person in 2018 is really
00:22 - what motivates me I wake up thinking you
00:24 - know what I don't have to hold on to
00:27 - what was okay yesterday I can change
00:29 - that narrative
00:30 - my name is Gia career I am an artist a
00:34 - singer an entrepreneur and a creative
00:38 - never moving me for students for
00:40 - educators for supporters and then maybe
00:43 - the first question under that is what is
00:45 - us or who is a supporter I had started
00:47 - my year at school and I was working at
00:48 - the Whitney and there was this
00:51 - exhibition up and it was all about
00:52 - cybersecurity and how information is
00:56 - being used that's when I thought wait a
01:02 - minute I actually have no idea how the
01:05 - internet works I don't know how my
01:07 - mission is being used and I don't really
01:08 - know what's happening on the backend of
01:11 - social media sites in the social media
01:13 - networks that I'm using on the on a day
01:15 - to day basis like Facebook Instagram
01:16 - snapchat for example I remember the
01:20 - girls who code summer immersion program
01:22 - and I decided to apply because it was
01:24 - the only option that I knew of to learn
01:26 - how to code it was just like there's so
01:28 - many opportunities
01:30 - that our educational base yeah not
01:33 - necessarily have to do with the class
01:35 - I'm thinking a lot of Wiggins we're sort
01:37 - of breaking down the barrier of what it
01:39 - means to be a student and what it means
01:40 - to be a teacher because I think students
01:42 - can learn so much from their teachers
01:44 - but I think teachers can also learn so
01:46 - much from their students
01:49 - when people walk into the girls who code
01:51 - classroom you're surrounded by people
01:53 - who want to see you grow it wasn't about
01:55 - reaching a standard it wasn't about
01:58 - proving to other people that you were
02:00 - smart but it was about learning for your
02:02 - own personal benefit and gain especially
02:06 - in America there isn't a lot of time set
02:08 - aside for figuring it out you have it
02:10 - either have it figured out or someone
02:12 - created a plan for you but there's not a
02:15 - lot of agency in terms of like creating
02:17 - your own path like I'm a connector in
02:20 - many senses so not only do I connect
02:23 - people I can connect to people most
02:27 - recently I've been challenging myself to
02:29 - work with young creatives who are sort
02:33 - of creating their own movements creating
02:35 - their own brands through my organization
02:37 - exploratory year at hoping to encourage
02:40 - people to take on these real world
02:44 - opportunities and continue to pursue
02:45 - their passions because I believe that
02:47 - people shouldn't have to risk everything
02:48 - to follow their dreams
02:52 - we don't have to wait for people to tell
02:55 - us what we need to learn if there's
02:56 - something that we want to know about or
02:58 - learn about we can ask we can search we
03:03 - can create by me personally adopting the
03:05 - philosophy of listening to people and
03:08 - understanding that every person can
03:10 - contribute value to my life I've learned
03:12 - so much about how to help so much about
03:16 - what I can do to better position myself
03:19 - to live the future that I'm trying to
03:22 - create for myself
03:23 - [Music]
03:42 - you
