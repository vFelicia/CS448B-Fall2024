00:05 - hi Margo here it's Audrey it's Janet
00:09 - it's Britain today we're talking about
00:10 - how to change the world with code when
00:14 - you think of coding of course there's
00:16 - TVs and phones and computers so there's
00:20 - also a lot of really cool things in the
00:22 - works like self-driving cars or space
00:25 - shuttles for people who aren't
00:26 - astronauts from Margaret Hamilton whose
00:28 - code got humans on the moon to apples
00:31 - code who got iPhones to work code is
00:33 - changing the world by changing how we
00:35 - use transportation and how we get around
00:37 - it code even influences something is
00:39 - this spaceships one technology that's
00:41 - getting really big recently is 3d
00:43 - printing if you don't know 3d printing
00:45 - is kind of like regular printing on
00:46 - paper except it's with plastic that's
00:48 - melted down then reprinted into whatever
00:50 - kind of 3d object you want code is
00:52 - changing the world by improving lives
00:54 - medicine human interaction and so much
00:57 - more all this technology is definitely
00:59 - going to change the world for the better
01:00 - and it's driven by code what probably
01:05 - cut in solving is how we cure illnesses
01:07 - using code scientists can test out a
01:09 - variety of vaccine and try to find a
01:11 - cure to El if I don't know if you guys
01:13 - have seen the movie big hero 6 but it's
01:15 - basically about a guy who codes a robot
01:18 - to do a whole bunch of medical functions
01:19 - killeen can teach others importance of
01:21 - recycling making healthier food choices
01:24 - and about the lesser known issues such
01:26 - as face-to-face driving is one of the
01:28 - most dangerous activities that we
01:30 - partake in on a daily basis because we
01:32 - as humans are prone to make errors and
01:34 - when you're driving a heavy piece of
01:35 - machinery like a car those errors could
01:37 - potentially be fatal if the technology
01:39 - for self-driving cars was approved and
01:41 - perfected however that would be
01:42 - completely gone my heart belonged to
01:47 - social issues I believe that we can use
01:50 - our programming skills to code for the
01:51 - butter I think it's really important we
01:53 - keep our Earth's safe and livable for as
01:55 - long as possible and we don't damage it
01:57 - horribly for future generations every
01:59 - single day our air and our oceans are
02:01 - getting more and more pollutants code
02:03 - can help solve this issue by making more
02:05 - efficient card and making
02:07 - easier to handle we have a lot of drops
02:09 - going on in this world that I feel like
02:11 - if we are cheaper better for animals
02:14 - more efficient and renewable ways of
02:17 - defaulting water we'd be able to solve
02:19 - at least some of our drought problems we
02:21 - can create apps and other programs in
02:23 - order to make change even if we don't
02:26 - make a hundred percent change Alys we're
02:27 - helping in the process so you've heard
02:29 - about some problems that can be solved
02:31 - with code along with the causes that
02:32 - we're passionate about now we want to
02:34 - hear about an app that you would create
02:35 - to solve a world problem you can share
02:38 - those in the comments section below and
02:39 - we'll see you next week to talk about
02:41 - our mentors attack see you then see you
02:43 - then see you then bye
