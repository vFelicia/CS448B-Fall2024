00:00 - hi I'm Lily Madigan I was the first
00:03 - trans person to be a woman's officer in
00:05 - the Labor Party in the United Kingdom
00:08 - hi I am Ashley kiddo I'm a
00:09 - singer-songwriter from billion activist
00:11 - the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and 400
00:14 - of the best interpolation so I was just
00:20 - wondering what lessons you've learned as
00:23 - an activist who's been in the game a lot
00:25 - longer than I have that you could pass
00:27 - them to me as someone who's just getting
00:30 - started out really um I've been
00:32 - political for about a year right and the
00:35 - thing that is important for you to
00:37 - understand is ask yourself the reason
00:39 - why you want to be an activist first of
00:42 - all that's the most important thing and
00:44 - ask yourself am i strong enough that's
00:48 - question you have to answer mine in my
00:52 - case being a woman a little girl in
00:56 - Africa when you're born a girl in Africa
00:58 - I don't have an intensity you just
01:00 - belong to your father that you're the
01:03 - daughter of your path and in my home
01:05 - where I grew up my brother was against
01:06 - that kind of thinking in that kind of
01:09 - practices so he raised boys and girls
01:11 - equally and saying there's no difference
01:14 - in what the capacity of what you have to
01:16 - do and my challenge I faced was jealousy
01:20 - and nastiness of people basically
01:24 - because I was not fitting in to the
01:26 - picture that make everybody feel
01:28 - comfortable about what a girl then your
01:30 - girl she look like it should be doing
01:32 - and I'll remember coming back from
01:35 - school when people have been throwing
01:38 - stones and spitting on me calling me or
01:42 - all kind of horrible name and I can't
01:45 - home that day I'm never gonna forget I
01:48 - feel so hopeless so work less I mean
01:51 - it's just you feel like you you don't
01:54 - you know you in ro body a micro mother
01:56 - said to me what's doing was running at
01:58 - to know what happened I said anyway I
02:01 - don't wanna sing anymore because I don't
02:02 - wanna go through this abuse anymore and
02:04 - my grandmother said okay even I let
02:07 - people tell you who you are and what you
02:08 - gonna do as they know but I don't want
02:11 - to be contrasted I said what do you care
02:13 - that are they your family are they're
02:16 - your friends do you respond to tell me
02:19 - anything you do to anyone in this hotel
02:22 - you got to sing the answer was no she
02:25 - said then I have an eye back so you let
02:27 - anyone define who you are you cannot
02:30 - love everybody anybody can't love you as
02:32 - long as what you're doing help you be
02:36 - happy empowers you to be the human being
02:39 - that do you see yourself to be just go
02:42 - for a head and do it no mind
02:45 - anybody that's such a powerful story
02:48 - thank you
02:50 - the bet that stuck out for me was when
02:54 - you said that people that you felt that
02:57 - society had a problem with you because
02:59 - you were acting differently to the other
03:01 - girls and that really struck a chord
03:05 - with me because it reminded me of when I
03:08 - was at school and and when I came out
03:11 - with trans and I wanted to be treated
03:13 - like the other girls and they wouldn't
03:15 - they wouldn't use my new legal name or
03:18 - pronouns all that means the girls dress
03:21 - code or spaces and that's a really a
03:25 - lien eating thing so I I can sort of on
03:29 - some level imaginable but it must have
03:31 - felt like for you I won't you saying
03:33 - really well do with me and that's why my
03:36 - father always used to say it to us as
03:38 - long as you can speak up and trying to
03:40 - present in front of you then you can go
03:43 - anywhere in the world and he said
03:44 - something also that really those two
03:47 - things defines the person that I am
03:49 - today he said if you are afraid you
03:52 - would never achieve anything and fear is
03:56 - a very powerful weapons it makes it in
03:59 - three hours or is enslave us people that
04:01 - don't want to call you the name that you
04:03 - are now it because they are afraid of
04:05 - accepting you or because we're the fear
04:07 - that is deep inside of them about
04:10 - themselves because if you know who you
04:13 - by you stand and you know who you are
04:17 - what you stand for no one should be
04:19 - afraid to you you should see any other
04:21 - human being as a great team but
04:24 - unfortunately we live in a society where
04:27 - fear it is embedded in everything from
04:30 - politics all the way down to the mark
04:31 - okay so therefore when you become an
04:36 - advocate and activist you have to know
04:39 - that those things are powerful as long
04:42 - as you can talk to people for them not
04:45 - to be afraid
04:46 - you mean everybody because once
04:51 - telling people racism is something that
04:54 - I need everyday everywhere I go and I
04:58 - grew up in a family where my mom and dad
05:00 - said a human being is not a matter of
05:02 - color don't judge anyone based off the
05:04 - skin color speak to people you will
05:07 - realize you may not have the same
05:09 - opinion but you can discuss as long as
05:11 - you can talk to each other
05:12 - everything's gonna be all right so for
05:15 - me everything start with that first
05:18 - conversation there are some people that
05:21 - never gonna win on your side
05:23 - and if you realized that after three
05:27 - times just move on because you cannot
05:29 - spend your time trying to get people on
05:31 - board or something that they never can
05:33 - understand there are some people that
05:35 - are willing to understand all that they
05:37 - are already understanding but they are
05:39 - afraid of fact they wanna be perceived
05:41 - by their family or their friends and
05:43 - what you said about fair I think is
05:46 - quite relevant in detail at the moment
05:48 - around trans rights where a lot of the
05:51 - argument is is people who are scared or
05:56 - saying that they're scared and fearful
05:58 - of trans people and trans women being
06:01 - treated like other women and when you
06:04 - break down that argument and have a
06:06 - conversation with most people they
06:08 - realized quite quickly that those fears
06:10 - are unfounded and not evidence based and
06:15 - and there are those few people who just
06:18 - won't come around but largely I think
06:20 - you're right just having a conversation
06:22 - but people might world people and just
06:26 - want the best thing and a conversation
06:29 - can really bring around people because
06:31 - we have been tuned like that the norm is
06:34 - being a woman a man period we are beings
06:38 - on this planet if you accept that
06:40 - infinite in nature why can't you accept
06:43 - the fact that as long as I'm happy no
06:46 - one can tell me that I'm making the
06:48 - wrong choice so if you're a phrase means
06:51 - you're not happy too because if you're
06:53 - happy you live happy within yourself
06:55 - I always said nothing come from the
06:58 - outside come from within your capacity
07:00 - of joy of resilience of love compassion
07:04 - empathy is embedded in you or not
07:07 - you gotta know you don't get I always
07:09 - think like when I was younger if I just
07:15 - picked one or two things and I wanted to
07:19 - change in society and focused on them
07:21 - and read about them when she has to be
07:23 - people when to hear people speak about
07:25 - them and then eventually when I was
07:28 - comfortable I should speak up about
07:30 - those things and if I like I really
07:34 - learned from that when I when I've
07:36 - struggled with stuff like coming out at
07:38 - school and being a transwoman in
07:41 - politics that yep I have to be
07:44 - passionate about these things and after
07:46 - understand as much about as I can and
07:48 - speak up about it and that's how I bring
07:51 - people around and that's how I make
07:53 - changed so that's that's a little lesson
07:55 - from my family but I've always been fond
07:57 - of that because when you love somebody
08:03 - you don't judge the person and that's
08:08 - wrong we have we are all being
08:10 - manipulated by the power in place it's
08:13 - all this is political and that's what I
08:15 - say when you instrumentalize people's
08:17 - pain for me it's not politics anymore is
08:20 - just abused and we have to redefine what
08:26 - being a politician means what does it
08:28 - mean what do we need and what we want
08:30 - from the politician we the people have
08:32 - to force them to be the leader that we
08:34 - want to I think politics at the moment
08:37 - it's quite disillusioning to so many
08:40 - people especially in the u.s. at the
08:44 - moment it's quiet down why do we go
08:51 - around and vote for people that are
08:55 - despicable what does it say about the
08:58 - society that we are if you have to be
09:00 - powerful you have to be the most
09:01 - nastiest human being on the planet you
09:05 - have to be you have to be a fun you have
09:07 - to be a psychopath
09:09 - when we change our view of what will go
09:13 - rondalee then we develop error well then
09:17 - we've only having this composition
09:18 - anymore
09:19 - we don't have any conversation about how
09:21 - do we make our education system better
09:23 - how do we make our help system better
09:26 - how do we create the society where
09:28 - everybody comes everybody can dream and
09:30 - everybody can live a decent life how do
09:33 - we give you how do we get there
09:37 - I think like things I I think it almost
09:43 - feels a lot like time a lot of times
09:46 - like we have our rights very fragile II
09:50 - held like examples for me a trump coming
09:56 - in and not letting me trans people serve
10:00 - in his military and taking away trans
10:02 - protections for students in schools and
10:06 - it seems like that's something those are
10:08 - things that we took for granted um so I
10:12 - take stuff like that for granted in the
10:14 - UK yeah yeah yeah well from this wake up
10:21 - call we're gonna treat each other better
10:23 - fair and never let the bullies come back
10:27 - to town
10:29 - I don't know how serve all the future
10:34 - generation of every kind of walk of life
10:36 - to be part of is wrong I agree and like
10:40 - in the UK we just said we're not just
10:43 - last year we saw Theresa May sign a
10:46 - coalition agreement with the Democratic
10:48 - Unionist Party
10:49 - quite an GOG BT and just quite horrific
10:54 - so that goes back to those thing about
10:57 - rights feeling quite freshly held and
11:03 - thing
11:06 - personally like all of my activism has
11:08 - been realizing that it isn't great but
11:13 - also that I can change up and fast
11:17 - I was I was sort of like I'm just
11:19 - changing this like I assumed my school
11:21 - because I wanted to make my school
11:24 - better for me but now I'm getting
11:26 - involved because I want to make society
11:29 - better for everyone and I think might be
11:32 - a very rewarding and unintended outcome
11:37 - for that people like um we're by younger
11:41 - and more marginalized activists will
11:42 - rise up and sort of take back the
11:45 - political ground and I think if if our
11:48 - politicians at the moment can't sort out
11:51 - one of these problems that we've been
11:52 - talking about and I think young people
11:54 - definitely well and I love a lot of
11:56 - young people yeah because the young
11:59 - people add the future is the one that
12:02 - did or you wake up and you grab your
12:04 - future bag and you are in total control
12:06 - of it oh you're gonna have so much mess
12:09 - to deal with later you're gonna go how
12:11 - do we get there but even then you move I
12:14 - said well when I was supposed to speak
12:16 - up I didn't hmm when I was supposed to
12:20 - turn up forthright I didn't and if you
12:24 - waved at one fraction of the second
12:28 - we'll come back to square one yeah and I
12:32 - think I think that's why I love most
12:35 - about I feel so supported by that the
12:41 - young section of my political party in
12:43 - this country and just a university I
12:45 - feel so accepted as a trans woman I
12:48 - think it's just in our minds it isn't
12:50 - even the debate anymore
12:52 - it's just when you look to older people
12:56 - I mean there are a few exceptions in
12:59 - okay so obviously they I'm very positive
13:02 - about the future me too I'm always
13:05 - positive otherwise I won't be doing what
13:07 - I've been doing for the last 40 years
13:09 - because you give up on blah right let
13:13 - give up on youth and what what happens
13:16 - to me can happen to anybody
13:18 - therefore
13:19 - when I'm thinking in my activism into
13:22 - five people I fight for every people
13:25 - it's not only for black people
13:27 - it's not only for poor people is
13:29 - everybody because if my freedom is in
13:32 - danger if I will stand against somebody
13:37 - I witnessed an injustice against
13:40 - somebody and I keep quiet
13:42 - then I accept that I can be abused -
13:45 - they are not voted for a category of
13:48 - people they are voted in office to fight
13:51 - for every single citizen's right - and
13:56 - we have power we have more power than we
13:58 - think people that companies I don't like
14:02 - transgender or minority don't spend your
14:05 - money buying their stuff I won't and
14:10 - like in the u.s. with them black
14:13 - community screen elections and I think
14:15 - that's such a powerful thing in the UK I
14:20 - know definitely but we've reached a
14:23 - point where if people are racists or
14:27 - LGBT payback or xenophobic I like to
14:31 - think we've reached a point where we
14:34 - were to reward them but I think
14:37 - especially with things like brexit yeah
14:41 - there is a fear that it can still be
14:44 - targeted and and you for so against and
14:48 - it's such a it's such a contrast between
14:55 - older people who wants to leave and
14:57 - young people who very much want to
14:59 - remain I think it all kind of links
15:01 - together yeah we have the power to bring
15:04 - people to realize their own potential
15:08 - that's where your success lie as much as
15:11 - you can mobilize muted young people
15:15 - around you we are all here for one goal
15:19 - to make this this planet of ours
15:21 - liveable within the value accepted
15:24 - everybody's differences no matter what
15:25 - who they are where they come yeah oh I
15:28 - gotta go I gotta go
15:31 - if you go to the airport oh very caring
15:34 - I'm going back to Paris then I'm going
15:37 - to Armenia amazing has an amazing time
15:40 - and it was so lovely to talk to you
15:45 - October 20th I've been learned on this
15:47 - even in a lifetime a word from some
15:50 - lines incredible so if you're around you
15:55 - want to come let me know
15:56 - I definitely well erupt it was so nice
16:01 - to talk to you
16:02 - we're gonna change this oh yeah we've
16:06 - you here yet

Cleaned transcript:

hi I'm Lily Madigan I was the first trans person to be a woman's officer in the Labor Party in the United Kingdom hi I am Ashley kiddo I'm a singersongwriter from billion activist the UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and 400 of the best interpolation so I was just wondering what lessons you've learned as an activist who's been in the game a lot longer than I have that you could pass them to me as someone who's just getting started out really um I've been political for about a year right and the thing that is important for you to understand is ask yourself the reason why you want to be an activist first of all that's the most important thing and ask yourself am i strong enough that's question you have to answer mine in my case being a woman a little girl in Africa when you're born a girl in Africa I don't have an intensity you just belong to your father that you're the daughter of your path and in my home where I grew up my brother was against that kind of thinking in that kind of practices so he raised boys and girls equally and saying there's no difference in what the capacity of what you have to do and my challenge I faced was jealousy and nastiness of people basically because I was not fitting in to the picture that make everybody feel comfortable about what a girl then your girl she look like it should be doing and I'll remember coming back from school when people

they wouldn't use my new legal name or pronouns all that means the girls dress code or spaces and that's a really a lien eating thing so I I can sort of on some level imaginable but it must have felt like for you I won't you saying really well do with me and that's why my father always used to say it to us as long as you can speak up and trying to present in front of you then you can go anywhere in the world and he said something also that really those two things defines the person that I am today he said if you are afraid you would never achieve anything and fear is a very powerful weapons

those things are powerful as long as you can talk to people for them not to be afraid you mean everybody because once telling people racism is something that I need everyday everywhere I go and I grew

people it's not only for black people it's not only for poor people is everybody because if my freedom is in danger if I will stand against somebody I witnessed an injustice against somebody and I keep quiet then I accept that I can be abused they are not voted for a category of people they are voted in office to fight for every single citizen's right and we have power we have more power than we think people that companies I don't like transgender or minority don't spend your money buying their stuff I won't and like in the u.s. with them black community screen elections and I think that's such a powerful thing in the UK I know definitely but we've reached a point where if people are racists or LGBT payback or xenophobic I like to think we've reached a point where we were to reward them but I think especially with things like brexit yeah there is a fear that it can still be targeted and and you for so against and it's such a it's such a contrast between older people who wants to leave and young people who very much want to remain I think it all kind of links together yeah we have the power to bring people to realize their own potential that's where your success lie as much as you can mobilize muted young people around you we are all here for one goal to make this this planet of ours liveable within the value accepted everybody's differences no matter what who they are where they come yeah oh I gotta go I gotta go if you go to the airport oh very caring I'm going back to Paris then I'm going to Armenia amazing has an amazing time and it was so lovely to talk to you

gonna change this oh yeah we've you here yet
