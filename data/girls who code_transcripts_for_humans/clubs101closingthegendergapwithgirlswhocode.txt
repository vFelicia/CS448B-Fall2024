02:35 - and postol age alums even more exciting
02:38 - these alums are earning computer science
02:40 - and related degrees at seven times the
02:43 - national average and for our sixth
02:45 - through 12th grade Club participants
02:47 - specifically we see incredible gains in

03:31 - with the program let's hear what they
03:33 - have to say about the impact of
03:37 - clubs participating in girls who code
03:40 - has helped me take away like the fear of
03:43 - like computer science from like this
03:45 - like abstract concept to actually
03:46 - something that's easy to do and or not
03:49 - easy every time but something that's
03:51 - like feasible and like a step-by-step

04:09 - and like everyone in the club hangs out
04:11 - with each other outside of school and we
04:13 - help each other with assignments not
04:14 - even for computer science sometimes it's
04:17 - for like other subjects as well being in
04:19 - a club that is just only all girls who
04:22 - all want to work on the same projects or
04:25 - just pursue the same computer science it
04:28 - just makes me feel more motivated to
04:30 - want to pursue computer science in the
04:34 - future
04:37 - wow these stories offer powerful
04:40 - testimonials about club's impact on

dedicated to closing the gender gap in technology and empowering the change makers of Tomorrow our organization tackles issues impacting the gender gap representation Workforce Development and opportunity for historically underrepresented groups in Tech we do this by providing free computer science programs that Inspire educate and equip young women and nonbinary individuals with the skills they need to pursue 21st century opportunities our vision is to build a pipeline of technologists we want to send more young women and nonbinary individuals into the tech Workforce achieving gender parity and entrylevel tech jobs by 2030 it's an ambitious goal and with your help we know we can achieve it since launching in 2012 Gru code has served over half a million young people through our

priority consideration for placement in girls who codes Workforce programs we're proud to say 53% of program participants are from historically underrepresented groups in Tech and we have almost 200,000 college and postol age alums even more exciting these alums are earning computer science and related degrees at seven times the national average and for our sixth through 12th grade Club participants specifically we see incredible gains in computer science skills career awareness and awareness of the contributions of women in Tech behind our stats are real stories of professional and personal development we're so proud of alums like Winfred Frida and Gabrielle who started in clubs they fully embraced the values of girls who code and went on to top colleges and universities with scholarships Awards and a passion for computer science of course it's one thing for us to tell you about the club's program it's another to directly hear from club members obne Angela Alyssa and Mia are Club participants who joined us last year to talk about their experiences with the program let's hear what they have to say about the impact of clubs participating in girls who code has helped me

absolutely no computer science experience is needed all you need to start your Club is a nonprofit host site technology and internet and a facilitator we'll explore each of these a bit further so first your host site can be any nonprofit like a school library or Community Center and clubs also offer the flexibility to meet in person or virtually through Google Classroom Zoom or any other conferencing platform technology and internet connection are required for 6th through 12th grade club members but are optional for third through fifth grade clubs the club's program is compatible with PCs Macs and Chromebooks iPads are also an option but can only be used for beginner selfguided tutorials in the coding language Swift finally every Club needs a facilitator to submit the club's application and oversee the club facilitators must be 18 or older and pass a background check if they are not an employee of the club's host site employees of host sites for example teachers at schools are not required to go through a separate background check most importantly facilitators do not need computer science or technical experience to facilitate a club due to the resources and support girl who code provides as you start to think about who might facilitate your Club it can be helpful to know that our club facilitators come from a variety of diverse roles including teachers Librarians nonprofit Pro program staff and community volunteers such as parents local Tech workers or even college and university students clubs frequently operate with one facilitator leading the curriculum however there are other options you may also have a club where there's more than one facilitator or clubs where the facilitator acts in an advisory capacity and the club is run by members
