00:19 - I wanted to be a part of girls who code
00:21 - because it was an opportunity for me to
00:22 - try something new I wanted to be a
00:24 - coding experience it's really hard to
00:26 - find like classes and my school doesn't
00:28 - have any clubs it first it's kind of
00:30 - intimidating and you feel like you're
00:31 - not going to get through it and you
00:33 - don't know really how it gave me the
00:35 - confidence to believe that I can learn
00:37 - this sort of thing and I thought that it
00:39 - would be really hard it's become really
00:41 - easy to learn these things and I think
00:42 - that's really cool currently I teach
00:45 - computer science prior to that I was at
00:47 - Howard University I returned to pursue a
00:51 - doctorial degree in computer science
00:53 - education with a focus on artificial
00:56 - intelligence so girls who code is a
00:58 - really good pillar that these girls can
01:00 - stand on to see Tech professionals who
01:02 - look like them who talk like them who
01:05 - sound like them and they encourage them
01:07 - to be the best that they can be and use
01:09 - computer science and everything that you
01:11 - do I personally really enjoyed 2048 just
01:14 - because you sit there and you play the
01:16 - game on your phone and you're like this
01:18 - must have been so hard to code and like
01:19 - you're having a great time but you know
01:21 - I I did it we did it we we can do that
01:24 - stuff we reach this moment where it
01:27 - clicks and then you get the there and
01:30 - it's really great and it's one of the
01:32 - best feelings I've ever had also we get
01:35 - to like bond with each other like even
01:37 - more Sisterhood yeah it's been like
01:39 - really cool watching everyone become so
01:40 - close she had a lot of interest in the
01:42 - same things that I was interested in
01:44 - we're both coming up with different ways
01:46 - to like redefine what our project can be
01:49 - and it's so great to have someone else
01:50 - who's also coming up with
01:53 - ideas I think it's so important that we
01:55 - girls have girls who code for us because
01:58 - computer science field really could use
01:59 - women in technology and seeing how much
02:02 - like I like it and how everyone else in
02:03 - the program likes it just makes me think
02:05 - about how many other girls we can impact
02:07 - with programs like girls who could so we
02:10 - have a summer program we call it our
02:12 - summer immersion program where we put
02:14 - girls 20 girls at a time in a technology
02:16 - company and they learn the fundamentals
02:18 - of computer science they learned you
02:20 - know coding languages they learned how
02:21 - to build a mobile app how to build a
02:23 - website the last two weeks they actually
02:25 - have their own projects where they
02:27 - design or create something whether it's
02:28 - an algorithm or whether it's
02:30 - app I definitely wish I had a program
02:33 - like girls who code when I was growing
02:35 - up um because when I was a freshman in
02:38 - college in my first introduction to
02:40 - computer science course I was one of the
02:43 - few girls in that class and I was
02:45 - definitely one who had never ever had an
02:47 - opportunity to code
02:49 - before so as far as I'm concerned we run
02:51 - the internet you know women Facebook
02:53 - more they tweet more they make 85% of
02:55 - all consumer purchases I think our world
02:57 - is just going to be a better place with
02:58 - more female engineers and soft
03:00 - programmers we should be sitting on the
03:02 - other side
