02:50 - in the federal technology
02:52 - space welcome Amanda thank you so much
02:55 - good to be here and thank you all for
02:58 - being here so let's let's go ahead and
03:00 - jump right into our discussion first set
03:03 - of questions is going to be a little bit
03:04 - about merging Technologies so how would
03:07 - you describe the current landscape of
03:09 - tech and how are emerging emerging
03:12 - Technologies impacting job
03:20 - opportunities okay sorry
03:23 - goad I didn't know if it was to someone
03:25 - specifically you can go ahead
03:28 - Patrice yeah so my focus on on cyber
03:33 - security really gives me a unique
03:35 - perspective of how this emerging
03:37 - Technologies such as Ai and machine
03:40 - learning things within cyber security
03:43 - itself that affected like
03:44 - ransomware and of course I think there
03:47 - is another one such as Cloud which has
03:49 - been there but is really making a um a
03:52 - big impact on the way that businesses
03:53 - like mine deoe um shifts and does its
03:57 - strategy so I really do see that things
03:59 - things that are business focus or these
04:01 - companies that you're partnering with or
04:03 - thinking about as you move into your
04:05 - career um these emerging Technologies
04:07 - are what we're looking at too and these
04:09 - three at least are big for for us here
04:11 - over
04:12 - deoe there was a second part of the
04:14 - question and I need to also adjust my
04:15 - camera it's getting fuzzy for some
04:17 - reason everybody I apologize was there a
04:19 - second part of that as well uh how do
04:22 - you how would you C and how are emerging
04:24 - Technologies impacting job opportunities
04:26 - ah yes so we see a huge demand for
04:31 - technical skills here um starts all the
04:34 - way down at the participants level right
04:37 - we definitely like to partner with those
04:39 - that are early in their career um
04:41 - seeking out like Talent that's um either
04:44 - on campuses or like I said shifting into
04:47 - Tech so we're at a bit of an
04:49 - underemployment for Tech the technical
04:52 - industry at large um so we do see a rise
04:56 - in the demand for those skill sets a
04:57 - need for that skill set and really
04:59 - competition for you know those that are
05:01 - here on the
05:03 - webinar absolutely thanks so much
05:06 - Patrice K I know you you had
05:09 - something I mean it's pretty similar to
05:11 - Patrice because deoy and Accenture are
05:13 - both consulting firms um I know when
05:16 - when I graduated like data science
05:19 - wasn't really big and so just getting
05:22 - into that you know growing your skills
05:25 - you can start from anywhere really and
05:27 - just build up your skill set as you go
05:30 - like I didn't take any python or R
05:32 - coding the only thing that was offered
05:34 - at my college was Java at the time so
05:38 - that was not great for what I do now you
05:41 - know and so it just kind of shows you
05:43 - the ever evolving landscape you know
05:45 - I've been with Accenture nine years and
05:47 - it's changed so much I have to know you
05:50 - know I've learned six different
05:51 - programming languages on my own just to
05:54 - keep up and that's really kind of what
05:57 - you want to focus on is just keep
05:59 - building building your skill set you
06:01 - know and um technical skills are so
06:04 - valuable so useful to um inside and
06:08 - outside of wherever you work you know
06:10 - it's just analytical thinking critical
06:12 - thinking um strategizing honestly and I
06:16 - think kind of navigating those Waters is
06:19 - is great tool for for anybody um the
06:23 - jobs we've definitely seen gone up
06:25 - generative AI with Chad GPT coming out
06:27 - like you're going to see t tons of
06:30 - spaces now opening up job markets to
06:33 - anyone with generative AI prompt
06:36 - engineering um learning how to do
06:38 - foundational models and building up from
06:40 - there uh definitely has changed the
06:43 - market we're investing so much money
06:45 - just in generative Ai and in our
06:47 - employees who know that kind of um
06:50 - technology so definitely change changes
06:54 - all the time so definitely be keeping on
06:56 - your
06:58 - toes uh I would definitely Echo that as
07:01 - well I think the the biggest constant in
07:04 - this field is change there's always new
07:06 - languages always new Frameworks and
07:09 - Technologies um so yeah being able to go
07:15 - with that flow to learn those languages
07:18 - um I see the comment that it's amazing
07:21 - to teach oneself six languages on your
07:24 - own which it is but also I think like
07:27 - probably all of us have learned a new
07:30 - language for a new job or a new project
07:32 - at some point in our careers um and that
07:35 - just becomes one of the skills is just
07:38 - knowing enough
07:40 - about um what the overall differences
07:43 - and similarities are to be able to learn
07:45 - those things and I think the creative
07:48 - problem solving stays the same
07:50 - throughout and that's what I think is
07:52 - the fun part um and what is like really
07:55 - the heart of what I would say is uh
07:58 - software engineering at the very least I
08:00 - think data science does get very
08:02 - analytical as
08:04 - well oh thank you all so much and am and
08:07 - I really appreciate that phrase uh the
08:09 - biggest constant is change right those
08:12 - two things don't sound like they belong
08:13 - in the same sentence but they most
08:15 - certainly do especially in this industry
08:18 - uh let's move on to our next question
08:19 - and again anyone can jump into answer um
08:22 - what emerging Technologies do you think
08:24 - will have the biggest impact on job
08:26 - opportunities in the tech industry in
08:28 - the next few years so AI was a good
08:31 - example we've definitely already touched
08:32 - upon that um other things like cyber
08:34 - security machine learning what are some
08:36 - of the technologies that are going to
08:37 - have that big
08:42 - impact uh so I would definitely say AI
08:46 - is a huge one it's also very much in the
08:48 - news right now so a lot of people are
08:50 - thinking about it talking about it
08:54 - um so it's very of the moment um there's
08:59 - just an executive order on AI uh that
09:02 - mentions digital core as a way to hire
09:06 - um Ai and AI enabling um Talent into the
09:11 - federal space but also uh similar to
09:14 - other previous changes I think that
09:18 - it'll shift the shape of work but not
09:20 - fundamentally change it
09:23 - um some things will get automated in the
09:26 - way some things have previously been
09:28 - automated at by all of our uh idees and
09:32 - everything um some of the work will
09:35 - become standing up these uh large
09:38 - language models and other sorts of um AI
09:42 - tools and but there will still be I
09:46 - think that creative problem solving is
09:48 - not something that AI has solved or I
09:51 - would guess is close to solving um
09:54 - others may have better information on
09:56 - that than I do I'm not following that
09:59 - closely that field but um but yeah I
10:02 - think it's it's just a different um a
10:07 - slightly different Focus but a lot of
10:09 - the same fundamental
10:11 - work yeah that's a fantastic answer um I
10:16 - I want to also kind of add to that I
10:19 - know we talked about AI but it is
10:22 - massive right um I I made I think a
10:26 - comment on LinkedIn where I said a lot
10:29 - of people are afraid in our industry in
10:32 - Tech of being replaced by Ai and what I
10:35 - really see is a more credible threat of
10:40 - I don't think you'll be replaced by AI
10:42 - so much as you'll be replaced by someone
10:44 - that's using AI to do the same work you
10:47 - do um so right I mean embracing
10:51 - artificial intelligence adopting it and
10:53 - really augmenting it where it makes
10:55 - sense is crucial coming in to Tech and
10:59 - realizing that most people are um not as
11:02 - well versed as some of the data
11:04 - scientists that are out there that have
11:06 - been dealing with this for a while put
11:08 - you on a pretty Level Playing Field and
11:10 - I want to make one more comment too that
11:12 - I wanted to add or add for the emerging
11:15 - um uh Tech landscape so I'm here in
11:18 - Washington DC deoy one of the three hubs
11:22 - where we do cyber security you'll see
11:24 - behind me there aren't a lot of people
11:26 - because remote work is also having a
11:29 - huge impact on the tech industry so you
11:32 - better believe we're working and we're
11:35 - delivering services in Tech but we're
11:37 - not necessarily doing it from offices
11:40 - anymore so that's that's a huge impact
11:43 - on the landscape as well um but yeah
11:46 - fantastic
11:48 - answers yeah and I want to like just
11:50 - Echo Amanda and Patrice like excellent
11:53 - answers and uh AI just is a huge range
11:59 - range of employment like it is not just
12:02 - one specific thing like there are
12:05 - multiple different positions multiple
12:08 - different uses so when we say AI it's
12:10 - not like pigeon holding you to any one
12:13 - specific task and like we always get
12:16 - those fears of new emerging technology
12:18 - like when cars were invented they were
12:21 - like oh my gosh it's taking away jobs
12:23 - from Carriage people you know like it's
12:25 - so silly you know that we think we still
12:27 - think like that even though over like we
12:29 - have such a record over time of how
12:32 - technology innovation has actually
12:34 - improved our job opportunities our
12:37 - landscape our economy like all of that
12:40 - and it has just created new jobs like
12:42 - when I was in college data science
12:44 - wasn't a job and now it's a degree you
12:46 - can get in college in MERS you know like
12:49 - there's tons of opportunities and there
12:52 - will be tons of new opportunities so
12:54 - even though we will use Ai and it might
12:58 - replace some jobs jobs it will create
12:59 - new jobs so I wouldn't be too worried
13:02 - about it like erasing jobs you'll just
13:05 - have to change with the
13:08 - technology absolutely we definitely just
13:10 - have to lean in instead of shying away
13:12 - when we know that this is something
13:13 - that's not going to go away anytime soon
13:16 - um all right we're going to shift gears
13:18 - a little bit and talk a little bit about
13:19 - upskilling and transferable skills so
13:21 - something that we've kind of touched
13:23 - upon a couple of times and gone around
13:25 - um how do you all think that individuals
13:27 - prepare for the opportunities and adapt
13:30 - their skill sets accordingly so you've
13:32 - talked about how things are constantly
13:33 - changing what are some things that
13:35 - people can do to prepare themselves for
13:39 - change I would just get well-versed you
13:42 - know like on what you want to do you
13:45 - know um study up on it talk to people in
13:50 - those Industries networking is your main
13:54 - thing that you need to do is network
13:56 - network network like reach out to people
13:59 - don't be afraid to go on LinkedIn reach
14:00 - out and say hey I'm really interested in
14:02 - what you do can we can we talk about it
14:06 - how did you get started because
14:07 - everyone's story is so different you
14:09 - know you can see people that didn't get
14:12 - Tech degrees are now in tech jobs or
14:14 - vice versa you know like how did that
14:16 - happen how can you make that transition
14:19 - what kind of courses can you take to
14:22 - upscale kind of thing so that's what I I
14:24 - would
14:25 - say yeah I'm a big fan too of um getting
14:29 - involved with organizations communities
14:32 - I mean you found your way to girls who
14:34 - code webinars I like following certain
14:37 - content creators too um both on Tik Tok
14:41 - LinkedIn um there's a lot of good PL
14:43 - people in the space again I specialize
14:45 - in cyber security so really staying in
14:48 - touch with your cohorts and peers is
14:51 - huge because you get to see what they
14:54 - care about and a lot of times especially
14:56 - content creators will um we'll talk
14:59 - about the things that the industry cares
15:02 - about right they'll be in Cutting Edge
15:04 - conversations or playing with that new
15:06 - tech or seeing how people are thinking
15:08 - about that so if that's what I did at
15:11 - the beginning of my career it was a
15:13 - little bit different because of course
15:15 - content creation wasn't as huge and
15:16 - content creator wasn't as huge but still
15:19 - like just staying involved in certain
15:22 - groups associations was was a really
15:24 - good thing as well too to keep up with
15:27 - everything yeah that's those were um
15:31 - great answers I definitely want to Echo
15:34 - like keep on learning new things don't
15:36 - be afraid of trying something new when
15:39 - you change projects or jobs just because
15:42 - a team
15:44 - is um is using a language that you
15:46 - haven't used before that is often
15:50 - expected um in the industry you will
15:53 - start a new job and have to pick up
15:56 - Python and people will help you with it
15:57 - and they'll be patient about that
15:59 - because that's just the way it actually
16:01 - works um so like go and try those new
16:05 - languages try to learn new things all
16:08 - the time take advantage of those
16:10 - programs if your job has them where
16:12 - they'll cover the cost of going to a
16:14 - conference or of taking a class or
16:17 - something um and I
16:20 - think um I think that like one of those
16:23 - things you do see with that like
16:26 - automation of pieces of a job um that
16:30 - we're see starting to see AI contribute
16:33 - to is that it gets rid of a lot of the
16:37 - like sort of mindless boilerplate part
16:40 - of the work and that means you can focus
16:43 - more on the like more deep thinking
16:46 - pieces of software engineering and I
16:49 - would say like between that and the Very
16:53 - remote um heavy job uh cultures and
16:58 - Landscapes that we have now try to be
17:02 - very mindful of your mental health as
17:05 - well and of how you are taking breaks
17:07 - and how you are getting a mix of like
17:11 - that really deep thinking that you will
17:13 - be doing a lot of
17:15 - and something else because I think um
17:19 - doing 40 hours a week of coding when
17:22 - sometimes what you're doing is you know
17:25 - creating all that like boilerplate you
17:27 - need to do for new Java class or writing
17:31 - out the unit tests now your IDE can just
17:35 - write some of your unit tests for you
17:38 - and you need to know what mistakes it
17:40 - might make and what to look for but um
17:44 - yeah like 40 hours of just deep thinking
17:47 - is a lot for a week so figure out how to
17:50 - find that New Balance now that like some
17:53 - of the old balance is going
17:56 - away absolutely and throughout this
17:59 - piece of the conversation we've
18:00 - mentioned a lot of different
18:01 - transferable skills so before we dive
18:03 - into um some audience questions I'd love
18:06 - to ask you all one more question to
18:10 - think about and I'll ask each one of you
18:11 - to answer so if in thinking about those
18:14 - transferable skills if you had to narrow
18:16 - it down to one specific transferable
18:19 - skill that you think job Seekers should
18:21 - leverage the most for long-term Career
18:24 - Success in this industry what do you
18:26 - think it would be so one big
18:29 - transferable skill that you think is
18:31 - like the most
18:33 - important and I'm gonna ask each one of
18:37 - you honestly it's it's not Teck it's
18:40 - communication honestly like for me uh
18:43 - just being able to
18:45 - communicate what you're doing like how
18:49 - you're doing it everything communicating
18:52 - with people uh I think that is the
18:56 - biggest skill to have you know because
18:58 - you could be Tech savy all day but if
19:00 - you can't explain your work or have an
19:04 - understanding um of how to like
19:06 - visualize it for someone else to
19:08 - understand who's not tech savvy like
19:10 - you're not going to just hand someone an
19:11 - Excel spreadsheet and be like here are
19:13 - the results like no like you have to be
19:15 - able to communicate and so that's what I
19:17 - would say is
19:23 - communication yeah I I I almost I'm
19:26 - almost reluctant to give my answer too
19:28 - but coming from consulting which deoe is
19:32 - a huge consulting firm um it's
19:36 - networking so to my introverts I know I
19:40 - know I know right I'm an extrovert so I
19:43 - get it um but being able maybe under
19:47 - that communication umbrella too to meet
19:49 - other people who may not know what you
19:52 - specialize in to show up to that thing
19:55 - to reach out um networking is actually
19:59 - very very beneficial people tend to like
20:03 - people or excuse me people tend to
20:04 - gravitate towards people like them and
20:08 - getting Beyond just those that do your
20:10 - day in and day
20:12 - out it's really really beneficial to get
20:14 - you know your name out there to
20:16 - understand what's going on I think
20:17 - networking is it's a very very good
20:19 - skill there's a great book too I'll drop
20:21 - it in the chat um it's Captivate but I
20:23 - need to find the entire book and I've
20:26 - recommended it to more than a few of my
20:31 - Ms um great answers I hadn't thought of
20:35 - either of those uh I'm going to cheat a
20:37 - little bit and say like learning new
20:39 - skills is a big skill but to do that I
20:43 - would say that like the fundamentals of
20:45 - computer science can be really really
20:48 - helpful so that's kind of understanding
20:51 - the algorithms and data structures that
20:53 - are being used Underneath It All and
20:55 - like you don't have to reimplement
20:57 - anymore but knowing how they're going to
20:59 - work is still going to be really helpful
21:02 - knowing the sort of fundamentals of how
21:06 - programming languages work and what are
21:08 - some of the differences you see between
21:10 - them so that then you can learn new ones
21:12 - more quickly how code is executed
21:14 - because that stuff is not changing and
21:17 - that's like how you're going to
21:20 - understand how to do the work well in
21:22 - addition to just doing
21:24 - it all right thank you all so much for
21:27 - going on that Journey with me I know
21:29 - it's hard to narrow it down to just one
21:31 - and I don't think that answer is
21:32 - cheating at all amand I think that
21:33 - definitely represents a lot of what
21:34 - we've talked about so far in this panel
21:37 - um all right so thank you all so much
21:38 - for sharing those insights we're going
21:40 - to move on to some questions from the
21:41 - audience so remember audience if you
21:44 - have a question for our panelist you can
21:45 - drop it in the Q&A box at the bottom of
21:47 - your screen uh so first question do you
21:51 - think it's better to have a degree in
21:54 - Tech with the changing landscape as
21:56 - opposed to having non-traditional
22:01 - experience I think so honestly um Tech
22:06 - degrees are just so versatile and like
22:10 - if again like communication can be learn
22:14 - or or you kind of naturally have that uh
22:17 - technical skills it shows you can think
22:19 - critically you can think analytically
22:21 - you can work in groups do group projects
22:23 - you know I I still think personally um I
22:26 - know Amanda and Patrice might have other
22:28 - ideas but personally for me I think Tech
22:31 - degrees are still very
22:35 - advantageous I'm shaking my head because
22:38 - I'm like wow this is a good question we
22:40 - in the industry ask all the time it's
22:43 - not just degrees people also ask about
22:45 - CTS do like and you'll see people say
22:48 - that certifications don't necessarily
22:50 - you know equate to someone's skills and
22:53 - so I will tell you that Tech degrees and
22:56 - certifications make it easy easier for
22:58 - Fortune 500 companies to quickly
23:01 - identify what you're capable of same
23:03 - thing with like your portfolio of work I
23:05 - often will ask somebody to give me you
23:07 - point me to their repo because it just
23:10 - cuts down on me understanding and like
23:12 - quickly seeing what you do and don't
23:14 - know um the whole industry is still kind
23:17 - of young compared to something like
23:19 - legal and medical where they're
23:21 - stringent uh requirements so you will
23:24 - see a path to success even without a
23:27 - degree but each year that we continue to
23:29 - grow I I do see that tightening and
23:32 - gravitating more towards something more
23:34 - substantial especially for these big
23:37 - companies um I think maybe a little bit
23:40 - differently about this I think it
23:42 - depends a lot on what your goals are um
23:46 - there are definitely a lot of companies
23:49 - a lot of those like big tech companies
23:51 - the Fang companies if you know what that
23:53 - means um are very much looking for some
23:57 - kind of computer science degree um or
24:00 - something specific to the work um a lot
24:05 - of startups uh and just other places are
24:09 - less concerned with that formal
24:12 - background um so depending on what your
24:16 - goals are it might really be easier for
24:20 - you be a better strategy to learn some
24:24 - of the basics get a bit of that like
24:27 - GitHub built up or something like have
24:29 - enough to show that you can do the work
24:32 - and then go do the work for those like
24:35 - two to four years instead of doing the
24:39 - the education and then getting into it
24:42 - there are certain skills that are used
24:45 - on many uh software engineering jobs
24:49 - that are not taught at many academic
24:52 - programs and that then people start
24:54 - working and need to learn on the job
24:56 - anyway um that's not 100% um but it's
25:00 - things like doing code reviews and um
25:04 - writing unit tests writing code so that
25:07 - it is communicating what it's doing back
25:10 - to uh K's Point
25:12 - earlier um so it's going to be different
25:17 - for different people and I think that
25:20 - it's certainly like maybe not having um
25:25 - the resources to go to fancy for your
25:28 - program should not prevent anybody from
25:31 - getting into the field there's many ways
25:33 - to do it without that formal training
25:35 - even though I did just say like those
25:38 - fundamentals are important and finding
25:40 - ways to learn them is still a good
25:44 - idea great thank you so much and that
25:46 - actually leads into our next question
25:48 - which is a little bit more about how
25:50 - someone can stand out so that they're
25:52 - not just written off when they're when
25:54 - they don't have a lot of experience or
25:55 - they come from a different
25:56 - non-traditional background ground or
25:58 - they're a career changer so you
26:00 - mentioned Amanda a lot of different
26:01 - things that someone could do to kind of
26:02 - build their experience is there any way
26:04 - someone can kind of showcase that so
26:07 - that they're showing yes I do have some
26:09 - experience or I do have these
26:10 - transferable skills that would apply in
26:12 - this situation how can they stand out if
26:14 - they maybe on paper don't have the
26:16 - background somebody might be looking
26:23 - for I think like Patrice said like she
26:25 - looks at kind of repos stuff like that
26:28 - so reos not won't always have what
26:31 - you've done for like a job in the past
26:34 - but they could be your academic work as
26:37 - well so you could do something like that
26:39 - where you say Hey you know even though I
26:42 - don't have professional experience I
26:44 - have done these types of projects on my
26:46 - own time while also working as I don't
26:50 - know a project manager or something so
26:52 - then I have the organizational skills as
26:55 - well as the coding skills to do that so
26:58 - definitely play up your past experience
27:02 - for professionally like whatever you've
27:04 - done will be transferable like it
27:07 - doesn't matter retail you have to deal
27:09 - with customer service you know working
27:11 - in a restaurant same thing but you know
27:15 - if you want a technical job you do have
27:17 - to show that you know how to be
27:19 - technical so definitely having a repo
27:22 - having some kind of example they can see
27:26 - that you you've done the work work but
27:28 - you're looking for a change so that
27:30 - that's what I would
27:33 - say um I think that um somewhat it's
27:39 - like based on your interests try to get
27:42 - involved in some kind of opportunties
27:44 - while you're still building your skills
27:46 - too so maybe that's volunteering um
27:49 - showing that like you have done this
27:51 - work in different contexts can help in
27:54 - some
27:55 - cases um definitely having some work for
27:58 - somebody to look at can be very helpful
28:01 - um extra bonus if you can find a job
28:04 - where you get to write code in open
28:06 - source so that like that all just
28:08 - happens automatically um but I know
28:11 - that's difficult um and then networking
28:15 - does really help so again you know while
28:18 - you're maybe if you are in an academic
28:20 - program if you're doing internships like
28:23 - try to get one or two new mentors at
28:25 - each internship and keep those
28:26 - relationship as you continue your degree
28:29 - so that by the time you're graduating
28:31 - you have a few people to talk to about
28:32 - it who might be able to connect you with
28:35 - opportunities
28:37 - um and um and then yeah like the
28:40 - volunteering kind of shows your
28:42 - interests and like helps you maybe
28:45 - show
28:46 - relevant um contextual experience to the
28:50 - jobs you might want to be applying for
28:54 - after great thank you all so much now
28:57 - we've talked a lot about networking and
29:00 - communication and the scary things that
29:01 - are also things that are not going away
29:03 - in any industry um and we did give a
29:06 - call out to some of our uh some of our
29:08 - introverts out there who maybe don't
29:10 - love the idea of having to network so
29:12 - we're going to close with this question
29:15 - do you all have any advice for anyone
29:18 - who has impostor syndrome and are
29:20 - apprehensive when trying to network how
29:23 - can someone work around
29:26 - that I would I would say treat it as
29:30 - like an acting role like it's not you
29:34 - it's someone else at least that's how
29:36 - I've seen it sometimes because I
29:38 - definitely I get very nervous on
29:40 - interviews I talk and ramble and use my
29:43 - hands and put my hair so I try to like
29:46 - go into it as like I'm an act it's not
29:49 - myself but I'm portraying someone who's
29:53 - you know really composed and really so
29:57 - smart and so just put together you know
30:00 - even if you're not feeling that if you
30:03 - can just pretend for the 30 minute
30:05 - interview that at least that helps me
30:07 - get through it like put your mindset in
30:09 - a in in that kind of situation where
30:12 - you're like this is not me this is
30:14 - someone who's cool and calm and
30:16 - collected you know like I would that's
30:19 - that's what's helped me I don't know if
30:20 - it works for everyone but that's what's
30:22 - helped me in the past with
30:24 - interviews yeah impostor syndrome is
30:27 - there even for the most
30:29 - experienced right again another good
30:32 - conversation that happens for those that
30:33 - are 10 15 20 plus years wondering if hey
30:38 - is this or or is someone going to find
30:40 - out that I don't know everything about
30:43 - this um industry it's Tech you don't
30:47 - know everything about this industry
30:49 - neither does the person next to you but
30:51 - in your own right you're smart you're
30:53 - learning you're hungry you are engaged
30:56 - so I I would say that you know don't be
30:59 - surprised if others feel the same way
31:01 - have that empathy but keep going keep
31:05 - going yeah I think one of the best um
31:10 - remedies for impostor syndrome is just
31:14 - talking about it and asking questions um
31:16 - especially early in your career nobody
31:18 - expects you to know everything to start
31:21 - so um and asking questions is a great
31:25 - way to build your knowledge and build
31:27 - your skills on the job it's also
31:30 - fundamentally what mentorship is all
31:31 - about so having a mentor like building
31:34 - Mentor relationships it actually works
31:37 - best if you can come to that like the C
31:40 - call the email whatever it is you're
31:42 - doing to try to me people come to it
31:45 - with a couple of like questions in mind
31:47 - with some things that you want to learn
31:49 - from them um and that's really that is
31:52 - what it's all about right so and it's
31:54 - it's constant learning anyway so always
31:56 - be willing to just push through that
31:59 - fear and just ask the question and
32:01 - you'll see sometimes they don't know
32:03 - either and they'll help you find an
32:04 - answer and that can be really like
32:07 - validating right to show none of us know
32:12 - everything um and sometimes they'll know
32:14 - and they'll be happy to share
32:17 - right love it another great quote none
32:20 - of us know everything definitely
32:22 - something to keep in mind always we're
32:24 - going to go ahead and wrap up our
32:25 - discussion but espe conversation with
32:28 - two girls who Cod alumni will take place
32:29 - later this afternoon at 2:45 p.m. you
32:32 - can find the link in the auditorium now
32:35 - please join me in thanking our panelists
32:36 - for dedicating their time and expertise
32:38 - to our conversation Patrice Kira Amanda
32:42 - thank you all so much and have a
32:44 - wonderful day thank you thanks for
32:47 - having us thank you so
32:53 - much

Cleaned transcript:

good afternoon everyone thank you so much for joining us for our panel on navigating the evolving landscape of tech my name is mar marcoo I use she her pronouns and I'm the manager of content and instructional design at girls who code today we have an incredible lineup of speakers who will discuss how current trends in Tech are shaping the industry in just a moment I'll introduce you to our panelists if you have a question for them you can drop it in the Q&A box at the bottom of your window as we will have some time for audience Q&A also please note that close captioning is enabled if you would like subtitles you can click on the live transcript show subtitle button at the bottom of your window to turn them on okay now that Logistics are out of the way I'm excited to introduce you to our panelists first up we have Patrice Drake Patrice is a distinguished cyber security expert with 15 plus years of experience in technology cyber security and business Consulting as a proactive leader Patrice has been instrumental in innovating cyber security strategies executing security operations and contributing to significant industry reports such as combating ransomware a comprehensive framework for Action Patrice a proud resident of the Washington DC area combines the energy of the city with the Quiet worlds of video games and fictional books welcome Patrice thank you next we have Kira Masters Kira received her BS in mathematics with minors in mechanical engineering and chemistry from the University of Denver she has been with Accenture for almost nine years where she is currently a data science manager Kira has worked on multiple projects mainly in the health care space involving machine learning Predictive Analytics propensity modeling optimization demand forecasting cross Channel analytics and customer segmentation when not at work Kira loves taking her three kids to explore the City of Austin welcome Kira thanks everyone our third panelist is Amanda Robinson Amanda began her career as a software engineer in 2010 she has previous experience with big Tech as well as startup work and has been in the public interest technology space since 2015 when she joined 18f she is currently a fellow experienced supervisor at us digital Corps where she helps early career software nav and software Engineers navigate their work in the federal technology space welcome Amanda thank you so much good to be here and thank you all for being here so let's let's go ahead and jump right into our discussion first set of questions is going to be a little bit about merging Technologies so how would you describe the current landscape of tech and how are emerging emerging Technologies impacting job opportunities okay sorry goad I didn't know if it was to someone specifically you can go ahead Patrice yeah so my focus on on cyber security really gives me a unique perspective of how this emerging Technologies such as Ai and machine learning things within cyber security itself that affected like ransomware and of course I think there is another one such as Cloud which has been there but is really making a um a big impact on the way that businesses like mine deoe um shifts and does its strategy so I really do see that things things that are business focus or these companies that you're partnering with or thinking about as you move into your career um these emerging Technologies are what we're looking at too and these three at least are big for for us here over deoe there was a second part of the question and I need to also adjust my camera it's getting fuzzy for some reason everybody I apologize was there a second part of that as well uh how do you how would you C and how are emerging Technologies impacting job opportunities ah yes so we see a huge demand for technical skills here um starts all the way down at the participants level right we definitely like to partner with those that are early in their career um seeking out like Talent that's um either on campuses or like I said shifting into Tech so we're at a bit of an underemployment for Tech the technical industry at large um so we do see a rise in the demand for those skill sets a need for that skill set and really competition for you know those that are here on the webinar absolutely thanks so much Patrice K I know you you had something I mean it's pretty similar to Patrice because deoy and Accenture are both consulting firms um I know when when I graduated like data science wasn't really big and so just getting into that you know growing your skills you can start from anywhere really and just build up your skill set as you go like I didn't take any python or R coding the only thing that was offered at my college was Java at the time so that was not great for what I do now you know and so it just kind of shows you the ever evolving landscape you know I've been with Accenture nine years and it's changed so much I have to know you know I've learned six different programming languages on my own just to keep up and that's really kind of what you want to focus on is just keep building building your skill set you know and um technical skills are so valuable so useful to um inside and outside of wherever you work you know it's just analytical thinking critical thinking um strategizing honestly and I think kind of navigating those Waters is is great tool for for anybody um the jobs we've definitely seen gone up generative AI with Chad GPT coming out like you're going to see t tons of spaces now opening up job markets to anyone with generative AI prompt engineering um learning how to do foundational models and building up from there uh definitely has changed the market we're investing so much money just in generative Ai and in our employees who know that kind of um technology so definitely change changes all the time so definitely be keeping on your toes uh I would definitely Echo that as well I think the the biggest constant in this field is change there's always new languages always new Frameworks and Technologies um so yeah being able to go with that flow to learn those languages um I see the comment that it's amazing to teach oneself six languages on your own which it is but also I think like probably all of us have learned a new language for a new job or a new project at some point in our careers um and that just becomes one of the skills is just knowing enough about um what the overall differences and similarities are to be able to learn those things and I think the creative problem solving stays the same throughout and that's what I think is the fun part um and what is like really the heart of what I would say is uh software engineering at the very least I think data science does get very analytical as well oh thank you all so much and am and I really appreciate that phrase uh the biggest constant is change right those two things don't sound like they belong in the same sentence but they most certainly do especially in this industry uh let's move on to our next question and again anyone can jump into answer um what emerging Technologies do you think will have the biggest impact on job opportunities in the tech industry in the next few years so AI was a good example we've definitely already touched upon that um other things like cyber security machine learning what are some of the technologies that are going to have that big impact uh so I would definitely say AI is a huge one it's also very much in the news right now so a lot of people are thinking about it talking about it um so it's very of the moment um there's just an executive order on AI uh that mentions digital core as a way to hire um Ai and AI enabling um Talent into the federal space but also uh similar to other previous changes I think that it'll shift the shape of work but not fundamentally change it um some things will get automated in the way some things have previously been automated at by all of our uh idees and everything um some of the work will become standing up these uh large language models and other sorts of um AI tools and but there will still be I think that creative problem solving is not something that AI has solved or I would guess is close to solving um others may have better information on that than I do I'm not following that closely that field but um but yeah I think it's it's just a different um a slightly different Focus but a lot of the same fundamental work yeah that's a fantastic answer um I I want to also kind of add to that I know we talked about AI but it is massive right um I I made I think a comment on LinkedIn where I said a lot of people are afraid in our industry in Tech of being replaced by Ai and what I really see is a more credible threat of I don't think you'll be replaced by AI so much as you'll be replaced by someone that's using AI to do the same work you do um so right I mean embracing artificial intelligence adopting it and really augmenting it where it makes sense is crucial coming in to Tech and realizing that most people are um not as well versed as some of the data scientists that are out there that have been dealing with this for a while put you on a pretty Level Playing Field and I want to make one more comment too that I wanted to add or add for the emerging um uh Tech landscape so I'm here in Washington DC deoy one of the three hubs where we do cyber security you'll see behind me there aren't a lot of people because remote work is also having a huge impact on the tech industry so you better believe we're working and we're delivering services in Tech but we're not necessarily doing it from offices anymore so that's that's a huge impact on the landscape as well um but yeah fantastic answers yeah and I want to like just Echo Amanda and Patrice like excellent answers and uh AI just is a huge range range of employment like it is not just one specific thing like there are multiple different positions multiple different uses so when we say AI it's not like pigeon holding you to any one specific task and like we always get those fears of new emerging technology like when cars were invented they were like oh my gosh it's taking away jobs from Carriage people you know like it's so silly you know that we think we still think like that even though over like we have such a record over time of how technology innovation has actually improved our job opportunities our landscape our economy like all of that and it has just created new jobs like when I was in college data science wasn't a job and now it's a degree you can get in college in MERS you know like there's tons of opportunities and there will be tons of new opportunities so even though we will use Ai and it might replace some jobs jobs it will create new jobs so I wouldn't be too worried about it like erasing jobs you'll just have to change with the technology absolutely we definitely just have to lean in instead of shying away when we know that this is something that's not going to go away anytime soon um all right we're going to shift gears a little bit and talk a little bit about upskilling and transferable skills so something that we've kind of touched upon a couple of times and gone around um how do you all think that individuals prepare for the opportunities and adapt their skill sets accordingly so you've talked about how things are constantly changing what are some things that people can do to prepare themselves for change I would just get wellversed you know like on what you want to do you know um study up on it talk to people in those Industries networking is your main thing that you need to do is network network network like reach out to people don't be afraid to go on LinkedIn reach out and say hey I'm really interested in what you do can we can we talk about it how did you get started because everyone's story is so different you know you can see people that didn't get Tech degrees are now in tech jobs or vice versa you know like how did that happen how can you make that transition what kind of courses can you take to upscale kind of thing so that's what I I would say yeah I'm a big fan too of um getting involved with organizations communities I mean you found your way to girls who code webinars I like following certain content creators too um both on Tik Tok LinkedIn um there's a lot of good PL people in the space again I specialize in cyber security so really staying in touch with your cohorts and peers is huge because you get to see what they care about and a lot of times especially content creators will um we'll talk about the things that the industry cares about right they'll be in Cutting Edge conversations or playing with that new tech or seeing how people are thinking about that so if that's what I did at the beginning of my career it was a little bit different because of course content creation wasn't as huge and content creator wasn't as huge but still like just staying involved in certain groups associations was was a really good thing as well too to keep up with everything yeah that's those were um great answers I definitely want to Echo like keep on learning new things don't be afraid of trying something new when you change projects or jobs just because a team is um is using a language that you haven't used before that is often expected um in the industry you will start a new job and have to pick up Python and people will help you with it and they'll be patient about that because that's just the way it actually works um so like go and try those new languages try to learn new things all the time take advantage of those programs if your job has them where they'll cover the cost of going to a conference or of taking a class or something um and I think um I think that like one of those things you do see with that like automation of pieces of a job um that we're see starting to see AI contribute to is that it gets rid of a lot of the like sort of mindless boilerplate part of the work and that means you can focus more on the like more deep thinking pieces of software engineering and I would say like between that and the Very remote um heavy job uh cultures and Landscapes that we have now try to be very mindful of your mental health as well and of how you are taking breaks and how you are getting a mix of like that really deep thinking that you will be doing a lot of and something else because I think um doing 40 hours a week of coding when sometimes what you're doing is you know creating all that like boilerplate you need to do for new Java class or writing out the unit tests now your IDE can just write some of your unit tests for you and you need to know what mistakes it might make and what to look for but um yeah like 40 hours of just deep thinking is a lot for a week so figure out how to find that New Balance now that like some of the old balance is going away absolutely and throughout this piece of the conversation we've mentioned a lot of different transferable skills so before we dive into um some audience questions I'd love to ask you all one more question to think about and I'll ask each one of you to answer so if in thinking about those transferable skills if you had to narrow it down to one specific transferable skill that you think job Seekers should leverage the most for longterm Career Success in this industry what do you think it would be so one big transferable skill that you think is like the most important and I'm gonna ask each one of you honestly it's it's not Teck it's communication honestly like for me uh just being able to communicate what you're doing like how you're doing it everything communicating with people uh I think that is the biggest skill to have you know because you could be Tech savy all day but if you can't explain your work or have an understanding um of how to like visualize it for someone else to understand who's not tech savvy like you're not going to just hand someone an Excel spreadsheet and be like here are the results like no like you have to be able to communicate and so that's what I would say is communication yeah I I I almost I'm almost reluctant to give my answer too but coming from consulting which deoe is a huge consulting firm um it's networking so to my introverts I know I know I know right I'm an extrovert so I get it um but being able maybe under that communication umbrella too to meet other people who may not know what you specialize in to show up to that thing to reach out um networking is actually very very beneficial people tend to like people or excuse me people tend to gravitate towards people like them and getting Beyond just those that do your day in and day out it's really really beneficial to get you know your name out there to understand what's going on I think networking is it's a very very good skill there's a great book too I'll drop it in the chat um it's Captivate but I need to find the entire book and I've recommended it to more than a few of my Ms um great answers I hadn't thought of either of those uh I'm going to cheat a little bit and say like learning new skills is a big skill but to do that I would say that like the fundamentals of computer science can be really really helpful so that's kind of understanding the algorithms and data structures that are being used Underneath It All and like you don't have to reimplement anymore but knowing how they're going to work is still going to be really helpful knowing the sort of fundamentals of how programming languages work and what are some of the differences you see between them so that then you can learn new ones more quickly how code is executed because that stuff is not changing and that's like how you're going to understand how to do the work well in addition to just doing it all right thank you all so much for going on that Journey with me I know it's hard to narrow it down to just one and I don't think that answer is cheating at all amand I think that definitely represents a lot of what we've talked about so far in this panel um all right so thank you all so much for sharing those insights we're going to move on to some questions from the audience so remember audience if you have a question for our panelist you can drop it in the Q&A box at the bottom of your screen uh so first question do you think it's better to have a degree in Tech with the changing landscape as opposed to having nontraditional experience I think so honestly um Tech degrees are just so versatile and like if again like communication can be learn or or you kind of naturally have that uh technical skills it shows you can think critically you can think analytically you can work in groups do group projects you know I I still think personally um I know Amanda and Patrice might have other ideas but personally for me I think Tech degrees are still very advantageous I'm shaking my head because I'm like wow this is a good question we in the industry ask all the time it's not just degrees people also ask about CTS do like and you'll see people say that certifications don't necessarily you know equate to someone's skills and so I will tell you that Tech degrees and certifications make it easy easier for Fortune 500 companies to quickly identify what you're capable of same thing with like your portfolio of work I often will ask somebody to give me you point me to their repo because it just cuts down on me understanding and like quickly seeing what you do and don't know um the whole industry is still kind of young compared to something like legal and medical where they're stringent uh requirements so you will see a path to success even without a degree but each year that we continue to grow I I do see that tightening and gravitating more towards something more substantial especially for these big companies um I think maybe a little bit differently about this I think it depends a lot on what your goals are um there are definitely a lot of companies a lot of those like big tech companies the Fang companies if you know what that means um are very much looking for some kind of computer science degree um or something specific to the work um a lot of startups uh and just other places are less concerned with that formal background um so depending on what your goals are it might really be easier for you be a better strategy to learn some of the basics get a bit of that like GitHub built up or something like have enough to show that you can do the work and then go do the work for those like two to four years instead of doing the the education and then getting into it there are certain skills that are used on many uh software engineering jobs that are not taught at many academic programs and that then people start working and need to learn on the job anyway um that's not 100% um but it's things like doing code reviews and um writing unit tests writing code so that it is communicating what it's doing back to uh K's Point earlier um so it's going to be different for different people and I think that it's certainly like maybe not having um the resources to go to fancy for your program should not prevent anybody from getting into the field there's many ways to do it without that formal training even though I did just say like those fundamentals are important and finding ways to learn them is still a good idea great thank you so much and that actually leads into our next question which is a little bit more about how someone can stand out so that they're not just written off when they're when they don't have a lot of experience or they come from a different nontraditional background ground or they're a career changer so you mentioned Amanda a lot of different things that someone could do to kind of build their experience is there any way someone can kind of showcase that so that they're showing yes I do have some experience or I do have these transferable skills that would apply in this situation how can they stand out if they maybe on paper don't have the background somebody might be looking for I think like Patrice said like she looks at kind of repos stuff like that so reos not won't always have what you've done for like a job in the past but they could be your academic work as well so you could do something like that where you say Hey you know even though I don't have professional experience I have done these types of projects on my own time while also working as I don't know a project manager or something so then I have the organizational skills as well as the coding skills to do that so definitely play up your past experience for professionally like whatever you've done will be transferable like it doesn't matter retail you have to deal with customer service you know working in a restaurant same thing but you know if you want a technical job you do have to show that you know how to be technical so definitely having a repo having some kind of example they can see that you you've done the work work but you're looking for a change so that that's what I would say um I think that um somewhat it's like based on your interests try to get involved in some kind of opportunties while you're still building your skills too so maybe that's volunteering um showing that like you have done this work in different contexts can help in some cases um definitely having some work for somebody to look at can be very helpful um extra bonus if you can find a job where you get to write code in open source so that like that all just happens automatically um but I know that's difficult um and then networking does really help so again you know while you're maybe if you are in an academic program if you're doing internships like try to get one or two new mentors at each internship and keep those relationship as you continue your degree so that by the time you're graduating you have a few people to talk to about it who might be able to connect you with opportunities um and um and then yeah like the volunteering kind of shows your interests and like helps you maybe show relevant um contextual experience to the jobs you might want to be applying for after great thank you all so much now we've talked a lot about networking and communication and the scary things that are also things that are not going away in any industry um and we did give a call out to some of our uh some of our introverts out there who maybe don't love the idea of having to network so we're going to close with this question do you all have any advice for anyone who has impostor syndrome and are apprehensive when trying to network how can someone work around that I would I would say treat it as like an acting role like it's not you it's someone else at least that's how I've seen it sometimes because I definitely I get very nervous on interviews I talk and ramble and use my hands and put my hair so I try to like go into it as like I'm an act it's not myself but I'm portraying someone who's you know really composed and really so smart and so just put together you know even if you're not feeling that if you can just pretend for the 30 minute interview that at least that helps me get through it like put your mindset in a in in that kind of situation where you're like this is not me this is someone who's cool and calm and collected you know like I would that's that's what's helped me I don't know if it works for everyone but that's what's helped me in the past with interviews yeah impostor syndrome is there even for the most experienced right again another good conversation that happens for those that are 10 15 20 plus years wondering if hey is this or or is someone going to find out that I don't know everything about this um industry it's Tech you don't know everything about this industry neither does the person next to you but in your own right you're smart you're learning you're hungry you are engaged so I I would say that you know don't be surprised if others feel the same way have that empathy but keep going keep going yeah I think one of the best um remedies for impostor syndrome is just talking about it and asking questions um especially early in your career nobody expects you to know everything to start so um and asking questions is a great way to build your knowledge and build your skills on the job it's also fundamentally what mentorship is all about so having a mentor like building Mentor relationships it actually works best if you can come to that like the C call the email whatever it is you're doing to try to me people come to it with a couple of like questions in mind with some things that you want to learn from them um and that's really that is what it's all about right so and it's it's constant learning anyway so always be willing to just push through that fear and just ask the question and you'll see sometimes they don't know either and they'll help you find an answer and that can be really like validating right to show none of us know everything um and sometimes they'll know and they'll be happy to share right love it another great quote none of us know everything definitely something to keep in mind always we're going to go ahead and wrap up our discussion but espe conversation with two girls who Cod alumni will take place later this afternoon at 245 p.m. you can find the link in the auditorium now please join me in thanking our panelists for dedicating their time and expertise to our conversation Patrice Kira Amanda thank you all so much and have a wonderful day thank you thanks for having us thank you so much
