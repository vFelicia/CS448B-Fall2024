03:56 - great
03:56 - first of all thanks for having me i'm so
03:58 - happy to be here and spend
04:00 - my evening i'm based in new york city
04:02 - with you guys um so thanks for having me
04:05 - um for the icebreaker question what do i
04:08 - enjoy most about
04:09 - my job um i think it's really the people
04:12 - interaction
04:13 - i never thought i would venture into hr
04:16 - i have a marketing background
04:18 - um i decided to dip into hr because
04:20 - quite honestly
04:21 - um it paid the most and out of school i
04:24 - was
04:25 - coming out with a lot of college debt so
04:27 - i took the first job that
04:28 - that paid the most but going in hr and
04:31 - using my marketing skills
04:33 - around consumer behavior i think the
04:36 - people interaction engaging with our
04:37 - tech employees is always phenomenal
04:39 - um it's you know it's really a joy and a
04:42 - pleasure to recruit and
04:43 - on board um our employees engage with
04:46 - them
04:46 - talking about the full talent life cycle
04:49 - um
04:49 - you know whether it was that mastercard
04:51 - or even at fox today but
04:52 - um i think that's probably my answer for
04:55 - you
04:58 - thank you and linda great hi
05:01 - good evening um i'm actually located in
05:04 - northern virginia
05:05 - centerville so for me
05:08 - talent i've always been interested in
05:10 - talent you know from early on
05:12 - working for a temporary staffing agency
05:17 - i then got involved in more of the
05:19 - recruiting getting to know the
05:20 - candidates and loved making the matches
05:24 - for me now working for deloitte you know
05:27 - meeting with the candidates
05:29 - working with the leaders setting up the
05:30 - interviews and then
05:32 - you know seeing seeing them in the
05:34 - office when we were in the office so
05:36 - it's that full life cycle
05:37 - helping getting to know what's important
05:41 - to the candidate and you know bringing
05:44 - them on board
05:48 - nice thank you for sharing that and
05:49 - definitely see the alignment between the
05:52 - both of you
05:53 - and your focus on candidate experience
05:55 - and really making sure that folks
05:57 - not just have a great experience while
05:58 - they're interviewing but especially once
06:00 - they join the company
06:04 - and again viewers definitely stay tuned
06:07 - for your own question
06:08 - of your own that's going to be popping
06:10 - up on your screen
06:12 - uh with with that that question is what
06:14 - excites you most
06:16 - about your future career in tech
06:19 - so really excited to hear some of your
06:21 - thoughts and what comes up from there
06:29 - for natasha and linda a sizable portion
06:32 - of our viewers are rising college
06:34 - students and a lot of the questions we
06:36 - received for them
06:38 - was around ways to prepare for their
06:39 - professional careers now
06:42 - they may know they love coding but
06:44 - aren't entirely sure what's available to
06:46 - them
06:47 - so our first group question is
06:49 - specifically for this group of viewers
06:53 - prior to entering college what were some
06:55 - of the steps and valuable resources
06:57 - that would help high school age students
07:00 - explore different career paths
07:01 - in tech linda what are your thoughts
07:05 - for me i think there's a there's a lot
07:08 - of things that you can do
07:10 - either through your local community
07:12 - college or campus
07:13 - whatever's nearby there are events that
07:16 - you could attend
07:17 - there's a lot on like linkedin just
07:20 - doing your research
07:21 - even youtube reading articles
07:24 - even googling even in in my in my role
07:28 - if i don't know something i mean just
07:30 - google it and then you can just learn so
07:32 - much more
07:33 - about you know what what you're thinking
07:35 - might interest you
07:40 - nice thank you how about you natasha
07:43 - yeah i am
07:44 - you know i echo what what linda is
07:46 - saying too i think
07:48 - leveraging google leveraging the assets
07:50 - available to you virtually
07:52 - um i know you know wasn't as
07:55 - readily available for some coming out of
07:58 - high school but i think
07:59 - it's just grown much more popular
08:01 - nowadays mashable is actually a really
08:03 - cool site i'm sure most of you
08:05 - are on it or check it out but sometimes
08:07 - they do have job
08:08 - blogs that actually i sometimes go on
08:10 - just to see if there's anybody
08:12 - cool that we might want to recruit from
08:13 - a tech perspective
08:15 - um definitely check that out the other
08:17 - thing i would say too
08:19 - coming out of high school we there are
08:21 - some companies you kind of have to dig a
08:23 - little bit but there are some companies
08:24 - that offer internship programs for high
08:26 - school students
08:28 - and it doesn't hurt to try something
08:30 - different if you're into coding but you
08:32 - want to switch careers and want to do
08:34 - something more on the engineering side
08:36 - or devops or something on the
08:37 - application front
08:39 - um i look and dig again echoing linda go
08:43 - on google
08:44 - find those internships i know i had
08:46 - worked at a company called terrex
08:48 - corporation in connecticut
08:50 - they love they do a high school intern
08:52 - program and they do a little bit of a
08:54 - soft rotation
08:55 - so that's one example i know some of you
08:57 - aren't local to the connecticut market
08:58 - but
08:59 - um definitely do some digging and
09:00 - research
09:04 - thank you both especially for the the
09:06 - tangible tools there
09:08 - and i know our viewers you had an
09:10 - opportunity to also chime in on what
09:12 - excites you about your future career
09:15 - in tech so if you're curious just as i
09:18 - was
09:18 - about 54 of you said solving
09:22 - problems using technology and 40
09:25 - mention learning new technologies so
09:28 - hopefully you gain so much more insight
09:32 - with with what excites you about your
09:34 - future career in technology
09:38 - now that we have a greater sense and
09:39 - understanding of what can be done to
09:41 - learn about career paths
09:44 - this question is specifically for our
09:45 - alumni who have been looking at
09:47 - professional opportunities um
09:50 - from for example from software engineer
09:52 - to ux designers
09:54 - we see roles posted on the girls who
09:56 - girls who code
09:57 - hire me and linkedin but what do these
10:00 - jobs entail
10:02 - for the viewers who specifically asked
10:04 - for information around what it means to
10:06 - be in these certain career roles or
10:08 - opportunities this question is for you
10:13 - but first audience members we definitely
10:15 - want an
10:16 - opportunity to hear again from you so
10:18 - complete the poll
10:19 - and inform us on this question
10:23 - do you already know what your dream job
10:25 - is or do you need assistance figuring it
10:30 - out
10:44 - perfect um so as those results come in
10:48 - linda and natasha we're interested in
10:51 - hearing from you
10:53 - what questions should job seekers ask to
10:56 - help them stand out
10:58 - what questions are taboo let's start
11:00 - with you linda
11:02 - what questions um good questions
11:06 - uh you do your research on the company
11:09 - um and i would ask more open-ended
11:12 - questions you know tell me more about
11:14 - the role tell me what you are looking
11:16 - for
11:17 - um in in finding you know the applicant
11:22 - things to stay away from um
11:26 - i would stay away from compensation or
11:28 - benefits
11:29 - um depending on who you're talking to
11:32 - they may
11:33 - they may not know the answer um
11:36 - in my role those types of conversations
11:39 - stay in talent
11:40 - and when you're talking with a hiring
11:42 - manager they're more
11:44 - around you know the actual role
11:46 - responsibilities the duties you know
11:48 - what
11:48 - what we're looking for in this
11:50 - individual and
11:51 - um another good question you know how
11:54 - you can add
11:55 - impact to what they're looking for and
11:58 - really kind of um
12:00 - you know i'm not you know see yourself
12:01 - in the role and just ask more
12:03 - ask ask a lot ask questions show
12:05 - interest i think it just goes a long way
12:12 - nice thank you natasha yeah um
12:15 - completely agree i am while i'm not a
12:18 - full-time recruiter in my job i do work
12:20 - very close with recruitment
12:22 - and i do um i also interview at the
12:25 - director level plus just from a culture
12:27 - fit because they are
12:28 - typically managing people at fox but
12:30 - some of my favorite questions
12:32 - um i'll start there is when candidates
12:34 - ask things like
12:36 - you know what does success look like for
12:38 - this role in the next six months
12:40 - um what are some challenges that you
12:41 - guys are facing now
12:43 - that i could or the potential candidate
12:45 - could help alleviate
12:46 - i think it shows initiative to to
12:48 - linda's point um
12:50 - and you know i think it really helps
12:51 - bridge the gap and also for
12:53 - hiring managers to hear that
12:54 - specifically all
12:56 - always kind of makes them feel like wow
12:58 - this person is already ready to take
13:00 - some work off of my plate which goes a
13:02 - long way
13:03 - um so i think those are probably my top
13:06 - two favorite
13:07 - questions curiosity is key to linda's
13:09 - point ask a ton of questions
13:11 - um but don't definitely open-ended right
13:14 - um you don't want it to just go to yes
13:15 - and no
13:16 - and then questions to refrain from
13:18 - that's actually pretty interesting i
13:20 - agree on the comp front
13:21 - um i also think coming out of school you
13:24 - don't want to come off
13:25 - too money hungry compensation is
13:28 - important
13:29 - and one thing i do want to stress is you
13:32 - know while maybe the facebooks and the
13:33 - netflix
13:34 - might be a little bit higher on base and
13:36 - bonus always look at the full package
13:38 - yes um while some companies may not be
13:41 - able to go as high
13:42 - on base and bonus immediately um they do
13:45 - offer things like
13:46 - educational assistance if you want to
13:48 - further your education
13:50 - benefits programs um always look about
13:53 - that full that full spectrum but keep
13:55 - reserve those questions for
13:56 - recruitment or the hr person you'll be
13:59 - connecting with as it relates to comp
14:02 - yep
14:05 - thank you for that um that's really
14:08 - really helpful to hear
14:10 - and with our poll question that we asked
14:13 - it was
14:13 - how many of you actually know what your
14:15 - dream job is or do you still need
14:17 - assistance figuring out we actually got
14:20 - 60 68 percent of viewers said no they do
14:24 - not know what their
14:25 - dream job is and that is very
14:29 - very normal you're not alone especially
14:31 - where you are
14:32 - in your education and in your experience
14:36 - a follow-up question is
14:40 - outside of software engineer roles what
14:42 - are some other
14:43 - job titles for those majoring in compsci
14:47 - that they can qualify are qualify for
14:50 - and what are the associated
14:51 - responsibilities
14:52 - would either of you linda or natasha be
14:55 - able to speak towards that question i
14:57 - can go first if you want
14:58 - sure yeah um so some i'll
15:02 - tell you some of the hot jobs i'm seeing
15:03 - today especially within media tech
15:07 - cyber security is always really hot
15:09 - especially right now we're obviously
15:11 - preparing for the elections um coming up
15:13 - so that's definitely a hot market
15:15 - but we're always looking for automation
15:17 - engineers people who are actually
15:19 - passionate about the cyberspace so
15:21 - that's that's one area
15:23 - data science is super hot as well
15:26 - app development either back-end
15:28 - engineers or front-end developers
15:30 - are always critical too we are hiring
15:32 - for a lot of roku
15:34 - and android developers engineering
15:37 - experience
15:37 - is cool but it's not needed i think the
15:40 - biggest thing for us
15:41 - is just making sure you have an appetite
15:43 - for the position especially if it's more
15:44 - entry level
15:46 - um i'd say that's probably what i'm
15:48 - seeing is what's hot right now
15:54 - nice thank you i can add to that
15:58 - you know i'm with a consulting firm and
16:00 - we are hiring
16:02 - this background as well you know we
16:04 - support our clients
16:06 - both on the commercial and the
16:07 - government side so it's
16:09 - cyber security the data science
16:12 - um front end back end developers devops
16:15 - is hot
16:16 - um so there's you know
16:19 - i feel it's just it's growing
16:23 - you know just tapping into so many
16:24 - different markets
16:28 - that's definitely helpful helpfully here
16:31 - especially with
16:32 - covid pandemic and how it hit the job
16:34 - market
16:35 - so many markets were were affected
16:37 - especially
16:39 - across the board and the tech industry
16:41 - is growing and transitioning and really
16:43 - adapting
16:44 - so that's helpful to know as our alumni
16:46 - who may be new graduates are looking for
16:48 - future opportunities in the tech space
16:54 - with that we're also interested
16:57 - in as we ask a bit more about what are
17:00 - those skill sets for those types of
17:02 - roles
17:04 - out of curiosity
17:07 - what are some of the basic skill
17:08 - requirements needed for
17:10 - internships or entry-level jobs in terms
17:13 - of coding languages years of experience
17:15 - types of projects etc uh natasha can you
17:18 - kick us off there
17:21 - yeah for for our intern programs um
17:24 - it's you know we understand going in
17:26 - that
17:27 - there won't probably be a lot of years
17:29 - of tangible experience on your resume
17:31 - and that's okay
17:33 - it's not always needed we do have an mba
17:36 - internship program too that requires at
17:38 - least a year out in the field somewhere
17:41 - but for our our basic college internship
17:44 - program
17:45 - it's really just the interest in
17:46 - studying in that field the thought is
17:48 - that you know whether it's zero to one
17:50 - we're not we're not
17:52 - too high up on making sure that you come
17:55 - out with five years of experience
17:56 - otherwise we'd hire a full-time employee
17:59 - um so the internship we're a little bit
18:00 - more relaxed on um
18:02 - i would say top three things is your
18:05 - major
18:05 - um you know if you're majoring in
18:08 - communications but
18:09 - you're going for a cyber internship
18:13 - you may not get the full foot in the
18:15 - door we might look at your resume
18:16 - depending on what your interests are and
18:18 - have a conversation with you
18:20 - i will say in speaking to some of our
18:22 - hiring managers on the floors
18:24 - hiring for interns i think they're
18:26 - always just looking especially on the
18:28 - internship level
18:29 - for pure interest it's it's really
18:31 - having a passion about the space
18:33 - our managers are really good at training
18:35 - and shadowing allowing you to shadow so
18:37 - you learn a lot
18:38 - um coming in from an internship but
18:41 - again from an experience perspective
18:43 - we're not requiring a ton
18:49 - i echo the same you know they're not
18:52 - look
18:52 - we're not looking at the experience it
18:55 - is the interest
18:56 - um and
19:00 - the academic you know background they
19:03 - will look at technical skills but again
19:05 - at a very junior level
19:07 - i mean they're not expecting you know
19:09 - years and years
19:10 - of experience a lot of it is um
19:14 - coming in to really see if you if you
19:16 - enjoy this type of work
19:18 - a lot of it is you know could be
19:20 - shadowing or
19:21 - um having that kind of that visibility a
19:25 - six week program
19:30 - so i hope that helps no that really does
19:34 - help in hearing your experience and
19:36 - typically what you look for and
19:40 - what some of these some of these
19:42 - questions are some of these responses
19:43 - that you're having related to
19:46 - opportunities out of curiosity where can
19:49 - alumni learn more in detail about the
19:51 - titles you just mentioned
19:53 - such as cyber security etc
19:57 - um i would say just to kick it off uh
20:00 - google definitely google it you can
20:02 - always go to fox careers if you're
20:04 - interested in a
20:05 - in a job with fox all of our jobs are
20:07 - posted
20:08 - in real time um i think we do have a
20:11 - section
20:11 - tailored to more of the entry level
20:13 - positions too
20:14 - um so definitely check that out most
20:17 - companies i
20:18 - you know if you're passionate about the
20:19 - brand of a company
20:21 - um i know mastercard does a really good
20:23 - job at that too definitely look at the
20:25 - company's site
20:26 - but linkedin is great to look through
20:28 - indeed is an amazing tool to look
20:30 - through
20:31 - um actually one cool um
20:35 - one cool site that i just came across
20:38 - it's actually a compensation site
20:40 - it's called levels.fyi um and they
20:43 - actually break down
20:45 - real compensation data similar to a
20:47 - glass store but from companies like
20:49 - google and microsoft
20:51 - facebook netflix is up there uh check
20:53 - them out because they also have
20:55 - a lot of repetitive job titles that you
20:58 - might be interested in so you might get
20:59 - a sense of what
21:00 - you might want to get into
21:05 - and i don't get anything yep same check
21:08 - out deloitte's career site
21:10 - google it um a lot of times you know i
21:13 - have found
21:13 - just being in this space a title could
21:17 - be different
21:17 - from just maybe a company has their own
21:19 - leveling
21:21 - just using deloitte as an example you
21:23 - know we have consultants
21:25 - and it could mean a variety of different
21:28 - responsibilities you could be a data
21:30 - science but you come in the firm and
21:32 - you're a consultant
21:33 - so maybe google
21:36 - you know it could be i'll just take data
21:38 - science as an example you know you like
21:40 - python
21:41 - and then you could see
21:44 - different titles that do come up that
21:46 - could be of interest so read more of the
21:48 - description
21:49 - responsibilities um there
21:52 - i think it just could allow open up
21:55 - other opportunities
21:56 - and not just you know maybe the the
21:58 - three or four that are maybe most common
22:00 - in the market
22:04 - that's so true especially in the tech
22:06 - space like titles can vary you can be a
22:08 - solution
22:08 - consultant or solutions engineer or
22:11 - technical account manager
22:13 - all of those titles are very similar
22:15 - right so it definitely helps to
22:17 - focus on the skills as you're looking at
22:19 - those job descriptions
22:22 - uh another question we have is does the
22:26 - college i receive my diploma from
22:28 - determine
22:30 - much job uh which job opportunities will
22:32 - be available to me and how much i can
22:34 - request for my salary
22:36 - let's start with you linda um
22:41 - i don't feel the college um just for
22:43 - speaking from
22:44 - deloitte you know we do uh recruit from
22:47 - a number of different schools but all of
22:49 - our
22:50 - opening or postings are on our career
22:53 - site so
22:54 - folks are i mean you could anybody can
22:56 - apply
22:57 - um coming in as an entry level
23:01 - analyst that is our title which could be
23:04 - data scientists like i had mentioned
23:08 - a lot of it is training so as you're
23:11 - interviewing or applying you know look
23:13 - at companies that are not only going to
23:14 - give you the hands-on
23:16 - keyboard skills but maybe more of the
23:18 - training background
23:20 - to help you um you know
23:24 - tap into the market get off get get with
23:26 - your career
23:27 - i think compensation as natasha
23:29 - mentioned you know it's
23:31 - total package like look at that it's not
23:33 - just dollars
23:34 - it could be the training and development
23:37 - education
23:37 - tuition you know assistance
23:41 - pto you know all that is
23:44 - part of compensation
23:49 - yeah and i i would i would say um to add
23:52 - to that for
23:52 - for our roles no i think that the
23:55 - college education piece i'm actually a
23:56 - huge fan of
23:58 - you know give me a college dropout
24:00 - that's
24:01 - interested in coding and has done like a
24:03 - ton of stuff on the back end i mean
24:05 - we're really trying to be a little bit
24:07 - more diverse in our approach so
24:09 - you're you know while going to a great
24:11 - ivy league school i mean
24:13 - kudos to you making through making
24:15 - through that um
24:16 - i think that's great but it's not
24:18 - necessarily going to break make or break
24:20 - anything
24:20 - from a comp perspective we always look
24:23 - at purity
24:24 - so if you're an entry level coming into
24:27 - fox
24:28 - at an engineer the the title for that
24:30 - would be an associate engineer
24:32 - all of our associate engineers coming
24:34 - out of college or they get paid the same
24:36 - so i wouldn't worry too much about oh if
24:38 - i'm graduating from mit
24:40 - does that necessarily bring me up like
24:42 - 10k more than some of my other peers
24:45 - coming from state schools
24:46 - that's not the case we're very big on
24:48 - purity we're very big on diversity too
24:50 - so we do look at you know and in
24:53 - complete
24:54 - honesty there are high school dropouts
24:55 - probably making more money than all of
24:57 - us on this call right now so
24:58 - you know we are we are very keen on that
25:01 - yeah
25:02 - i agree very true
25:05 - uh i see a lot of call a lot of
25:07 - employers that are focused a bit more on
25:09 - the experience and skills versus the
25:11 - education and that's very common
25:13 - thinking about
25:14 - diversity of thought and perspective as
25:17 - you're hiring
25:19 - new folks a company so it's great to
25:21 - hear about deloitte and fox
25:25 - our other question is do companies offer
25:28 - development programs
25:29 - for college students who are entering
25:31 - the job market to help them adjust to
25:33 - their first time role
25:35 - uh we'll start with you natasha
25:38 - yeah it's a it's a good question um you
25:41 - know we're
25:42 - we're probably not the best at it just
25:45 - yet
25:45 - um i think coming on board what you do
25:48 - get especially at fox i know some other
25:50 - companies actually mastercard is pretty
25:51 - good at that too but
25:53 - um there's a lot of on-the-job training
25:55 - a lot of shadowing your managers will
25:57 - probably buddy you up with somebody
25:58 - who's
25:59 - a year or two ahead of you that you can
26:01 - learn a lot from
26:03 - when it comes to specific hard skills to
26:05 - learn
26:07 - versus the soft skills you know we do
26:09 - have
26:10 - linkedin learning is our go-to learning
26:12 - channel
26:14 - and we have access you know unlimited
26:16 - access to
26:17 - all of the virtual training
26:18 - opportunities there so
26:20 - if it is something in python or it's
26:22 - coding or something that might up your
26:24 - skills a bit we do have that at you know
26:27 - free disposal to
26:28 - all of our employees um but coming in
26:31 - it's really
26:32 - you know working with your managers who
26:33 - are also very hands-on and your peers
26:39 - nice thank you anything you'd like to
26:41 - add in linda
26:42 - sure yes so you know with coming into
26:45 - deloitte there's
26:47 - we offer it's a robust orientation
26:50 - program
26:50 - again you have a mentor it is a lot of
26:53 - um
26:54 - hands-on shadowing learning
26:58 - listening linkedin learning we love um
27:02 - i've even participated like i am such a
27:04 - huge fan so
27:06 - we offer a lot of different programs
27:09 - um training that folks can do on their
27:12 - own time as well
27:15 - and i think that's has shown a lot of
27:19 - success
27:20 - uh depending on where folks want to
27:22 - continue to you know
27:23 - learn new skills
27:27 - nice thank you for that i've also heard
27:30 - of coursera
27:31 - yeah um and if it's not through girls
27:34 - who code also your universities may be
27:37 - willing to pay for these opportunities
27:39 - which is something to take advantage of
27:40 - now
27:42 - uh we have some bonus questions as well
27:45 - for you so
27:46 - i know you mentioned this a bit linda
27:48 - can you share a bit more and then
27:50 - natasha what are some of the rotational
27:52 - programs that your company
27:54 - may offer for some of those for some
27:57 - for folks who are like just now joining
28:00 - their the workforce and their first
28:01 - full-time opportunity
28:05 - so speaking of of deloitte they will
28:08 - may meaning um more at the i'll call it
28:12 - at the analyst
28:12 - level there's a rotation program where
28:15 - you may be on a project for a couple
28:17 - it could be six to 12 weeks and then
28:19 - they will roll you off just to give you
28:21 - that experience
28:24 - they have found great success in that
28:28 - and also you know talking with
28:30 - individuals of where's the interest you
28:32 - know
28:32 - did you enjoy that project and where are
28:35 - you looking to
28:36 - kind of add value to go to that next
28:38 - project so
28:39 - um that happens a lot um at the
28:42 - analyst level so you know learning
28:45 - really what
28:47 - what you enjoy doing uh and where you
28:50 - can see yourself stretching
28:55 - nice thank you and natasha
28:59 - yeah so from a rotation program
29:00 - perspective um
29:02 - as it pertains to tech there is one
29:04 - pilot we're doing
29:06 - there's a little bit more on the arizona
29:07 - front but we have a new tech center
29:09 - being built out there it's on the media
29:11 - and broadcast operation
29:13 - side um it is something that's probably
29:15 - going to be about nine months long where
29:17 - you spent about three months
29:19 - on the medium broadcast operation so
29:21 - it's like eyes on screen
29:23 - making sure all of our media is sort of
29:25 - being plugged in where it's supposed to
29:27 - no shows are going down and then you'll
29:30 - probably spend about
29:31 - another three months on the cyber front
29:34 - and then another three months
29:36 - on either a devops or engineering side
29:39 - so we're still finalizing that program
29:41 - it's a little hot off the press
29:43 - um it'll probably launch in 2021 once
29:46 - we're fully live with our
29:48 - our tech center so that is one rotation
29:50 - program that we're building out as it
29:52 - pertains to tech but
29:54 - we're always looking to do more i think
29:56 - now you know
29:57 - because of covid and the virtual setup i
29:59 - think there's a lot more we can do on
30:01 - this front
30:02 - um we're just sort of and i think many
30:04 - companies might be facing this too
30:05 - trying to reshift a little bit on how
30:08 - they manage these programs
30:09 - i think when you're on site it's a
30:11 - little bit easier to be a sponge and
30:13 - learn more and ask peers for questions
30:16 - so it's taking us a bit of time to mold
30:18 - something perfect for a virtual setup
30:22 - nice those are both like really exciting
30:24 - opportunities and it's kind of like we
30:25 - got the the sneak peek before everyone
30:27 - else did natasha so thank you and
30:30 - hopefully folks were taking note of that
30:31 - program to look into in 2021
30:36 - thank you another question is
30:40 - what is the difference between working
30:42 - for a consulting firm like deloitte
30:44 - or working for a corporate company like
30:46 - fox can you share your thoughts on that
30:48 - starting with natasha
30:51 - yeah so i've actually um never been a
30:53 - consultant
30:54 - i've been poached to be a consultant
30:56 - before but i never took that route
30:57 - um i work with a lot of consultants
30:59 - though um some phenomenal ones
31:02 - i think personally and linda keep me
31:04 - honest here with this
31:05 - but um on the consultant front it's
31:08 - definitely much more project based right
31:10 - and i think you have different exposure
31:12 - to many different employers
31:14 - i think it's actually probably a little
31:16 - bit cooler
31:17 - in a sense where you can maybe be on a
31:20 - six-month engagement working for
31:22 - a media company and then pivot to a tech
31:24 - company and then pivot to fintech or
31:26 - whatever it might be i don't think
31:28 - you'll ever get bored to be honest and
31:30 - not to say that i'm bored of my role but
31:32 - a lot of our consultants are amazing
31:33 - they're great partners
31:35 - we have a lot of consultants on site too
31:37 - some of them in which we turn into
31:38 - full-time employees
31:40 - if the consulting company is open to
31:42 - that just because
31:43 - that relationship is you know beyond
31:45 - great
31:46 - um coming from an actual employer
31:50 - um and just being a full-time employee
31:52 - versus a consultant
31:53 - it is um it is different you know you're
31:56 - kind of a little bit more focused on on
31:58 - the job
31:59 - projects can change depending on your
32:01 - position too
32:03 - um but you're solely focused on that
32:05 - specific brand and that specific
32:07 - employer
32:08 - i think that's probably the the biggest
32:09 - difference and and linda of course this
32:11 - consulting piece is more up your alley
32:13 - so i'll let you you hit it
32:15 - i mean it's project based
32:18 - it's summer short term some are long
32:20 - term some can change overnight
32:24 - just depending on the nature of the
32:25 - project the client
32:27 - they could change gears or just decide
32:30 - to slow down
32:32 - so i think having a career
32:36 - in consulting is you know working with
32:39 - project teams you will have the
32:42 - opportunity
32:44 - you could you could support our
32:45 - government side you could support our
32:47 - commercial side there's even global
32:49 - opportunity
32:50 - um and just work with leaders
32:55 - on the client side and then you'll have
32:57 - your folks
32:58 - you know within your network that you're
33:01 - you know working with as well
33:02 - each project could be different so you
33:04 - could be on one project with one team
33:06 - and then
33:07 - once that project is over you could be
33:08 - roll on to another team completely
33:11 - new set of folks which
33:14 - you know is exciting too
33:18 - nice those both sound really exciting uh
33:20 - natasha we're getting questions in the
33:22 - chat can you repeat the program that you
33:24 - mentioned
33:25 - oh you i see you just put it but feel
33:27 - free to repeat it
33:29 - um so it's uh we don't have an official
33:31 - name but it is going to be in arizona
33:34 - it's likely going to be a nine month
33:36 - rotation program in tempe arizona which
33:38 - is where our new tech center is going to
33:40 - be housed
33:42 - once it is launched i think we're going
33:43 - to have a dedicated page on our fox
33:45 - careers page for the rotation program
33:48 - i know there was a question about high
33:49 - school i think we're targeting college
33:50 - students first let's see how it goes
33:52 - with the pilot before we go down into
33:54 - into high school students want to make
33:56 - sure it's a successful opportunity for
33:58 - you guys
33:58 - they don't want to rush too quickly but
34:01 - more to come
34:01 - in early 2021
34:05 - nice thank you for that sneak peek um
34:09 - and then we're receiving a few questions
34:11 - from viewers
34:12 - and i'm it's kind of a good thing that i
34:15 - sped through
34:15 - the first part of this panel because now
34:18 - we have 20 minutes you
34:19 - actually get into depth with our viewers
34:22 - questions and really what's important
34:24 - um to them right now in the moment so
34:27 - some of those questions i'll be asking
34:29 - you now the first one is from lanique
34:32 - would you be able to linda and natasha
34:34 - compare different
34:36 - tech roles um for example thinking
34:38 - through about some of the
34:40 - tech roles that you hire for uh what are
34:42 - some some of the skill sets that may be
34:44 - required for each
34:45 - for example a back end engineer versus a
34:48 - front end
34:50 - etc or even a data analyst versus a data
34:53 - scientist what are some of the skills
34:54 - that you look for
34:56 - as you're comparing those roles
35:00 - i can i can go um depending on the role
35:03 - if it's a back end or front end um the
35:06 - technology
35:07 - is typically the must-have depending on
35:09 - the project they might need
35:12 - you know what i'm finding i'm not
35:13 - proficient in it i can talk about it
35:16 - you know they look for javascript you
35:18 - know python
35:20 - um sql
35:25 - you know different technologies there is
35:28 - flexibility so
35:29 - you know look at python as a programming
35:32 - language if you know r
35:33 - there is you know they'll take r over
35:36 - python
35:37 - so just depending on the work in the
35:39 - nature and also the project what the
35:41 - client is looking for
35:42 - since we're client focused um
35:45 - we tend to partner you know with our
35:48 - with our clients to learn more about
35:50 - their delivery and what's what's
35:51 - important to them and what do they need
35:53 - in hiring this individual
35:58 - and to add a you know i would say go to
36:02 - go to any career site and look at the
36:03 - job descriptions we're very keen on
36:06 - differentiating between a back end and a
36:07 - front end
36:09 - um aws is really hot right now
36:12 - um so that's that's a top skill that i'm
36:14 - seeing in a lot of
36:15 - our a lot of our jd's that our managers
36:17 - are posting
36:18 - um i actually took a sneak peek at one
36:21 - github and jarrah
36:22 - is also something that's um that's top
36:24 - up there too i'm
36:25 - starting to see repeats of that from a
36:28 - data perspective if you're
36:29 - interested in the data front um i think
36:31 - being a data scientist actually
36:33 - it's pretty cool but you know passionate
36:36 - about obviously assessing trends
36:38 - gathering data but looking at data sort
36:41 - of thoroughly
36:41 - to provide business updates in terms of
36:44 - you know six months out from now
36:46 - this is probably where we need to pivot
36:47 - or what we should focus on
36:49 - um i think data engineering is really
36:51 - helping us with our data platforms
36:54 - and ensuring that wherever we're
36:56 - sourcing data and you know obviously for
36:58 - media companies
36:59 - there's a plethora of data out there
37:02 - whether it's nielsen data on our ratings
37:04 - or how many viewers are
37:05 - on our apps or subscribers so pulling
37:08 - that data in a thoughtful way
37:10 - and in in a consistent way for our
37:12 - leaders to look at
37:14 - um i think is obviously important and
37:16 - i'm going more high level than the
37:18 - actual
37:18 - terms in a job description but my
37:21 - recommendation is look at those jd's
37:23 - it may not pop out at the very front
37:25 - because we always want to give like a
37:27 - quick intro in terms of what we're
37:28 - looking for but look at those bullet
37:30 - points because
37:30 - it'll it'll start coming out yeah
37:36 - nice thank you for sharing that and
37:38 - hopefully um
37:39 - this is really helpful because i i also
37:42 - hear the
37:43 - computing space or the cloud space is a
37:45 - huge one so aws is a huge focus along
37:48 - with
37:48 - cyber security which i think was cyber
37:51 - security awareness month this month so
37:54 - that's exciting uh another question we
37:57 - received
37:58 - is relate related to um
38:02 - the the job while you're in the job in
38:04 - particular
38:05 - so this is coming from mia in school we
38:08 - have
38:08 - assignments that we have to complete how
38:11 - does that work at a
38:12 - actual like corporate job what do you
38:14 - what kind of assignments do you have
38:17 - um in your day-to-day that you may have
38:19 - to complete this can be related to your
38:21 - role or even to a more tech focused role
38:23 - we can start with natasha yeah so
38:26 - assignment based i think you know rather
38:29 - than the specific
38:31 - assignment i think project management
38:33 - skills is definitely needed
38:35 - across the board um what i personally
38:38 - took from school
38:39 - is how to up my pm game to make sure it
38:43 - fits within companies so
38:45 - you know if my manager gives me a
38:46 - specific task at work
38:48 - or even our tech folks i think the first
38:50 - thing we do is always build out a
38:52 - roadmap and look at the milestones of
38:54 - what we need to hit
38:55 - to make sure we're executing flawlessly
38:58 - um
38:58 - so i think from an assignment
39:00 - perspective whether it's a three-month
39:01 - assignment or six months
39:03 - i mean personally i'm in hr one of the
39:05 - things that we're working on from an hr
39:07 - perspective is a it's a kpi dashboard
39:10 - of all of our metrics within hr so how
39:13 - many people were hiring are we hittering
39:15 - our diversity quotas
39:16 - are we looking at things like um
39:18 - obviously looking at some different
39:19 - schools and things like that too but how
39:21 - are we putting this in a dashboard
39:22 - format
39:23 - i gave my team about a month to help me
39:25 - complete this
39:26 - we're on track to to complete it by the
39:29 - end of the month
39:29 - but again i think the one thing i do
39:32 - want to stress here i think it's more of
39:33 - the
39:34 - the project management skills making
39:36 - sure you're hitting your deadlines if
39:37 - you're not going to hit your deadlines
39:39 - how do you communicate that
39:41 - to your team to stakeholders like your
39:43 - managers that
39:44 - this might fall because of xyz and how
39:46 - can we sort of rectify that so
39:49 - linda i'll pass it to you for yeah i
39:51 - agree project management skills i think
39:54 - in every role that i've been on
39:56 - for somebody new coming into the
39:58 - workforce
39:59 - you know being prepared give yourself
40:01 - time plan
40:03 - if you're having trouble or not able to
40:05 - meet the
40:06 - the goal you know raise your hand you
40:09 - know go to your project manager
40:12 - ask questions if if you're not sure i
40:14 - mean
40:15 - you know ask those questions to make
40:17 - sure you understand
40:19 - what what the ask is and what you need
40:21 - to deliver
40:24 - thanks for sharing that out of curiosity
40:26 - are there any
40:27 - project management tools that you can
40:30 - suggest or courses
40:33 - that you've taken or that's offered at
40:35 - your companies
40:37 - i will look at linkedin learning for
40:39 - some virtual courses
40:41 - um you know i think scrum masters are
40:44 - are big here too and they deal with a
40:46 - lot of some of the project management
40:47 - efforts too
40:48 - um looking at tickets and also making
40:50 - sure that we're we're hitting our
40:52 - deadlines
40:52 - um google look for like a really cool pm
40:56 - template a project management template
40:57 - on google sometimes you can actually get
40:58 - like a really cool
40:59 - download of like what a you know
41:01 - realistic road map could look like
41:04 - um i've i've used that i i mean i google
41:06 - throughout college i still google
41:08 - throughout my career so i i would
41:10 - you know definitely try to search for
41:12 - for keywords like that
41:16 - yeah i agree 100
41:19 - nice thank you i know you've already
41:22 - mentioned project management
41:24 - but what are some other software hard
41:26 - skills that companies are typically
41:27 - looking for
41:28 - today and this question is coming from
41:32 - tasfia
41:34 - we can start with linda um
41:38 - so other skills like a project
41:40 - management
41:41 - roles that could be um
41:46 - in my space you know i
41:50 - we tend to hire folks with experience so
41:53 - they'll look for somebody that may have
41:54 - their pmp certificate
41:56 - somebody that has um the project
41:59 - management skills
42:02 - not to get too you know technical
42:05 - but like scrum masters you know they'll
42:08 - look
42:09 - for that type of background i think
42:12 - if you were to google maybe project
42:15 - management
42:17 - roles i i think you'll that could open
42:20 - up a lot of different
42:22 - jobs out there and just reading about
42:24 - them
42:25 - again the title could vary depending on
42:29 - the company
42:30 - and it's kind of their structure you
42:33 - know it may not be a project manager but
42:34 - it could be
42:36 - you know just another term doing the
42:38 - same thing
42:39 - or very similar that's helpful thank you
42:42 - linda
42:43 - and this can be not just project
42:45 - management but open-ended what are
42:46 - companies typically looking for for
42:48 - those softer hard skills
42:50 - i think on on our end um and and some of
42:53 - the other companies i've worked for
42:55 - i think on the softer skill side
42:57 - learnability and curiosity goes a long
43:00 - way
43:00 - so you know we've seen brilliant
43:02 - engineers come in but they're not
43:05 - um you know if the company pivots or the
43:08 - direction of a project pivots
43:10 - they're just really focused on their
43:11 - role they don't go
43:13 - in my opinion as far as the engineer who
43:16 - is always has an appetite for innovation
43:20 - um who's always asking the right
43:21 - question question
43:23 - everything to be honest i mean i think
43:25 - that goes a long way
43:26 - just because a company does a process
43:28 - for so long that doesn't mean it's right
43:30 - you know ask
43:30 - why um i think you know that's helped me
43:33 - in my career
43:34 - in in leveling up and and getting to
43:37 - where i'm at
43:38 - um but i've i've always questioned our
43:40 - processes it's you know
43:42 - and because we do it one year go through
43:44 - a full cycle sometimes too before you
43:46 - question every single thing
43:48 - um see how it's done and then i think
43:49 - taking a serious intake on the inventory
43:52 - of why we do it
43:53 - and then even providing don't just
43:55 - question it
43:56 - um but also providing thoughtful sort of
43:59 - responses as to
44:01 - you know i see we've done it this way
44:03 - for some time
44:04 - i wonder if we could probably introduce
44:06 - this part into the process
44:08 - because i think it might save us time or
44:09 - money or whatever it might be
44:11 - so that curiosity component i think will
44:14 - take you very far in your career
44:22 - thank you and now we're on to our
44:25 - last question uh this question is
44:28 - if we are majoring in computer science
44:31 - but we don't really know if we like
44:33 - coding
44:34 - um we'll graduating with the computer
44:36 - science and coding experience allow me
44:38 - to get a job in the tech
44:40 - sector that won't necessarily deal with
44:42 - coding
44:46 - in other words let's say i graduated
44:48 - with computer science and coding but i'm
44:50 - not sure if i want to do coding
44:52 - what kind of degrees or role maybe roles
44:54 - can i look for at your companies
44:57 - we'll start with natasha for this yeah
45:00 - so
45:00 - you know computer science degree is
45:02 - interesting i i do
45:04 - think the degree itself
45:07 - it doesn't really lend itself to that
45:09 - specific
45:10 - sort of job here i think you know
45:14 - if you wanted to be a developer if you
45:16 - wanted to do
45:17 - even get into the engineering track but
45:19 - you're fresh out of school
45:21 - we're not always looking at what you
45:23 - graduated with or what your major was
45:25 - um i also think taking certificates like
45:28 - aws is offering a ton of certificates
45:31 - you could be aws certified in six months
45:33 - if you wanted to
45:34 - um i think putting things on your resume
45:37 - that you've done
45:38 - a course or you know even outside of
45:41 - traditional schooling
45:43 - maybe you did something in jira or you
45:45 - did something in python or whatever it
45:47 - might be
45:48 - i think some of them are probably more
45:50 - condensed
45:52 - um programs that you can you can look
45:54 - into
45:55 - i think adding that to your resume if
45:56 - you don't want to do the traditional
45:57 - computer science path
45:59 - um can go a long way um i'm always happy
46:02 - by the way
46:03 - too i know this is our last question but
46:05 - to look at resumes and help out
46:07 - i do that on my free time when i
46:08 - volunteer too um so
46:10 - if you always you want to hit me up on
46:13 - linkedin
46:14 - and send along your resume i'm always
46:15 - happy to give some some guidance there
46:21 - nice thank you definitely take that off
46:23 - for y'all
46:25 - and linda can you share a bit more with
46:28 - us
46:29 - sure um i think you know the degree
46:32 - opens the door
46:33 - and again go after what you're
46:35 - passionate about what you're interested
46:37 - in
46:38 - the certificates that that you're
46:40 - interested in
46:41 - i think it's it's great you know put it
46:43 - on your resume
46:45 - um that i have seen folks with a
46:48 - computer science degree and then they're
46:49 - going into more strategy because they
46:52 - just found that passion
46:54 - be open-minded have an open aperture
46:57 - join a firm ask questions be
47:00 - innovative um you know network
47:03 - learn from other folks you know their
47:06 - career path

compsci degree for our viewers welcome i enjoy reading the chatter in the chat box continue to use that chat box to share your thoughts and questions throughout tonight's conversation and a member of the girls who code staff will respond with that i'm pleased to introduce our panelists our first panelist is natasha valani who's the vice president of human resources at fox natasha focuses on talent management performance recruitment diversity and the overall employee experience within technology and finance prior to fox she worked at mastercard where she received the 2016 mastercard global hr excellence award for her work involving mastercard's performance management process to be geared more towards the employee experience second we have linda tanil who is a manager of gps experience hire recruiting at deloitte linder plays a key role in recruiting highly clearly cleared technical talent mentoring and coaching candidates as well as her team in addition to building and implementing strategic recruiting strategies to drive business objectives in her free time linda linda and her husband greg enjoy time outdoors such as running hiking and spending time with their two pups sunny and blondie so with that let's virtual applause to our panelist speakers and i'm really excited to speak with you both this evening as we get set up we're going to start the night with an icebreaker afterwards we'll follow that by questions that will address the concerns of girls who code collegeaged alumni and students across the country who are either beginning matriculating or even ending their college experience then we'll wrap up the evening with a conversation focus on q a segment segments and questions from our viewers without further ado let's get started so welcome natasha and linda our first icebreaker question is what do you enjoy most about your role and i'm going to ask you to answer in the order that you were introduced as for our viewers stay tuned and get ready to answer your own icebreaker question using the polls feature this will be the first poll question of the evening so stay alert because you only have about 30 seconds to respond after it pops up on your screen so join us and let us know your thoughts as well for the icebreaker that pops up for our panelists again what do you enjoy most about your role and let's start off with natasha yeah great first of all thanks for having me i'm so happy to be here and spend my evening i'm based in new york city with you guys um so thanks for having me um for the icebreaker question what do i enjoy most about my job um i think it's really the people interaction i never thought i would venture into hr i have a marketing background um i decided to dip into hr because quite honestly um it paid the most and out of school i was coming out with a lot of college debt so i took the first job that that paid the most but going in hr and using my marketing skills around consumer behavior i think the people interaction engaging with our tech employees is always phenomenal um it's you know it's really a joy and a pleasure to recruit and on board um our employees engage with them talking about the full talent life cycle um you know whether it was that mastercard or even at fox today but um i think that's probably my answer for you thank you and linda great hi good evening um i'm actually located in northern virginia centerville so for me talent i've always been interested in talent you know from early on working for a temporary staffing agency i then got involved in more of the recruiting getting to know the candidates and loved making the matches for me now working for deloitte you know meeting with the candidates working with the leaders setting up the interviews and then you know seeing seeing them in the office when we were in the office so it's that full life cycle helping getting to know what's important to the candidate and you know bringing them on board nice thank you for sharing that and definitely see the alignment between the both of you and your focus on candidate experience and really making sure that folks not just have a great experience while they're interviewing but especially once they join the company and again viewers definitely stay tuned for your own question of your own that's going to be popping up on your screen uh with with that that question is what excites you most about your future career in tech so really excited to hear some of your thoughts and what comes up from there for natasha and linda a sizable portion of our viewers are rising college students and a lot of the questions we received for them was around ways to prepare for their professional careers now they may know they love coding but aren't entirely sure what's available to them so our first group question is specifically for this group of viewers prior to entering college what were some of the steps and valuable resources that would help high school age students explore different career paths in tech linda what are your thoughts for me i think there's a there's a lot of things that you can do either through your local community college or campus whatever's nearby there are events that you could attend there's a lot on like linkedin just doing your research even youtube reading articles even googling even in in my in my role if i don't know something i mean just google it and then you can just learn so much more about you know what what you're thinking might interest you nice thank you how about you natasha yeah i am you know i echo what what linda is saying too i think leveraging google leveraging the assets available to you virtually um i know you know wasn't as readily available for some coming out of high school but i think it's just grown much more popular nowadays mashable is actually a really cool site i'm sure most of you are on it or check it out but sometimes they do have job blogs that actually i sometimes go on just to see if there's anybody cool that we might want to recruit from a tech perspective um definitely check that out the other thing i would say too coming out of high school we there are some companies you kind of have to dig a little bit but there are some companies that offer internship programs for high school students and it doesn't hurt to try something different if you're into coding but you want to switch careers and want to do something more on the engineering side or devops or something on the application front um i look and dig again echoing linda go on google find those internships i know i had worked at a company called terrex corporation in connecticut they love they do a high school intern program and they do a little bit of a soft rotation so that's one example i know some of you aren't local to the connecticut market but um definitely do some digging and research thank you both especially for the the tangible tools there and i know our viewers you had an opportunity to also chime in on what excites you about your future career in tech so if you're curious just as i was about 54 of you said solving problems using technology and 40 mention learning new technologies so hopefully you gain so much more insight with with what excites you about your future career in technology now that we have a greater sense and understanding of what can be done to learn about career paths this question is specifically for our alumni who have been looking at professional opportunities um from for example from software engineer to ux designers we see roles posted on the girls who girls who code hire me and linkedin but what do these jobs entail for the viewers who specifically asked for information around what it means to be in these certain career roles or opportunities this question is for you but first audience members we definitely want an opportunity to hear again from you so complete the poll and inform us on this question do you already know what your dream job is or do you need assistance figuring it out perfect um so as those results come in linda and natasha we're interested in hearing from you what questions should job seekers ask to help them stand out what questions are taboo let's start with you linda what questions um good questions uh you do your research on the company um and i would ask more openended questions you know tell me more about the role tell me what you are looking for um in in finding you know the applicant things to stay away from um i would stay away from compensation or benefits um depending on who you're talking to they may they may not know the answer um in my role those types of conversations stay in talent and when you're talking with a hiring manager they're more around you know the actual role responsibilities the duties you know what what we're looking for in this individual and um another good question you know how you can add impact to what they're looking for and really kind of um you know i'm not you know see yourself in the role and just ask more ask ask a lot ask questions show interest i think it just goes a long way nice thank you natasha yeah um completely agree i am while i'm not a fulltime recruiter in my job i do work very close with recruitment and i do um i also interview at the director level plus just from a culture fit because they are typically managing people at fox but some of my favorite questions um i'll start there is when candidates ask things like you know what does success look like for this role in the next six months um what are some challenges that you guys are facing now that i could or the potential candidate could help alleviate i think it shows initiative to to linda's point um and you know i think it really helps bridge the gap and also for hiring managers to hear that specifically all always kind of makes them feel like wow this person is already ready to take some work off of my plate which goes a long way um so i think those are probably my top two favorite questions curiosity is key to linda's point ask a ton of questions um but don't definitely openended right um you don't want it to just go to yes and no and then questions to refrain from that's actually pretty interesting i agree on the comp front um i also think coming out of school you don't want to come off too money hungry compensation is important and one thing i do want to stress is you know while maybe the facebooks and the netflix might be a little bit higher on base and bonus always look at the full package yes um while some companies may not be able to go as high on base and bonus immediately um they do offer things like educational assistance if you want to further your education benefits programs um always look about that full that full spectrum but keep reserve those questions for recruitment or the hr person you'll be connecting with as it relates to comp yep thank you for that um that's really really helpful to hear and with our poll question that we asked it was how many of you actually know what your dream job is or do you still need assistance figuring out we actually got 60 68 percent of viewers said no they do not know what their dream job is and that is very very normal you're not alone especially where you are in your education and in your experience a followup question is outside of software engineer roles what are some other job titles for those majoring in compsci that they can qualify are qualify for and what are the associated responsibilities would either of you linda or natasha be able to speak towards that question i can go first if you want sure yeah um so some i'll tell you some of the hot jobs i'm seeing today especially within media tech cyber security is always really hot especially right now we're obviously preparing for the elections um coming up so that's definitely a hot market but we're always looking for automation engineers people who are actually passionate about the cyberspace so that's that's one area data science is super hot as well app development either backend engineers or frontend developers are always critical too we are hiring for a lot of roku and android developers engineering experience is cool but it's not needed i think the biggest thing for us is just making sure you have an appetite for the position especially if it's more entry level um i'd say that's probably what i'm seeing is what's hot right now nice thank you i can add to that you know i'm with a consulting firm and we are hiring this background as well you know we support our clients both on the commercial and the government side so it's cyber security the data science um front end back end developers devops is hot um so there's you know i feel it's just it's growing you know just tapping into so many different markets that's definitely helpful helpfully here especially with covid pandemic and how it hit the job market so many markets were were affected especially across the board and the tech industry is growing and transitioning and really adapting so that's helpful to know as our alumni who may be new graduates are looking for future opportunities in the tech space with that we're also interested in as we ask a bit more about what are those skill sets for those types of roles out of curiosity what are some of the basic skill requirements needed for internships or entrylevel jobs in terms of coding languages years of experience types of projects etc uh natasha can you kick us off there yeah for for our intern programs um it's you know we understand going in that there won't probably be a lot of years of tangible experience on your resume and that's okay it's not always needed we do have an mba internship program too that requires at least a year out in the field somewhere but for our our basic college internship program it's really just the interest in studying in that field the thought is that you know whether it's zero to one we're not we're not too high up on making sure that you come out with five years of experience otherwise we'd hire a fulltime employee um so the internship we're a little bit more relaxed on um i would say top three things is your major um you know if you're majoring in communications but you're going for a cyber internship you may not get the full foot in the door we might look at your resume depending on what your interests are and have a conversation with you i will say in speaking to some of our hiring managers on the floors hiring for interns i think they're always just looking especially on the internship level for pure interest it's it's really having a passion about the space our managers are really good at training and shadowing allowing you to shadow so you learn a lot um coming in from an internship but again from an experience perspective we're not requiring a ton i echo the same you know they're not look we're not looking at the experience it is the interest um and the academic you know background they will look at technical skills but again at a very junior level i mean they're not expecting you know years and years of experience a lot of it is um coming in to really see if you if you enjoy this type of work a lot of it is you know could be shadowing or um having that kind of that visibility a six week program so i hope that helps no that really does help in hearing your experience and typically what you look for and what some of these some of these questions are some of these responses that you're having related to opportunities out of curiosity where can alumni learn more in detail about the titles you just mentioned such as cyber security etc um i would say just to kick it off uh google definitely google it you can always go to fox careers if you're interested in a in a job with fox all of our jobs are posted in real time um i think we do have a section tailored to more of the entry level positions too um so definitely check that out most companies i you know if you're passionate about the brand of a company um i know mastercard does a really good job at that too definitely look at the company's site but linkedin is great to look through indeed is an amazing tool to look through um actually one cool um one cool site that i just came across it's actually a compensation site it's called levels.fyi um and they actually break down real compensation data similar to a glass store but from companies like google and microsoft facebook netflix is up there uh check them out because they also have a lot of repetitive job titles that you might be interested in so you might get a sense of what you might want to get into and i don't get anything yep same check out deloitte's career site google it um a lot of times you know i have found just being in this space a title could be different from just maybe a company has their own leveling just using deloitte as an example you know we have consultants and it could mean a variety of different responsibilities you could be a data science but you come in the firm and you're a consultant so maybe google you know it could be i'll just take data science as an example you know you like python and then you could see different titles that do come up that could be of interest so read more of the description responsibilities um there i think it just could allow open up other opportunities and not just you know maybe the the three or four that are maybe most common in the market that's so true especially in the tech space like titles can vary you can be a solution consultant or solutions engineer or technical account manager all of those titles are very similar right so it definitely helps to focus on the skills as you're looking at those job descriptions uh another question we have is does the college i receive my diploma from determine much job uh which job opportunities will be available to me and how much i can request for my salary let's start with you linda um i don't feel the college um just for speaking from deloitte you know we do uh recruit from a number of different schools but all of our opening or postings are on our career site so folks are i mean you could anybody can apply um coming in as an entry level analyst that is our title which could be data scientists like i had mentioned a lot of it is training so as you're interviewing or applying you know look at companies that are not only going to give you the handson keyboard skills but maybe more of the training background to help you um you know tap into the market get off get get with your career i think compensation as natasha mentioned you know it's total package like look at that it's not just dollars it could be the training and development education tuition you know assistance pto you know all that is part of compensation yeah and i i would i would say um to add to that for for our roles no i think that the college education piece i'm actually a huge fan of you know give me a college dropout that's interested in coding and has done like a ton of stuff on the back end i mean we're really trying to be a little bit more diverse in our approach so you're you know while going to a great ivy league school i mean kudos to you making through making through that um i think that's great but it's not necessarily going to break make or break anything from a comp perspective we always look at purity so if you're an entry level coming into fox at an engineer the the title for that would be an associate engineer all of our associate engineers coming out of college or they get paid the same so i wouldn't worry too much about oh if i'm graduating from mit does that necessarily bring me up like 10k more than some of my other peers coming from state schools that's not the case we're very big on purity we're very big on diversity too so we do look at you know and in complete honesty there are high school dropouts probably making more money than all of us on this call right now so you know we are we are very keen on that yeah i agree very true uh i see a lot of call a lot of employers that are focused a bit more on the experience and skills versus the education and that's very common thinking about diversity of thought and perspective as you're hiring new folks a company so it's great to hear about deloitte and fox our other question is do companies offer development programs for college students who are entering the job market to help them adjust to their first time role uh we'll start with you natasha yeah it's a it's a good question um you know we're we're probably not the best at it just yet um i think coming on board what you do get especially at fox i know some other companies actually mastercard is pretty good at that too but um there's a lot of onthejob training a lot of shadowing your managers will probably buddy you up with somebody who's a year or two ahead of you that you can learn a lot from when it comes to specific hard skills to learn versus the soft skills you know we do have linkedin learning is our goto learning channel and we have access you know unlimited access to all of the virtual training opportunities there so if it is something in python or it's coding or something that might up your skills a bit we do have that at you know free disposal to all of our employees um but coming in it's really you know working with your managers who are also very handson and your peers nice thank you anything you'd like to add in linda sure yes so you know with coming into deloitte there's we offer it's a robust orientation program again you have a mentor it is a lot of um handson shadowing learning listening linkedin learning we love um i've even participated like i am such a huge fan so we offer a lot of different programs um training that folks can do on their own time as well and i think that's has shown a lot of success uh depending on where folks want to continue to you know learn new skills nice thank you for that i've also heard of coursera yeah um and if it's not through girls who code also your universities may be willing to pay for these opportunities which is something to take advantage of now uh we have some bonus questions as well for you so i know you mentioned this a bit linda can you share a bit more and then natasha what are some of the rotational programs that your company may offer for some of those for some for folks who are like just now joining their the workforce and their first fulltime opportunity so speaking of of deloitte they will may meaning um more at the i'll call it at the analyst level there's a rotation program where you may be on a project for a couple it could be six to 12 weeks and then they will roll you off just to give you that experience they have found great success in that and also you know talking with individuals of where's the interest you know did you enjoy that project and where are you looking to kind of add value to go to that next project so um that happens a lot um at the analyst level so you know learning really what what you enjoy doing uh and where you can see yourself stretching nice thank you and natasha yeah so from a rotation program perspective um as it pertains to tech there is one pilot we're doing there's a little bit more on the arizona front but we have a new tech center being built out there it's on the media and broadcast operation side um it is something that's probably going to be about nine months long where you spent about three months on the medium broadcast operation so it's like eyes on screen making sure all of our media is sort of being plugged in where it's supposed to no shows are going down and then you'll probably spend about another three months on the cyber front and then another three months on either a devops or engineering side so we're still finalizing that program it's a little hot off the press um it'll probably launch in 2021 once we're fully live with our our tech center so that is one rotation program that we're building out as it pertains to tech but we're always looking to do more i think now you know because of covid and the virtual setup i think there's a lot more we can do on this front um we're just sort of and i think many companies might be facing this too trying to reshift a little bit on how they manage these programs i think when you're on site it's a little bit easier to be a sponge and learn more and ask peers for questions so it's taking us a bit of time to mold something perfect for a virtual setup nice those are both like really exciting opportunities and it's kind of like we got the the sneak peek before everyone else did natasha so thank you and hopefully folks were taking note of that program to look into in 2021 thank you another question is what is the difference between working for a consulting firm like deloitte or working for a corporate company like fox can you share your thoughts on that starting with natasha yeah so i've actually um never been a consultant i've been poached to be a consultant before but i never took that route um i work with a lot of consultants though um some phenomenal ones i think personally and linda keep me honest here with this but um on the consultant front it's definitely much more project based right and i think you have different exposure to many different employers i think it's actually probably a little bit cooler in a sense where you can maybe be on a sixmonth engagement working for a media company and then pivot to a tech company and then pivot to fintech or whatever it might be i don't think you'll ever get bored to be honest and not to say that i'm bored of my role but a lot of our consultants are amazing they're great partners we have a lot of consultants on site too some of them in which we turn into fulltime employees if the consulting company is open to that just because that relationship is you know beyond great um coming from an actual employer um and just being a fulltime employee versus a consultant it is um it is different you know you're kind of a little bit more focused on on the job projects can change depending on your position too um but you're solely focused on that specific brand and that specific employer i think that's probably the the biggest difference and and linda of course this consulting piece is more up your alley so i'll let you you hit it i mean it's project based it's summer short term some are long term some can change overnight just depending on the nature of the project the client they could change gears or just decide to slow down so i think having a career in consulting is you know working with project teams you will have the opportunity you could you could support our government side you could support our commercial side there's even global opportunity um and just work with leaders on the client side and then you'll have your folks you know within your network that you're you know working with as well each project could be different so you could be on one project with one team and then once that project is over you could be roll on to another team completely new set of folks which you know is exciting too nice those both sound really exciting uh natasha we're getting questions in the chat can you repeat the program that you mentioned oh you i see you just put it but feel free to repeat it um so it's uh we don't have an official name but it is going to be in arizona it's likely going to be a nine month rotation program in tempe arizona which is where our new tech center is going to be housed once it is launched i think we're going to have a dedicated page on our fox careers page for the rotation program i know there was a question about high school i think we're targeting college students first let's see how it goes with the pilot before we go down into into high school students want to make sure it's a successful opportunity for you guys they don't want to rush too quickly but more to come in early 2021 nice thank you for that sneak peek um and then we're receiving a few questions from viewers and i'm it's kind of a good thing that i sped through the first part of this panel because now we have 20 minutes you actually get into depth with our viewers questions and really what's important um to them right now in the moment so some of those questions i'll be asking you now the first one is from lanique would you be able to linda and natasha compare different tech roles um for example thinking through about some of the tech roles that you hire for uh what are some some of the skill sets that may be required for each for example a back end engineer versus a front end etc or even a data analyst versus a data scientist what are some of the skills that you look for as you're comparing those roles i can i can go um depending on the role if it's a back end or front end um the technology is typically the musthave depending on the project they might need you know what i'm finding i'm not proficient in it i can talk about it you know they look for javascript you know python um sql you know different technologies there is flexibility so you know look at python as a programming language if you know r there is you know they'll take r over python so just depending on the work in the nature and also the project what the client is looking for since we're client focused um we tend to partner you know with our with our clients to learn more about their delivery and what's what's important to them and what do they need in hiring this individual and to add a you know i would say go to go to any career site and look at the job descriptions we're very keen on differentiating between a back end and a front end um aws is really hot right now um so that's that's a top skill that i'm seeing in a lot of our a lot of our jd's that our managers are posting um i actually took a sneak peek at one github and jarrah is also something that's um that's top up there too i'm starting to see repeats of that from a data perspective if you're interested in the data front um i think being a data scientist actually it's pretty cool but you know passionate about obviously assessing trends gathering data but looking at data sort of thoroughly to provide business updates in terms of you know six months out from now this is probably where we need to pivot or what we should focus on um i think data engineering is really helping us with our data platforms and ensuring that wherever we're sourcing data and you know obviously for media companies there's a plethora of data out there whether it's nielsen data on our ratings or how many viewers are on our apps or subscribers so pulling that data in a thoughtful way and in in a consistent way for our leaders to look at um i think is obviously important and i'm going more high level than the actual terms in a job description but my recommendation is look at those jd's it may not pop out at the very front because we always want to give like a quick intro in terms of what we're looking for but look at those bullet points because it'll it'll start coming out yeah nice thank you for sharing that and hopefully um this is really helpful because i i also hear the computing space or the cloud space is a huge one so aws is a huge focus along with cyber security which i think was cyber security awareness month this month so that's exciting uh another question we received is relate related to um the the job while you're in the job in particular so this is coming from mia in school we have assignments that we have to complete how does that work at a actual like corporate job what do you what kind of assignments do you have um in your daytoday that you may have to complete this can be related to your role or even to a more tech focused role we can start with natasha yeah so assignment based i think you know rather than the specific assignment i think project management skills is definitely needed across the board um what i personally took from school is how to up my pm game to make sure it fits within companies so you know if my manager gives me a specific task at work or even our tech folks i think the first thing we do is always build out a roadmap and look at the milestones of what we need to hit to make sure we're executing flawlessly um so i think from an assignment perspective whether it's a threemonth assignment or six months i mean personally i'm in hr one of the things that we're working on from an hr perspective is a it's a kpi dashboard of all of our metrics within hr so how many people were hiring are we hittering our diversity quotas are we looking at things like um obviously looking at some different schools and things like that too but how are we putting this in a dashboard format i gave my team about a month to help me complete this we're on track to to complete it by the end of the month but again i think the one thing i do want to stress here i think it's more of the the project management skills making sure you're hitting your deadlines if you're not going to hit your deadlines how do you communicate that to your team to stakeholders like your managers that this might fall because of xyz and how can we sort of rectify that so linda i'll pass it to you for yeah i agree project management skills i think in every role that i've been on for somebody new coming into the workforce you know being prepared give yourself time plan if you're having trouble or not able to meet the the goal you know raise your hand you know go to your project manager ask questions if if you're not sure i mean you know ask those questions to make sure you understand what what the ask is and what you need to deliver thanks for sharing that out of curiosity are there any project management tools that you can suggest or courses that you've taken or that's offered at your companies i will look at linkedin learning for some virtual courses um you know i think scrum masters are are big here too and they deal with a lot of some of the project management efforts too um looking at tickets and also making sure that we're we're hitting our deadlines um google look for like a really cool pm template a project management template on google sometimes you can actually get like a really cool download of like what a you know realistic road map could look like um i've i've used that i i mean i google throughout college i still google throughout my career so i i would you know definitely try to search for for keywords like that yeah i agree 100 nice thank you i know you've already mentioned project management but what are some other software hard skills that companies are typically looking for today and this question is coming from tasfia we can start with linda um so other skills like a project management roles that could be um in my space you know i we tend to hire folks with experience so they'll look for somebody that may have their pmp certificate somebody that has um the project management skills not to get too you know technical but like scrum masters you know they'll look for that type of background i think if you were to google maybe project management roles i i think you'll that could open up a lot of different jobs out there and just reading about them again the title could vary depending on the company and it's kind of their structure you know it may not be a project manager but it could be you know just another term doing the same thing or very similar that's helpful thank you linda and this can be not just project management but openended what are companies typically looking for for those softer hard skills i think on on our end um and and some of the other companies i've worked for i think on the softer skill side learnability and curiosity goes a long way so you know we've seen brilliant engineers come in but they're not um you know if the company pivots or the direction of a project pivots they're just really focused on their role they don't go in my opinion as far as the engineer who is always has an appetite for innovation um who's always asking the right question question everything to be honest i mean i think that goes a long way just because a company does a process for so long that doesn't mean it's right you know ask why um i think you know that's helped me in my career in in leveling up and and getting to where i'm at um but i've i've always questioned our processes it's you know and because we do it one year go through a full cycle sometimes too before you question every single thing um see how it's done and then i think taking a serious intake on the inventory of why we do it and then even providing don't just question it um but also providing thoughtful sort of responses as to you know i see we've done it this way for some time i wonder if we could probably introduce this part into the process because i think it might save us time or money or whatever it might be so that curiosity component i think will take you very far in your career thank you and now we're on to our last question uh this question is if we are majoring in computer science but we don't really know if we like coding um we'll graduating with the computer science and coding experience allow me to get a job in the tech sector that won't necessarily deal with coding in other words let's say i graduated with computer science and coding but i'm not sure if i want to do coding what kind of degrees or role maybe roles can i look for at your companies we'll start with natasha for this yeah so you know computer science degree is interesting i i do think the degree itself it doesn't really lend itself to that specific sort of job here i think you know if you wanted to be a developer if you wanted to do even get into the engineering track but you're fresh out of school we're not always looking at what you graduated with or what your major was um i also think taking certificates like aws is offering a ton of certificates you could be aws certified in six months if you wanted to um i think putting things on your resume that you've done a course or you know even outside of traditional schooling maybe you did something in jira or you did something in python or whatever it might be i think some of them are probably more condensed um programs that you can you can look into i think adding that to your resume if you don't want to do the traditional computer science path um can go a long way um i'm always happy by the way too i know this is our last question but to look at resumes and help out i do that on my free time when i volunteer too um so if you always you want to hit me up on linkedin and send along your resume i'm always happy to give some some guidance there nice thank you definitely take that off for y'all and linda can you share a bit more with us sure um i think you know the degree opens the door and again go after what you're passionate about what you're interested in the certificates that that you're interested in i think it's it's great you know put it on your resume um that i have seen folks with a computer science degree and then they're going into more strategy because they just found that passion be openminded have an open aperture join a firm ask questions be innovative um you know network learn from other folks you know their career path look people up on linkedin you know if you find a company that you're interested in you know look at somebody's career path trajectory you know oh well you were a computer science but now you're you know everybody has a story um that i think you just need to you know go after what you know what what you're truly interested in and there's a lot out there i'm happy to review resumes as well um i'm on linkedin ping me so you know good good luck to everybody you know if this is our last question yes that was our last question and really appreciate it um same with our viewers i hope you appreciated it and you have now new folks to add to your corner as well as me so feel free to definitely add us on linkedin as many of you are already doing and chatting and sharing your own linkedin since your peers are your biggest supporters and these could be folks that will hire you in the future as well so with that we have come to an
