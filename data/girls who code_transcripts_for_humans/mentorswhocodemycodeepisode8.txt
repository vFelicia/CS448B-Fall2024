00:06 - hi again it's Shannon it's Mario again
00:09 - it's Britney it's Audrey in this episode
00:11 - of my code we're going to be talking
00:12 - about our mentors who have inspired us
00:14 - to have one of my mentors is my older
00:18 - brother he and I always used to make
00:20 - movies and games together using this
00:21 - program called scratch when we were kids
00:23 - he started actually selling these
00:25 - programs when he was a teenager to
00:26 - people online which is really crazy
00:27 - interesting and I like want to be like
00:29 - that my mentors name is Ashley she works
00:32 - at Instagram as a project manager and
00:34 - she went to school for computer science
00:36 - my mentors are Margaret Hamilton who can
00:39 - vote the code to get humans on the moon
00:42 - Reshma the founder of girls who code and
00:44 - my mom my mentors are older women who
00:47 - have already been in the fields of
00:48 - computer science for a while it's really
00:50 - nice to talk to someone who's or had
00:52 - different jobs at different companies
00:54 - and take their career advice the best
00:59 - piece of advice about coding that I've
01:00 - ever received is to not be afraid to use
01:02 - the internet to help you with your
01:03 - problems coding is not a pop quiz most
01:06 - of your problems can be solved with just
01:08 - a quick internet search I don't think
01:10 - I've ever made a single program without
01:12 - stopping a dozen times to look up how to
01:13 - do things I was really interested in
01:16 - biology and I thought that I wouldn't be
01:18 - able to incorporate code into my love
01:20 - for biology but she introduced to me
01:23 - biomedical engineering and a lot of
01:25 - other possibilities that I could have
01:27 - and overall just help me to understand
01:29 - that I can incorporate coding into
01:31 - anything I love to do we can spend time
01:33 - dreaming about all the possibilities we
01:35 - can create with code but we have to take
01:37 - the time to code it sometimes we psych
01:39 - ourselves out or explore ourselves we
01:41 - can't do something but if we face every
01:44 - single situation thinking why not or I
01:47 - can do this no problem we'll be able to
01:49 - achieve anything some advice that I
01:54 - would give to a girl to inspire her to
01:55 - code is to remind her that the
01:57 - science community is not nearly as
01:59 - closed off or as elitist as it might
02:01 - seem to an outsider even if there are
02:03 - super crazy smart coders they're
02:05 - learning all the time too whether you
02:06 - don't know what code is you've never
02:08 - coded before or find it too difficult i
02:11 - will tell you to just do it coding is
02:13 - like having a superpower you can solve
02:15 - the problems that affect you and your
02:17 - community you can create products that
02:19 - your peers will use and depend on every
02:22 - single day there is absolutely no harm
02:24 - in trying and at the end it will be
02:25 - worth it now that I learned how to code
02:27 - it's constantly pushing me to go out
02:30 - there and learn more about the world
02:32 - around me and if you want to become more
02:34 - aware of what really goes on in this
02:36 - technical world we live in then coding
02:38 - is your perfect guide it's a lot easier
02:40 - to start something new when you have the
02:42 - support of mentors and a community
02:44 - that's what we're creating a movement of
02:45 - girls who code to support one another we
02:48 - want to read your favorite piece of
02:49 - advice leave it in the comments section
02:51 - down below next week we're going to talk
02:53 - about the different careers you can have
02:54 - with code see you then see you then see
02:57 - you then till then bye guys
03:04 - you
