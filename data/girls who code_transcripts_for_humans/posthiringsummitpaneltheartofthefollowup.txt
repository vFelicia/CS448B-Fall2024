03:56 - grateful that you're here with us and we
03:58 - will head into some of our
04:00 - questions so many of our students on
04:04 - this call uh may have had interviews at
04:06 - the hiring Summit or actively in their
04:08 - interview process now and so we're going
04:09 - to focus some of our initial questions
04:11 - on some post interiew etiquette in
04:14 - today's job market and so my question
04:16 - for our panelists um is how important is
04:19 - post interiew etiquette and how does it
04:22 - contribute to a candidate's overall
04:24 - impression and so I'm going to kick us
04:27 - off Emily if you can kind of uh kick us
04:29 - off with just some post interview
04:31 - etiquette tips absolutely um I have a
04:34 - lot to say here so everybody else feel
04:35 - free to jump in at any point but um I
04:38 - think that you know having good
04:40 - etiquette is very important throughout
04:42 - your entire interview process um and
04:44 - that's not just for the candidate but
04:45 - for the company as well that being said
04:48 - today's focus is on the candidate um and
04:51 - the Art of follow-up so I will say you
04:52 - know good etiquette stands out
04:54 - absolutely it can help you stand apart
04:56 - and show how you would treat people in
04:57 - your day-to-day job every single
05:00 - interaction you have with every person
05:01 - at the company really gives the company
05:03 - an idea of the type of person you are
05:06 - and who they're going to be working with
05:07 - in their day-to- day and at the end of
05:09 - the day you spend a ton of time at work
05:11 - you want to make sure that you work at a
05:12 - place that really um has a great culture
05:14 - and people highly contribute to that um
05:17 - I have had incredible candidates just
05:19 - ace every single interview um you know
05:21 - with every single person but then we
05:23 - find out in the debrief that they
05:25 - treated the recruiting coordinator very
05:27 - poorly and because of that you know the
05:30 - the team ended up not moving forward um
05:32 - so what I'll add is that that etiquette
05:35 - is also memorable and not in a good way
05:37 - um I'm sure you've checked out like a
05:38 - restaurant on Yelp or Google reviews and
05:40 - the negative comments really do stand
05:42 - out and are hard to forget I understand
05:44 - that the job market is like very tough
05:46 - it can be super frustrating to go
05:48 - through so many processes um and
05:50 - sometimes people react so I would just
05:53 - really focus on trying to keep composed
05:55 - being true to yourself and being kind
05:57 - because kindness goes a long way
06:00 - love that thanks Emily we're going to
06:02 - touch upon some like post interview like
06:05 - thank you notes and Communications but I
06:07 - think that behavioral kind of in the
06:08 - values uh shown throughout the interview
06:10 - are super important um Adrien really
06:13 - curious on on some etiquette post
06:15 - interview etiquette tips from you as
06:18 - well well that Emil Emily's a tough uh
06:22 - one to follow she has some great points
06:24 - there um but the post interview
06:27 - etiquette uh it's a very important
06:31 - extension uh of of how you show up uh
06:35 - you know it it becomes a additional uh
06:39 - opportunity to just to display your
06:42 - personality um because even if it is is
06:45 - a potentially a written
06:48 - communication uh tone is still uh tone
06:52 - still travels through uh you know your
06:55 - written communication and and it does
06:57 - matter so it's an opportunity to uh put
07:00 - your personality on display uh it also
07:04 - contributes to or can take away from
07:06 - your character
07:08 - attributes uh and as Emily mentioned you
07:11 - know everyone is it's it's a holistic
07:14 - view of that whom all you have uh come
07:16 - in contact with along the way so uh you
07:20 - know you can interview and feel very
07:23 - extremely confident about how you
07:25 - performed in the interview but uh that
07:27 - followup is is equal as important and
07:31 - how you handle people uh through the uh
07:35 - continuation of those
07:38 - Communications that's an interesting
07:40 - perspective too just you know you can
07:41 - nail an interview and get all the right
07:43 - answer or say all the right things and
07:45 - kind of have your your pitch really down
07:48 - packed but the folks the recruiting the
07:50 - talent acquisition manager or whoever
07:52 - along this process the way that you
07:53 - treat them is equally as important to
07:55 - companies that really kind of care that
07:57 - holistic view yes
08:00 - great um Z would love to also hear some
08:03 - of your perspective on kind of in
08:04 - Etiquette and uh contributions to a
08:07 - candidate's overall impression yeah I
08:10 - think um yeah I think Emily and Adrian
08:13 - mentioned really great points just to
08:15 - add to that I guess the written
08:19 - statement that you're going to send to
08:22 - the interviewer or to the recruiter will
08:24 - make you stand out they will make it
08:27 - will make you um memorable so they would
08:32 - remember your name and it's a great
08:35 - opportunity to thank them and to um
08:38 - reiterate your qualifications remind
08:41 - them of who you are and give a glimpse
08:44 - of your personality just like Adrianne
08:46 - said and I think what Emily said it kind
08:50 - of reminded me of something that it
08:53 - shocked me when I started working after
08:56 - getting into corporate life it was I
08:58 - still have a a really great relationship
09:00 - with my recruiter and something it would
09:04 - give you a really great advantage on the
09:06 - long run if you um if you end up getting
09:09 - the job for example you will have
09:12 - someone who can still vouch for you if
09:14 - you get promotions you can um have
09:16 - someone who can recommend you to other
09:18 - teams if you want to transition so
09:19 - having these connections it will help
09:23 - you move really fast later when you're
09:26 - in this company so keeping it
09:28 - professional and sending these thank you
09:30 - notes it can be very um a very small
09:34 - step but it has a really huge impact on
09:37 - the long run so um definitely recommend
09:40 - uh tailoring that into whenever you're
09:43 - uh
09:45 - interviewing and Zaya we actually
09:46 - talking a little bit to our second
09:48 - question and Adrian would love for you
09:49 - to kick us off just specifically like
09:52 - what are some of the key elements of
09:54 - that thank you note after an email right
09:56 - I'm sure we can Google like what's a
09:57 - typical thank you note right that you
09:59 - send post and interview um so
10:01 - specifically like how can candidates
10:03 - really personalize their messages that
10:05 - really um will make a longlasting impact
10:09 - uh to potential recruiters so Adrian
10:10 - I'll hand it to you or Leah I'm sorry
10:13 - Leah oh yeah absolutely so yeah again I
10:17 - agree with everything that was said
10:18 - prior and um I think the way to think
10:21 - about um etiquette and general is that
10:24 - every um every interaction that you
10:27 - experience before during and after your
10:30 - interview is a part of your assessment
10:32 - process so focusing on professionalism
10:35 - the quality of your interactions is is
10:37 - super important so getting to the second
10:39 - question some of the things that are
10:41 - relevant or important for from a thank
10:43 - you note perspective or just general uh
10:45 - follow-up post interview um I I for me
10:49 - the most important um sort of tip or the
10:52 - most important thing to me when I
10:54 - receive a communication is that the
10:56 - individual is genuine so right so what
10:59 - are you truly following up for that
11:02 - could come across very easily in your
11:05 - message right so the tone of your
11:07 - message what you include in your message
11:10 - um the length of your message all of
11:12 - those things I think are important so
11:14 - there's no formula here but um I person
11:16 - and some of this is personal preference
11:18 - as well right so I'm speaking from my
11:20 - personal preference and just my
11:22 - experience with receiving these types of
11:23 - communications were important to me um
11:25 - second to being you know sort of genuine
11:27 - and obviously having a a real reason to
11:30 - follow up the second would be um brevity
11:33 - so being concise and to the point um
11:36 - you've had you know numerous
11:38 - interactions likely prior to that point
11:39 - so you don't need to sort of resell
11:41 - yourself all over again or or send a
11:44 - long you know paragraphs of of
11:46 - information trying to you know again
11:48 - sell yourself because you've had the
11:50 - opportunity to do that so this is an
11:52 - opportunity to show your appreciation to
11:54 - be brief to be positive and to be
11:57 - genuine um those are the the things that
11:59 - I look for and appreciate um in
12:01 - follow-up
12:03 - messages love that aah I was just
12:05 - writing down some of these things they
12:07 - very helpful tips too just tone brevity
12:09 - right positive it's not maybe the time
12:11 - to like resell and kind of list all the
12:13 - bullet points that you might have said
12:15 - verbally um Adrian I I did cut you off
12:19 - um I would love to kind of hear from you
12:20 - next on some uh thank you note tips no
12:24 - no you're fine um I I I would say to you
12:27 - know still keep it formal because it's
12:29 - an opportunity to uh put your business
12:32 - posture on display uh so follow your
12:36 - standard greeting and as far as your
12:38 - body is is concerned always express uh
12:42 - appreciation it's a competitive market
12:44 - so the fact that you were chosen to
12:46 - interview is something that you want to
12:48 - show appreciation for uh you do want to
12:51 - reiterate your your value uh what is the
12:54 - value in bringing you on to to this team
12:57 - and the the organization in question uh
13:00 - show gratitude for a piece of
13:02 - information that the interviewer shared
13:04 - whether it was about them personally um
13:07 - or about the company its values Etc U
13:11 - but that does show that you were were
13:13 - listening um and and that you did uh
13:15 - receive and retain that information and
13:18 - then of course your your closing and so
13:21 - that's again keeping with uh good
13:23 - business posture and and a formal uh
13:26 - response similar to what Aaliyah said
13:28 - it's always also important to you know
13:30 - person you can personalize it by simply
13:33 - being authentic if there's a quote or a
13:36 - catchphrase that might be important to
13:38 - you or really reflect your values uh
13:41 - your thought process as whatever the
13:43 - role may be um that's always a nice
13:47 - touch and I know I mentioned several
13:49 - things but being brief how piggyback
13:51 - Aaliyah on on that you do want to uh be
13:55 - brief but inclusive of all of those
13:57 - things now what I will add in closing uh
14:01 - in the spirit of whom our audience is in
14:04 - the generation uh I would say in the
14:06 - room but in our virtual in our virtual
14:09 - room uh chat GPT is very popular you
14:15 - know and and and it can uh it's it's
14:17 - very nice you know your your output is
14:20 - as good as your your input uh if you do
14:23 - feel compelled to use it to boost to
14:26 - boost your confidence you know it is
14:28 - defin itely uh it definitely becomes
14:30 - more important that you personalize that
14:34 - uh and add some
14:36 - authenticity uh to it because especially
14:38 - if you're in in Tech uh those of us that
14:41 - are familiar with AI also know those
14:44 - familiar AI uh
14:48 - words that are frequently uh used in
14:51 - those outputs that that you receive so
14:55 - that's that's uh that's my perspective
14:58 - thing yes no we talk a lot internally
15:02 - about you know AI the advantages watch
15:05 - outs you know some of the risks and
15:06 - really kind of just you know educate our
15:08 - students on you know being authentic
15:10 - right and using it to their advantage um
15:13 - but being mindful of the risks and so
15:15 - yeah thank you for mentioning
15:18 - that uh Emily I'll hand it to you just
15:20 - some elements of a CFT full thank you
15:23 - note after an interview yeah absolutely
15:25 - so I was going to start it how Adrien
15:28 - ended it actually I was going to say you
15:30 - know um Aaliyah and Adrien both brought
15:32 - up great points which is to be genuine
15:34 - and authentic so you have to really be
15:36 - careful with chat GPT or any of the
15:38 - other um AI tools and make sure that you
15:40 - do personalize it they hit on a lot of
15:42 - the points that I would hit on which is
15:44 - keep it short we don't want it to be a
15:46 - novel it doesn't have to be one sentence
15:48 - right but you know don't want it to be
15:50 - too long um I would say continue
15:52 - building Rapport at the end of the day
15:54 - people thrive off connecting with others
15:56 - sometimes in the interview you may learn
15:58 - something about the interviewer like I
16:00 - don't know if you have extra time and
16:02 - they talk about like oh my favorite show
16:03 - is How I Met Your Mother and you're like
16:05 - oh well have you seen how I met your
16:07 - father and they say no and the thank you
16:09 - note maybe you can say hey make sure you
16:10 - watch this episode it's really great or
16:12 - whatever it is right try to build that
16:14 - connection um and then I would say the
16:17 - third one is after you interview I
16:20 - understand that sometimes it can it can
16:23 - be a little scary your mind might race
16:25 - you know you might say like oh I could
16:26 - have answered this better or I was so
16:28 - wrong when I said that um I think that
16:31 - it could be a really good opportunity to
16:33 - say Hey you know I was really thinking
16:35 - about this question and you know what I
16:37 - would love to add is
16:39 - XYZ again don't get too long with it um
16:43 - but it's a good opportunity to continue
16:45 - sort of those things as well um so I
16:48 - think that Aaliyah and Adrian hit the
16:50 - rest of what I would say as well but
16:51 - that's that's all I really have to add I
16:54 - love that uh especially like building
16:55 - off that you know the personalized piece
16:57 - too that trigger you know the recruiter
17:00 - to just remember or just you know uh
17:02 - keep you in the back of their mind I
17:04 - love that um I'm going to head into my
17:06 - next question because I think maybe chat
17:08 - GPT might be uh a common mistake or uh
17:12 - you know part of a pitfall maybe that
17:13 - job Seekers now should avoid or just be
17:16 - mindful of when crafting your thank you
17:18 - notes so I'll start with you ZB on just
17:20 - like any common mistakes or pitfalls
17:23 - that job she Seeker should avoid maybe
17:25 - when crafting those
17:27 - notes
17:29 - I think for me it would be the length
17:31 - they already tou the they already
17:33 - touched on um the length of the emails
17:36 - you don't need a whole letter um be
17:41 - because it would just not be read That's
17:44 - be um straightforward it won't be read
17:48 - corporate life is very busy people don't
17:50 - have a lot of time to dedicate to that
17:53 - just be concise and I think uh bullet
17:56 - points or uh um I don't know you can
18:01 - just have smaller paragraphs but just be
18:04 - concise and straightforward to the point
18:06 - and um it will be very helpful to just
18:09 - stand out and keep it memorable and the
18:12 - recruiter or the interviewer's um
18:16 - memory absolutely thank you for that um
18:20 - Al I'll turn it over to you yeah I'd say
18:23 - you know to to piggy back here you know
18:27 - kind of the opposite every that we you
18:29 - know sort of suggested that you do do
18:31 - right you know too long reliving the
18:34 - interview um you know sort of not being
18:37 - professional or authentic Etc um but in
18:40 - addition to that I'll just say to
18:42 - another um to to the earlier point you
18:44 - know sometimes it is a little bit
18:46 - nerve-wracking after an interview is
18:48 - concluded you want to know when am I
18:50 - going to hear back and you know have
18:52 - there been any decisions made and so
18:54 - sometimes you can get anxious and it
18:56 - feels like time is dragging right for
18:57 - the C candidate um so I would say also
19:00 - be careful about following up um too
19:02 - soon or too often right so um certainly
19:07 - a well-placed you know brief genuine
19:09 - thank you note is
19:11 - appropriate beyond that following up for
19:13 - status updates um i' be careful about
19:16 - that right you want to be very um
19:19 - attentive and cognizant as to what the
19:21 - recruiter or hiring manager shares with
19:23 - you pertaining to the process and when
19:25 - you can expect a hear back and really
19:27 - lean into sort of that guidance when
19:29 - you're determining whether you should
19:31 - follow up or or when you should follow
19:33 - up or how often you should follow up so
19:35 - I'd say just being patient um is
19:38 - important as well and not following up
19:40 - too soon or too
19:43 - often that's great I'm also going to
19:45 - make a plug for Q&A for students I have
19:48 - maybe one or two more questions and I
19:50 - would definitely love to hear from y'all
19:52 - um I'm going a little off script just
19:54 - cuz I'm I I love hearing kind of
19:55 - personal anecdotes and stories about
19:57 - maybe
19:58 - you know things that you've implemented
20:00 - or strategy so I'm just really curious
20:03 - um to hear from you all and maybe I'll
20:05 - start with you Adrian on just kind of
20:07 - like a PO interview practice um that you
20:10 - really that or successful experience
20:12 - that you've had or maybe not so good of
20:15 - a one that you've really learned from I
20:17 - know you know hearing from you know
20:19 - different challenges and experiences are
20:20 - really helpful for our students as well
20:23 - um so just kind of like how it kind of
20:24 - resonates with you and manifests maybe
20:26 - in some of your your post interview
20:29 - processes um let's
20:33 - see this wasn't part of the this wasn't
20:35 - part of the SCP no pressure no and you
20:38 - know I'm thinking because I I um I
20:41 - interviewed last year for the first time
20:45 - in seven
20:48 - years and actually had the the blessing
20:52 - of um uh being hired for the first
20:56 - position I applied for so I'm digging in
20:59 - the archive a bit because it's it's
21:01 - certainly been a journey you know
21:03 - getting to that point um so I would say
21:06 - one one thing you know if if I look back
21:10 - um I think there was a time where I was
21:14 - uh I would avoid the the followup not
21:18 - the thank you I would send a a a thank
21:20 - you um but I would sometimes I would not
21:24 - always rather
21:26 - uh send in a um inquiry for a followup
21:31 - to the recruiter um I would just you
21:34 - know assume it you know it it got the
21:38 - position was filled you know they
21:39 - selected another candidate or um even
21:43 - that the the position was with the Drone
21:46 - so um that was actually an extension
21:48 - that I was going to add to Aaliyah's
21:51 - feedback um for the previous question is
21:54 - is in keeping with uh proper etiquette
21:58 - in conducting the followup is is to not
22:00 - be afraid um to hesit to Don't Be Afraid
22:05 - uh to to seek out um updates on on
22:10 - status of that position but um you know
22:13 - because that also helps you to get
22:15 - feedback so I would say in my experience
22:18 - that's something that uh during those
22:20 - times I could have done better and uh
22:24 - where I would have gotten feedback I'm
22:25 - sure it would have helped me with
22:27 - improving uh my interview uh
22:30 - etiquette in in the additional
22:32 - opportunities to
22:34 - come thank you for sharing and going off
22:36 - script with me no problem this is a
22:39 - little bit related to a Q&A question
22:41 - from Alicia um that we have you know
22:43 - just on timing right generally of like
22:46 - what's a good time to follow up after an
22:48 - interview is it a day is it the same day
22:50 - is it a few days after like kind of
22:52 - striking that balance between being
22:54 - pushy and you know but also kind of
22:56 - giving time for things to set settle so
22:58 - just really curious um and maybe we'll
23:00 - start with you Emily just on like
23:03 - subjectively like what would be a timing
23:05 - that you you know think is the nice
23:07 - sweet spot yeah well um I think first
23:10 - and foremost what I would say is to get
23:13 - clarity beforehand um ask the recruiter
23:16 - you know like hey when should I
23:18 - anticipate you know an answer by um so
23:20 - that way you kind of have an idea and
23:22 - then they'll give you the answer to that
23:24 - basically so if they're like oh you know
23:26 - we may have an answer in three days to
23:27 - five days then I would wait till that
23:30 - fifth day and when you do follow up I
23:33 - would just make it like very brief
23:34 - nothing very long again you know just
23:36 - basically saying like hey you know just
23:38 - wanted to reiterate my excitement for
23:40 - the role appreciate everyone's time if
23:42 - you have any updates I'd love to hear
23:44 - about them right so yeah and this is
23:47 - actually speaking to a really good
23:48 - question that another student had like
23:50 - what's the difference between like a
23:51 - thank you note right like thank you for
23:52 - your interview and then followup right
23:54 - and so maybe like the timing of that
23:56 - thank you note post
23:58 - interview that you just had and then the
24:00 - follow-up piece like what would be the
24:02 - difference um and maybe the timing
24:05 - differentiation there um Aaliyah maybe
24:07 - I'll I'll hand it to you yeah yeah I
24:10 - think the thank you note placed um
24:12 - pretty immediately after the interview
24:15 - process when you're still fresh in the
24:16 - person's mind and you still have a
24:18 - little bit of momentum to potentially
24:20 - sort of continue to sort of add to the
24:22 - experience that the individual had with
24:24 - you so I'd say within a day uh two at
24:27 - Max for the followup pertaining to the
24:29 - thank you note and then I agree
24:31 - completely with with what Emily shared
24:33 - you know listening in and and asking
24:35 - actually proactively asking if the
24:36 - recruiter doesn't share with you when
24:38 - you can expect to hear back certainly
24:41 - let that time lapse and then maybe the
24:43 - next day you know following up um
24:45 - because at that point it's a fair ask
24:47 - right you you've been there's an
24:49 - expectation set that you would hear back
24:50 - in five days and if you haven't then
24:52 - it's fair to follow up and again again
24:55 - just to reiterate what Emily said you
24:56 - know just a very quick you know
24:59 - positively phrase message that again I
25:01 - appreciate your time I'm still very
25:03 - interested in the role would love an
25:05 - update or um you know please let me know
25:07 - when I can expect to hear back from you
25:10 - um so yeah I love that yeah and too I
25:14 - mean I would I say this kind of go you
25:16 - know the other thing to consider too in
25:18 - that followup this is less related to
25:20 - sort of how you know when you follow up
25:21 - but also things to consider you know
25:24 - again time sort of stands still when
25:26 - you're waiting to hear right but on the
25:28 - recruiter's end things are moving very
25:30 - fast right and you never know what the
25:33 - delay might be right the person who has
25:36 - to approve your offer could be on
25:37 - vacation for a couple of days or you
25:40 - know there could be some interviews
25:42 - complet you know final interviews that
25:44 - are occurring and all of those need to
25:46 - have happened before final decisions are
25:48 - made so there's all kinds of different
25:50 - things that can um affect that timeline
25:54 - and so again some of it is just really
25:56 - sort of uh you know talking yourself
25:59 - into being patient along with following
26:01 - up you know well-placed followup but um
26:04 - but also being patient and understanding
26:05 - that there's a lot of factors that could
26:08 - go into the delay it's not um I guess
26:10 - ultimately the summary is don't take
26:12 - that personally you know um but but
26:14 - again it's fair to follow up if you if
26:16 - if there's been an expectation set or if
26:19 - there wasn't an expectation set and
26:21 - let's say you forgot to ask then I would
26:24 - say give it a week right and then that's
26:26 - kind of my personal rule of thumb U or
26:30 - or what I would appreciate in terms of
26:32 - you know just sort of the the time Grace
26:35 - uh before that
26:37 - followup absolutely I love that and I
26:39 - think that's answering a little bit of
26:40 - what Nicole um wrote in our Q&A just
26:43 - around is it appropriate to ask at the
26:44 - end at the end of an interview next
26:46 - steps and I think the vibe that we're
26:48 - getting is yes that's appropriate so you
26:50 - have a timeline to kind of coordinate
26:51 - your followup and there's expectation
26:54 - set there and and and just to jump in I
26:57 - mean a good recruiter is going to share
26:59 - that with you proactively right so they
27:01 - kind of owe you that information um as a
27:05 - recruiter um again this is just a
27:06 - personal uh personal opinion but um but
27:09 - yeah but so therefore yes if if not then
27:12 - I think it's quite quite appropriate to
27:14 - ask
27:15 - yes and this is taking it a step further
27:18 - Avery asked if an interview involves
27:20 - multiple people at once should I follow
27:23 - up with separate emails per person or
27:25 - one message with all interviews viers
27:28 - included and I think I've been on the
27:30 - receiving end of both ends of those but
27:33 - um I'll uh I'll maybe pass it to you
27:36 - Adrian and zanab and kind of your
27:38 - perspectives on
27:40 - it um I would say I I would say
27:45 - all-inclusive um is okay unless you felt
27:49 - as though there was a uh connection made
27:55 - with one of the candidates and then you
27:58 - wouldn't want to send it to the group
28:00 - and then that candidate individually um
28:02 - so go one way or or the other uh but
28:06 - there should if you're doing them
28:08 - individually uh it should be to
28:10 - capitalize on an opportunity to connect
28:14 - with them uh individually by way of
28:17 - something that was specific to them or
28:19 - something they they said um or or a just
28:23 - some sort of level of connection uh by
28:26 - way of of the answer for you
28:29 - so
28:32 - absolutely add to that um I guess I I
28:36 - believe that quality is over quantity so
28:39 - if you built that kind of connection
28:41 - with one of the interviewers just um try
28:46 - to hone on that and lean into that
28:48 - connection that you built and make it as
28:50 - personal as possible because if you
28:52 - stand out for that interviewer he still
28:54 - they can still vouch for you uh so so
28:58 - that's treat it as a power of a or
29:01 - strength that you can leverage for your
29:03 - own
29:05 - benefit that's great we have a a
29:08 - question oh no go ahead sorry Ain I I
29:11 - just wanted to add um to that that if
29:15 - you interview with a panel the
29:17 - decisionmaking is likely going to happen
29:20 - uh as a group so being sure to
29:23 - capitalize I'll say on that connection
29:27 - uh certainly does give you an advocate
29:29 - for yourself at the table uh when that
29:32 - group comes back together for
29:34 - decision-making
29:35 - purposes so that was a good call
29:39 - out and we have a question in the in the
29:41 - Q&A around preferred methods of contact
29:45 - right so there may be some hiring
29:47 - managers or recruiter that prefer email
29:49 - or LinkedIn um is it appropriate to ask
29:53 - them or interviewers in that if we don't
29:55 - have that information prior
29:58 - maybe hand it over to you
30:00 - Emily um yeah it's definitely
30:02 - appropriate to ask um I would always
30:05 - like lean on emails first though by the
30:07 - way unless you've asked like hey can I
30:09 - connect with you on LinkedIn what I
30:10 - would not do is like try to find their
30:12 - Instagram or Facebook or any other
30:14 - social media because that does happen um
30:17 - so I would avoid that and really you
30:20 - know focus on email or ask hey like do
30:22 - you mind if I connect with you on
30:23 - LinkedIn so we can stay in
30:25 - touch there was actually something in
30:27 - the chat that I saw Emily Grove you
30:29 - wrote just being mindful of the timing
30:31 - of your interview I'm wondering how much
30:34 - on the receiving and the recruiting side
30:35 - we actually look at that if it's an
30:37 - email sent at 3: in the morning versus 3
30:40 - in the afternoon like how does that you
30:42 - know from a recruiting perspective like
30:44 - how does that land or does that hold any
30:46 - weight in some decision making um so
30:48 - feel free anyone to kind of come off of
30:50 - mute and and share
30:52 - Reflections I have stuff to say yeah
30:55 - please go please go I I was going to say
30:58 - not so much for me I think everybody has
31:00 - their own schedules and boundaries in
31:02 - terms of when they're logging in and
31:04 - when they're accepting emails so if
31:06 - someone's sending it at 3 in the morning
31:08 - I won't get it until you know 9 or so
31:11 - the next morning and that's fine um with
31:15 - you know again personal preference um I
31:17 - think you know some of it is as well but
31:19 - um but yeah that I I don't think that is
31:21 - going to um sort of make or break um or
31:24 - would be a sort of major you know
31:26 - etiquette faux if you were sending a
31:28 - message at a time when someone else
31:29 - typically wouldn't be logged in yeah I
31:32 - 100% agree everybody has different
31:35 - things going on in their lives and maybe
31:37 - you know what works for them is to email
31:39 - you at 3: a. and nobody should be judged
31:41 - for that at the end of the day right and
31:43 - certain companies you'll learn as you go
31:45 - through the process also have that view
31:47 - on the way that they work in their
31:49 - culture like I know our company and a
31:51 - couple others like gitlab Etc like it's
31:53 - very much like they care about outcomes
31:56 - not specific like the hours that you
31:57 - work from 9: to 5 or whatever it is it's
31:59 - like you get your stuff done when you
32:01 - can make your meetings of course but
32:03 - yeah so I would just say really do
32:06 - what's best for you in that aspect we
32:10 - also know we're we're working with
32:11 - students too so we know student
32:13 - schedules are very different from ours
32:15 - as well so and I think to to what Emily
32:19 - clarified in the chat too it's more
32:20 - about being at the top of your inbox
32:22 - right like it may get buried and maybe
32:24 - automated things or sends and so just
32:27 - you know kind of being mindful of maybe
32:28 - the time zone of yourself and on the
32:31 - recruiting end but life so Aaron if I if
32:35 - I may um just to add to that in the
32:37 - technology space we can sometimes become
32:39 - the the city that never sleeps right and
32:42 - so uh I I think the the danger in
32:46 - sending uh something late super late
32:48 - night or the middle of the night you
32:50 - have the potential for that person to be
32:53 - online um and if they read it during
32:55 - that that time it could you know they
32:58 - can maybe not lend as much attention to
33:00 - it or it fall off the radar so while it
33:02 - wouldn't be um you know any anything
33:05 - that that would create anyone to create
33:07 - any have any judgments past judgment or
33:10 - or anything um there is always the
33:12 - opportunity to use your technology and
33:16 - the great features that are associated
33:18 - to most emails and uh simply schedule it
33:23 - for you know maybe a 7 7:30 8 8 am uh
33:27 - type of time that would uh in accordance
33:29 - to their time zone if you're aware at it
33:32 - that would be a nice you know top of the
33:35 - inbox uh ready to be read morning email
33:38 - for that
33:39 - interviewer yes that's one that's a
33:41 - really good point particularly if you
33:44 - are talking about like two in the
33:46 - morning on Saturday or you know that
33:49 - then you're you know Friday night
33:51 - Saturday then you're talking about you
33:52 - know a couple days pass before that
33:54 - Monday morning so get great great points
33:58 - I
33:59 - agree I think even Beyond right in the
34:01 - workplace too I I'm very mindful of that
34:03 - I have small children and sometimes I
34:05 - work past 10 o'clock and I don't want my
34:07 - team to think that they need to read an
34:09 - email at 11: p.m. right so that schedule
34:11 - set comes in in
34:12 - handy um I'm going to switch gears a
34:15 - little bit um because I'm I'm thinking
34:17 - more so um and Emily from girls who
34:20 - could had this question um is it
34:22 - appropriate to ask for feedback and this
34:24 - is if you've had kind of the interview
34:27 - I'm really curious maybe post interview
34:30 - um immediate just for feedback but also
34:32 - maybe if you don't get the job right and
34:34 - kind of you you know you're not moving
34:35 - forward in the interview process um
34:38 - asking for feedback about your answers
34:40 - or performance like how does that feel
34:42 - um and is that
34:47 - appropriate maybe I jump in and sorry
34:53 - z um I think it might depend on the
34:56 - company itself in this case because I've
34:59 - had um some of the big companies that
35:01 - interviewed for they were were not
35:04 - allowed to provide me with Fe feedback
35:06 - because it was confidential and they
35:07 - were not allowed to share uh however if
35:11 - you interview with startups or um
35:14 - smaller companies and you're you have a
35:17 - a TI let's say a more personal uh
35:19 - relationship with a recruiter you can um
35:22 - get feedback so I remember receiving uh
35:25 - written feedback as well
35:27 - so it doesn't hurt to ask make sure you
35:30 - ask and whether it's yes or no it's um
35:33 - you'll still get your
35:36 - answer I think Aaliyah had something to
35:38 - say to add to that yes agreed you it I
35:41 - don't believe it's inappropriate to ask
35:44 - but just be prepared that some companies
35:46 - have a policy not to provide interview
35:48 - feedback for legal reasons um deoy being
35:51 - one of them we're an accounting firm so
35:53 - we're you know conservative when it
35:55 - comes to Legal risk for example so um I
35:58 - think you know generally um there's a
36:01 - wide spectrum of of answers that you'll
36:03 - get um but I don't think it's in
36:04 - appropriate to ask and you may just get
36:06 - lucky and strike a good um rapport with
36:10 - an interviewer or your recruiter and
36:11 - that person may be personally willing to
36:13 - share tidbits of information with you as
36:16 - well so again completely appropriate to
36:18 - ask but just be prepared that you might
36:20 - not get a formal
36:22 - answer yeah I oh go ahead please Adrian
36:28 - okay um yeah I plus one to that
36:30 - absolutely and I think also it depends
36:32 - how you ask I've worked at companies
36:34 - that you know the legal ramifications
36:35 - were much higher um and then at startups
36:38 - where if somebody just says like you
36:40 - know I had a really great time but I
36:43 - understand it didn't work out but like I
36:44 - want to get better because I'm
36:45 - interviewing at other places is there
36:47 - anything you can do to just kind of help
36:48 - me get to that next up or whatever it is
36:51 - right like I find that when people ask
36:53 - that way where it's like a learning of
36:55 - like I want to get better for my other
36:57 - interviews um you kind when you're a
36:59 - recruiter you kind of understand some
37:00 - people ask that way and then it's like
37:02 - no like what did I do wrong because I
37:03 - thought that this would be like the role
37:05 - for me right so you just kind of gauge
37:08 - so I think it's all in how you ask as
37:11 - well abolutely
37:13 - Adrian anything to
37:15 - add uh it's it's not a whole lot
37:18 - different um I was just gonna say
37:20 - maintain emotional intelligence uh when
37:23 - you're asking and and that can
37:25 - definitely improve uh the chances on on
37:29 - the organization being willing to engage
37:32 - and it really just falls under the
37:34 - perview of nothing beats a failure but a
37:37 - try you know though they will either the
37:39 - organization will either deny the
37:41 - feedback um or give you some feedback
37:43 - that as Emily said really helps you as
37:45 - you progress through the additional uh
37:48 - interviewing
37:51 - opportunities we have a a questioning
37:53 - Q&A and this I think relates a little
37:54 - bit zanib to what you were talking about
37:56 - in terms of maintaining relationships
37:58 - with the person who interviewed you or
38:00 - the recruiter um so we have a question
38:02 - in the chat how do you suggest
38:04 - maintaining a connection with a
38:05 - recruiter even if you don't accept an
38:07 - offer or you don't move move along in
38:10 - the interview
38:12 - process I really like that question um
38:15 - and Z neb I don't know if you have any
38:17 - kind of like personal experience of you
38:19 - know maintaining a relationship with one
38:20 - of the folks who kind of interviewed you
38:22 - along in the interview process but um
38:25 - that's for you you had the job but maybe
38:27 - how do how do folks kind of maintain
38:29 - that connection even if they don't
38:30 - necessarily get the job and is that
38:33 - appropriate I think always following up
38:36 - in um what One Mentor that I had said uh
38:42 - you have to follow up even New Year's
38:44 - you know Christmas you can just send
38:46 - these small notes and emails after these
38:49 - things happen like after the interview
38:51 - you you were rejected or you didn't
38:54 - accept the offer you can always reach
38:55 - out and keep that connection alive with
38:58 - uh reaching out in um occas these
39:01 - occasions so you can keep the uh the
39:05 - relationship alive with with the
39:07 - interviewer or the recruiter um in my
39:10 - experience I it was quite different it
39:13 - wasn't um
39:15 - a job application but it was more of um
39:19 - a mentorship with Google in a program
39:22 - that happened and I ended up following
39:25 - up with my Mentor that I had from there
39:28 - and we kept meeting almost like every 3
39:31 - months and he would um assist me and
39:34 - then he ended up uh being my mentor and
39:37 - for my thesis and my undergrad and it
39:40 - was voluntarily done so people are
39:42 - willing to help if you just know how to
39:45 - maintain the relationship and um know
39:48 - how to follow up uh and I guess building
39:51 - that connection you know in the
39:52 - beginning where you both have that spark
39:56 - where you're interested in the same
39:58 - thing or you just have the I don't know
40:00 - very um common things that happen in or
40:03 - you show a lot of interest in what they
40:05 - do um I think that can help a
40:10 - lot yeah that's great and how do we feel
40:14 - a follow-up question to this and anyone
40:16 - can come off of uh of mute
40:19 - um how do y'all feel about or thoughts
40:23 - on connecting and following with folks
40:25 - outside of email but connecting on
40:27 - LinkedIn right is that something that
40:28 - you may be ask in the interview or if
40:30 - you have interviewees that find you on
40:32 - LinkedIn and friend you or kind of add
40:35 - you as a connection kind of what are
40:36 - some of your thoughts on that kind of
40:39 - maintaining that you know that
40:40 - connection that relationship with a with
40:42 - a recruiter um Aaliyah maybe I'll hand
40:45 - it to
40:46 - you yeah so I think because LinkedIn is
40:49 - a professional social media Outlet um
40:52 - it's completely appropriate to send a
40:55 - request um um you know again a brief
40:58 - well-placed uh professional request to
41:01 - connect um and that person will you know
41:04 - accept or not accept your request and it
41:07 - might be based on their preferences but
41:08 - I think it's completely appropriate to
41:10 - send um again I would just be prepared
41:13 - that not everyone is um on the same
41:16 - level in terms of they are their social
41:19 - media presence in activity so I'm
41:22 - probably one who is um you know guilty
41:25 - of not being on LinkedIn on a daily
41:28 - basis and so again I sometimes log into
41:32 - LinkedIn and see that someone sent me a
41:34 - message quite some time ago right just
41:36 - because that's I live in email and sort
41:39 - of in that you know email and instant
41:41 - messaging um and so um I say it's
41:44 - completely appropriate but just
41:46 - understand that people have different
41:47 - sort of preferences and levels of
41:49 - activity within so again don't take it
41:52 - personally perhaps if someone doesn't uh
41:54 - accept your request it may just be that
41:56 - they're not often um you know present
41:59 - online and or you know they'll accept
42:01 - your request once they do log in but um
42:04 - but yeah I think it's completely
42:05 - appropriate given that LinkedIn is
42:07 - utilized for professional purposes
42:12 - primarily sorry no go ahead Emily um you
42:15 - could also leave a note on the LinkedIn
42:18 - connection like there's an option to
42:20 - send a note with it so you could just
42:21 - say like it was great meeting you during
42:22 - this interview or something very
42:25 - brief
42:26 - that's
42:27 - great um I know the focus of our
42:30 - conversation has primarily been on like
42:31 - post interiew etiquette but we do have a
42:34 - question from Emily in the chat just
42:35 - around post application etiquette and so
42:39 - Zab I know you talked a little bit about
42:40 - kind of your Mentor for the the program
42:42 - that you had um but any kind of
42:44 - differences or similarities for like
42:46 - applying into a program whether that's
42:49 - kind of an internship a summer program
42:51 - um and any kind of etiquette um
42:53 - considerations
42:55 - there
42:58 - um so when you apply you don't really
43:01 - have uh any emails of the recruiters yet
43:05 - so post application when you first apply
43:08 - with the resume scanning and everything
43:10 - you might not have the ability to follow
43:12 - up or just send
43:15 - Um send a an email however if you are
43:19 - referred I think it would be a great
43:22 - idea
43:23 - to um follow up with whoever referred
43:26 - you to that position and thank them and
43:29 - be and also follow up regarding the
43:32 - progress of the application because they
43:34 - receive um updates regarding your
43:37 - applications so you can at least find
43:38 - out how uh how well you've done on um
43:44 - the scanning resume scanning process and
43:46 - everything so but in the beginning of
43:49 - the application process you might not
43:51 - have the ability to do that
43:52 - unfortunately so save that the all the
43:55 - efforts for post
43:58 - interview to piggyback off of that
44:01 - actually too in addition to you know
44:03 - someone who might have referred you for
44:04 - a position to kind of stay on the
44:07 - LinkedIn topic for a minute another
44:09 - approach or possibility is for you to
44:12 - seek out individuals on LinkedIn who
44:15 - work for that particular company and who
44:17 - have something else common in your
44:19 - background so one of my favorites is um
44:22 - you know Duke graduates right if if
44:25 - someone reaches out to me and says hey I
44:27 - saw your LinkedIn profile I see you're a
44:29 - Duke um Fuca School of Business graduate
44:32 - I've applied for a role at deoe would
44:34 - you be willing to speak with me for 10
44:35 - or 15 minutes about you know opportunity
44:37 - that Delo I'm going to say yes every
44:39 - single time because um you know one I
44:42 - love talking about opportunities at deoe
44:45 - two the person you know sort of took the
44:47 - time and initiative to reach out and
44:49 - three importantly we share something in
44:51 - common and have a you know sort of
44:53 - commonality in our background so that's
44:54 - something else and again you
44:56 - you're not going to get a 100% response
44:58 - rate from the individuals who you reach
45:00 - out on uh to on LinkedIn but again you
45:04 - don't try you don't know so um so I
45:06 - think you know mining LinkedIn for
45:08 - connections of that sort and and
45:10 - requesting connections even if it's kind
45:12 - of a cold call um type of Outreach can
45:15 - work as well yeah that speaks to the
45:18 - personalized aspect too I think I'm
45:20 - always going to be a a sucker for folks
45:22 - that have we've gone to we have the same
45:23 - Alma Mo right fut a fellow Alum that's
45:27 - applying you know into girls who code or
45:30 - you know a partnering company that
45:32 - resonates with me a
45:35 - lot um I have we don't have any more
45:39 - questions in the Q&A but please I think
45:41 - we have time for a few more um but one
45:45 - question is around and let me find it
45:48 - because this was a really great question
45:49 - that Emily had posed um so let's say
45:52 - that you actually get another offer so
45:54 - in that kind of waiting period to hear
45:55 - here back on next steps final interviews
45:58 - um you know you you get another offer
46:00 - and you accept it how do you communicate
46:03 - that to the first company or the you
46:05 - know the other company that you've been
46:06 - interviewing with um you know like how
46:09 - does that how does that communication
46:11 - kind of work in terms of like you have
46:13 - another counter offer or you have
46:15 - something else kind of in the works um
46:17 - how should that communication
46:20 - be maybe I'll pass it to you Emily I see
46:22 - the the thinking the thinking face and
46:25 - maybe I made that
46:27 - um I mean I would say like obviously
46:30 - give the same respect that you would
46:31 - want and throughout the process
46:33 - hopefully your recruiters asking you
46:34 - where you are in your stage as well but
46:36 - I think that that communication should
46:38 - be there on both ends um and so I would
46:41 - recommend you know if it's not when you
46:43 - get to a final interview you can say you
46:45 - know I'm anticipating an offer I don't
46:47 - know my timeline I'll let you know if
46:49 - you do end up getting an offer it
46:51 - depends if you're really interested in
46:53 - this other role or not right if you're
46:54 - not and you just want to accept then you
46:56 - just let them know hey you know
46:58 - unfortunately you know I'm no longer
46:59 - available I got another offer I
47:01 - appreciate your time and really you know
47:03 - be gracious about that if you are still
47:05 - interested I would just let them know
47:07 - you know hey I have received another
47:09 - offer this is how much time I have to
47:11 - make the decision which that's also
47:13 - negotiable by the way a lot of people
47:15 - don't know that you can ask for more
47:16 - time if you need more time to make your
47:18 - decision um but yeah and and then I
47:21 - would let them know you know I have this
47:22 - amount of time um so I just am kind of
47:25 - wondering things are at and then it's up
47:26 - to them to make a decision they either
47:28 - move forward or they don't at that time
47:29 - because now they know they have a time
47:31 - limit so yeah that's a great piece too
47:34 - and like a distinction like if you were
47:35 - really interested in that first company
47:37 - right like without sounding like you're
47:39 - giving ultimates in some ways but being
47:41 - just really honest with your timeline
47:43 - right for decision
47:45 - making so Erin one thing I'll I'll add
47:48 - to that is I think people sometimes want
47:50 - a company to think that they they love
47:52 - them so much that uh you know they're
47:54 - putting all their eggs in one basket so
47:57 - to speak uh one thing that can help with
47:59 - that is if you are actively interviewing
48:03 - you know you can also make that known at
48:06 - the time of your interview as well you
48:08 - know I'm very interested in your company
48:11 - your values align with my values the
48:13 - position uh sounds as though it's an
48:15 - excellent fit uh I do want to make you
48:18 - aware that I am actively
48:21 - interviewing uh with other organizations
48:24 - and and so
48:26 - it it creates you know when especially
48:29 - when you're a strong candidate it
48:30 - creates a sense of urgency for the
48:33 - organization if they are very interested
48:36 - in you because they don't want you to to
48:38 - get away so don't be hesitant you know
48:42 - to to communicate that uh as a part of
48:45 - your interview process as well so that
48:47 - you don't get away you know and go
48:50 - through the whole negotiation and you
48:53 - know they can just
48:54 - come you know Straight Out The Gate and
48:57 - and send you that that offer um because
49:00 - we we do make immediate decisions uh we
49:03 - don't you know
49:05 - so I would just add to um you just in
49:09 - general to be transparent I think is
49:11 - appreciated right just as you expect you
49:14 - uh we talked a lot about you know
49:16 - hearing back from companies and sort of
49:17 - knowing what's going on and there in and
49:19 - it's the same the other way around too I
49:21 - know when I was a recruiter and it would
49:23 - extend offers to candidates I would
49:24 - actually ask
49:26 - um are you considering any other offers
49:28 - are you you know considering offers
49:30 - outside of consultant you know there
49:32 - were you nice ways to ask the candidate
49:34 - as well you know sort of what they have
49:36 - going on as a candidate um I'd be
49:38 - transparent just so that you know people
49:41 - know where you stand and they understand
49:43 - that you're very interested but you also
49:44 - have other options so um that motivates
49:47 - them to do the same and then sometimes
49:50 - to move your process along if needed um
49:52 - if they really want you so yeah you're
49:55 - not going to lose an opportunity because
49:57 - you're interviewing elsewhere so don't
49:59 - be scared of that if that is something
50:01 - that you would ever be scared of yeah
50:03 - and Emily you did mention though like
50:05 - you can ask for more time like once you
50:07 - let's say you got an offer from a
50:08 - company that is lowering your priority
50:10 - list like how how much time could you
50:13 - realistically ask for like what's the
50:15 - appropriate amount of extension maybe to
50:17 - make that decision or to wait to hear
50:18 - back from another company absolutely I
50:21 - mean it's going to depend it's on a
50:24 - couple things right like how transparent
50:25 - you were at the beginning so I'll give
50:27 - you an example um at one of the
50:29 - companies that I was at previously there
50:31 - was a candidate that we interviewed and
50:33 - she let me know right off the bat my
50:34 - goal is to interview this month I would
50:37 - like to make a decision within that the
50:39 - first week of the next month and I would
50:40 - like to start the month after which
50:42 - would have meant that we would have had
50:43 - to wait a month for her to start um but
50:46 - she would need you know if we got done
50:48 - with the interview time she would need
50:49 - two to three weeks to make the decision
50:51 - or whatever that time was um and the
50:53 - recruiter should be communicating this
50:55 - with the the hiring manager so there's
50:56 - no concern there so in that situation
50:59 - everybody was aware of the situation
51:01 - they loved her they wanted to make her
51:02 - an offer they did took her two to three
51:05 - weeks she signed her offer and she
51:06 - started a month later so be transparent
51:09 - but it's going to depend on business
51:11 - urgency it's going to depend where the
51:13 - company is at you know they may be
51:15 - interviewing five or six people and then
51:17 - you know it may get to a point where if
51:19 - you need longer than one to two weeks
51:21 - and they found somebody else they really
51:22 - like they may have to have a hard
51:24 - conversation of like you need to make
51:25 - decision or we need to move forward so I
51:27 - guess to answer more
51:29 - directly I would ask for like probably
51:32 - no more than a week like Max two but you
51:36 - have to be prepared for them to say we
51:38 - can only give you an extra three to five
51:41 - days and i' say you also have to be
51:43 - prepared to again be transparent to be
51:46 - able to share with them the context as
51:48 - to why you're asking for the extension
51:49 - that would be much appreciated as
51:52 - well and I'll say you know um if I think
51:56 - about our campus recruiting process so
51:58 - for students who are actually on campus
52:00 - interviewing for either internships or
52:02 - full-time roles um you know in that
52:05 - situation we typically have a little bit
52:07 - more leeway because we're interviewing
52:09 - so far out from when students are
52:11 - actually going to start so we're
52:12 - interviewing in August September for
52:14 - students we know are not going to start
52:15 - until the next June or July so typically
52:18 - we're going to have just a general rule
52:20 - of thumb so some sort of policy around
52:23 - okay we can give a week or we can give
52:25 - two weeks but we're not going to give
52:26 - two months um but there tends to be more
52:30 - flexibility of you know when you're when
52:32 - you're in a campus process and you're
52:34 - still a student expecting to start many
52:37 - months out so that's something to
52:38 - consider for for our students on the
52:40 - line as
52:41 - well we just got like rapid fire in the
52:44 - Q&A but we can connect and we have all
52:47 - the panelists LinkedIn a lot of them are
52:49 - around like are there any jobs do you
52:50 - hire non-programmers and so we will
52:52 - share Linkin profiles um in the chat in
52:55 - a little bit for y'all to follow up but
52:57 - my last kind of closing question and you
53:00 - know um let's say you don't get the job
53:03 - right how do candidates handle rejection
53:06 - gracefully um but still maintaining that
53:08 - positive and professional kind of
53:10 - demeanor potentially still using that
53:12 - relationship to leverage in the future
53:14 - you know just for future opportunities
53:16 - so if we can kind of close out with like
53:18 - handling I don't like to call it
53:20 - rejection but you know not uh moving
53:23 - forward with that particular position um
53:25 - SOA maybe we'll start with
53:27 - you yeah I think understanding that um
53:31 - the hiring process is not personal and
53:34 - any rejection is not about you as an
53:36 - individual the hiring process is very
53:38 - pragmatic it doesn't account for your
53:40 - feelings or um your ideas or your
53:44 - opinions about the company it's just
53:46 - very pragmatic um so it's not personal
53:50 - it's not about you a lot of details go
53:52 - into the hiring process and choosing
53:55 - someone for the position so don't take
53:58 - it personally and take it as a an
54:01 - opportunity to learn if you get the
54:04 - feedback just try to build on that and
54:06 - improve and also I think something that
54:10 - helped me so much is Shifting the
54:12 - mindset
54:13 - from the if I didn't get this position
54:17 - it might not be for me I have something
54:20 - else meant for me and it will find me
54:22 - and it's a good thing if you if you get
54:25 - rejected it's a good thing because
54:26 - something bigger is waiting for you and
54:28 - just hold on that and uh keep working
54:32 - and you're going to fail everyone did
54:34 - everyone got rejected and it's just part
54:37 - of proc the process just be patient and
54:40 - take it with Grace and give yourself um
54:43 - some Grace and uh love and keep working
54:47 - hard rejection is redirection every know
54:50 - which is practice for the one yes I love
54:52 - these like words of affirmation this is
54:55 - incredible um anyone else on the call
54:58 - though how do how do we handle rejection
55:00 - gracefully any any tips
55:08 - there Adrian I saw you on
55:12 - mute you're like me we use teams and I
55:14 - see that little blue circle I'm like
55:18 - say but you know just as they say
55:21 - there's opportunity and opposition
55:24 - there's opportunity in in rejection you
55:28 - know you've you've increased your
55:30 - network uh you've met individuals at the
55:32 - organization that you may not have known
55:35 - uh before you know you can still um be
55:40 - mindful of of the fact that you may not
55:42 - have been a good fit for that position
55:46 - uh but you may be a good fit for another
55:50 - position and you can all there's there's
55:51 - no harm in saying if if you know of
55:53 - anyone that uh could benefit from the
55:57 - skills that I do have you know despite
55:59 - uh not being the most qualified
56:01 - candidate for position x uh please feel
56:03 - free to refer me uh and just maintain
56:07 - emotional I'm really big on emotional
56:08 - intelligence you know just just maintain
56:10 - your emotional intelligence um and in
56:14 - your response and uh similar to what
56:17 - what um Z mentioned you know there's
56:21 - there's I just believe that what's
56:24 - what's your
56:25 - uh is is assigned to you and and no one
56:28 - else is is going to get it so it's
56:30 - really a game of um patience and having
56:33 - a positive outlook and just being uh
56:37 - consistent in in pursuit of what is out
56:40 - there for for
56:42 - you yeah um I have rejected people that
56:47 - I've ended up hiring at the same company
56:49 - or maybe even other companies um excuse
56:53 - me and I think you know speaking about
56:55 - emotional intelligence people really do
56:56 - show their true colors during times that
56:58 - could be considered stressful this being
57:00 - one of them right so I'd recommend just
57:02 - kind of taking in whatever the recruiter
57:05 - says thanking them for their time
57:07 - letting them know you'd still be
57:08 - interested in the future if you would of
57:09 - course and then like we've talked about
57:11 - ask them if it's okay to connect on
57:13 - LinkedIn um you know feel free to check
57:15 - in on occasion um but yeah definitely
57:19 - plus one to a lot of of what's been
57:21 - already
57:23 - said yeah yeah ditto ditto ditto I I um
57:29 - I it stings I just want to acknowledge
57:31 - that rejection or not getting a role
57:34 - that you've applied for does Sting right
57:36 - so maybe give your time yourself time to
57:40 - accept that feeling and feel that way um
57:44 - but then ultimately to know that if that
57:46 - opportunity did not come through for you
57:48 - then there's likely something that's a
57:49 - better fit for you there's likely
57:51 - something that's better just personally
57:52 - I will can honestly say
57:55 - every time I've applied for interview
57:57 - for a position that I did not get
57:59 - eventually where I did land was the
58:02 - perfect place for me um including my
58:04 - current role so I'd say you know take
58:06 - the sting I have a career coach in the
58:09 - past that would say um like spend a day
58:11 - in pity City but not longer than that
58:14 - and then move on um and understand that
58:17 - um you know there's there's a better
58:18 - opportunity that's likely um the right
58:21 - one for you I love that we've go a we've
58:24 - got a take this chat Emily the pity City
58:27 - all of these great affirmations I love
58:29 - that um but we're going to wrap up our
58:31 - conversation I know we're at time if
58:33 - folks can just stay on one more minute I
58:34 - have a few kind of closing announcements

active so um if we can also in the chat just thank all of our panelists for the gift of their time today we are so grateful that you're here with us and we will head into some of our questions so many of our students on this call uh may have had interviews at the hiring Summit or actively in their interview process now and so we're going to focus some of our initial questions on some post interiew etiquette in today's job market and so my question for our panelists um is how important is post interiew etiquette and how does it contribute to a candidate's overall impression and so I'm going to kick us off Emily if you can kind of uh kick us off with just some post interview etiquette tips absolutely um I have a lot to say here so everybody else feel free to jump in at any point but um I think that you know having good etiquette is very important throughout your entire interview process um and that's not just for the candidate but for the company as well that being said today's focus is on the candidate um and the Art of followup so I will say you know good etiquette stands out absolutely it can help you stand apart and show how you would treat people in your daytoday job every single interaction you have with every person at the company really gives the company an idea of the type of person you are and who they're going to be working with in their dayto day and at the end of the day you spend a ton of time at work you want to make sure that you work at a place that really um has a great culture and people highly contribute to that um I have had incredible candidates just ace every single interview um you know with every single person but then we find out in the debrief that they treated the recruiting coordinator very poorly and because of that you know the the team ended up not moving forward um so what I'll add is that that etiquette is also memorable and not in a good way um I'm sure you've checked out like a restaurant on Yelp or Google reviews and the negative comments really do stand out and are hard to forget I understand that the job market is like very tough it can be super frustrating to go through so many processes um and sometimes people react so I would just really focus on trying to keep composed being true to yourself and being kind because kindness goes a long way love that thanks Emily we're going to touch upon some like post interview like thank you notes and Communications but I think that behavioral kind of in the values uh shown throughout the interview are super important um Adrien really curious on on some etiquette post interview etiquette tips from you as well well that Emil Emily's a tough uh one to follow she has some great points there um but the post interview etiquette uh it's a very important extension uh of of how you show up uh you know it it becomes a additional uh opportunity to just to display your personality um because even if it is is a potentially a written communication uh tone is still uh tone still travels through uh you know your written communication and and it does matter so it's an opportunity to uh put your personality on display uh it also contributes to or can take away from your character attributes uh and as Emily mentioned you know everyone is it's it's a holistic view of that whom all you have uh come in contact with along the way so uh you know you can interview and feel very extremely confident about how you performed in the interview but uh that followup is is equal as important and how you handle people uh through the uh continuation of those Communications that's an interesting perspective too just you know you can nail an interview and get all the right answer or say all the right things and kind of have your your pitch really down packed but the folks the recruiting the talent acquisition manager or whoever along this process the way that you treat them is equally as important to companies that really kind of care that holistic view yes great um Z would love to also hear some of your perspective on kind of in Etiquette and uh contributions to a candidate's overall impression yeah I think um yeah I think Emily and Adrian mentioned really great points just to add to that I guess the written statement that you're going to send to the interviewer or to the recruiter will make you stand out they will make it will make you um memorable so they would remember your name and it's a great opportunity to thank them and to um reiterate your qualifications remind them of who you are and give a glimpse of your personality just like Adrianne said and I think what Emily said it kind of reminded me of something that it shocked me when I started working after getting into corporate life it was I still have a a really great relationship with my recruiter and something it would give you a really great advantage on the long run if you um if you end up getting the job for example you will have someone who can still vouch for you if you get promotions you can um have someone who can recommend you to other teams if you want to transition so having these connections it will help you move really fast later when you're in this company so keeping it professional and sending these thank you notes it can be very um a very small step but it has a really huge impact on the long run so um definitely recommend uh tailoring that into whenever you're uh interviewing and Zaya we actually talking a little bit to our second question and Adrian would love for you to kick us off just specifically like what are some of the key elements of that thank you note after an email right I'm sure we can Google like what's a typical thank you note right that you send post and interview um so specifically like how can candidates really personalize their messages that really um will make a longlasting impact uh to potential recruiters so Adrian I'll hand it to you or Leah I'm sorry Leah oh yeah absolutely so yeah again I agree with everything that was said prior and um I think the way to think about um etiquette and general is that every um every interaction that you experience before during and after your interview is a part of your assessment process so focusing on professionalism the quality of your interactions is is super important so getting to the second question some of the things that are relevant or important for from a thank you note perspective or just general uh followup post interview um I I for me the most important um sort of tip or the most important thing to me when I receive a communication is that the individual is genuine so right so what are you truly following up for that could come across very easily in your message right so the tone of your message what you include in your message um the length of your message all of those things I think are important so there's no formula here but um I person and some of this is personal preference as well right so I'm speaking from my personal preference and just my experience with receiving these types of communications were important to me um second to being you know sort of genuine and obviously having a a real reason to follow up the second would be um brevity so being concise and to the point um you've had you know numerous interactions likely prior to that point so you don't need to sort of resell yourself all over again or or send a long you know paragraphs of of information trying to you know again sell yourself because you've had the opportunity to do that so this is an opportunity to show your appreciation to be brief to be positive and to be genuine um those are the the things that I look for and appreciate um in followup messages love that aah I was just writing down some of these things they very helpful tips too just tone brevity right positive it's not maybe the time to like resell and kind of list all the bullet points that you might have said verbally um Adrian I I did cut you off um I would love to kind of hear from you next on some uh thank you note tips no no you're fine um I I I would say to you know still keep it formal because it's an opportunity to uh put your business posture on display uh so follow your standard greeting and as far as your body is is concerned always express uh appreciation it's a competitive market so the fact that you were chosen to interview is something that you want to show appreciation for uh you do want to reiterate your your value uh what is the value in bringing you on to to this team and the the organization in question uh show gratitude for a piece of information that the interviewer shared whether it was about them personally um or about the company its values Etc U but that does show that you were were listening um and and that you did uh receive and retain that information and then of course your your closing and so that's again keeping with uh good business posture and and a formal uh response similar to what Aaliyah said it's always also important to you know person you can personalize it by simply being authentic if there's a quote or a catchphrase that might be important to you or really reflect your values uh your thought process as whatever the role may be um that's always a nice touch and I know I mentioned several things but being brief how piggyback Aaliyah on on that you do want to uh be brief but inclusive of all of those things now what I will add in closing uh in the spirit of whom our audience is in the generation uh I would say in the room but in our virtual in our virtual room uh chat GPT is very popular you know and and and it can uh it's it's very nice you know your your output is as good as your your input uh if you do feel compelled to use it to boost to boost your confidence you know it is defin itely uh it definitely becomes more important that you personalize that uh and add some authenticity uh to it because especially if you're in in Tech uh those of us that are familiar with AI also know those familiar AI uh words that are frequently uh used in those outputs that that you receive so that's that's uh that's my perspective thing yes no we talk a lot internally about you know AI the advantages watch outs you know some of the risks and really kind of just you know educate our students on you know being authentic right and using it to their advantage um but being mindful of the risks and so yeah thank you for mentioning that uh Emily I'll hand it to you just some elements of a CFT full thank you note after an interview yeah absolutely so I was going to start it how Adrien ended it actually I was going to say you know um Aaliyah and Adrien both brought up great points which is to be genuine and authentic so you have to really be careful with chat GPT or any of the other um AI tools and make sure that you do personalize it they hit on a lot of the points that I would hit on which is keep it short we don't want it to be a novel it doesn't have to be one sentence right but you know don't want it to be too long um I would say continue building Rapport at the end of the day people thrive off connecting with others sometimes in the interview you may learn something about the interviewer like I don't know if you have extra time and they talk about like oh my favorite show is How I Met Your Mother and you're like oh well have you seen how I met your father and they say no and the thank you note maybe you can say hey make sure you watch this episode it's really great or whatever it is right try to build that connection um and then I would say the third one is after you interview I understand that sometimes it can it can be a little scary your mind might race you know you might say like oh I could have answered this better or I was so wrong when I said that um I think that it could be a really good opportunity to say Hey you know I was really thinking about this question and you know what I would love to add is XYZ again don't get too long with it um but it's a good opportunity to continue sort of those things as well um so I think that Aaliyah and Adrian hit the rest of what I would say as well but that's that's all I really have to add I love that uh especially like building off that you know the personalized piece too that trigger you know the recruiter to just remember or just you know uh keep you in the back of their mind I love that um I'm going to head into my next question because I think maybe chat GPT might be uh a common mistake or uh you know part of a pitfall maybe that job Seekers now should avoid or just be mindful of when crafting your thank you notes so I'll start with you ZB on just like any common mistakes or pitfalls that job she Seeker should avoid maybe when crafting those notes I think for me it would be the length they already tou the they already touched on um the length of the emails you don't need a whole letter um be because it would just not be read That's be um straightforward it won't be read corporate life is very busy people don't have a lot of time to dedicate to that just be concise and I think uh bullet points or uh um I don't know you can just have smaller paragraphs but just be concise and straightforward to the point and um it will be very helpful to just stand out and keep it memorable and the recruiter or the interviewer's um memory absolutely thank you for that um Al I'll turn it over to you yeah I'd say you know to to piggy back here you know kind of the opposite every that we you know sort of suggested that you do do right you know too long reliving the interview um you know sort of not being professional or authentic Etc um but in addition to that I'll just say to another um to to the earlier point you know sometimes it is a little bit nervewracking after an interview is concluded you want to know when am I going to hear back and you know have there been any decisions made and so sometimes you can get anxious and it feels like time is dragging right for the C candidate um so I would say also be careful about following up um too soon or too often right so um certainly a wellplaced you know brief genuine thank you note is appropriate beyond that following up for status updates um i' be careful about that right you want to be very um attentive and cognizant as to what the recruiter or hiring manager shares with you pertaining to the process and when you can expect a hear back and really lean into sort of that guidance when you're determining whether you should follow up or or when you should follow up or how often you should follow up so I'd say just being patient um is important as well and not following up too soon or too often that's great I'm also going to make a plug for Q&A for students I have maybe one or two more questions and I would definitely love to hear from y'all um I'm going a little off script just cuz I'm I I love hearing kind of personal anecdotes and stories about maybe you know things that you've implemented or strategy so I'm just really curious um to hear from you all and maybe I'll start with you Adrian on just kind of like a PO interview practice um that you really that or successful experience that you've had or maybe not so good of a one that you've really learned from I know you know hearing from you know different challenges and experiences are really helpful for our students as well um so just kind of like how it kind of resonates with you and manifests maybe in some of your your post interview processes um let's see this wasn't part of the this wasn't part of the SCP no pressure no and you know I'm thinking because I I um I interviewed last year for the first time in seven years and actually had the the blessing of um uh being hired for the first position I applied for so I'm digging in the archive a bit because it's it's certainly been a journey you know getting to that point um so I would say one one thing you know if if I look back um I think there was a time where I was uh I would avoid the the followup not the thank you I would send a a a thank you um but I would sometimes I would not always rather uh send in a um inquiry for a followup to the recruiter um I would just you know assume it you know it it got the position was filled you know they selected another candidate or um even that the the position was with the Drone so um that was actually an extension that I was going to add to Aaliyah's feedback um for the previous question is is in keeping with uh proper etiquette in conducting the followup is is to not be afraid um to hesit to Don't Be Afraid uh to to seek out um updates on on status of that position but um you know because that also helps you to get feedback so I would say in my experience that's something that uh during those times I could have done better and uh where I would have gotten feedback I'm sure it would have helped me with improving uh my interview uh etiquette in in the additional opportunities to come thank you for sharing and going off script with me no problem this is a little bit related to a Q&A question from Alicia um that we have you know just on timing right generally of like what's a good time to follow up after an interview is it a day is it the same day is it a few days after like kind of striking that balance between being pushy and you know but also kind of giving time for things to set settle so just really curious um and maybe we'll start with you Emily just on like subjectively like what would be a timing that you you know think is the nice sweet spot yeah well um I think first and foremost what I would say is to get clarity beforehand um ask the recruiter you know like hey when should I anticipate you know an answer by um so that way you kind of have an idea and then they'll give you the answer to that basically so if they're like oh you know we may have an answer in three days to five days then I would wait till that fifth day and when you do follow up I would just make it like very brief nothing very long again you know just basically saying like hey you know just wanted to reiterate my excitement for the role appreciate everyone's time if you have any updates I'd love to hear about them right so yeah and this is actually speaking to a really good question that another student had like what's the difference between like a thank you note right like thank you for your interview and then followup right and so maybe like the timing of that thank you note post interview that you just had and then the followup piece like what would be the difference um and maybe the timing differentiation there um Aaliyah maybe I'll I'll hand it to you yeah yeah I think the thank you note placed um pretty immediately after the interview process when you're still fresh in the person's mind and you still have a little bit of momentum to potentially sort of continue to sort of add to the experience that the individual had with you so I'd say within a day uh two at Max for the followup pertaining to the thank you note and then I agree completely with with what Emily shared you know listening in and and asking actually proactively asking if the recruiter doesn't share with you when you can expect to hear back certainly let that time lapse and then maybe the next day you know following up um because at that point it's a fair ask right you you've been there's an expectation set that you would hear back in five days and if you haven't then it's fair to follow up and again again just to reiterate what Emily said you know just a very quick you know positively phrase message that again I appreciate your time I'm still very interested in the role would love an update or um you know please let me know when I can expect to hear back from you um so yeah I love that yeah and too I mean I would I say this kind of go you know the other thing to consider too in that followup this is less related to sort of how you know when you follow up but also things to consider you know again time sort of stands still when you're waiting to hear right but on the recruiter's end things are moving very fast right and you never know what the delay might be right the person who has to approve your offer could be on vacation for a couple of days or you know there could be some interviews complet you know final interviews that are occurring and all of those need to have happened before final decisions are made so there's all kinds of different things that can um affect that timeline and so again some of it is just really sort of uh you know talking yourself into being patient along with following up you know wellplaced followup but um but also being patient and understanding that there's a lot of factors that could go into the delay it's not um I guess ultimately the summary is don't take that personally you know um but but again it's fair to follow up if you if if there's been an expectation set or if there wasn't an expectation set and let's say you forgot to ask then I would say give it a week right and then that's kind of my personal rule of thumb U or or what I would appreciate in terms of you know just sort of the the time Grace uh before that followup absolutely I love that and I think that's answering a little bit of what Nicole um wrote in our Q&A just around is it appropriate to ask at the end at the end of an interview next steps and I think the vibe that we're getting is yes that's appropriate so you have a timeline to kind of coordinate your followup and there's expectation set there and and and just to jump in I mean a good recruiter is going to share that with you proactively right so they kind of owe you that information um as a recruiter um again this is just a personal uh personal opinion but um but yeah but so therefore yes if if not then I think it's quite quite appropriate to ask yes and this is taking it a step further Avery asked if an interview involves multiple people at once should I follow up with separate emails per person or one message with all interviews viers included and I think I've been on the receiving end of both ends of those but um I'll uh I'll maybe pass it to you Adrian and zanab and kind of your perspectives on it um I would say I I would say allinclusive um is okay unless you felt as though there was a uh connection made with one of the candidates and then you wouldn't want to send it to the group and then that candidate individually um so go one way or or the other uh but there should if you're doing them individually uh it should be to capitalize on an opportunity to connect with them uh individually by way of something that was specific to them or something they they said um or or a just some sort of level of connection uh by way of of the answer for you so absolutely add to that um I guess I I believe that quality is over quantity so if you built that kind of connection with one of the interviewers just um try to hone on that and lean into that connection that you built and make it as personal as possible because if you stand out for that interviewer he still they can still vouch for you uh so so that's treat it as a power of a or strength that you can leverage for your own benefit that's great we have a a question oh no go ahead sorry Ain I I just wanted to add um to that that if you interview with a panel the decisionmaking is likely going to happen uh as a group so being sure to capitalize I'll say on that connection uh certainly does give you an advocate for yourself at the table uh when that group comes back together for decisionmaking purposes so that was a good call out and we have a question in the in the Q&A around preferred methods of contact right so there may be some hiring managers or recruiter that prefer email or LinkedIn um is it appropriate to ask them or interviewers in that if we don't have that information prior maybe hand it over to you Emily um yeah it's definitely appropriate to ask um I would always like lean on emails first though by the way unless you've asked like hey can I connect with you on LinkedIn what I would not do is like try to find their Instagram or Facebook or any other social media because that does happen um so I would avoid that and really you know focus on email or ask hey like do you mind if I connect with you on LinkedIn so we can stay in touch there was actually something in the chat that I saw Emily Grove you wrote just being mindful of the timing of your interview I'm wondering how much on the receiving and the recruiting side we actually look at that if it's an email sent at 3 in the morning versus 3 in the afternoon like how does that you know from a recruiting perspective like how does that land or does that hold any weight in some decision making um so feel free anyone to kind of come off of mute and and share Reflections I have stuff to say yeah please go please go I I was going to say not so much for me I think everybody has their own schedules and boundaries in terms of when they're logging in and when they're accepting emails so if someone's sending it at 3 in the morning I won't get it until you know 9 or so the next morning and that's fine um with you know again personal preference um I think you know some of it is as well but um but yeah that I I don't think that is going to um sort of make or break um or would be a sort of major you know etiquette faux if you were sending a message at a time when someone else typically wouldn't be logged in yeah I 100% agree everybody has different things going on in their lives and maybe you know what works for them is to email you at 3 a. and nobody should be judged for that at the end of the day right and certain companies you'll learn as you go through the process also have that view on the way that they work in their culture like I know our company and a couple others like gitlab Etc like it's very much like they care about outcomes not specific like the hours that you work from 9 to 5 or whatever it is it's like you get your stuff done when you can make your meetings of course but yeah so I would just say really do what's best for you in that aspect we also know we're we're working with students too so we know student schedules are very different from ours as well so and I think to to what Emily clarified in the chat too it's more about being at the top of your inbox right like it may get buried and maybe automated things or sends and so just you know kind of being mindful of maybe the time zone of yourself and on the recruiting end but life so Aaron if I if I may um just to add to that in the technology space we can sometimes become the the city that never sleeps right and so uh I I think the the danger in sending uh something late super late night or the middle of the night you have the potential for that person to be online um and if they read it during that that time it could you know they can maybe not lend as much attention to it or it fall off the radar so while it wouldn't be um you know any anything that that would create anyone to create any have any judgments past judgment or or anything um there is always the opportunity to use your technology and the great features that are associated to most emails and uh simply schedule it for you know maybe a 7 730 8 8 am uh type of time that would uh in accordance to their time zone if you're aware at it that would be a nice you know top of the inbox uh ready to be read morning email for that interviewer yes that's one that's a really good point particularly if you are talking about like two in the morning on Saturday or you know that then you're you know Friday night Saturday then you're talking about you know a couple days pass before that Monday morning so get great great points I agree I think even Beyond right in the workplace too I I'm very mindful of that I have small children and sometimes I work past 10 o'clock and I don't want my team to think that they need to read an email at 11 p.m. right so that schedule set comes in in handy um I'm going to switch gears a little bit um because I'm I'm thinking more so um and Emily from girls who could had this question um is it appropriate to ask for feedback and this is if you've had kind of the interview I'm really curious maybe post interview um immediate just for feedback but also maybe if you don't get the job right and kind of you you know you're not moving forward in the interview process um asking for feedback about your answers or performance like how does that feel um and is that appropriate maybe I jump in and sorry z um I think it might depend on the company itself in this case because I've had um some of the big companies that interviewed for they were were not allowed to provide me with Fe feedback because it was confidential and they were not allowed to share uh however if you interview with startups or um smaller companies and you're you have a a TI let's say a more personal uh relationship with a recruiter you can um get feedback so I remember receiving uh written feedback as well so it doesn't hurt to ask make sure you ask and whether it's yes or no it's um you'll still get your answer I think Aaliyah had something to say to add to that yes agreed you it I don't believe it's inappropriate to ask but just be prepared that some companies have a policy not to provide interview feedback for legal reasons um deoy being one of them we're an accounting firm so we're you know conservative when it comes to Legal risk for example so um I think you know generally um there's a wide spectrum of of answers that you'll get um but I don't think it's in appropriate to ask and you may just get lucky and strike a good um rapport with an interviewer or your recruiter and that person may be personally willing to share tidbits of information with you as well so again completely appropriate to ask but just be prepared that you might not get a formal answer yeah I oh go ahead please Adrian okay um yeah I plus one to that absolutely and I think also it depends how you ask I've worked at companies that you know the legal ramifications were much higher um and then at startups where if somebody just says like you know I had a really great time but I understand it didn't work out but like I want to get better because I'm interviewing at other places is there anything you can do to just kind of help me get to that next up or whatever it is right like I find that when people ask that way where it's like a learning of like I want to get better for my other interviews um you kind when you're a recruiter you kind of understand some people ask that way and then it's like no like what did I do wrong because I thought that this would be like the role for me right so you just kind of gauge so I think it's all in how you ask as well abolutely Adrian anything to add uh it's it's not a whole lot different um I was just gonna say maintain emotional intelligence uh when you're asking and and that can definitely improve uh the chances on on the organization being willing to engage and it really just falls under the perview of nothing beats a failure but a try you know though they will either the organization will either deny the feedback um or give you some feedback that as Emily said really helps you as you progress through the additional uh interviewing opportunities we have a a questioning Q&A and this I think relates a little bit zanib to what you were talking about in terms of maintaining relationships with the person who interviewed you or the recruiter um so we have a question in the chat how do you suggest maintaining a connection with a recruiter even if you don't accept an offer or you don't move move along in the interview process I really like that question um and Z neb I don't know if you have any kind of like personal experience of you know maintaining a relationship with one of the folks who kind of interviewed you along in the interview process but um that's for you you had the job but maybe how do how do folks kind of maintain that connection even if they don't necessarily get the job and is that appropriate I think always following up in um what One Mentor that I had said uh you have to follow up even New Year's you know Christmas you can just send these small notes and emails after these things happen like after the interview you you were rejected or you didn't accept the offer you can always reach out and keep that connection alive with uh reaching out in um occas these occasions so you can keep the uh the relationship alive with with the interviewer or the recruiter um in my experience I it was quite different it wasn't um a job application but it was more of um a mentorship with Google in a program that happened and I ended up following up with my Mentor that I had from there and we kept meeting almost like every 3 months and he would um assist me and then he ended up uh being my mentor and for my thesis and my undergrad and it was voluntarily done so people are willing to help if you just know how to maintain the relationship and um know how to follow up uh and I guess building that connection you know in the beginning where you both have that spark where you're interested in the same thing or you just have the I don't know very um common things that happen in or you show a lot of interest in what they do um I think that can help a lot yeah that's great and how do we feel a followup question to this and anyone can come off of uh of mute um how do y'all feel about or thoughts on connecting and following with folks outside of email but connecting on LinkedIn right is that something that you may be ask in the interview or if you have interviewees that find you on LinkedIn and friend you or kind of add you as a connection kind of what are some of your thoughts on that kind of maintaining that you know that connection that relationship with a with a recruiter um Aaliyah maybe I'll hand it to you yeah so I think because LinkedIn is a professional social media Outlet um it's completely appropriate to send a request um um you know again a brief wellplaced uh professional request to connect um and that person will you know accept or not accept your request and it might be based on their preferences but I think it's completely appropriate to send um again I would just be prepared that not everyone is um on the same level in terms of they are their social media presence in activity so I'm probably one who is um you know guilty of not being on LinkedIn on a daily basis and so again I sometimes log into LinkedIn and see that someone sent me a message quite some time ago right just because that's I live in email and sort of in that you know email and instant messaging um and so um I say it's completely appropriate but just understand that people have different sort of preferences and levels of activity within so again don't take it personally perhaps if someone doesn't uh accept your request it may just be that they're not often um you know present online and or you know they'll accept your request once they do log in but um but yeah I think it's completely appropriate given that LinkedIn is utilized for professional purposes primarily sorry no go ahead Emily um you could also leave a note on the LinkedIn connection like there's an option to send a note with it so you could just say like it was great meeting you during this interview or something very brief that's great um I know the focus of our conversation has primarily been on like post interiew etiquette but we do have a question from Emily in the chat just around post application etiquette and so Zab I know you talked a little bit about kind of your Mentor for the the program that you had um but any kind of differences or similarities for like applying into a program whether that's kind of an internship a summer program um and any kind of etiquette um considerations there um so when you apply you don't really have uh any emails of the recruiters yet so post application when you first apply with the resume scanning and everything you might not have the ability to follow up or just send Um send a an email however if you are referred I think it would be a great idea to um follow up with whoever referred you to that position and thank them and be and also follow up regarding the progress of the application because they receive um updates regarding your applications so you can at least find out how uh how well you've done on um the scanning resume scanning process and everything so but in the beginning of the application process you might not have the ability to do that unfortunately so save that the all the efforts for post interview to piggyback off of that actually too in addition to you know someone who might have referred you for a position to kind of stay on the LinkedIn topic for a minute another approach or possibility is for you to seek out individuals on LinkedIn who work for that particular company and who have something else common in your background so one of my favorites is um you know Duke graduates right if if someone reaches out to me and says hey I saw your LinkedIn profile I see you're a Duke um Fuca School of Business graduate I've applied for a role at deoe would you be willing to speak with me for 10 or 15 minutes about you know opportunity that Delo I'm going to say yes every single time because um you know one I love talking about opportunities at deoe two the person you know sort of took the time and initiative to reach out and three importantly we share something in common and have a you know sort of commonality in our background so that's something else and again you you're not going to get a 100% response rate from the individuals who you reach out on uh to on LinkedIn but again you don't try you don't know so um so I think you know mining LinkedIn for connections of that sort and and requesting connections even if it's kind of a cold call um type of Outreach can work as well yeah that speaks to the personalized aspect too I think I'm always going to be a a sucker for folks that have we've gone to we have the same Alma Mo right fut a fellow Alum that's applying you know into girls who code or you know a partnering company that resonates with me a lot um I have we don't have any more questions in the Q&A but please I think we have time for a few more um but one question is around and let me find it because this was a really great question that Emily had posed um so let's say that you actually get another offer so in that kind of waiting period to hear here back on next steps final interviews um you know you you get another offer and you accept it how do you communicate that to the first company or the you know the other company that you've been interviewing with um you know like how does that how does that communication kind of work in terms of like you have another counter offer or you have something else kind of in the works um how should that communication be maybe I'll pass it to you Emily I see the the thinking the thinking face and maybe I made that um I mean I would say like obviously give the same respect that you would want and throughout the process hopefully your recruiters asking you where you are in your stage as well but I think that that communication should be there on both ends um and so I would recommend you know if it's not when you get to a final interview you can say you know I'm anticipating an offer I don't know my timeline I'll let you know if you do end up getting an offer it depends if you're really interested in this other role or not right if you're not and you just want to accept then you just let them know hey you know unfortunately you know I'm no longer available I got another offer I appreciate your time and really you know be gracious about that if you are still interested I would just let them know you know hey I have received another offer this is how much time I have to make the decision which that's also negotiable by the way a lot of people don't know that you can ask for more time if you need more time to make your decision um but yeah and and then I would let them know you know I have this amount of time um so I just am kind of wondering things are at and then it's up to them to make a decision they either move forward or they don't at that time because now they know they have a time limit so yeah that's a great piece too and like a distinction like if you were really interested in that first company right like without sounding like you're giving ultimates in some ways but being just really honest with your timeline right for decision making so Erin one thing I'll I'll add to that is I think people sometimes want a company to think that they they love them so much that uh you know they're putting all their eggs in one basket so to speak uh one thing that can help with that is if you are actively interviewing you know you can also make that known at the time of your interview as well you know I'm very interested in your company your values align with my values the position uh sounds as though it's an excellent fit uh I do want to make you aware that I am actively interviewing uh with other organizations and and so it it creates you know when especially when you're a strong candidate it creates a sense of urgency for the organization if they are very interested in you because they don't want you to to get away so don't be hesitant you know to to communicate that uh as a part of your interview process as well so that you don't get away you know and go through the whole negotiation and you know they can just come you know Straight Out The Gate and and send you that that offer um because we we do make immediate decisions uh we don't you know so I would just add to um you just in general to be transparent I think is appreciated right just as you expect you uh we talked a lot about you know hearing back from companies and sort of knowing what's going on and there in and it's the same the other way around too I know when I was a recruiter and it would extend offers to candidates I would actually ask um are you considering any other offers are you you know considering offers outside of consultant you know there were you nice ways to ask the candidate as well you know sort of what they have going on as a candidate um I'd be transparent just so that you know people know where you stand and they understand that you're very interested but you also have other options so um that motivates them to do the same and then sometimes to move your process along if needed um if they really want you so yeah you're not going to lose an opportunity because you're interviewing elsewhere so don't be scared of that if that is something that you would ever be scared of yeah and Emily you did mention though like you can ask for more time like once you let's say you got an offer from a company that is lowering your priority list like how how much time could you realistically ask for like what's the appropriate amount of extension maybe to make that decision or to wait to hear back from another company absolutely I mean it's going to depend it's on a couple things right like how transparent you were at the beginning so I'll give you an example um at one of the companies that I was at previously there was a candidate that we interviewed and she let me know right off the bat my goal is to interview this month I would like to make a decision within that the first week of the next month and I would like to start the month after which would have meant that we would have had to wait a month for her to start um but she would need you know if we got done with the interview time she would need two to three weeks to make the decision or whatever that time was um and the recruiter should be communicating this with the the hiring manager so there's no concern there so in that situation everybody was aware of the situation they loved her they wanted to make her an offer they did took her two to three weeks she signed her offer and she started a month later so be transparent but it's going to depend on business urgency it's going to depend where the company is at you know they may be interviewing five or six people and then you know it may get to a point where if you need longer than one to two weeks and they found somebody else they really like they may have to have a hard conversation of like you need to make decision or we need to move forward so I guess to answer more directly I would ask for like probably no more than a week like Max two but you have to be prepared for them to say we can only give you an extra three to five days and i' say you also have to be prepared to again be transparent to be able to share with them the context as to why you're asking for the extension that would be much appreciated as well and I'll say you know um if I think about our campus recruiting process so for students who are actually on campus interviewing for either internships or fulltime roles um you know in that situation we typically have a little bit more leeway because we're interviewing so far out from when students are actually going to start so we're interviewing in August September for students we know are not going to start until the next June or July so typically we're going to have just a general rule of thumb so some sort of policy around okay we can give a week or we can give two weeks but we're not going to give two months um but there tends to be more flexibility of you know when you're when you're in a campus process and you're still a student expecting to start many months out so that's something to consider for for our students on the line as well we just got like rapid fire in the Q&A but we can connect and we have all the panelists LinkedIn a lot of them are around like are there any jobs do you hire nonprogrammers and so we will share Linkin profiles um in the chat in a little bit for y'all to follow up but my last kind of closing question and you know um let's say you don't get the job right how do candidates handle rejection gracefully um but still maintaining that positive and professional kind of demeanor potentially still using that relationship to leverage in the future you know just for future opportunities so if we can kind of close out with like handling I don't like to call it rejection but you know not uh moving forward with that particular position um SOA maybe we'll start with you yeah I think understanding that um the hiring process is not personal and any rejection is not about you as an individual the hiring process is very pragmatic it doesn't account for your feelings or um your ideas or your opinions about the company it's just very pragmatic um so it's not personal it's not about you a lot of details go into the hiring process and choosing someone for the position so don't take it personally and take it as a an opportunity to learn if you get the feedback just try to build on that and improve and also I think something that helped me so much is Shifting the mindset from the if I didn't get this position it might not be for me I have something else meant for me and it will find me and it's a good thing if you if you get rejected it's a good thing because something bigger is waiting for you and just hold on that and uh keep working and you're going to fail everyone did everyone got rejected and it's just part of proc the process just be patient and take it with Grace and give yourself um some Grace and uh love and keep working hard rejection is redirection every know which is practice for the one yes I love these like words of affirmation this is incredible um anyone else on the call though how do how do we handle rejection gracefully any any tips there Adrian I saw you on mute you're like me we use teams and I see that little blue circle I'm like say but you know just as they say there's opportunity and opposition there's opportunity in in rejection you know you've you've increased your network uh you've met individuals at the organization that you may not have known uh before you know you can still um be mindful of of the fact that you may not have been a good fit for that position uh but you may be a good fit for another position and you can all there's there's no harm in saying if if you know of anyone that uh could benefit from the skills that I do have you know despite uh not being the most qualified candidate for position x uh please feel free to refer me uh and just maintain emotional I'm really big on emotional intelligence you know just just maintain your emotional intelligence um and in your response and uh similar to what what um Z mentioned you know there's there's I just believe that what's what's your uh is is assigned to you and and no one else is is going to get it so it's really a game of um patience and having a positive outlook and just being uh consistent in in pursuit of what is out there for for you yeah um I have rejected people that I've ended up hiring at the same company or maybe even other companies um excuse me and I think you know speaking about emotional intelligence people really do show their true colors during times that could be considered stressful this being one of them right so I'd recommend just kind of taking in whatever the recruiter says thanking them for their time letting them know you'd still be interested in the future if you would of course and then like we've talked about ask them if it's okay to connect on LinkedIn um you know feel free to check in on occasion um but yeah definitely plus one to a lot of of what's been already said yeah yeah ditto ditto ditto I I um I it stings I just want to acknowledge that rejection or not getting a role that you've applied for does Sting right so maybe give your time yourself time to accept that feeling and feel that way um but then ultimately to know that if that opportunity did not come through for you then there's likely something that's a better fit for you there's likely something that's better just personally I will can honestly say every time I've applied for interview for a position that I did not get eventually where I did land was the perfect place for me um including my current role so I'd say you know take the sting I have a career coach in the past that would say um like spend a day in pity City but not longer than that and then move on um and understand that um you know there's there's a better opportunity that's likely um the right one for you I love that we've go a we've got a take this chat Emily the pity City all of these great affirmations I love that um but we're going to wrap up our conversation I know we're at time if folks can just stay on one more minute I have a few kind of closing announcements and you've seen some of uh the notes in the chat um but we would love to hear from you so there is a uh QR code I believe we're either going to put on the screen but if not oh it's already there perfect um if you all can kind of QR code scan that and let us know um how this event went and really helps us to plan future events we also have all of our panelist LinkedIn profiles um so the art of the followup art following up with our panelists and asking all those questions you can probably also go to their respective company sites if there are any jobs available um but if we can all kind of in the chat just thank our attendee our panelists um for their time the gift of their time tonight please do so um we really appreciate all of you tuning in to our final Workshop of our hiring Summit Workshop series so that is a wrap we hope that everyone enjoys the rest of their afternoon and evening um and thank you so much have a great one everyone you too thank you thank you please fall you have a good night thank you Adrian Emily Z it was such a pleasure oh the pleasure was all mine thank you so much have a great night
