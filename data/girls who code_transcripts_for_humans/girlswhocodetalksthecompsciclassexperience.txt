02:34 - science
02:34 - in computer engineering from the
02:37 - university of maryland
02:38 - college park and so we are super excited
02:41 - to have these two wonderful panelists
02:44 - if you didn't wave hello to the people
02:45 - christine wherever the people
02:47 - i'm super excited to have folks here
02:49 - tonight so um
02:51 - what we are going to do is we're going
02:53 - to start off tonight with an
02:54 - icebreaker um and then um
02:57 - we are going to uh follow that with some
03:00 - questions that will be addressed
03:01 - um by uh that will address the concerns
03:05 - of the girls who code
03:06 - college age alumni um in various
03:09 - students across the country who are
03:11 - beginning
03:12 - matriculating or ending their college
03:14 - experience so we're going to really take
03:16 - some time
03:17 - to really address some of the questions
03:18 - that you all have
03:20 - and then at the end of the conversation
03:21 - we'll have a q a segment that i'll lead
03:24 - um with questions that we gathered in
03:26 - advance specifically from
03:27 - our users and from our viewers so we're
03:30 - super excited about that so
03:32 - um so here's what we're going to do i'm
03:33 - going to start this question off with
03:35 - our panelists
03:36 - um kelsey i'm going to have you answer
03:38 - this one first
03:40 - um what was your favorite computer
03:42 - science or
03:43 - non-computer science class when you were
03:46 - in
03:46 - undergrad okay so i
03:50 - actually aren't a computer science major
03:52 - i'm an electrical engineering
03:53 - major but i did take some cs courses so
03:56 - i would have to say
03:58 - that my favorite was just the
04:00 - introduction
04:01 - to fundamentals of computer science it
04:03 - was just basic c
04:04 - programming because a lot of the key
04:06 - aspects that i learned there
04:08 - i applied it to other languages and
04:11 - other problems it's a great way of
04:13 - conquering problems it really helps with
04:16 - problem solving
04:18 - but for my non-favorites or my favorite
04:21 - non-cs class it's definitely
04:24 - more of a physics class it was
04:25 - electromagnetics so
04:27 - i'll leave that you know just there
04:30 - awesome awesome christine what about you
04:32 - what were your favorite
04:33 - cs and non-cs courses um
04:36 - let's see cs i think it was the same so
04:39 - it was my first cs
04:40 - class um and not so much like the
04:42 - material but just how it was presented
04:45 - so i had a really cool professor like
04:47 - biker dude
04:49 - and i was just like okay this is
04:51 - relatable like
04:52 - it's not you don't have to be like a
04:53 - certain kind of way um to be a
04:55 - programmer
04:56 - so it was just how the material was
04:58 - presented to me i was so it was so
05:00 - relatable
05:01 - um so yeah he made the class epic and i
05:04 - was like okay this is
05:05 - i'm doing this um yeah and then
05:09 - non-cs i'd have to say um psychology
05:13 - like psychology was super interesting
05:15 - for me um
05:16 - it was just like another using another
05:18 - part of your brain so yeah
05:20 - for sure excellent excellent so viewers
05:23 - we want to hear from you right
05:24 - um we want you to answer the poll
05:27 - question that should have just popped up
05:28 - on your screen
05:29 - um is your favorite class computer
05:32 - science related or
05:34 - is it a non-computer science related
05:36 - class we're going to give you
05:38 - about 30 seconds to respond and then
05:41 - we'll get
05:42 - that little piece of feedback and then
05:44 - we'll move forward
05:49 - what about you derek do you have any
05:52 - favorite class
05:53 - you know um so i was a education major
05:57 - in college
05:57 - and so um for me all of my favorite
06:01 - classes in college
06:02 - um in general either were an education
06:05 - class anything that allowed me to be in
06:07 - front of students in front of people
06:10 - getting a chance to teach getting a
06:11 - chance to impart knowledge
06:14 - helping students and seeing that light
06:16 - bulb that would go off with students
06:17 - when they learned a new concept
06:19 - when they really understood how to
06:22 - multiply numbers or whatever that
06:23 - concept might have been so i really
06:25 - really really enjoyed that course
06:27 - or those classes i also had a really
06:29 - cool class at my undergrad
06:31 - called marriage and family and it was
06:33 - taught it was teen taught by a
06:35 - theology professor a psychology
06:39 - professor
06:39 - and a sociology professor and so it
06:42 - talked about kind of the construct of
06:44 - marriage within societies
06:47 - and within different cultures and it was
06:48 - really really really interesting
06:50 - um to hear the perspective especially
06:53 - from those different
06:54 - areas those different fields and how
06:56 - that really
06:57 - um influenced i guess how different
06:59 - cultures and different areas looked at
07:01 - marriage so
07:02 - that was my favorite course in college
07:05 - yeah it was very different very cool
07:07 - though um very very cool
07:09 - so um thanks to everyone for for
07:11 - answering the poll so
07:13 - about 53 of our um
07:16 - attendees here said that a computer
07:18 - science course was their
07:20 - most favorite class um in college in
07:22 - about 48
07:23 - set a non-computer science course so
07:25 - really split that down the middle
07:26 - and you know i think it really goes to
07:28 - the point that um
07:30 - whatever field you go into after you
07:32 - graduate from college
07:34 - there really is the mix of the skill set
07:36 - that you're going to learn within your
07:38 - program right
07:39 - and i think the ability to think
07:40 - critically the ability to
07:43 - speak properly the ability to write
07:45 - properly
07:47 - to problem solve all of those things
07:49 - really i think go into
07:51 - a lot of us and our daily jobs and what
07:53 - it is that we do
07:54 - and so i think that that really speaks
07:56 - to having to use both your left brain
07:58 - and your right brain
07:59 - um as we really go throughout our career
08:01 - so i think that that's a really
08:03 - um awesome thing so what we're going to
08:05 - do is we're going to
08:07 - going to go on and um
08:10 - kind of move into our discussion
08:11 - questions so we do have some questions
08:13 - that we want to ask our panelists
08:15 - um this evening and you know we know
08:17 - that the computer science space is
08:19 - really dominated by a majority um white
08:22 - men
08:22 - um and asian men right and it's one of
08:25 - the reasons why
08:26 - this organization girls who code was
08:29 - really birthed
08:30 - and and why it really came to be um and
08:32 - we also recognize
08:34 - that uh being a woman in the technical
08:36 - world
08:37 - um has its barriers um and particularly
08:40 - as women of color there are certainly i
08:42 - would imagine another set of challenges
08:44 - even on top of uh of just being a woman
08:48 - um that you have to deal with so really
08:50 - with that being said
08:51 - i'm gonna direct this really and have
08:53 - christine maybe answer this first but
08:55 - what's one piece of advice you wish
08:57 - someone would have told you as an
08:58 - incoming student looking to major in
09:01 - computer sciences oregon kind of the
09:03 - sciences
09:04 - in general um
09:07 - let's see one piece of advice i think
09:10 - perseverance is key
09:12 - like um just
09:15 - anything like worth having like it'll
09:17 - just take hours and time
09:19 - um but also people surrounding yourself
09:21 - with good people
09:23 - um and that's i mean as much as there is
09:26 - you know
09:26 - conflict and people will see you
09:28 - differently there are also just so much
09:30 - there's a lot of good as well so there
09:32 - are people you can align yourself with
09:34 - um people like you people not like you
09:37 - um but you know if you both have the
09:38 - same end goal you can work together
09:41 - um so yeah i'd say like one perseverance
09:44 - and to aligning yourself with the right
09:45 - people
09:47 - awesome kelsey what about you what
09:48 - what's that one piece of advice that
09:50 - you're like man
09:51 - someone should have told me this at the
09:53 - beginning of my program
09:55 - uh definitely in the beginning do not
09:58 - compare yourself
09:59 - to other people you're going in and it's
10:01 - about you and your own development so i
10:03 - think that was one thing i probably
10:06 - should have you know took into
10:07 - consideration when i joined because i
10:09 - went to a predominantly you know white
10:12 - school and especially in my courses they
10:14 - were mostly men
10:15 - so going in you're already like the one
10:17 - out of 10
10:18 - women that are in the in the the class
10:21 - so
10:22 - definitely leave that at the door you
10:24 - know you're in there to learn
10:26 - uh that would be my best advice yeah and
10:28 - i and i think
10:29 - those are both really great pieces of
10:31 - advice and i think it really
10:32 - kind of gets to the notion that um you
10:35 - know you got admitted into these
10:37 - colleges
10:38 - um and in these programs for a specific
10:40 - reason right those colleges
10:41 - as someone who works in college
10:43 - admissions and this is what i do right
10:45 - we don't admit students that we don't
10:47 - think you're going to be successful in
10:48 - the program and so really being able to
10:51 - um be confident in yourself and know
10:53 - that you belong
10:54 - even if it doesn't always look like you
10:57 - belong
10:58 - right and you know i think about um not
11:01 - to compare my experience to the
11:02 - experience of our panelists but
11:04 - um being a black man and being one of
11:06 - the only black males in
11:08 - a lot of my classes in an education
11:10 - program early childhood education
11:12 - program
11:12 - a field that's dominated by women in
11:15 - really i'm having to know that i'm there
11:17 - for a reason
11:17 - um and i was chosen to be there for a
11:21 - reason
11:21 - so that confidence is i think really
11:23 - really important
11:25 - um when you think about kind of moving
11:27 - into the next
11:28 - question um transitioning from high
11:30 - school to college is a very
11:32 - hectic process i think especially given
11:36 - where we are right now in the world with
11:38 - covid
11:39 - um you know with a lot of the the
11:42 - different challenges that we're having i
11:43 - think as
11:44 - as a community um and so you know you're
11:46 - transitioning from high school to
11:48 - college it's hectic
11:49 - um you feel like you're getting the hang
11:51 - of things
11:52 - um and then you really have to make that
11:55 - decision of
11:56 - is this the major that i really want to
11:58 - do is this
11:59 - the the the piece the the program that i
12:02 - really want to move
12:03 - um forward with and so um you know from
12:06 - our audience we really want to know
12:08 - at this point in time um have you
12:10 - declared your major i'm
12:12 - really curious if you have declared
12:15 - your major so far so hopefully that poll
12:17 - question is popping up here if it's not
12:19 - popping up now should be popping up
12:20 - shortly
12:21 - um there we go we want to get an idea if
12:23 - you have already
12:25 - um declared your major so um while the
12:28 - audience is doing our poll and i'll
12:29 - report those results here
12:31 - um in just a few um kelsey can you tell
12:34 - us how and when
12:35 - you determined which computer science
12:38 - specialization you wanted to major in
12:40 - can you really kind of give us an
12:42 - insight
12:42 - into your process of deciding how you
12:44 - how you chose that
12:46 - sure um so when i went into my undergrad
12:49 - i
12:49 - already decided that i was going to do
12:51 - electrical engineering
12:52 - i didn't go undecided i already chose
12:55 - that major
12:56 - and what really made me choose that was
12:58 - from courses and clubs that i did in
13:00 - high school
13:01 - so i was in a robotics club and i did a
13:03 - physics and those kind of both helped me
13:06 - understand
13:07 - what i kind of wanted to do in the next
13:09 - four years or what more information i
13:11 - wanted
13:12 - out of that area so definitely
13:15 - if you really like coursework that
13:17 - you've done in your last
13:19 - year of high school um and you want to
13:22 - do that
13:22 - going forward that that's always a
13:24 - leading way to decide
13:25 - uh whether the major is right for you
13:28 - and did you happen to change your major
13:29 - at all kelsey did you like
13:31 - once you entered college did you stick
13:32 - with your major did you go and
13:34 - maybe switch concentrations or areas
13:37 - so for my master's i did photonics which
13:40 - is kind of a subdivision of
13:42 - uh electrical engineering so for that
13:45 - one
13:46 - i liked the way the field was
13:48 - underdeveloped meaning there was a lot
13:50 - of research to be done
13:52 - so i wanted to do my master's studies
13:54 - and that
13:56 - and and that's kind of the main
13:58 - specialization that i picked
13:59 - it kind of incorporated uh electrical
14:02 - engineering and physics
14:04 - together and so that's why i picked it
14:06 - great awesome
14:07 - um we've got the poll results before i
14:09 - asked christine to kind of jump in with
14:11 - with her answers but
14:12 - um it looks like 41 of students have not
14:15 - dick
14:15 - or have declared their major excuse me
14:17 - and then 59 of students
14:19 - have not declared their major um and so
14:21 - just a really interesting piece of
14:23 - advice and i don't think that that's a
14:24 - bad thing it's not an outlier in any way
14:27 - shape or form
14:28 - many students do enter into their
14:30 - college career
14:31 - um without a major um they go in
14:33 - undecided that is the most popular major
14:36 - if you will at the college i work for
14:38 - and at most colleges that i've worked
14:39 - for um in the past and so
14:41 - totally okay if you don't know but
14:43 - christine for you how how did you
14:45 - go through that process of picking what
14:47 - specialization you wanted to major in
14:50 - um i'd have to say for me it was more
14:52 - elimination of what i didn't want to do
14:56 - which was i don't know it worked for me
14:58 - but i mean a lot of my family members
15:00 - are in
15:00 - like medicine and health and i was like
15:02 - i can't do that
15:04 - um but then i did like in high school i
15:06 - did enjoy like the math and the physics
15:07 - and sciences so i was like i'll
15:09 - probably will stick to engineering and
15:11 - entering college i thought i was going
15:12 - to do civil engineering
15:14 - um but once i took that first computer
15:17 - science class i was like forget that
15:19 - this is
15:21 - so i would say just in your first year
15:23 - like just take as many
15:24 - it's the time that you have to really
15:26 - explore
15:27 - um you might not know what's out there
15:29 - um so it's
15:30 - in a way it's good to be undecided it's
15:32 - like a lot more things are open to you
15:34 - um so yeah that's how i got into
15:38 - computer engineering made the right
15:39 - choice i am very
15:41 - happy i did and i think that that spot
15:45 - on christine in terms
15:47 - of um coming in as an undecided student
15:50 - uh you know i think sometimes students
15:51 - feel this pressure
15:52 - that i've got to enter in um to college
15:55 - knowing exactly what it is that i want
15:58 - to do
15:58 - um for the rest of my life and i just i
16:01 - don't think that that's always possible
16:03 - i'm
16:03 - 34 years old and there are still days
16:06 - that i'm like yeah
16:07 - maybe i'll switch careers here you know
16:09 - and so it's it's okay to take classes
16:12 - across campus
16:13 - um and really get a sense of what you
16:15 - like and what you don't like
16:16 - um and using the resources that your
16:18 - campus has to offer
16:20 - you know many campuses have career
16:22 - centers and they have assessments that
16:24 - you can take
16:24 - to help you understand what your skill
16:27 - sets are
16:28 - and how your skill sets might be best
16:30 - used um as you move forward too so
16:32 - really great
16:33 - great stories that you all really kind
16:34 - of share with us
16:36 - about that um so you know now that both
16:39 - of you are working in the workforce
16:41 - um you're out you're you're in your
16:43 - career you're doing
16:44 - really awesome work i'm sure you've had
16:47 - some time to reflect on your college
16:49 - experience
16:50 - and probably have realized that you've
16:51 - learned a lot from college
16:54 - and from what you went through there of
16:57 - all the lessons that you learned in the
16:58 - classes that you took
17:00 - what skills coding languages and
17:02 - information helped you best prepare for
17:05 - your role
17:06 - as a full-time employee and christine
17:08 - maybe if you want to take that one first
17:10 - for us
17:11 - sure um one thing i do think
17:15 - college like really helped me and was um
17:18 - kelsey had mentioned earlier like
17:19 - learning the basic principles
17:21 - that will just take you because with
17:24 - technology especially things are always
17:26 - changing
17:27 - um so you those basic principles a lot
17:29 - of the newer technologies are all built
17:31 - on
17:32 - that foundational layer so i will say
17:35 - like
17:36 - a lot of the languages we had i had some
17:38 - classes where we did like five
17:40 - programming languages in a semester
17:42 - and it wasn't necessarily that they
17:43 - wanted us to master all those languages
17:45 - it was just learning how to learn
17:48 - um so i think it's just you need to like
17:51 - be i think like realize you're always
17:53 - going to be learning it's not like you
17:54 - finish college and you stop learning
17:56 - um so keep learning like you're forever
17:59 - a student that's what i'm learning i
18:01 - still like learn
18:01 - new things like classes you know so
18:04 - definitely
18:05 - i just keep on the like the learning
18:06 - attitude yeah
18:08 - that's so spot on being a lifelong
18:10 - learner i think is just something that
18:12 - all of us should strive to be and should
18:14 - be
18:14 - um and we do continue to learn
18:16 - constantly throughout our careers and
18:18 - throughout our lives and so that's a
18:19 - really
18:20 - really great lesson um that you learned
18:22 - kelsey what about you what what do you
18:24 - think that you really
18:25 - learned on what skills what informations
18:28 - what experiences really
18:30 - helped best prepare you to be a
18:31 - full-time employee
18:33 - so a lot of my coursework uh was
18:36 - designed on problem solving
18:38 - so a lot of assessing the issue and
18:39 - figuring out the best way to
18:41 - solve it so i definitely apply that in
18:44 - my
18:44 - career right now what i do is i take
18:47 - issues from customers and i find the
18:49 - best way to make to solve them to
18:51 - you know find their pain points and
18:52 - minimize them
18:54 - definitely you're always learning just
18:56 - like what christine said
18:57 - uh i didn't know python going into my
19:00 - job
19:01 - but currently i do a lot of scripting to
19:03 - make things more efficient
19:05 - so if i'm trying to test something i
19:07 - will design a python script
19:09 - in order to test it i didn't know that
19:12 - but
19:12 - having the fundamentals from that c
19:14 - class definitely helped me
19:16 - you know graphs the language better than
19:19 - if i didn't have anything
19:20 - so even though i'm not really using what
19:23 - i learned in school
19:24 - having the background in it really
19:26 - helped me uh
19:27 - progress into my career right now yeah i
19:30 - think those solid foundations
19:33 - those solid foundational courses and
19:35 - skills that people learn
19:36 - really can kind of help um kind of
19:39 - through that process as well and you
19:40 - know i think for me when i think about
19:42 - kind of going into the workforce and
19:44 - kind of what that really meant and and
19:47 - and how that really was going to
19:48 - manifest itself it really you know i
19:50 - think i used a lot of
19:52 - um the skills that i actually learned
19:54 - outside of the classroom
19:55 - right i mean i think that there's so
19:56 - much that we learn in the classroom
19:58 - right um which is awesome and it's it's
20:02 - a
20:02 - really great thing to be able to do that
20:04 - and at the same time i think there's
20:06 - so much that you're going to learn
20:07 - through your clubs
20:09 - through your organizations um through
20:11 - having leadership
20:12 - roles um in some of these organizations
20:15 - there's so much
20:16 - there um in terms of learning how to
20:18 - speak learning how to communicate
20:20 - learning how to think critically
20:22 - those problems solving skills that you
20:24 - really spoke of
20:25 - um those kind of things can really help
20:27 - i think when you go into
20:29 - the workforce as well so some really
20:32 - really really really great points there
20:34 - so
20:34 - what we're going to do we're going to
20:35 - move into some q a
20:38 - um and this is q a that we have gathered
20:40 - from
20:41 - um you um our panelists are not our
20:43 - panelists our attendees if you will
20:45 - um in advance to this particular panel
20:48 - um
20:49 - and we are going to pose these questions
20:51 - um to each of our panelists and see
20:53 - what insight they can share with us so
20:55 - our first question is from mary
20:57 - m um and the question is what if
21:01 - anything has ever
21:02 - made you want to stop pursuing or drop
21:05 - out of
21:06 - the stem field or computer science um
21:08 - and what made you decide to stay with it
21:11 - um so have there ever been anything
21:13 - that's you've been like you know what
21:14 - maybe this is
21:15 - not for me like i'm gonna go and do
21:17 - something else or what is it that
21:19 - actually keeps you
21:20 - keeps you in it kelsey uh for me
21:23 - definitely seeing like a low grade on a
21:28 - a final exam or something getting a bad
21:30 - score in a class like i remember
21:32 - even though the fundamentals that i say
21:35 - is one of my favorite cs classes i
21:36 - didn't do exactly that
21:38 - the greatest in that class i think i
21:39 - ended up with a b or something in the
21:41 - class one
21:42 - i'm coming from a high school you know
21:44 - all
21:45 - a's b's you know i'm used to usually at
21:47 - that level of performing and
21:49 - and when you get a letter grade that you
21:52 - didn't feel like you
21:53 - need or would like uh that could
21:56 - definitely
21:57 - you know dimmer or put a dimmer on what
21:59 - you want to do
22:00 - in the future so definitely getting that
22:02 - the first quarter
22:03 - uh for me uh made me question like is
22:06 - this really actually kind of what i want
22:07 - to be doing but
22:08 - uh i continued the coursework to see if
22:11 - there was anything else you know maybe
22:12 - if there was another
22:13 - pitfall in the future then i would
22:15 - reconsider and i didn't have it so
22:18 - i definitely think even though you get a
22:20 - low grade in one class just
22:21 - try keep try it one more time you know
22:23 - keep keep going with the flow and
22:26 - uh if you you may find that actually is
22:28 - is great and it comes back to
22:30 - be a positive experience yeah yeah and i
22:34 - i can so relate to that experience
22:36 - kelsey i tell this story all the time
22:38 - with students that i work with but um
22:40 - you know i was a student in high school
22:42 - 3.8
22:43 - gpa student i had a 28 a.c.t like i did
22:46 - well
22:47 - got into a great school and at the end
22:49 - of my first semester i had a 1.8 gpa
22:51 - right and you start really thinking
22:54 - about and i think having that imposter
22:56 - syndrome
22:57 - should i be here do i belong here at the
22:59 - this institution do i belong in this
23:01 - program
23:02 - that i've decided to go into and i think
23:05 - to continue to kelsey's point to
23:07 - continue
23:08 - to push yourself forward and say this is
23:10 - just a roadblock
23:11 - this is just one blip in my entire
23:14 - journey that i'm really going to have
23:16 - over the course of my years
23:18 - in college and after college and know
23:20 - that you can
23:21 - get through that you can certainly go
23:23 - through that process
23:24 - and come out of it on the other side and
23:27 - end up doing well you know i graduate
23:28 - with a 3.0 gpa which i was very
23:30 - excited about to have that into my four
23:33 - years in college and so
23:34 - i think that persistence piece is really
23:37 - um important
23:38 - um for you christine what was it that
23:40 - might have made you stop pursuing
23:42 - um a stem field or computer science and
23:45 - what was that that thing that maybe
23:47 - turned it around for you to say you know
23:48 - what i'm going gonna keep going with it
23:50 - yeah i mean i went through this like
23:53 - with every project i did
23:54 - i was it was a lot of sleepless nights
23:56 - and i was like what am i doing my
23:59 - friends are out
24:00 - having normal college experiences and
24:02 - i'm here in the library
24:04 - um for hours on end and this thing isn't
24:06 - compiling
24:07 - um so i think for me was like the long
24:10 - nights
24:11 - and i had some like mental breakdowns
24:15 - um but at the end of the day like things
24:17 - did compile
24:18 - i like would have you know like however
24:22 - long it took it was so rewarding though
24:24 - like to see something that you
24:25 - i can't come out of your head onto a
24:27 - computer um
24:28 - so yeah a lot of moments of doubt um
24:32 - but i will say was rewarding to see
24:34 - something from my head in a screen
24:37 - um i'm gonna go off script for a second
24:39 - because that's what i like to do
24:40 - sometimes and i'm really curious kind of
24:42 - to your point christine
24:43 - how do you deal with that self-care
24:45 - piece of it right i mean what are the
24:47 - things between the two of you that you
24:49 - really
24:49 - um do in order to stay motivated in
24:52 - order to make sure that you can
24:54 - um kind of take care of yourself because
24:56 - i think there you know in college there
24:58 - are a lot of those sleepless nights
25:00 - and really tough exams and you know
25:02 - moments that you think man how am i
25:04 - actually going to get through
25:05 - through this and so for you both of you
25:08 - i'm really really curious how
25:10 - you really dealt with the self-care part
25:12 - of it
25:14 - as you went through college um
25:18 - let's see my sister will tell you that
25:22 - she was my crying shoulder
25:23 - um but i think it's like i having a
25:26 - support system
25:27 - um really knowing like having people you
25:30 - can really turn to and be like listen i
25:31 - really had a hard day like i just need
25:33 - to
25:34 - have ice cream and just binge watch
25:35 - something um
25:37 - and yeah so like a support system um
25:41 - and if not that also just being kind to
25:44 - yourself
25:44 - um realizing okay you know what this
25:47 - saturday i'm gonna close my laptop close
25:49 - my books
25:49 - go for a run do what i need to do to
25:51 - relax um
25:53 - yeah being like just kind with yourself
25:55 - but also accountable you know be like
25:56 - okay saturday i took a day off sunday
25:58 - i'm going to get back to it
25:59 - um so yeah yeah
26:02 - kelsey what do you what did you do in
26:03 - college to self-care
26:05 - so a lot of my friends were kind of in
26:08 - the same course
26:09 - so whenever we had exams wherever we had
26:11 - projects that were just so
26:13 - mind-boggling that once it was done we'd
26:15 - all get together and just be like
26:17 - oh it's done like yeah we're free and
26:19 - just have you know just to talk to each
26:21 - other and express like what we're the
26:23 - like the really
26:24 - hard things and how did they come and
26:26 - and compare
26:27 - and so it's kind of a way to de-stress
26:29 - after you've been ramping this dress the
26:31 - whole you know quarter basically
26:33 - um so that's kind of one thing that i
26:35 - did in in college is definitely finding
26:37 - people that
26:38 - can sympathize with what you're going to
26:40 - you don't want to
26:41 - express your you know stress to someone
26:44 - who's
26:45 - partying all the time like that's not
26:46 - going to help you need to you know
26:48 - find someone that also is kind of around
26:50 - the same point you are
26:51 - and maybe build off each other and say
26:53 - hey look i think you you you should try
26:55 - focusing on this next time and work from
26:57 - there
26:58 - um but i also agree that taking like a
27:00 - day off is is really good
27:02 - but be accountable you know make sure
27:04 - that
27:05 - just because you took a day off doesn't
27:06 - mean that you you should continue it uh
27:09 - it's just
27:10 - a good time to take care of yourself uh
27:12 - maybe watch shows go hang with friends
27:14 - so you can ignore
27:16 - the stress but uh definitely get back on
27:18 - it because it's a slippery slope when
27:20 - you stop
27:20 - wearing it things build up really
27:23 - quickly
27:24 - yeah yeah that thing don't go away
27:27 - exactly it's going to be there tomorrow
27:30 - it certainly is going to be there
27:31 - tomorrow so
27:33 - take your moment take a day to yourself
27:35 - but get back on that horse and make sure
27:37 - that you stay
27:38 - focused yeah i i baked cookies for my
27:41 - floor
27:44 - just what i do so that was my self-care
27:49 - was baking cookies and eating them
27:51 - [Laughter]
27:54 - probably not the best decision but it
27:56 - was okay
27:58 - the next question is from maria m um the
28:01 - question
28:02 - is with computer science core uh classes
28:04 - becoming more intense
28:05 - every year um how do you balance taking
28:08 - several
28:08 - challenging classes each semester at
28:11 - once without confusing the information
28:13 - during exams that's a really great
28:15 - question
28:16 - um and maybe christine if you want to
28:17 - maybe uh jump in on that one first
28:20 - okay that's an interesting question i've
28:22 - never even thought about
28:24 - like um i think once you get into the
28:27 - classes
28:28 - um you do see differences so like some
28:31 - things will be more
28:32 - algorithms other things um
28:35 - i think it's like a per class basis it
28:38 - might not happen as
28:39 - frequently as you think to confuse
28:41 - information
28:42 - um but
28:45 - let's see yeah
28:48 - so i yeah that's what i'd say
28:52 - i like it no i and i think that you're
28:54 - spot on i think that
28:56 - i think that people think that it's
28:58 - going to be one of those things where
28:59 - you confuse things more than you
29:01 - maybe do in a way um kelsey what's your
29:04 - insight on that question how might have
29:05 - you uh kind of kept some of that
29:07 - information separate
29:09 - yeah i'm trying to think of a time where
29:10 - i was in an exam and i wrote down
29:12 - another exam and i don't think i've had
29:16 - something like that i may have spent
29:18 - more time studying one topic
29:20 - over the other that i can see i
29:22 - definitely probably have done
29:24 - um but i think to that extent if for
29:26 - some reason you have exams on the same
29:28 - day
29:29 - let's say final exams and they're like
29:31 - back to back sometimes you can talk to
29:32 - the professor and ask them like look i
29:34 - have these two exams right next to each
29:36 - other and they're very hard like
29:38 - can i push one forward uh usually
29:40 - they're they're
29:41 - pretty lenient on that if you really
29:43 - explain um that they're tough classes
29:45 - and you need
29:46 - a break in between because three hour
29:48 - final exams are
29:50 - kill your brain slowly
29:55 - yeah i think i think that's spot on as
29:57 - well you know i think one of the things
29:58 - that i always recommend to students
30:00 - um just in general and it's a good habit
30:02 - to get into is just
30:03 - continue as you are if you're in high
30:06 - school um and you're working towards
30:07 - college or maybe you're in college and
30:09 - you're working kind of towards
30:10 - graduation
30:11 - you know i think the the continued focus
30:13 - on organization
30:14 - and how you structure your day and
30:17 - structure
30:18 - um you know what it is that you're doing
30:19 - on a regular basis you know i
30:22 - um always tell folks and this was the
30:24 - lesson that i learned after my 1.8 gpa
30:27 - semester that i had
30:28 - um but i learned that your education
30:30 - should be a full-time job
30:32 - that is what you are in college to do
30:33 - right you're there
30:35 - um to get that degree and so from nine
30:37 - to five you should be working on or
30:39 - whatever that eight hour time slot is
30:41 - during the day
30:42 - you really should be focusing on um your
30:45 - academics and so that structure
30:48 - i think sometimes can help folks when it
30:50 - comes to
30:51 - um balancing maybe material in different
30:53 - classes too
30:54 - yeah um we have another question and
30:57 - it's from christina y
30:59 - um and the question is in many of my
31:01 - major classes i have noticed people are
31:03 - either already extremely familiar with
31:05 - the material
31:06 - or they're quick learners which makes me
31:08 - nervous about my career choice
31:11 - how much prior coding experience is
31:13 - needed to successfully land
31:15 - an internship or a job and so
31:18 - kelsey i don't know if you have any
31:20 - insight on that piece of it
31:22 - so i think it kind of goes along with uh
31:24 - don't compare yourself
31:26 - i know there i have many classes where
31:28 - people have come in knowing pretty much
31:30 - the whole content of the class or having
31:32 - the previous exams
31:34 - and using that as a reference so you
31:36 - know there's no point in comparing with
31:38 - them they have already have a leg up
31:40 - you just need to focus on understanding
31:42 - the material because
31:43 - professors design the class for you know
31:46 - entry
31:47 - people to understand it so if it says
31:50 - you require a specific knowledge
31:51 - beforehand
31:52 - then maybe you should but if it doesn't
31:54 - say any knowledge is required then
31:56 - i think uh going into it without any
32:00 - prior knowledge is totally fine as long
32:01 - as you you know put in the effort for it
32:03 - um for prior coding experience
32:07 - um since i didn't really have that much
32:09 - other than coursework i really can't
32:11 - comment too much on this but i
32:12 - definitely think that having any
32:15 - sort of coding language in your you know
32:17 - back pocket is a plus because
32:19 - everywhere every company wants to be
32:21 - efficient and they can always do that by
32:23 - scripting so that's what i learned in my
32:25 - current job that you know having some
32:27 - fundamentals of understanding how to
32:30 - write a code
32:31 - read someone else's code um is really
32:33 - important uh
32:34 - and you know if it says only job
32:37 - description
32:38 - no coding then maybe you should take you
32:39 - know a couple hours to refresh
32:41 - but that's that's all i can say that's
32:44 - great what about you christine any
32:46 - advice one um
32:47 - on that yeah i mean i think
32:51 - like some coding experiences
32:55 - needed necessary just to like be able to
32:57 - like
32:58 - have a conversation and really
32:59 - understand but a lot of times like i've
33:02 - just seen in like the real world
33:04 - you learn on the job like you learn and
33:06 - people are there
33:08 - like i was in my first job i remember i
33:11 - was like so scared like
33:12 - my first task like not to ask questions
33:14 - and my
33:16 - um my manager was like if you have any
33:18 - questions ask me and then i was like
33:19 - wait do you really mean that
33:20 - like i don't get like i thought like i
33:24 - was going to be punished you know
33:25 - because i didn't know something and he
33:26 - was like no we're a teen
33:28 - so i think like post college um
33:31 - you get more into like we're just it's
33:34 - not they're not necessarily out looking
33:35 - at you
33:36 - they're just trying to finish a task so
33:39 - and the more that you can communicate
33:40 - the more
33:41 - um the better you could communicate like
33:44 - what you know and what you don't know
33:46 - that's also really important because a
33:48 - you learn and b do whatever you're doing
33:49 - better
33:50 - um so yeah so a lot of the real world
33:53 - you learn on the job
33:54 - so yeah it's it's true um you know i
33:57 - think internships obviously are
33:58 - important to have some sort of skill set
34:00 - to offer for
34:02 - you know whatever that that internship
34:03 - is um but that's supposed to be a
34:05 - learning experience
34:06 - internships are designed to help you
34:09 - learn
34:10 - um about a particular industry or better
34:12 - about a particular field and so
34:14 - you're right i mean there is a lot of
34:16 - that that really occurs um
34:17 - kind of on the fly on the job um i'm
34:20 - gonna add
34:21 - in a question here um do you have any
34:24 - advice this was a really interesting one
34:26 - through our q a
34:27 - um do you have any advice for someone
34:28 - who might be getting uh
34:30 - bullied or picked on for being a girl in
34:33 - computer science
34:34 - and is that something that either of you
34:35 - have really dealt with
34:39 - i i don't maybe they said it behind my
34:42 - back but i just wasn't paying attention
34:44 - but uh
34:44 - no one has ever verbally said it to me
34:48 - um but you definitely get looks you know
34:50 - that that's
34:51 - you go into a room with mainly men like
34:53 - you're gonna get looks and uh
34:54 - unfortunate that you know things like
34:56 - this do happen but
34:58 - i would have to say you know they're
34:59 - just jealous you know you're a female
35:02 - you know you you're in
35:03 - and you're threatening almost in a way
35:05 - so just
35:06 - remember that you know and uh try to
35:08 - find people to support you have your
35:10 - back
35:11 - uh it may be hard in the beginning but
35:12 - you'll find them you'll find your crew
35:14 - that's true love that christine any
35:16 - additions to that
35:18 - yeah i mean you have to for us to like
35:21 - really
35:21 - like make a difference we have to be
35:23 - present you know so i remember one time
35:26 - i was i was at a tech talk and this is
35:28 - like the
35:29 - my first and only experience but it
35:30 - shook me um
35:32 - i was at a tech talk and i was standing
35:33 - in the back so i just come from work
35:35 - and i remember a guy came up to me and
35:37 - he was like hey do you know where i can
35:39 - get more napkins
35:40 - and he thought i was like there to
35:42 - assist with the program
35:44 - and it just shook me because i hadn't
35:45 - experienced that in my life and i was
35:47 - like
35:47 - okay okay well um
35:51 - no i was like well i'm attending it too
35:53 - but
35:54 - you can ask you know like i'm sure you
35:56 - can find them there um so
35:58 - i think just being present is like
36:01 - lesson enough you know so i would just
36:04 - like it's more yeah
36:08 - it's more impactful just being there
36:10 - than even saying anything
36:12 - and like let these men know that girls
36:15 - run
36:15 - the world like i just it just really
36:19 - bothers me
36:19 - i i'm not gonna go on a soapbox about my
36:23 - feelings
36:24 - about all of this but like we need to
36:27 - let women run the world that that's like
36:29 - just what needs to happen
36:30 - and so um hold your head up high
36:34 - keep moving forward like do you is what
36:37 - i say like do you be in that room
36:39 - and i and again i i you know it's
36:42 - definitely different but similarly being
36:44 - a black man being a gay man
36:46 - um being um you know someone young
36:49 - relatively young in my position like you
36:51 - just have to go in and know that people
36:52 - are going to talk and at the end of the
36:54 - day
36:55 - you're there for a reason you were hired
36:57 - for your job for a reason
36:58 - you got admitted into your school for a
37:00 - reason and like
37:02 - go and just do you like live your life
37:05 - um i had to say that out loud okay
37:08 - we have about three ish minutes left for
37:10 - questions so i'm gonna at least pull um
37:11 - at least one more
37:12 - um aren't there any resources or
37:15 - materials or
37:16 - tools that you would recommend for
37:18 - college students who are
37:19 - in tech that you have seen that's maybe
37:23 - been a lifesaver for you
37:25 - um maybe through your college years or
37:27 - after you graduated from college in
37:28 - terms of tools resources
37:30 - materials books anything like that
37:35 - uh for me personally i it seems strange
37:38 - but youtube
37:39 - uh if you definitely need help like a
37:41 - math problem and a
37:42 - you know physics problem or anything
37:44 - like that or coding problem
37:45 - if you go on youtube and type kind of
37:47 - similar you know something similar to
37:49 - what the problem
37:50 - is you'll find a step-by-step by someone
37:52 - usually on a whiteboard kind of going
37:53 - over it so
37:54 - you know it's free uh i mean there's
37:56 - some ads but you
37:57 - you don't get around those but uh yeah
38:00 - definitely youtube
38:01 - anyone can use it so yeah um for
38:05 - coding i really like udemy um i
38:08 - i know a lot of schools might have like
38:11 - can get you through a discount or
38:12 - something
38:13 - but that if you want like just like to
38:15 - learn something really quickly
38:16 - they their classes are organized really
38:19 - well
38:20 - um if you have maybe like a day like
38:22 - some classes can be like a python class
38:24 - javascript react
38:26 - it can be like a week of just make
38:28 - making an intense schedule for yourself
38:30 - they're
38:30 - really helpful they go through the
38:32 - basics really well so it's udemy
38:34 - udemy love it love resources like that
38:39 - and again i think continuing to check
38:40 - with your i'm gonna plug career centers
38:42 - again because they're
38:43 - one of my favorites a lot of resources
38:45 - there a lot of resources through college
38:47 - libraries
38:49 - a lot of free resources that they really
38:51 - have to offer for students
38:53 - always something to think about your
38:55 - professors in their office hours
38:56 - go to your professor's office hours
39:00 - go talk to your professors like
39:04 - yeah how often did you all do office
39:05 - hours with your professors would you say
39:07 - that was a pretty frequent occurrence or
39:10 - usually when you just needed something
39:11 - or how did that work for you
39:14 - so definitely oh go ahead christine go
39:17 - um no i remember i found out about
39:19 - office hours a little too late until
39:21 - like my
39:22 - end of like second semester junior year
39:24 - and i was like
39:25 - what um so i wish i learned knew sooner
39:29 - that my professors were just there
39:30 - literally as
39:32 - questions um so yes do office hours
39:37 - go ahead kelsey um yeah definitely same
39:40 - thing i
39:40 - didn't really use it during my undergrad
39:43 - i really regret it now because i used it
39:44 - a lot during my master's because
39:46 - i just needed that extra help and they
39:48 - were willing and there were tas that
39:50 - also were helpful
39:51 - so definitely don't be afraid like even
39:53 - if you come in and you think that you're
39:54 - gonna ask some silly questions
39:56 - and they're gonna look down on you like
39:57 - they won't they'll walk you through it i
39:59 - mean they're there to help
40:01 - um and definitely if at the end of the
40:03 - you know quarter or semester
40:05 - you finally decide to go see the
40:06 - professor and you ask for help they're
40:08 - gonna wonder
40:09 - where were you during the whole semester
40:11 - so definitely try to show face
40:13 - you know a little bit of the time uh
40:16 - just so at the end you can be like i've
40:18 - been there i need help please
40:19 - so just and just to clarify office hours
40:23 - for anyone who doesn't know who's not
40:24 - quite yet in college a lot of professors
40:26 - will hold times during the week that
40:28 - students can walk in
40:30 - um and ask questions or chat or get help
40:33 - on homework
40:34 - or on the readings so definitely take
40:37 - advantage of
40:38 - office hours we're going to ask one more
40:40 - question i think this is kind of a fun
40:41 - one
40:42 - to end on um and the question is if you
40:45 - had to pick another professional
40:47 - field what would it be
40:51 - and let's start with kelsey if you had
40:54 - to pick
40:54 - another field to be in what do you think
40:58 - that might
40:58 - might be for you um
41:02 - i think maybe going towards like either
41:05 - i have
41:06 - two two different like in my mind so one
41:09 - would be medicine because i was always
41:10 - fascinated with it but i just i can't
41:12 - grasp my head around chemistry it's just
41:15 - too i don't know why
41:16 - that one just bothered me um
41:19 - but then also business because i didn't
41:22 - realize
41:23 - how comfortable i am more or less kind
41:26 - of talking to people
41:28 - and i think business has a lot of that
41:29 - aspect as an engineer you may not get
41:31 - that much experience you know
41:33 - presenting or or talking to groups or
41:36 - projects so uh definitely maybe
41:39 - marketing kind of that sort of concept
41:41 - uh
41:41 - it's kind of interesting to me right now
41:44 - but uh definitely those two but
41:45 - it's very very different i love that
41:48 - though christine what about you what
41:49 - would you do
41:51 - um well
41:54 - probably i'd want to do something
41:57 - related with english and like poetry
41:59 - so like being a writer um yeah i find
42:03 - that
42:03 - i mean i'm interested in psychology and
42:06 - like reading that kind of stuff so
42:08 - i'd ha very different very different but
42:11 - total the other side but i'd probably do
42:13 - like poetry be a writer
42:15 - yeah yeah those are awesome fields i
42:17 - like that
42:18 - i would go i've always wanted to do
42:20 - urban planning which is so weird
42:22 - um but like i'm so interested in how
42:25 - cities um you know thinking about coding
42:29 - and buildings and um you know how do you
42:32 - how do you really structure cities in
42:33 - such a way to really serve
42:36 - um the population in a really effective
42:38 - way and so i've always wanted to go back
42:40 - to school for urban planning
42:42 - and never have and probably never will
42:44 - but uh it would be fun you never know
42:46 - you never know right it might happen one
42:49 - day yeah
42:50 - for sure it's so intriguing to me so
42:53 - uh well awesome well thank you all so
42:55 - much those were really really really
42:57 - great
42:58 - um insights that both of you really had
43:00 - um about your experiences you had some
43:02 - great great
43:03 - uh stories to share um with our um
43:06 - with our attendees and you're so
43:08 - grateful for your time um with us this
43:10 - evening so i'm gonna turn it over to
43:11 - alyssa
43:12 - from girls who code who has some last
43:14 - minute things to share
43:17 - hi everyone i just want to thank you for
43:20 - joining us this evening i'm bringing up
43:23 - the powerpoint on the screen one second
43:26 - um so if everyone doesn't mind taking
43:29 - out their phones
43:30 - um just um holding it over the qr code
43:33 - and mind taking our one minute survey
43:35 - just to let you know what we thought of
43:37 - the evening
43:38 - um yeah and if i just want to thank
43:40 - everyone derek christina
43:41 - um kelsey for joining us this evening it

43:46 - thank you so much thank you
45:44 - um
45:50 - you

Cleaned transcript:

howdy welcome my name is emily heist moss i'm the director of alumni programs at girls who code thank you so much for joining us tonight for a gwc talk i'm really excited to welcome back our moderator derek brinkley derek joined us for our very first gwc talk a few months ago and we enjoyed his advice and suggestions and attitude so much we invited him back he'll be moderating our panel tonight and derek is the assistant vice president of undergraduate admissions at columbia college chicago he is a true expert he also helped launch the aruba college of loyola university chicago a twoyear program designed for lowincome firstgeneration college students in his free time derek enjoys spending time with friends scuba diving and doing crossfit which i'm sure is outdoors right now derek when you're ready take it away excellent thank you emily i appreciate it welcome welcome welcome um my name is derek brinkley as emily said and i'm so excited to be here with you all again uh this evening um to discuss the computer science class experiences and any tips and tactics that helped our panelists succeed and we're going to introduce our panelists here in just a second so thank you again for taking time out of everyone's busy schedule um to be here with us this evening um for all of our viewers we ask that you use the chat box that we have to share any thoughts that you have and questions that you have throughout the entire evening's conversation um and a member of the girls who code staff will respond to any questions um comments and concerns that you may have so um those are just some ground rules we want to set early um in this process so that we have a really great event tonight so um so i'm going to take the time to introduce our analysts so first off we have kelsey rodriguez say hello kelsey wave to the fine people um kelsey kelsey is the senior application engineer at cadence design systems um which supports ke and she supports key customers by enhancing their design flows for cutting edge technology um she holds a bachelor's of science in electrical engineering from cal poly uh san luis obispo and a masters of science in electrical engineering from uc san diego so we're glad that you're with us this evening kelsey thanks for being here and then our second panelist is christine marette she is a software engineer at prudential financial um and a full stack developer who uses traditional and modern technologies to design solutions and she holds a bachelor's of science in computer engineering from the university of maryland college park and so we are super excited to have these two wonderful panelists if you didn't wave hello to the people christine wherever the people i'm super excited to have folks here tonight so um what we are going to do is we're going to start off tonight with an icebreaker um and then um we are going to uh follow that with some questions that will be addressed um by uh that will address the concerns of the girls who code college age alumni um in various students across the country who are beginning matriculating or ending their college experience so we're going to really take some time to really address some of the questions that you all have and then at the end of the conversation we'll have a q a segment that i'll lead um with questions that we gathered in advance specifically from our users and from our viewers so we're super excited about that so um so here's what we're going to do i'm going to start this question off with our panelists um kelsey i'm going to have you answer this one first um what was your favorite computer science or noncomputer science class when you were in undergrad okay so i actually aren't a computer science major i'm an electrical engineering major but i did take some cs courses so i would have to say that my favorite was just the introduction to fundamentals of computer science it was just basic c programming because a lot of the key aspects that i learned there i applied it to other languages and other problems it's a great way of conquering problems it really helps with problem solving but for my nonfavorites or my favorite noncs class it's definitely more of a physics class it was electromagnetics so i'll leave that you know just there awesome awesome christine what about you what were your favorite cs and noncs courses um let's see cs i think it was the same so it was my first cs class um and not so much like the material but just how it was presented so i had a really cool professor like biker dude and i was just like okay this is relatable like it's not you don't have to be like a certain kind of way um to be a programmer so it was just how the material was presented to me i was so it was so relatable um so yeah he made the class epic and i was like okay this is i'm doing this um yeah and then noncs i'd have to say um psychology like psychology was super interesting for me um it was just like another using another part of your brain so yeah for sure excellent excellent so viewers we want to hear from you right um we want you to answer the poll question that should have just popped up on your screen um is your favorite class computer science related or is it a noncomputer science related class we're going to give you about 30 seconds to respond and then we'll get that little piece of feedback and then we'll move forward what about you derek do you have any favorite class you know um so i was a education major in college and so um for me all of my favorite classes in college um in general either were an education class anything that allowed me to be in front of students in front of people getting a chance to teach getting a chance to impart knowledge helping students and seeing that light bulb that would go off with students when they learned a new concept when they really understood how to multiply numbers or whatever that concept might have been so i really really really enjoyed that course or those classes i also had a really cool class at my undergrad called marriage and family and it was taught it was teen taught by a theology professor a psychology professor and a sociology professor and so it talked about kind of the construct of marriage within societies and within different cultures and it was really really really interesting um to hear the perspective especially from those different areas those different fields and how that really um influenced i guess how different cultures and different areas looked at marriage so that was my favorite course in college yeah it was very different very cool though um very very cool so um thanks to everyone for for answering the poll so about 53 of our um attendees here said that a computer science course was their most favorite class um in college in about 48 set a noncomputer science course so really split that down the middle and you know i think it really goes to the point that um whatever field you go into after you graduate from college there really is the mix of the skill set that you're going to learn within your program right and i think the ability to think critically the ability to speak properly the ability to write properly to problem solve all of those things really i think go into a lot of us and our daily jobs and what it is that we do and so i think that that really speaks to having to use both your left brain and your right brain um as we really go throughout our career so i think that that's a really um awesome thing so what we're going to do is we're going to going to go on and um kind of move into our discussion questions so we do have some questions that we want to ask our panelists um this evening and you know we know that the computer science space is really dominated by a majority um white men um and asian men right and it's one of the reasons why this organization girls who code was really birthed and and why it really came to be um and we also recognize that uh being a woman in the technical world um has its barriers um and particularly as women of color there are certainly i would imagine another set of challenges even on top of uh of just being a woman um that you have to deal with so really with that being said i'm gonna direct this really and have christine maybe answer this first but what's one piece of advice you wish someone would have told you as an incoming student looking to major in computer sciences oregon kind of the sciences in general um let's see one piece of advice i think perseverance is key like um just anything like worth having like it'll just take hours and time um but also people surrounding yourself with good people um and that's i mean as much as there is you know conflict and people will see you differently there are also just so much there's a lot of good as well so there are people you can align yourself with um people like you people not like you um but you know if you both have the same end goal you can work together um so yeah i'd say like one perseverance and to aligning yourself with the right people awesome kelsey what about you what what's that one piece of advice that you're like man someone should have told me this at the beginning of my program uh definitely in the beginning do not compare yourself to other people you're going in and it's about you and your own development so i think that was one thing i probably should have you know took into consideration when i joined because i went to a predominantly you know white school and especially in my courses they were mostly men so going in you're already like the one out of 10 women that are in the in the the class so definitely leave that at the door you know you're in there to learn uh that would be my best advice yeah and i and i think those are both really great pieces of advice and i think it really kind of gets to the notion that um you know you got admitted into these colleges um and in these programs for a specific reason right those colleges as someone who works in college admissions and this is what i do right we don't admit students that we don't think you're going to be successful in the program and so really being able to um be confident in yourself and know that you belong even if it doesn't always look like you belong right and you know i think about um not to compare my experience to the experience of our panelists but um being a black man and being one of the only black males in a lot of my classes in an education program early childhood education program a field that's dominated by women in really i'm having to know that i'm there for a reason um and i was chosen to be there for a reason so that confidence is i think really really important um when you think about kind of moving into the next question um transitioning from high school to college is a very hectic process i think especially given where we are right now in the world with covid um you know with a lot of the the different challenges that we're having i think as as a community um and so you know you're transitioning from high school to college it's hectic um you feel like you're getting the hang of things um and then you really have to make that decision of is this the major that i really want to do is this the the the piece the the program that i really want to move um forward with and so um you know from our audience we really want to know at this point in time um have you declared your major i'm really curious if you have declared your major so far so hopefully that poll question is popping up here if it's not popping up now should be popping up shortly um there we go we want to get an idea if you have already um declared your major so um while the audience is doing our poll and i'll report those results here um in just a few um kelsey can you tell us how and when you determined which computer science specialization you wanted to major in can you really kind of give us an insight into your process of deciding how you how you chose that sure um so when i went into my undergrad i already decided that i was going to do electrical engineering i didn't go undecided i already chose that major and what really made me choose that was from courses and clubs that i did in high school so i was in a robotics club and i did a physics and those kind of both helped me understand what i kind of wanted to do in the next four years or what more information i wanted out of that area so definitely if you really like coursework that you've done in your last year of high school um and you want to do that going forward that that's always a leading way to decide uh whether the major is right for you and did you happen to change your major at all kelsey did you like once you entered college did you stick with your major did you go and maybe switch concentrations or areas so for my master's i did photonics which is kind of a subdivision of uh electrical engineering so for that one i liked the way the field was underdeveloped meaning there was a lot of research to be done so i wanted to do my master's studies and that and and that's kind of the main specialization that i picked it kind of incorporated uh electrical engineering and physics together and so that's why i picked it great awesome um we've got the poll results before i asked christine to kind of jump in with with her answers but um it looks like 41 of students have not dick or have declared their major excuse me and then 59 of students have not declared their major um and so just a really interesting piece of advice and i don't think that that's a bad thing it's not an outlier in any way shape or form many students do enter into their college career um without a major um they go in undecided that is the most popular major if you will at the college i work for and at most colleges that i've worked for um in the past and so totally okay if you don't know but christine for you how how did you go through that process of picking what specialization you wanted to major in um i'd have to say for me it was more elimination of what i didn't want to do which was i don't know it worked for me but i mean a lot of my family members are in like medicine and health and i was like i can't do that um but then i did like in high school i did enjoy like the math and the physics and sciences so i was like i'll probably will stick to engineering and entering college i thought i was going to do civil engineering um but once i took that first computer science class i was like forget that this is so i would say just in your first year like just take as many it's the time that you have to really explore um you might not know what's out there um so it's in a way it's good to be undecided it's like a lot more things are open to you um so yeah that's how i got into computer engineering made the right choice i am very happy i did and i think that that spot on christine in terms of um coming in as an undecided student uh you know i think sometimes students feel this pressure that i've got to enter in um to college knowing exactly what it is that i want to do um for the rest of my life and i just i don't think that that's always possible i'm 34 years old and there are still days that i'm like yeah maybe i'll switch careers here you know and so it's it's okay to take classes across campus um and really get a sense of what you like and what you don't like um and using the resources that your campus has to offer you know many campuses have career centers and they have assessments that you can take to help you understand what your skill sets are and how your skill sets might be best used um as you move forward too so really great great stories that you all really kind of share with us about that um so you know now that both of you are working in the workforce um you're out you're you're in your career you're doing really awesome work i'm sure you've had some time to reflect on your college experience and probably have realized that you've learned a lot from college and from what you went through there of all the lessons that you learned in the classes that you took what skills coding languages and information helped you best prepare for your role as a fulltime employee and christine maybe if you want to take that one first for us sure um one thing i do think college like really helped me and was um kelsey had mentioned earlier like learning the basic principles that will just take you because with technology especially things are always changing um so you those basic principles a lot of the newer technologies are all built on that foundational layer so i will say like a lot of the languages we had i had some classes where we did like five programming languages in a semester and it wasn't necessarily that they wanted us to master all those languages it was just learning how to learn um so i think it's just you need to like be i think like realize you're always going to be learning it's not like you finish college and you stop learning um so keep learning like you're forever a student that's what i'm learning i still like learn new things like classes you know so definitely i just keep on the like the learning attitude yeah that's so spot on being a lifelong learner i think is just something that all of us should strive to be and should be um and we do continue to learn constantly throughout our careers and throughout our lives and so that's a really really great lesson um that you learned kelsey what about you what what do you think that you really learned on what skills what informations what experiences really helped best prepare you to be a fulltime employee so a lot of my coursework uh was designed on problem solving so a lot of assessing the issue and figuring out the best way to solve it so i definitely apply that in my career right now what i do is i take issues from customers and i find the best way to make to solve them to you know find their pain points and minimize them definitely you're always learning just like what christine said uh i didn't know python going into my job but currently i do a lot of scripting to make things more efficient so if i'm trying to test something i will design a python script in order to test it i didn't know that but having the fundamentals from that c class definitely helped me you know graphs the language better than if i didn't have anything so even though i'm not really using what i learned in school having the background in it really helped me uh progress into my career right now yeah i think those solid foundations those solid foundational courses and skills that people learn really can kind of help um kind of through that process as well and you know i think for me when i think about kind of going into the workforce and kind of what that really meant and and and how that really was going to manifest itself it really you know i think i used a lot of um the skills that i actually learned outside of the classroom right i mean i think that there's so much that we learn in the classroom right um which is awesome and it's it's a really great thing to be able to do that and at the same time i think there's so much that you're going to learn through your clubs through your organizations um through having leadership roles um in some of these organizations there's so much there um in terms of learning how to speak learning how to communicate learning how to think critically those problems solving skills that you really spoke of um those kind of things can really help i think when you go into the workforce as well so some really really really really great points there so what we're going to do we're going to move into some q a um and this is q a that we have gathered from um you um our panelists are not our panelists our attendees if you will um in advance to this particular panel um and we are going to pose these questions um to each of our panelists and see what insight they can share with us so our first question is from mary m um and the question is what if anything has ever made you want to stop pursuing or drop out of the stem field or computer science um and what made you decide to stay with it um so have there ever been anything that's you've been like you know what maybe this is not for me like i'm gonna go and do something else or what is it that actually keeps you keeps you in it kelsey uh for me definitely seeing like a low grade on a a final exam or something getting a bad score in a class like i remember even though the fundamentals that i say is one of my favorite cs classes i didn't do exactly that the greatest in that class i think i ended up with a b or something in the class one i'm coming from a high school you know all a's b's you know i'm used to usually at that level of performing and and when you get a letter grade that you didn't feel like you need or would like uh that could definitely you know dimmer or put a dimmer on what you want to do in the future so definitely getting that the first quarter uh for me uh made me question like is this really actually kind of what i want to be doing but uh i continued the coursework to see if there was anything else you know maybe if there was another pitfall in the future then i would reconsider and i didn't have it so i definitely think even though you get a low grade in one class just try keep try it one more time you know keep keep going with the flow and uh if you you may find that actually is is great and it comes back to be a positive experience yeah yeah and i i can so relate to that experience kelsey i tell this story all the time with students that i work with but um you know i was a student in high school 3.8 gpa student i had a 28 a.c.t like i did well got into a great school and at the end of my first semester i had a 1.8 gpa right and you start really thinking about and i think having that imposter syndrome should i be here do i belong here at the this institution do i belong in this program that i've decided to go into and i think to continue to kelsey's point to continue to push yourself forward and say this is just a roadblock this is just one blip in my entire journey that i'm really going to have over the course of my years in college and after college and know that you can get through that you can certainly go through that process and come out of it on the other side and end up doing well you know i graduate with a 3.0 gpa which i was very excited about to have that into my four years in college and so i think that persistence piece is really um important um for you christine what was it that might have made you stop pursuing um a stem field or computer science and what was that that thing that maybe turned it around for you to say you know what i'm going gonna keep going with it yeah i mean i went through this like with every project i did i was it was a lot of sleepless nights and i was like what am i doing my friends are out having normal college experiences and i'm here in the library um for hours on end and this thing isn't compiling um so i think for me was like the long nights and i had some like mental breakdowns um but at the end of the day like things did compile i like would have you know like however long it took it was so rewarding though like to see something that you i can't come out of your head onto a computer um so yeah a lot of moments of doubt um but i will say was rewarding to see something from my head in a screen um i'm gonna go off script for a second because that's what i like to do sometimes and i'm really curious kind of to your point christine how do you deal with that selfcare piece of it right i mean what are the things between the two of you that you really um do in order to stay motivated in order to make sure that you can um kind of take care of yourself because i think there you know in college there are a lot of those sleepless nights and really tough exams and you know moments that you think man how am i actually going to get through through this and so for you both of you i'm really really curious how you really dealt with the selfcare part of it as you went through college um let's see my sister will tell you that she was my crying shoulder um but i think it's like i having a support system um really knowing like having people you can really turn to and be like listen i really had a hard day like i just need to have ice cream and just binge watch something um and yeah so like a support system um and if not that also just being kind to yourself um realizing okay you know what this saturday i'm gonna close my laptop close my books go for a run do what i need to do to relax um yeah being like just kind with yourself but also accountable you know be like okay saturday i took a day off sunday i'm going to get back to it um so yeah yeah kelsey what do you what did you do in college to selfcare so a lot of my friends were kind of in the same course so whenever we had exams wherever we had projects that were just so mindboggling that once it was done we'd all get together and just be like oh it's done like yeah we're free and just have you know just to talk to each other and express like what we're the like the really hard things and how did they come and and compare and so it's kind of a way to destress after you've been ramping this dress the whole you know quarter basically um so that's kind of one thing that i did in in college is definitely finding people that can sympathize with what you're going to you don't want to express your you know stress to someone who's partying all the time like that's not going to help you need to you know find someone that also is kind of around the same point you are and maybe build off each other and say hey look i think you you you should try focusing on this next time and work from there um but i also agree that taking like a day off is is really good but be accountable you know make sure that just because you took a day off doesn't mean that you you should continue it uh it's just a good time to take care of yourself uh maybe watch shows go hang with friends so you can ignore the stress but uh definitely get back on it because it's a slippery slope when you stop wearing it things build up really quickly yeah yeah that thing don't go away exactly it's going to be there tomorrow it certainly is going to be there tomorrow so take your moment take a day to yourself but get back on that horse and make sure that you stay focused yeah i i baked cookies for my floor just what i do so that was my selfcare was baking cookies and eating them [Laughter] probably not the best decision but it was okay the next question is from maria m um the question is with computer science core uh classes becoming more intense every year um how do you balance taking several challenging classes each semester at once without confusing the information during exams that's a really great question um and maybe christine if you want to maybe uh jump in on that one first okay that's an interesting question i've never even thought about like um i think once you get into the classes um you do see differences so like some things will be more algorithms other things um i think it's like a per class basis it might not happen as frequently as you think to confuse information um but let's see yeah so i yeah that's what i'd say i like it no i and i think that you're spot on i think that i think that people think that it's going to be one of those things where you confuse things more than you maybe do in a way um kelsey what's your insight on that question how might have you uh kind of kept some of that information separate yeah i'm trying to think of a time where i was in an exam and i wrote down another exam and i don't think i've had something like that i may have spent more time studying one topic over the other that i can see i definitely probably have done um but i think to that extent if for some reason you have exams on the same day let's say final exams and they're like back to back sometimes you can talk to the professor and ask them like look i have these two exams right next to each other and they're very hard like can i push one forward uh usually they're they're pretty lenient on that if you really explain um that they're tough classes and you need a break in between because three hour final exams are kill your brain slowly yeah i think i think that's spot on as well you know i think one of the things that i always recommend to students um just in general and it's a good habit to get into is just continue as you are if you're in high school um and you're working towards college or maybe you're in college and you're working kind of towards graduation you know i think the the continued focus on organization and how you structure your day and structure um you know what it is that you're doing on a regular basis you know i um always tell folks and this was the lesson that i learned after my 1.8 gpa semester that i had um but i learned that your education should be a fulltime job that is what you are in college to do right you're there um to get that degree and so from nine to five you should be working on or whatever that eight hour time slot is during the day you really should be focusing on um your academics and so that structure i think sometimes can help folks when it comes to um balancing maybe material in different classes too yeah um we have another question and it's from christina y um and the question is in many of my major classes i have noticed people are either already extremely familiar with the material or they're quick learners which makes me nervous about my career choice how much prior coding experience is needed to successfully land an internship or a job and so kelsey i don't know if you have any insight on that piece of it so i think it kind of goes along with uh don't compare yourself i know there i have many classes where people have come in knowing pretty much the whole content of the class or having the previous exams and using that as a reference so you know there's no point in comparing with them they have already have a leg up you just need to focus on understanding the material because professors design the class for you know entry people to understand it so if it says you require a specific knowledge beforehand then maybe you should but if it doesn't say any knowledge is required then i think uh going into it without any prior knowledge is totally fine as long as you you know put in the effort for it um for prior coding experience um since i didn't really have that much other than coursework i really can't comment too much on this but i definitely think that having any sort of coding language in your you know back pocket is a plus because everywhere every company wants to be efficient and they can always do that by scripting so that's what i learned in my current job that you know having some fundamentals of understanding how to write a code read someone else's code um is really important uh and you know if it says only job description no coding then maybe you should take you know a couple hours to refresh but that's that's all i can say that's great what about you christine any advice one um on that yeah i mean i think like some coding experiences needed necessary just to like be able to like have a conversation and really understand but a lot of times like i've just seen in like the real world you learn on the job like you learn and people are there like i was in my first job i remember i was like so scared like my first task like not to ask questions and my um my manager was like if you have any questions ask me and then i was like wait do you really mean that like i don't get like i thought like i was going to be punished you know because i didn't know something and he was like no we're a teen so i think like post college um you get more into like we're just it's not they're not necessarily out looking at you they're just trying to finish a task so and the more that you can communicate the more um the better you could communicate like what you know and what you don't know that's also really important because a you learn and b do whatever you're doing better um so yeah so a lot of the real world you learn on the job so yeah it's it's true um you know i think internships obviously are important to have some sort of skill set to offer for you know whatever that that internship is um but that's supposed to be a learning experience internships are designed to help you learn um about a particular industry or better about a particular field and so you're right i mean there is a lot of that that really occurs um kind of on the fly on the job um i'm gonna add in a question here um do you have any advice this was a really interesting one through our q a um do you have any advice for someone who might be getting uh bullied or picked on for being a girl in computer science and is that something that either of you have really dealt with i i don't maybe they said it behind my back but i just wasn't paying attention but uh no one has ever verbally said it to me um but you definitely get looks you know that that's you go into a room with mainly men like you're gonna get looks and uh unfortunate that you know things like this do happen but i would have to say you know they're just jealous you know you're a female you know you you're in and you're threatening almost in a way so just remember that you know and uh try to find people to support you have your back uh it may be hard in the beginning but you'll find them you'll find your crew that's true love that christine any additions to that yeah i mean you have to for us to like really like make a difference we have to be present you know so i remember one time i was i was at a tech talk and this is like the my first and only experience but it shook me um i was at a tech talk and i was standing in the back so i just come from work and i remember a guy came up to me and he was like hey do you know where i can get more napkins and he thought i was like there to assist with the program and it just shook me because i hadn't experienced that in my life and i was like okay okay well um no i was like well i'm attending it too but you can ask you know like i'm sure you can find them there um so i think just being present is like lesson enough you know so i would just like it's more yeah it's more impactful just being there than even saying anything and like let these men know that girls run the world like i just it just really bothers me i i'm not gonna go on a soapbox about my feelings about all of this but like we need to let women run the world that that's like just what needs to happen and so um hold your head up high keep moving forward like do you is what i say like do you be in that room and i and again i i you know it's definitely different but similarly being a black man being a gay man um being um you know someone young relatively young in my position like you just have to go in and know that people are going to talk and at the end of the day you're there for a reason you were hired for your job for a reason you got admitted into your school for a reason and like go and just do you like live your life um i had to say that out loud okay we have about three ish minutes left for questions so i'm gonna at least pull um at least one more um aren't there any resources or materials or tools that you would recommend for college students who are in tech that you have seen that's maybe been a lifesaver for you um maybe through your college years or after you graduated from college in terms of tools resources materials books anything like that uh for me personally i it seems strange but youtube uh if you definitely need help like a math problem and a you know physics problem or anything like that or coding problem if you go on youtube and type kind of similar you know something similar to what the problem is you'll find a stepbystep by someone usually on a whiteboard kind of going over it so you know it's free uh i mean there's some ads but you you don't get around those but uh yeah definitely youtube anyone can use it so yeah um for coding i really like udemy um i i know a lot of schools might have like can get you through a discount or something but that if you want like just like to learn something really quickly they their classes are organized really well um if you have maybe like a day like some classes can be like a python class javascript react it can be like a week of just make making an intense schedule for yourself they're really helpful they go through the basics really well so it's udemy udemy love it love resources like that and again i think continuing to check with your i'm gonna plug career centers again because they're one of my favorites a lot of resources there a lot of resources through college libraries a lot of free resources that they really have to offer for students always something to think about your professors in their office hours go to your professor's office hours go talk to your professors like yeah how often did you all do office hours with your professors would you say that was a pretty frequent occurrence or usually when you just needed something or how did that work for you so definitely oh go ahead christine go um no i remember i found out about office hours a little too late until like my end of like second semester junior year and i was like what um so i wish i learned knew sooner that my professors were just there literally as questions um so yes do office hours go ahead kelsey um yeah definitely same thing i didn't really use it during my undergrad i really regret it now because i used it a lot during my master's because i just needed that extra help and they were willing and there were tas that also were helpful so definitely don't be afraid like even if you come in and you think that you're gonna ask some silly questions and they're gonna look down on you like they won't they'll walk you through it i mean they're there to help um and definitely if at the end of the you know quarter or semester you finally decide to go see the professor and you ask for help they're gonna wonder where were you during the whole semester so definitely try to show face you know a little bit of the time uh just so at the end you can be like i've been there i need help please so just and just to clarify office hours for anyone who doesn't know who's not quite yet in college a lot of professors will hold times during the week that students can walk in um and ask questions or chat or get help on homework or on the readings so definitely take advantage of office hours we're going to ask one more question i think this is kind of a fun one to end on um and the question is if you had to pick another professional field what would it be and let's start with kelsey if you had to pick another field to be in what do you think that might might be for you um i think maybe going towards like either i have two two different like in my mind so one would be medicine because i was always fascinated with it but i just i can't grasp my head around chemistry it's just too i don't know why that one just bothered me um but then also business because i didn't realize how comfortable i am more or less kind of talking to people and i think business has a lot of that aspect as an engineer you may not get that much experience you know presenting or or talking to groups or projects so uh definitely maybe marketing kind of that sort of concept uh it's kind of interesting to me right now but uh definitely those two but it's very very different i love that though christine what about you what would you do um well probably i'd want to do something related with english and like poetry so like being a writer um yeah i find that i mean i'm interested in psychology and like reading that kind of stuff so i'd ha very different very different but total the other side but i'd probably do like poetry be a writer yeah yeah those are awesome fields i like that i would go i've always wanted to do urban planning which is so weird um but like i'm so interested in how cities um you know thinking about coding and buildings and um you know how do you how do you really structure cities in such a way to really serve um the population in a really effective way and so i've always wanted to go back to school for urban planning and never have and probably never will but uh it would be fun you never know you never know right it might happen one day yeah for sure it's so intriguing to me so uh well awesome well thank you all so much those were really really really great um insights that both of you really had um about your experiences you had some great great uh stories to share um with our um with our attendees and you're so grateful for your time um with us this evening so i'm gonna turn it over to alyssa from girls who code who has some last minute things to share hi everyone i just want to thank you for joining us this evening i'm bringing up the powerpoint on the screen one second um so if everyone doesn't mind taking out their phones um just um holding it over the qr code and mind taking our one minute survey just to let you know what we thought of the evening um yeah and if i just want to thank everyone derek christina um kelsey for joining us this evening it was wonderful hearing you talk so thank you so much thank you um you
