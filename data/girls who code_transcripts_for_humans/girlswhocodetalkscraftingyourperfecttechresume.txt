03:42 - experience
03:43 - we'll end the conversation with a q a
03:45 - segment with some of the questions that
03:47 - have been
03:47 - submitted before today's session so
03:51 - panelists our ice breaker question is
03:54 - at what age did you draft your first
03:57 - resume
03:59 - and when you drafted who helped you
04:03 - so i want to give you some time to think
04:05 - about that question
04:07 - i'm going to ask you all to answer in
04:08 - the order that you were
04:10 - but before you do viewers i want you to
04:13 - get
04:14 - ready to answer icebreaker question
04:16 - using a whole feature
04:19 - [Music]
04:20 - open in the evenings stay alert because
04:22 - you'll only have
04:24 - 30 seconds to respond the boxes up now
04:27 - so you have 30 seconds to answer the
04:29 - question that's on the screen
05:02 - so um let's have someone go ahead and
05:04 - answer the question
05:05 - so anthony can you answer that question
05:08 - um for us
05:09 - the first question about your resume oh
05:12 - wait i thought it was the order in which
05:14 - we were introduced
05:15 - yeah but it's okay i switched the game
05:18 - up i switched the game
05:19 - yeah rachel when you said that um i love
05:22 - the question
05:23 - when i it made me think so i would say
05:27 - i did get my first job without my first
05:29 - resume my first
05:31 - actual resume i believe i was probably
05:34 - 21 22 because i had
05:37 - a lot of my jobs had been networking
05:40 - talking to people
05:42 - and you know kind of getting through the
05:44 - back door and tapping that network so
05:47 - yeah i was actually in college almost
05:49 - out of college
05:50 - when i drafted my first resume and
05:52 - google helped me
05:54 - google google is your friend love it
05:56 - love to hear it
05:57 - um so so really quick so really quickly
06:00 - before we go on to the other panelists
06:02 - for the icebreaker
06:03 - we did have the results of the poll so i
06:06 - want to share the results of the poll
06:07 - 71 response
06:10 - yes the question about the resume so
06:13 - that is a good that's a good population
06:15 - of people
06:15 - so proud girls who code love to see it
06:19 - and for those who who the answer isn't
06:20 - yes we're gonna be giving you some tools
06:22 - that we believe will be helpful for you
06:24 - okay so let's just go back through the
06:26 - order rachel do you mind answering that
06:28 - icebreaker question for us
06:33 - you're on mute rachel
06:37 - sorry double mute um so my guess is my
06:39 - guess is going to be
06:41 - 17 or 18 like senior year in high school
06:45 - i think is probably the earliest i can
06:47 - remember in preparation for college and
06:49 - probably my mom helped me
06:51 - [Laughter]
06:54 - love it love it i'm seeing in the chat a
06:57 - lot of people said
06:59 - my mom too me too a lot of co-signing
07:01 - thanks mom
07:05 - love it and jasmine will you share with
07:07 - us your your response to the icebreaker
07:10 - yeah i'm on the same board with rachel
07:12 - it was probably
07:13 - around 17 18 preparing
07:17 - um for college i am a graduate of north
07:19 - carolina a t
07:20 - state university so aggie pride there um
07:23 - but yeah
07:24 - it was i i built the resume around 17
07:27 - and perfected it when i was in college
07:29 - for sure
07:30 - so no worries if you haven't created it
07:33 - just yet
07:34 - google is your friend mom is always your
07:36 - friend and um
07:37 - and college will certainly help you get
07:39 - them backing awesome
07:41 - awesome yeah i had the same response it
07:43 - was mom it was
07:44 - um in high school i was um preparing my
07:47 - freshman year for my first job
07:49 - uh working um at a beauty salon i was
07:52 - the greeter in the front of the salon
07:54 - and i had to have a resume for that
07:56 - um so i rem i remember those days as
07:58 - well so thank you so much panelists for
08:00 - the icebreaker
08:01 - um participants thank you so much for
08:04 - everything you're dropping into the chat
08:06 - i'm hearing some and seeing some really
08:08 - great things
08:09 - um and again to the poll question we are
08:12 - so
08:13 - um happy to hear that the first draft of
08:16 - your resume has
08:16 - already been complete that's a big deal
08:18 - that's the first step
08:20 - and we're excited to unpack that through
08:21 - the session
08:24 - so okay let's go ahead and prepare to go
08:27 - into
08:27 - our first question that's going to
08:29 - explore entering college
08:32 - most of the questions from viewers have
08:34 - been around formatting
08:35 - that's a a big question which sections
08:38 - are essential when applying for tech
08:40 - roles and in which orders should they be
08:42 - listed
08:44 - should candidates excuse me should
08:46 - candidates have a summary or
08:48 - objective line or not and
08:51 - designs and colored fonts for real
08:53 - dazzle
08:54 - basic template so my question i'm going
08:58 - to pose this to anthony and rachel
09:00 - is what are key components every
09:02 - technical resume should have
09:05 - and what are some guidelines that should
09:06 - be followed
09:08 - maybe we'll start with rachel this time
09:13 - oh man i love this question but i hate
09:14 - this question because
09:16 - it twofold right so one is a little bit
09:18 - of personal preference and then the
09:20 - other thing is
09:21 - every company has a different preference
09:23 - right so all three of us would give a
09:25 - completely different answer i'm sure
09:27 - right because all of our companies have
09:28 - different preferences
09:30 - um but for me a couple of things that
09:32 - you reference so definitely one page
09:35 - you're in college right keep it to one
09:37 - page you don't have that much experience
09:39 - that it should go beyond that
09:41 - um you know if you have technical skills
09:45 - some languages or some of the courses
09:47 - that you've taken is always good
09:49 - um i love especially if we're talking
09:51 - about like user experience or design
09:54 - type um work that i kind of want to see
09:56 - that creativity in your resume right so
09:59 - i'm okay with some of the colors not the
10:00 - neon green
10:01 - right but um you know i'm okay with it
10:04 - being a little more creative
10:05 - artistic um if that's the way that
10:08 - you're going in terms of the roles that
10:09 - you're looking for that's more fitting
10:11 - to the personality
10:12 - um so i think those are some of my key
10:14 - tips but some of it is you've really got
10:16 - to put your personality into the resume
10:18 - so you
10:19 - you've got to figure out what's your
10:20 - personality and how to best get your
10:22 - personality onto paper
10:23 - which isn't always the simplest thing so
10:25 - you also remember you're going to go
10:26 - through tons of iterations
10:28 - of resumes which is okay for the rest of
10:30 - your career i literally probably have
10:31 - like 832 versions of my resume since
10:34 - i created my first one at 17 or 18.
10:37 - right so
10:38 - um i would say just you know be open to
10:40 - looking at others
10:42 - googling as always you know google is
10:44 - always your best friend
10:45 - um and just iterating on it you know
10:48 - throughout your college career
10:54 - yeah i i everything that rachel said
10:57 - resonated with me what if you take
11:00 - nothing from this what i would say
11:01 - my general overarching guideline is
11:05 - your resume is a marketing tool not your
11:07 - life story
11:09 - so we've all been on youtube
11:12 - you can skip a youtube ad in five
11:13 - seconds that's
11:15 - you have to treat your resume as an
11:17 - advertisement
11:18 - and in order to do that you do things
11:20 - like rachel talked about
11:21 - highlight the key components in terms of
11:24 - technical skills whether it be
11:26 - you know javascript html css
11:30 - but also tailoring it to the jobs that
11:32 - you're looking for
11:33 - and then going along the lines of
11:36 - keeping your resume
11:37 - as this tool that's promoting and
11:39 - advertising you
11:41 - think about when you go on a website if
11:42 - you want to go girls who code website
11:44 - right now
11:46 - the screen has the most important things
11:48 - that you need to see
11:50 - right to navigate you know what girls
11:52 - who code is about
11:53 - same thing with your resume put those
11:55 - key skills
11:57 - put urls to projects that you've done
12:00 - that display your code people want to
12:02 - see examples of your work
12:04 - not that you just said that you did it
12:06 - um
12:07 - so yeah we can dive deeper into that
12:09 - more but i would say general guideline
12:10 - is treat it like a marketing tool and if
12:13 - you think about it that way
12:14 - then that'll help you go through those
12:16 - iterations that rachel spoke about
12:19 - yeah um great responses panelists and
12:21 - there was a question that came in
12:23 - in the chat that i'll just answer what
12:26 - if you have not had
12:27 - formal experience you haven't had a job
12:29 - yet how do you think about that as
12:30 - someone who's preparing to go into
12:32 - college
12:33 - and what i would say is think about the
12:34 - course the classes you've taken if there
12:36 - have been
12:36 - any projects that have really stretched
12:38 - your skills um even if you did something
12:41 - you created a project for yourself it
12:43 - wasn't through a class but you spent
12:45 - significant time
12:46 - exploring a new concept or diving into a
12:49 - concept all of that counts
12:50 - and all of that is helpful so so use
12:52 - that as well as a part of your early
12:54 - journey of exposure
12:56 - okay um so thank you thank you so much
12:58 - panelists
12:59 - um now we're going to move to
13:02 - matriculating students so students who
13:03 - are currently in college
13:06 - the description for this session we
13:08 - mentioned tips to successfully get past
13:10 - an
13:10 - applicant tracking system
13:13 - what is an ats that's the acronym for
13:16 - applicant tracking system
13:18 - topresume.com defines an ats as a type
13:21 - of software used during the hiring
13:23 - process to collect
13:25 - sort scan and rank the job applications
13:28 - they receive for open positions
13:32 - it's it's hard to weed out on or it's
13:36 - easy to weed out unqualified applicants
13:38 - so the recruiter can devote their time
13:40 - to evaluating candidates who are more
13:42 - likely to be a match for the position so
13:44 - it's a time saver
13:47 - before diving too deep into the
13:49 - conversation i want to make sure our
13:50 - viewers
13:51 - understand the function of an ats
13:54 - applicant tracking system
13:56 - so we want a poll another poll poll time
13:59 - um was that definition that i just
14:01 - shared helpful
14:03 - uh scholars on the line please respond
14:06 - accordingly was the definition of
14:09 - applicant tracking session system
14:14 - helpful
14:28 - all right let's see the results 90 said
14:31 - yes
14:32 - so awesome so now we can keep it moving
14:34 - that's good and you know what a lot of
14:36 - people don't fully know the function of
14:37 - ats so we're happy that
14:39 - everyone here has general understanding
14:42 - so now we can move forward with the
14:43 - question
14:44 - so this is going to be for rachel and
14:46 - jasmine understanding
14:48 - applicant tracking systems act as
14:50 - electronic gatekeepers for employers
14:52 - how should internship job seekers
14:56 - convey their skill set experiences and
14:58 - impact
14:59 - on their resumes to be identified as a
15:02 - qualified candidate so maybe we will
15:04 - start with jasmine for this question
15:08 - um okay hi everyone um so we
15:11 - we certainly or most companies all
15:13 - companies have some type of applicant
15:15 - tracking system
15:16 - especially when it comes to things like
15:18 - in summer internships where you have
15:21 - you know up to 2000 applicants
15:24 - bringing in the pipeline what it helps
15:27 - us to do
15:27 - is really bucketize uh the candidates
15:30 - into
15:31 - um you know who which skill set would
15:34 - match the best
15:35 - and then you know which candidate you
15:37 - know would be a stellar candidate but i
15:39 - say that
15:40 - um in a twofold type of concept
15:44 - it really requires or it should require
15:46 - the hiring manager
15:47 - recruiter to look
15:50 - hopefully at as many applicants as they
15:53 - can
15:54 - and what what we try to do at att
15:56 - certainly is to look at the most
15:58 - well-rounded candidate so i'll give you
16:00 - an example
16:01 - if you are a student um who
16:05 - is super active on campus i was very
16:08 - active when i was in school
16:09 - um you know i had a lot of fun in
16:11 - college too
16:13 - so um i wasn't um a 4.0
16:17 - student i also wasn't a 3.5 student
16:19 - either
16:20 - so i teetered between that you know 2.9
16:23 - 3.125 um and so
16:26 - but i also did like community activities
16:28 - i had you know lots of leadership
16:30 - qualities
16:31 - and so even though there should be
16:35 - and oftentimes are um quali
16:38 - disqualifiers within
16:39 - the applicant tracking system because
16:41 - you can't hire everyone
16:42 - uh what we certainly try to do is make
16:45 - sure we're looking at
16:47 - the most well-rounded candidate so when
16:50 - i'm interviewing
16:51 - you know students i'm you know they
16:53 - mentioned before about what's on your
16:54 - resume
16:55 - i want to know about your projects i
16:56 - want to know about you know the things
16:58 - that you're doing on campus and even if
17:00 - you don't have
17:02 - excuse me a lot of that work experience
17:04 - you can
17:05 - you know tell me about maybe some things
17:06 - that you're doing in your community
17:08 - that you know are super innovative or
17:10 - have some type of tech
17:12 - background if you're teaching or you
17:14 - know um
17:15 - mentoring someone younger than you or
17:18 - things at your church so
17:20 - all that to say the applicant tracking
17:22 - system is
17:23 - um the the house so to speak
17:26 - and you know we bucketize the candidates
17:29 - into different rooms
17:30 - and it helps us to um navigate to the
17:34 - best candidate
17:35 - um that has the best skill set for the
17:37 - job
17:40 - i hope that answer question yeah no no
17:43 - no that's great and i think that
17:45 - in in the chat there's been a lot of
17:47 - conversations just about
17:49 - um what if i don't have enough
17:52 - experience even when you think about
17:54 - kind of key words
17:55 - how do you even think about keywords
17:57 - from an applicant tracking system
17:59 - this wasn't technically a part of it but
18:00 - is there anybody who wants to to respond
18:02 - to the importance of keywords
18:06 - um i can talk a little bit about that
18:08 - because the one comment i really wanted
18:10 - to make and this is going to sound
18:11 - really simple
18:12 - right but this is like we see it a lot
18:15 - in terms of
18:16 - if there is a job description and it has
18:20 - either like the basic
18:21 - qualifications or minimum requirements
18:24 - like either of those phrases
18:25 - listed right one of the simplest things
18:28 - you can do to get
18:29 - past even just that first screen is make
18:32 - sure that your resume
18:33 - includes those list them put them
18:36 - somewhere
18:36 - in there right if it says requires
18:39 - java or python make sure you list java
18:42 - or python if it says
18:43 - you know 3.0 minimum gpa make sure you
18:46 - write your gpa
18:47 - like literally the basic basic
18:50 - qualifications or minimum requirements
18:52 - if it's listed in the job description
18:53 - do everything you can to get all of
18:55 - those in your resume
18:57 - right because one of the things um that
19:00 - you know
19:00 - unfortunately kind of to jasmine's point
19:02 - of having you know 2 000 plus applicants
19:05 - potentially is you know recruiters don't
19:07 - want to have to go back and hunt you
19:08 - down and say hey you didn't put this on
19:10 - here so i'm just confirming do you have
19:12 - this right
19:12 - that's gonna already put you in the
19:13 - bucket of okay maybe i'll come back to
19:15 - them if i can't find it
19:16 - with all these people who already did
19:18 - list it right so
19:19 - that's one key thing for me just off the
19:21 - bat make sure whatever's in the minimum
19:24 - section that's in there yeah and i saw a
19:27 - question
19:28 - in the chat about and we do and we get
19:30 - this a lot and
19:31 - rachel you could probably agree with
19:32 - this as well um
19:34 - what about the student that doesn't have
19:36 - a gpa yet you know and recruitment
19:38 - seasons are
19:39 - you know really heavy in the fall you
19:42 - know they
19:42 - we certainly put our you know full court
19:44 - press so to speak you know in the fall
19:46 - and then
19:47 - um we're doing more of the um
19:51 - low-hanging fruit in the spring what i
19:53 - say to that is that you can always put
19:55 - your high school gpa
19:56 - um and that you know we understand that
19:59 - you are a freshman and that you haven't
20:01 - you know really gotten a gpa just yet
20:04 - um you speak to that you know speak to
20:07 - you know maybe some things that you've
20:09 - done in high school because listen
20:11 - i think and especially in this this time
20:13 - that we're living in
20:14 - we're really trying to humanize the
20:16 - recruitment process
20:18 - we were all there uh we we've all had
20:20 - you know the experience of applying for
20:22 - jobs and looking for jobs and things and
20:24 - so
20:25 - um again to answer that particular
20:27 - question
20:28 - uh put your high school gpa um and then
20:31 - also you know put some of the courses
20:33 - the core
20:34 - courses that you could be taking uh the
20:36 - first semester of your freshman year
20:38 - maybe some projects and things that
20:39 - you're working on
20:41 - those projects are important it shows
20:43 - what you're interested in
20:45 - i saw another question that i did want
20:47 - to touch on briefly i'll be really quick
20:48 - um do we look you up on social media yes
20:54 - yes we do um so and not like a
20:57 - gotcha type of moment but you know you
21:00 - always remember
21:01 - no company wants you to affect bottom
21:03 - line
21:04 - bottom line
21:07 - yeah yeah no i'm so happy jasmine
21:10 - jasmine and anthony both talk to you
21:11 - about mark about marketing your personal
21:13 - brand
21:14 - and i've heard i've heard the girls who
21:16 - code scholars have awesome brands but we
21:18 - have to remind you preparing to go into
21:21 - into the workforce so just keep that
21:23 - keep that in mind
21:24 - um the other thing that i want to give
21:26 - everyone is homework i know giving
21:27 - homework in the summer
21:29 - is um i want you to google go to google
21:32 - and just type in think about a role that
21:35 - you're interested in a programmer role
21:37 - if you're interested in data analysis
21:40 - type of role anything in that space
21:42 - just type that term in and a company
21:45 - that you're interested in google
21:46 - microsoft att
21:47 - raytheon like everyone who's here and
21:49 - just look at a job description of an
21:51 - analyst level role um in a career that
21:54 - you're interested in
21:55 - like it might seem intimidating but just
21:57 - look at it
21:58 - read what it says look at some of the
22:00 - key words that they're highlighting
22:02 - because i think that that's something i
22:03 - wish i had done earlier that'll give you
22:05 - some insight
22:06 - um as students who are just exploring
22:08 - what's for you okay
22:10 - so let's let's keep it moving because we
22:12 - have we want to get the panelists to
22:13 - speak
22:14 - um the next category is graduating
22:17 - students
22:18 - okay so in light of covet 19 the job
22:22 - market has been
22:23 - um sent into a frenzy that's a
22:26 - any employers receive several hundred
22:28 - applications for job openings
22:31 - although the tech job market is stable
22:34 - hiring managers
22:35 - and recruiters workloads only allow them
22:38 - to spend
22:38 - a couple of seconds reading before
22:40 - deciding whether to move forward or not
22:44 - so this question is for jasmine and
22:45 - anthony we'll start with anthony
22:47 - what elements can be added to perfect a
22:50 - good resume and me
22:52 - and make it stand out and then after you
22:54 - have answered that
22:55 - what should candidates completely avoid
22:58 - putting on their resume
23:06 - i have i got two tools that can help you
23:09 - perfect a good resume
23:10 - um and also help you build up your
23:12 - resume and it builds off what you said
23:14 - chelsea about
23:15 - reading some of these job descriptions
23:17 - like if you're
23:18 - stressed if you're facing imposter
23:20 - syndrome if you're nervous we
23:21 - understand that so i would say a good
23:24 - homework assignment
23:26 - 10 job descriptions you're interested in
23:29 - and don't do anything else like don't
23:30 - pressure yourself to write a resume
23:32 - because what will happen is you start to
23:34 - just get comfortable with like oh wow
23:36 - i've seen java 15 times i've seen
23:39 - the word cross-functional team eight
23:41 - times and
23:42 - you just start to get more comfortable
23:44 - with it and then i
23:46 - start thinking about your resume because
23:47 - now you have context for how you can
23:49 - position and market yourself
23:51 - so that's one second is the tools so one
23:54 - is called
23:55 - jobscan.co and another one
23:58 - is called recruiting.net so
24:01 - jobscan which you can do is you can
24:04 - paste
24:05 - a version of your resume even if it's
24:07 - like v1 first drive
24:09 - and you can paste the job description
24:10 - and what it'll do it'll run an algorithm
24:13 - and show you the words in the job
24:15 - description that you're missing
24:19 - and that's a free tool they have a paid
24:20 - version but you get a few
24:22 - free fences and the second is
24:24 - recruiting.net
24:26 - so what you can do is say like you said
24:28 - you want to be an analyst at
24:29 - att right what you can do is you can
24:32 - look up
24:33 - uh people who work at a t that are
24:35 - already analysts
24:37 - and linkedin and see okay what are the
24:40 - words that they're using
24:42 - um uh and it's jobscan.co
24:45 - actually okay um so yeah two tools and
24:48 - then
24:48 - one thing to do is just as we said think
24:50 - about how you market and position
24:52 - yourself
24:52 - and using these tools and as chelsea
24:55 - said reading a lot of
24:56 - uh reading a lot of job postings
24:59 - especially at the companies you want to
25:01 - work with
25:02 - that'll not only give you confidence but
25:04 - also more context
25:05 - for how to position yourself
25:10 - um jasmine would you like to add yeah
25:12 - very good i mean
25:13 - um that's really great advice i would
25:15 - say um
25:16 - leadership skills if you have any type
25:19 - of leadership skills
25:21 - um programming languages you know
25:24 - look at the market you know that is
25:26 - becoming um
25:29 - the norm to have some type of
25:31 - programming
25:32 - proficiency in some area so i have that
25:36 - um and then any type of organizations
25:39 - you know community
25:40 - impact i think is really really
25:43 - important now
25:44 - companies are looking more at you know
25:47 - what what you're connected to
25:51 - what you're passionate about and because
25:53 - that ultimately
25:56 - leads to what you bring to work and so
25:58 - and then vice versa we have the
26:00 - candidates that we interact with they
26:02 - want to know
26:03 - you know what what are you doing in the
26:05 - community what how how do you feel about
26:08 - philanthropic philanthropic work um so
26:11 - that's important
26:12 - um but you know what i would say the
26:15 - don'ts
26:17 - um don't have misspelled words on your
26:18 - resume that's like no
26:21 - that's number one um and then two you
26:24 - know if it's if it's light
26:25 - you know if it's you don't have much to
26:27 - put on that that's okay you know don't
26:28 - beat yourself up
26:29 - you're gonna get there to anthony's
26:32 - point you gotta get more confident
26:34 - in creating a resume around the
26:38 - the content that that leads to the
26:40 - content
26:41 - so um i would say no misspell words
26:44 - no you know weird margins um so
26:47 - all that all that all that normal stuff
26:50 - that you would think of and then if
26:51 - you're in college i can't stress this
26:53 - enough
26:53 - um and i speak from experience because i
26:55 - didn't take advantage of it
26:57 - enough when i was in like i said i had a
26:59 - lot of fun um
27:00 - but definitely you need to be attached
27:04 - at the hip to your career services
27:06 - office they provide invaluable
27:09 - time and information you know as a
27:11 - recruiter and you know in college
27:13 - recruiting i'm talking to them
27:15 - probably three to four times a week and
27:17 - so
27:18 - they they have the pulse on the industry
27:22 - um and what i also like to tell
27:24 - candidates too
27:25 - is you know doing all of those things it
27:28 - ultimately leads to
27:29 - ensuring that your your juice is worth
27:32 - the squeeze which means you know you
27:34 - you can back up what you what you have
27:37 - on that resume
27:38 - um so yeah that's mine that's my um
27:41 - feedback
27:42 - good stuff just love this panelist team
27:45 - and the questions
27:46 - in the chat are awesome um panelists
27:49 - feel free at any point to answer some of
27:51 - these questions i'm trying to to help
27:53 - the the scholars as well
27:54 - now i did find a tool earlier in the or
27:57 - an article earlier in the week that i
27:59 - wanted to share that i think is helpful
28:01 - and the article i'm just going to
28:03 - highlight a few things talked about
28:04 - the hard skills um or the technical
28:07 - skills that necessary
28:09 - particular roles and so i just wanted 30
28:12 - seconds share them with you
28:13 - for those of you who are interested in
28:15 - web development proficiency
28:17 - in html css and javascript
28:20 - are typically a must for those who are
28:23 - interested in cyber security
28:25 - knowledge of programming and scripting
28:27 - languages is desired by employers
28:30 - along with a track record of analyzing
28:32 - maybe malware or data sets so anytime
28:34 - you're working with data or excel that
28:36 - can be helpful
28:37 - if you're interested in data science
28:39 - candidates should prop their
28:40 - expertise into modeling so some modeling
28:43 - analysis which also typically will
28:45 - require excel
28:47 - machine learning you'll want some
28:49 - proficiency in python
28:50 - or experience with gpu which is a
28:53 - computer and data mining system
28:55 - and the final one is programmers you
28:57 - should be strong in sas
28:58 - and language is like sql okay and so
29:01 - we've we've talked about that before
29:03 - let's get into some of the other
29:04 - questions because we've got um
29:07 - what do we have about 30 minutes
29:08 - together a little bit less than that
29:10 - um so our first question is around
29:12 - linkedin
29:14 - and we've been seeing in the chat a lot
29:16 - of questions about linkedin
29:18 - so linkedin seems to be the new resume
29:20 - for recruiters and employers
29:22 - should i list the same information on my
29:25 - resume as i do on my linkedin page
29:28 - who wants to tackle that one i'll start
29:34 - i'll start um i love this area because i
29:37 - loop
29:38 - you know um linkedin and instagram and
29:41 - all that you know i i loop it in
29:42 - together
29:43 - and i laugh i was joking you know
29:45 - earlier not really
29:46 - um that we do look at your social
29:49 - because we do
29:50 - and not necessarily as a gotcha moment
29:52 - but
29:53 - also like in a positive way you know if
29:55 - you're doing really cool things on
29:57 - instagram like on campus or in your
29:59 - community or what have you like i want
30:00 - to see
30:01 - i think that's awesome and we also use
30:04 - those type of platforms to recruit you
30:06 - know lots of companies
30:09 - when you're scrolling through instagram
30:10 - or scrolling through linkedin you see
30:12 - these
30:12 - uh targeted ads that you might even
30:15 - [Music]
30:19 - you know for your interviews
30:21 - announcement popped up
30:22 - you know on your um instagram feed all
30:25 - of those things
30:27 - are um are you know essential
30:30 - in marketing um yourself and so
30:34 - uh i certainly use linkedin a lot i post
30:37 - on linkedin i look at articles on
30:38 - linkedin
30:39 - companies now are pushing more
30:41 - information through linkedin
30:43 - we can connect with candidates via chat
30:47 - the you know different postings so it's
30:49 - a really cool tool
30:51 - um to engage with potential hires
30:55 - um and also to get some of the questions
30:57 - that you have answered
30:58 - and to anthony's point earlier about
31:01 - looking at
31:02 - you know goals that other people have
31:03 - that you may interested in that's
31:05 - a great way to do that you can see their
31:07 - linkedin profile you can see what they
31:09 - like
31:09 - you can see who they're connected to you
31:11 - know your people connect with my people
31:13 - type of thing
31:14 - and so um i
31:17 - you know believe that it is your digital
31:19 - resume it gives
31:21 - um a good idea of what your vibe is like
31:24 - you know what you're interested in
31:26 - type of thing so i've i've seen a lot of
31:28 - questions around
31:30 - you know how old do you have to be to
31:31 - have a linkedin you know what you need
31:33 - to do
31:34 - just create one if you don't have a
31:37 - a professional profile picture my
31:40 - background right now
31:41 - in my apartment is why you can put on a
31:43 - nice you know
31:44 - outfit and do just a complete little
31:46 - headshot and put that up there
31:48 - definitely doesn't need to be any
31:49 - selfies or anything like that
31:51 - but um but i i really do feel like
31:55 - um linkedin has been super beneficial
31:58 - to lots of companies and at t being
32:01 - them fantastic is there anyone else who
32:04 - wants to add in on linkedin
32:05 - it's a very important topic
32:11 - oh anthony yeah please hop in yeah i
32:13 - would say
32:14 - to jasmine's point just like other
32:16 - platforms right you have
32:18 - instagram i'm sure there's people you
32:21 - follow on instagram there's communities
32:22 - whether
32:23 - it's about fashion whether it's
32:26 - different
32:28 - things that you're into whether it's
32:30 - different brands that you follow
32:31 - right and linkedin is that powerful but
32:35 - for
32:35 - jobs right so even just even if
32:39 - you created like a bare minimum linkedin
32:42 - and all you did was just
32:43 - like post and follow people and
32:46 - companies
32:47 - again you just that also starts to build
32:49 - your confidence you're like oh like i
32:51 - understand this linkedin thing
32:52 - so also don't feel as though it's you
32:55 - have to figure out everything at once
32:56 - it's like oh i gotta have my great
32:58 - resume
32:58 - and my linkedin and my experience no
33:01 - like
33:02 - first starts to understand these tools
33:04 - and how powerful they are
33:05 - and then start to build upon that and
33:07 - including you know everything else that
33:09 - jasmine said
33:12 - awesome awesome all right let's go to
33:14 - the next question
33:16 - um so someone said i do not have
33:18 - particularly strong transcripts
33:20 - and also lack formal work experiences
33:23 - came up earlier
33:24 - how can i craft a compelling resume and
33:27 - still present
33:28 - myself as a strong candidate so if we
33:29 - can give for this question if we can
33:31 - think about any specific examples you
33:33 - all can think about like that you've had
33:34 - on the job where a student has really
33:37 - showed you strong skills regardless of
33:39 - grades or
33:40 - or anything that would be helpful so
33:43 - whoever would like to take it rachel do
33:45 - you have a thought
33:46 - yes i'll start on that one um so i think
33:49 - and i think we've
33:50 - touched on this several times tonight
33:52 - but um
33:54 - i think this is where you can really um
33:56 - highlight your leadership skills
33:58 - your volunteer activities your campus
34:02 - you know organizations projects that
34:05 - you've done in class right it doesn't
34:07 - always have to be
34:08 - formal work experience right um anything
34:11 - that highlights your interest and your
34:14 - skill sets
34:15 - um is great right you can link to like
34:17 - your github page if you have projects on
34:20 - there you can put that on your resume
34:22 - there are different ways
34:23 - to still you know project yourself in a
34:26 - good light outside of just your gpa
34:28 - right i think jasmine mentioned it
34:29 - before we we're looking for well-rounded
34:31 - right and that's not always in a number
34:33 - right
34:34 - and people have different circumstances
34:35 - on why that their gpa
34:37 - is the way that it is so we want to see
34:39 - kind of that broad horizon of different
34:41 - experiences that you're
34:43 - participating in um and i think one
34:46 - thing
34:47 - that's um important is the skill sets
34:49 - area right a lot of people sometimes
34:51 - have skills listed there right
34:53 - so you can add on different skills and
34:55 - then also putting something maybe unique
34:57 - now this is something this is a very
34:59 - particular
35:01 - story that i had super random um but i
35:03 - was interviewing a candidate
35:04 - right and she you know had had
35:08 - tons of leadership and community
35:11 - um you know she did fairly well in
35:12 - school and then in her interest
35:14 - area right um she was you know
35:16 - volunteering did it
35:17 - and then it said uh mallard duck caller
35:21 - if anybody so a mallard it's literally
35:23 - it's like the
35:24 - the green it's like a green and black
35:26 - duck so
35:27 - she literally one of her skills was
35:29 - mallard caller
35:30 - right and i literally followed up with
35:33 - her because
35:34 - that made her stand out in the pool of
35:36 - this is a super
35:37 - random skill slash interest
35:41 - and i was like i kind of want to know
35:42 - more right so sometimes also putting
35:45 - something very unique or specific to you
35:47 - that again
35:47 - shows your personality like anthony
35:49 - anthony was talking about marketing
35:51 - yourself right
35:52 - it's not always about marketing yes i
35:54 - know c plus and i know java but also i'm
35:57 - a mallard duck caller
35:58 - really what does that mean what do you
36:00 - do right
36:01 - that is also very intriguing to
36:03 - recruiters so adding a little bit of
36:05 - your personality
36:06 - will go a long way as well
36:09 - awesome awesome awesome um any other
36:12 - thoughts on that question
36:15 - yeah i would just say um i feel like
36:17 - people are going to start
36:18 - learning i know i'm like
36:21 - i'm reading the comments thanks for
36:24 - talking to the dogs from their bosses um
36:28 - so but from the gpa standpoint i'll give
36:31 - you a very
36:31 - real you know example you know i had a
36:34 - candidate
36:35 - that had a 2-5 gpa
36:38 - and um they worked through school
36:42 - they were a part of um or
36:45 - president of some particular
36:46 - organization
36:48 - and they were uh they didn't live on
36:51 - campus so
36:52 - all of these different things and but
36:55 - they had you know project experience or
36:58 - they had
36:59 - um community experience and they you
37:01 - know did other things now
37:03 - the qualifier for our program was a 3-0
37:05 - but there was another area you know for
37:08 - this candidate to funnel in so all was
37:10 - not
37:10 - lost and and i really encourage students
37:14 - to
37:14 - not get hung hung up so much
37:18 - on the gp i mean do well in school but i
37:21 - you know everybody's not a you know 4.0
37:24 - student everyone's not a 3-5 student
37:26 - some people are not a 3.0 student but
37:28 - you have
37:29 - those you know really strong
37:30 - interpersonal skills you have
37:32 - strong technical skills you know you may
37:35 - learn a different
37:36 - way or absorb information a different
37:38 - way it's about
37:39 - telling that right story to anthony and
37:42 - rachel's point marketing yourself
37:44 - in the right way and doing those things
37:46 - to make you
37:47 - you know even more competitive so but
37:50 - you can like have a super low gpa
37:53 - and you don't do that in school and you
37:54 - don't you know that's not gonna work
37:55 - either so
37:56 - um but you know you have to be
38:00 - well-rounded in all areas absolutely
38:03 - go ahead 20 seconds my two cents is that
38:06 - another example i don't know the young
38:08 - woman personally
38:09 - but a few years ago i saw a woman um
38:12 - young black woman who at an internship
38:15 - at spotify
38:16 - now again i don't know how her grades
38:18 - were but again back to this theme of
38:21 - marketing how do you position yourself
38:23 - right your story as jasmine spoke about
38:25 - maybe this young um candidate's resume
38:29 - or
38:29 - gpa wasn't high but the story in terms
38:31 - of what they did and
38:32 - a few years ago and i can share this
38:34 - article but this woman she applied to
38:37 - spotify
38:38 - with a playlist so she actually added
38:41 - spotify on twitter
38:43 - and said hey here's a playlist that
38:45 - represents my love
38:46 - for other black artists and why i would
38:49 - be a good fit
38:50 - for your internship so it's not always
38:53 - about
38:53 - let me get the right keywords for my
38:55 - resume and let me get the
38:57 - ets it's like how are you going to stand
39:00 - out and touch
39:01 - somebody like rachel or jasmine so so
39:03 - when they get on a panel they're
39:04 - actually
39:05 - mentioning you because you were so
39:07 - memorable right
39:09 - yeah anthony that's powerful because i
39:11 - think sometimes to the point of rachel
39:13 - brock
39:13 - sometimes the things we think are are
39:15 - least important are the things that
39:16 - catch people's eyes so
39:17 - if you're trying to craft a perfect
39:20 - resume
39:20 - it may not be so perfect so just just do
39:24 - be authentic and let your personality
39:26 - come through that's really powerful
39:28 - rachel um shared in the chat rachel
39:30 - you've been adding some really powerful
39:31 - stuff but rachel said hackathons
39:33 - are really great opportunities right um
39:36 - and i was also thinking about
39:37 - um if if students go to like grace
39:39 - hopper or any major conferences that are
39:41 - giving them exposure
39:43 - they should be adding them to their
39:45 - resume yes
39:46 - so i guess my point here is um other
39:49 - than things like hackathon and
39:50 - conferences is there any other like
39:52 - really
39:53 - interesting things that you love to see
39:55 - on on resumes
39:57 - student works um you know definitely
40:01 - i was you know i i was in sga
40:04 - i you know in a sorority all that stuff
40:07 - i mean it's great to be involved
40:09 - right like it's great to be a a member
40:11 - but i would love to see how you lead
40:13 - you know how you partner um you know
40:16 - what you again what you do in the
40:17 - community
40:18 - um and then you know also you know
40:20 - things that interest you like just in
40:22 - general
40:22 - i mean if you are a you know electrical
40:26 - engineering major
40:27 - or maybe a marketing major but you like
40:30 - gaming on the side
40:32 - you know that's also those transferable
40:34 - skills i i love to see that
40:36 - because you know i was a marketing major
40:38 - but i started in network engineering
40:40 - and so to be able to pivot you know in
40:43 - certain areas
40:44 - to you know anthony's point about being
40:47 - bold and marketing yourself in the right
40:49 - way
40:50 - you know to rachel's point about the
40:51 - hackathons all those things are really
40:53 - really cool and you have to you know
40:55 - don't saturate
40:57 - your resume with all that stuff don't
40:58 - put everything but put the most
41:00 - impactful the most authentic the most
41:03 - intentional
41:04 - um things on your resume yep and in 10
41:08 - seconds can someone tell us what a
41:09 - hackathon is
41:11 - 10 seconds is short but it's like does
41:12 - someone have an ability to tell us what
41:14 - is a hackathon it was asked in the chat
41:17 - do we are we able to give
41:21 - so so my 10 hackathon is
41:24 - it's a competition where you're
41:26 - generally put on teams and you have
41:28 - some type of coding challenge to achieve
41:32 - in a specific time frame that's kind of
41:35 - a
41:35 - quickest exact explanation that's
41:37 - exactly it that's exactly it
41:39 - perfect rachel perfect and all of the
41:41 - into saying wow
41:42 - thank you so good so really quickly we
41:45 - do have one
41:46 - one more question on networking that i i
41:48 - can't wait for to ask the group
41:50 - but there was a question that i saw that
41:51 - came in that was on um
41:53 - like if you should be listing courses
41:55 - like relevant courses
41:57 - um how do you feel like what kind of of
42:01 - student
42:01 - or graduate should be listing under
42:04 - their degree um the courses that they
42:07 - they took is that a waste of space or is
42:09 - it helpful
42:12 - i would say no more than four i you know
42:15 - and they have to be very
42:16 - specific to the role so if you are
42:19 - you know um looking at a technical
42:22 - like a data analyst and you've yes
42:27 - um in advance statistics
42:30 - and some type of you know mathematical
42:33 - course
42:33 - though that's important um but if you're
42:36 - listing out
42:37 - you know your course catalog that's not
42:39 - gonna work so don't do that
42:44 - and i would i would just add to that
42:45 - that i really look at
42:47 - the course list thing as a filler a lot
42:49 - of times so
42:51 - in replacement of if you don't have
42:53 - experiences
42:54 - you know that can help sometimes fill up
42:57 - space so if you're a freshman
42:59 - um you know your first year and you want
43:01 - to focus on some of the core courses or
43:03 - your first year in your major and you
43:04 - don't have
43:05 - internship or specific experience or
43:06 - project experience yet
43:08 - then sometimes those key core courses um
43:10 - are helpful to
43:12 - to list out there as well yeah
43:15 - the only other thing that i would add is
43:17 - um if you're not
43:18 - if you're a non-technical major um for
43:20 - any reason and you're interested in the
43:22 - tech space and so if you're doing a
43:24 - social
43:24 - science if you're doing a humanities
43:27 - major
43:28 - for instance but you're interested in
43:30 - going into tech you'll want to show
43:32 - the recruiter that you've taken classes
43:34 - that are related to the job
43:36 - so so great thank you thank you team for
43:38 - answering that
43:39 - um final question
43:42 - um so someone said i'm currently
43:44 - completing my last
43:46 - internship and will be graduating in the
43:48 - fall
43:49 - although i haven't completed the
43:50 - internship is it okay
43:54 - okay um is it okay to um connect with
43:57 - other recruiters
43:58 - so if you are in an internship you're
44:01 - not finished with your internship yet
44:03 - but you're thinking about other
44:05 - opportunities can you reach out if so
44:06 - how do you reach out effectively
44:09 - i'm sorry chelsea so you you looked away
44:12 - and then that
44:13 - second that you looked away we had an a
44:16 - special guest
44:17 - run in the background rachel sorry my
44:20 - two-year-old son made a break away
44:21 - my husband had to come and get him thank
44:24 - you for all the great comments
44:26 - everywhere
44:27 - this is a real live i love
44:29 - [Laughter]
44:35 - you it he wants to get in too
44:39 - that was really cute so that's all the
44:40 - um that was all the chat
44:42 - uh okay so question one more time say it
44:44 - one more time okay
44:45 - okay that was great because i'm like
44:47 - what's going on i'm missing it but the
44:49 - question is
44:50 - someone's in an internship and um
44:53 - they are not done with their internship
44:54 - but they're wanting to connect with
44:56 - another employer
44:57 - um how do you do that in an effective
44:59 - way like what does it look like for you
45:02 - to
45:02 - make the update and basically it's a
45:04 - network i think it's a networking and
45:05 - exposure conversation to other
45:07 - opportunities like how do you think that
45:08 - through
45:11 - i'll i'll start um i think it's always
45:14 - great to network and expand your network
45:16 - cast the net broadly um as long as
45:18 - you're not losing focus on what you're
45:19 - currently doing
45:20 - so as long as it's like a
45:24 - stepping stone so let's say if you
45:26 - intern somewhere
45:27 - and you are meeting all the requirements
45:30 - and you're doing everything you're
45:31 - supposed to do but you just
45:33 - really don't feel like you're going to
45:35 - be connected
45:36 - um ultimately with that company just
45:38 - based on how you feel and that happens i
45:40 - mean
45:41 - um so making connection to another
45:43 - company where you have some interest
45:45 - that's okay um it's just you're building
45:48 - that experience
45:49 - now don't do it in a way where you're
45:52 - you know like
45:53 - ghosting the other company that's why
45:55 - don't do that
45:56 - but but always be professional and just
46:00 - say hey i want to expand my network
46:02 - i want to have an informational
46:04 - interview
46:05 - um i love that because if you're not
46:07 - making anyone commit to anything
46:09 - yet you are kind of interviewing for
46:12 - something that you
46:13 - have an interest in so nothing nothing
46:15 - wrong with that just do it in a very
46:17 - professional manner
46:21 - yeah yeah and i definitely think as you
46:23 - get so if we're talking about summer
46:24 - internships for example as you get to
46:26 - the
46:26 - end of the summer you should be actively
46:28 - updating your resume one of the great
46:30 - things about updating your resume is
46:31 - doing it when the information is
46:33 - fresh right so honestly the end of your
46:36 - summer internship is the perfect time to
46:38 - update your resume
46:39 - because what you've done is fresh in
46:41 - your mind so it's okay to go ahead and
46:43 - update that
46:44 - and start applying um as jasmine
46:46 - mentioned you know
46:47 - be open with the current coming your
46:48 - intern interning with to see if there
46:50 - are current opportunities
46:52 - um you know and let them know that
46:53 - you're you're you know looking for
46:55 - future opportunities as well elsewhere
46:57 - and within the company
46:59 - yes yes and so perfect the perfect
47:02 - responses
47:03 - a few things that i wanted to highlight
47:05 - since we're talking the first one was
47:07 - there was a question from someone
47:09 - that said you say we should be specific
47:12 - to the role in which we're applying
47:14 - but also to diversify ourselves and show
47:17 - our
47:17 - interest this is a contradiction how can
47:19 - we manage the two
47:20 - so can someone just share or i'm happy
47:23 - to
47:24 - in a few seconds how do you balance
47:26 - being specific in your resume
47:28 - with those keywords and showing your
47:29 - competence but also showing your
47:31 - personality because that's really what
47:32 - the person's trying to get at
47:35 - what do you think
47:38 - i think personality can come through in
47:41 - a couple of different ways so it can
47:42 - come through
47:43 - in resume format or design right
47:46 - it can also come through in your skills
47:49 - or
47:50 - leadership activity section
47:54 - but being specific about the role in
47:56 - your skill sets should come through
47:58 - in you know coursework in
48:01 - technical skills in projects in
48:04 - work experience but there's always a
48:06 - section on leadership
48:07 - and community involvement and that's
48:09 - where you can highlight some more of
48:11 - your personality
48:13 - yep um there was a question also that i
48:16 - see
48:16 - ashley posed how many sections should
48:19 - you have on your resume
48:20 - how many bullets
48:25 - we all have four different answers
48:28 - i just would say make them even you know
48:31 - like
48:32 - you know don't let it be an odd number
48:33 - of bullets that's just me you know i
48:36 - i would say you know your education your
48:38 - experience your
48:39 - you know interest three and then
48:42 - the bullets under each would should be
48:44 - even um
48:46 - you don't want to put the entire job
48:48 - description
48:50 - under the specific job you're just
48:52 - highlighting the major points
48:54 - of the job or of the work or of the
48:57 - project
48:58 - you know um that's
49:01 - yeah that's what i would say and i would
49:03 - also say i i like the question
49:05 - but i think a better question is how are
49:08 - you
49:09 - resonating with the audience or the job
49:11 - that you're trying to get
49:13 - right um versus the number of
49:17 - bullets and the margin and right it's
49:19 - it's really
49:20 - okay if i want to work at a t and i want
49:22 - to be an analyst
49:24 - okay okay what do those profiles look
49:26 - like who do the people who work there
49:28 - look like
49:29 - what do other job descriptions right and
49:31 - getting context
49:32 - um and then general rule of thumb like
49:35 - keep it to our page
49:36 - right if jasmine is reviewing you know
49:39 - hundreds of resumes or working with
49:41 - our hiring managers right we have a few
49:43 - minutes to look at
49:44 - each resume if that right i think
49:46 - industry average is like
49:48 - six to ten seconds right so just like a
49:51 - youtube ad
49:52 - you can get you know next and but in
49:55 - order to
49:56 - stay top of mind and and and show your
49:59 - worth
49:59 - as as rachel mentioned it's being in
50:01 - alignment with have
50:03 - exactly the skill sets that you need and
50:05 - if you look at my linkedin for example
50:07 - 80 of my summary is like what i do
50:11 - and then there's like two sentences that
50:12 - say i love 90s hip hop i love nature
50:15 - and i love food that's it like that's
50:18 - true
50:19 - i don't have to make that up it's not
50:21 - right but majority of it when somebody
50:23 - comes to my page is like oh
50:24 - okay this person is a talent expert or a
50:27 - recruiting leader
50:30 - yep yep and there was a question that
50:32 - came in
50:33 - um i'm gonna attempt to try to ask it
50:35 - about girls who code
50:37 - like should you be putting that on your
50:38 - resume where do you put it absolutely
50:40 - you put it
50:41 - what do you mean girls who codes a
50:43 - global amazing network of the future
50:46 - leaders well the leaders of this world
50:48 - right
50:49 - [Laughter]
50:52 - better put girls who code but also on
50:54 - linkedin you can put it as well you can
50:55 - put it um
50:56 - there's the at the linkedin has a um
50:59 - organizational affiliation category
51:02 - that's at the bottom it's not towards
51:04 - the top but you can put organizations
51:06 - that you belong to of course girls who
51:07 - code
51:08 - has a company page on linkedin so you
51:10 - can add it and then add alumni
51:12 - okay so so please add that on um so
51:15 - panelists we are getting towards the end
51:17 - and i want you all
51:18 - um first of all thank you what a
51:20 - brilliant dynamic group of leaders thank
51:22 - you so much
51:23 - can you give like a word of wisdom to
51:26 - close us out
51:27 - um we'll start um from jasmine and work
51:29 - our way to anthony can you just share
51:31 - one um powerful take away for today for
51:35 - our scholars
51:37 - um yeah so nobody knows you better than
51:41 - you
51:42 - right nobody can tell your story better
51:44 - than you can
51:45 - and so um the ability to
51:49 - um weave your authenticity
51:54 - and your impact
51:57 - and your knowledge is just a powerful
52:01 - story to tell
52:02 - and you know the time the future is
52:05 - female
52:07 - no shade
52:14 - all good
52:18 - [Music]
52:20 - i would say if i just if i had to like
52:25 - give advice that i wanted to hear years
52:27 - ago and that i'm still
52:29 - implementing is two things one is
52:32 - uh you can jay shetty uh he's a kind of
52:36 - like a spiritual teacher
52:37 - i followed and read some of his books
52:39 - and he had a quote and he said
52:40 - um you can only take the world as far as
52:42 - you've traveled internally
52:45 - which lauryn hill also said you know how
52:47 - you're going to win if you ain't right
52:48 - with it so it's like
52:50 - also all of what we don't don't expect
52:53 - to
52:53 - take everything we said today and just
52:55 - go apply it and it just work tomorrow
52:58 - right like this is a journey be kind to
53:00 - yourself
53:01 - um and then the the other thing i would
53:03 - say is be of service
53:04 - um the reason that i'm on this panel the
53:06 - reason i've gotten so many opportunities
53:08 - is because i've gone out of my way to
53:10 - help others
53:12 - so yes i know it's a global pandemic you
53:14 - know you're looking for internships
53:16 - or you're changing jobs or maybe even
53:18 - lost a job but always be thinking about
53:21 - how you can add value to someone else
53:23 - and i promise you
53:25 - like later down in your career like
53:27 - those things start to come back
53:29 - tenfold when you least expect them um
53:32 - yeah be of service and uh go within
53:40 - rachel uh oh you're on beauty yes
53:42 - oh i got it
53:44 - so and there's my son again which is
53:46 - also the
53:47 - be yourself which sometimes is with a
53:50 - kid
53:50 - um so sorry
53:54 - no you're fine um okay so my
53:58 - my really would be be yourself right is
54:00 - honestly number one be who you are
54:02 - right um and that's kind of an ode to
54:04 - everything that jasmine was saying be
54:06 - yourself but
54:06 - i think the bigger thing sometimes is
54:08 - don't overthink
54:10 - it um i know you guys are probably
54:12 - literally like trying to take notes and
54:13 - everything we're saying they're like
54:14 - okay
54:15 - you need this in this section this and
54:16 - this okay only one page like
54:18 - but don't don't overthink it and i think
54:20 - anthony mentioned at one point
54:22 - like you have time to learn all these
54:24 - things like to focus on one thing at a
54:26 - time
54:26 - um this these skills they come with time
54:30 - like i said you're going to iterate
54:31 - a million times on your resume so don't
54:34 - put so much pressure on yourself
54:36 - right um that it's stressing yourself
54:39 - out or
54:40 - you're feeling like you're not
54:41 - succeeding right i would say give
54:43 - yourself grace
54:44 - if anything um it's something that you
54:47 - have to continuously tell yourself
54:48 - throughout your career
54:49 - you know you'll continuously tell
54:50 - yourself is give yourself grace that's
54:52 - looking at that man so give yourself
54:54 - grace
54:54 - be yourself don't overthink it
54:58 - yes turning into churches and closing it
55:00 - down
55:02 - exactly it's so funny because rachel
55:06 - took every ever took the what i was
55:08 - going to say give yourself grace
55:09 - so we're all we're all this this
55:12 - panelist team is is connected and
55:14 - um we're preparing to close out with our
55:16 - five minutes that's left
55:18 - um everybody who came today made time in
55:21 - the summer

off tonight with an icebreaker followed by a question that will address the concerns of girls who code college alumni and students across the country who are either beginning matriculating or ending their college experience we'll end the conversation with a q a segment with some of the questions that have been submitted before today's session so panelists our ice breaker question is at what age did you draft your first resume and when you drafted who helped you so i want to give you some time to think about that question i'm going to ask you all to answer in the order that you were but before you do viewers i want you to get ready to answer icebreaker question using a whole feature open in the evenings stay alert because you'll only have 30 seconds to respond the boxes up now so you have 30 seconds to answer the question that's on the screen so um let's have someone go ahead and answer the question so anthony can you answer that question um for us the first question about your resume oh wait i thought it was the order in which we were introduced yeah but it's okay i switched the game up i switched the game yeah rachel when you said that um i love the question when i it made me think so i would say i did get my first job without my first resume my first actual resume i believe i was probably 21 22 because i had a lot of my jobs had been networking talking to people and you know kind of getting through the back door and tapping that network so yeah i was actually in college almost out of college when i drafted my first resume and google helped me google google is your friend love it love to hear it um so so really quick so really quickly before we go on to the other panelists for the icebreaker we did have the results of the poll so i want to share the results of the poll 71 response yes the question about the resume so that is a good that's a good population of people so proud girls who code love to see it and for those who who the answer isn't yes we're gonna be giving you some tools that we believe will be helpful for you okay so let's just go back through the order rachel do you mind answering that icebreaker question for us you're on mute rachel sorry double mute um so my guess is my guess is going to be 17 or 18 like senior year in high school i think is probably the earliest i can remember in preparation for college and probably my mom helped me [Laughter] love it love it i'm seeing in the chat a lot of people said my mom too me too a lot of cosigning thanks mom love it and jasmine will you share with us your your response to the icebreaker yeah i'm on the same board with rachel it was probably around 17 18 preparing um for college i am a graduate of north carolina a t state university so aggie pride there um but yeah it was i i built the resume around 17 and perfected it when i was in college for sure so no worries if you haven't created it just yet google is your friend mom is always your friend and um and college will certainly help you get them backing awesome awesome yeah i had the same response it was mom it was um in high school i was um preparing my freshman year for my first job uh working um at a beauty salon i was the greeter in the front of the salon and i had to have a resume for that um so i rem i remember those days as well so thank you so much panelists for the icebreaker um participants thank you so much for everything you're dropping into the chat i'm hearing some and seeing some really great things um and again to the poll question we are so um happy to hear that the first draft of your resume has already been complete that's a big deal that's the first step and we're excited to unpack that through the session so okay let's go ahead and prepare to go into our first question that's going to explore entering college most of the questions from viewers have been around formatting that's a a big question which sections are essential when applying for tech roles and in which orders should they be listed should candidates excuse me should candidates have a summary or objective line or not and designs and colored fonts for real dazzle basic template so my question i'm going to pose this to anthony and rachel is what are key components every technical resume should have and what are some guidelines that should be followed maybe we'll start with rachel this time oh man i love this question but i hate this question because it twofold right so one is a little bit of personal preference and then the other thing is every company has a different preference right so all three of us would give a completely different answer i'm sure right because all of our companies have different preferences um but for me a couple of things that you reference so definitely one page you're in college right keep it to one page you don't have that much experience that it should go beyond that um you know if you have technical skills some languages or some of the courses that you've taken is always good um i love especially if we're talking about like user experience or design type um work that i kind of want to see that creativity in your resume right so i'm okay with some of the colors not the neon green right but um you know i'm okay with it being a little more creative artistic um if that's the way that you're going in terms of the roles that you're looking for that's more fitting to the personality um so i think those are some of my key tips but some of it is you've really got to put your personality into the resume so you you've got to figure out what's your personality and how to best get your personality onto paper which isn't always the simplest thing so you also remember you're going to go through tons of iterations of resumes which is okay for the rest of your career i literally probably have like 832 versions of my resume since i created my first one at 17 or 18. right so um i would say just you know be open to looking at others googling as always you know google is always your best friend um and just iterating on it you know throughout your college career yeah i i everything that rachel said resonated with me what if you take nothing from this what i would say my general overarching guideline is your resume is a marketing tool not your life story so we've all been on youtube you can skip a youtube ad in five seconds that's you have to treat your resume as an advertisement and in order to do that you do things like rachel talked about highlight the key components in terms of technical skills whether it be you know javascript html css but also tailoring it to the jobs that you're looking for and then going along the lines of keeping your resume as this tool that's promoting and advertising you think about when you go on a website if you want to go girls who code website right now the screen has the most important things that you need to see right to navigate you know what girls who code is about same thing with your resume put those key skills put urls to projects that you've done that display your code people want to see examples of your work not that you just said that you did it um so yeah we can dive deeper into that more but i would say general guideline is treat it like a marketing tool and if you think about it that way then that'll help you go through those iterations that rachel spoke about yeah um great responses panelists and there was a question that came in in the chat that i'll just answer what if you have not had formal experience you haven't had a job yet how do you think about that as someone who's preparing to go into college and what i would say is think about the course the classes you've taken if there have been any projects that have really stretched your skills um even if you did something you created a project for yourself it wasn't through a class but you spent significant time exploring a new concept or diving into a concept all of that counts and all of that is helpful so so use that as well as a part of your early journey of exposure okay um so thank you thank you so much panelists um now we're going to move to matriculating students so students who are currently in college the description for this session we mentioned tips to successfully get past an applicant tracking system what is an ats that's the acronym for applicant tracking system topresume.com defines an ats as a type of software used during the hiring process to collect sort scan and rank the job applications they receive for open positions it's it's hard to weed out on or it's easy to weed out unqualified applicants so the recruiter can devote their time to evaluating candidates who are more likely to be a match for the position so it's a time saver before diving too deep into the conversation i want to make sure our viewers understand the function of an ats applicant tracking system so we want a poll another poll poll time um was that definition that i just shared helpful uh scholars on the line please respond accordingly was the definition of applicant tracking session system helpful all right let's see the results 90 said yes so awesome so now we can keep it moving that's good and you know what a lot of people don't fully know the function of ats so we're happy that everyone here has general understanding so now we can move forward with the question so this is going to be for rachel and jasmine understanding applicant tracking systems act as electronic gatekeepers for employers how should internship job seekers convey their skill set experiences and impact on their resumes to be identified as a qualified candidate so maybe we will start with jasmine for this question um okay hi everyone um so we we certainly or most companies all companies have some type of applicant tracking system especially when it comes to things like in summer internships where you have you know up to 2000 applicants bringing in the pipeline what it helps us to do is really bucketize uh the candidates into um you know who which skill set would match the best and then you know which candidate you know would be a stellar candidate but i say that um in a twofold type of concept it really requires or it should require the hiring manager recruiter to look hopefully at as many applicants as they can and what what we try to do at att certainly is to look at the most wellrounded candidate so i'll give you an example if you are a student um who is super active on campus i was very active when i was in school um you know i had a lot of fun in college too so um i wasn't um a 4.0 student i also wasn't a 3.5 student either so i teetered between that you know 2.9 3.125 um and so but i also did like community activities i had you know lots of leadership qualities and so even though there should be and oftentimes are um quali disqualifiers within the applicant tracking system because you can't hire everyone uh what we certainly try to do is make sure we're looking at the most wellrounded candidate so when i'm interviewing you know students i'm you know they mentioned before about what's on your resume i want to know about your projects i want to know about you know the things that you're doing on campus and even if you don't have excuse me a lot of that work experience you can you know tell me about maybe some things that you're doing in your community that you know are super innovative or have some type of tech background if you're teaching or you know um mentoring someone younger than you or things at your church so all that to say the applicant tracking system is um the the house so to speak and you know we bucketize the candidates into different rooms and it helps us to um navigate to the best candidate um that has the best skill set for the job i hope that answer question yeah no no no that's great and i think that in in the chat there's been a lot of conversations just about um what if i don't have enough experience even when you think about kind of key words how do you even think about keywords from an applicant tracking system this wasn't technically a part of it but is there anybody who wants to to respond to the importance of keywords um i can talk a little bit about that because the one comment i really wanted to make and this is going to sound really simple right but this is like we see it a lot in terms of if there is a job description and it has either like the basic qualifications or minimum requirements like either of those phrases listed right one of the simplest things you can do to get past even just that first screen is make sure that your resume includes those list them put them somewhere in there right if it says requires java or python make sure you list java or python if it says you know 3.0 minimum gpa make sure you write your gpa like literally the basic basic qualifications or minimum requirements if it's listed in the job description do everything you can to get all of those in your resume right because one of the things um that you know unfortunately kind of to jasmine's point of having you know 2 000 plus applicants potentially is you know recruiters don't want to have to go back and hunt you down and say hey you didn't put this on here so i'm just confirming do you have this right that's gonna already put you in the bucket of okay maybe i'll come back to them if i can't find it with all these people who already did list it right so that's one key thing for me just off the bat make sure whatever's in the minimum section that's in there yeah and i saw a question in the chat about and we do and we get this a lot and rachel you could probably agree with this as well um what about the student that doesn't have a gpa yet you know and recruitment seasons are you know really heavy in the fall you know they we certainly put our you know full court press so to speak you know in the fall and then um we're doing more of the um lowhanging fruit in the spring what i say to that is that you can always put your high school gpa um and that you know we understand that you are a freshman and that you haven't you know really gotten a gpa just yet um you speak to that you know speak to you know maybe some things that you've done in high school because listen i think and especially in this this time that we're living in we're really trying to humanize the recruitment process we were all there uh we we've all had you know the experience of applying for jobs and looking for jobs and things and so um again to answer that particular question uh put your high school gpa um and then also you know put some of the courses the core courses that you could be taking uh the first semester of your freshman year maybe some projects and things that you're working on those projects are important it shows what you're interested in i saw another question that i did want to touch on briefly i'll be really quick um do we look you up on social media yes yes we do um so and not like a gotcha type of moment but you know you always remember no company wants you to affect bottom line bottom line yeah yeah no i'm so happy jasmine jasmine and anthony both talk to you about mark about marketing your personal brand and i've heard i've heard the girls who code scholars have awesome brands but we have to remind you preparing to go into into the workforce so just keep that keep that in mind um the other thing that i want to give everyone is homework i know giving homework in the summer is um i want you to google go to google and just type in think about a role that you're interested in a programmer role if you're interested in data analysis type of role anything in that space just type that term in and a company that you're interested in google microsoft att raytheon like everyone who's here and just look at a job description of an analyst level role um in a career that you're interested in like it might seem intimidating but just look at it read what it says look at some of the key words that they're highlighting because i think that that's something i wish i had done earlier that'll give you some insight um as students who are just exploring what's for you okay so let's let's keep it moving because we have we want to get the panelists to speak um the next category is graduating students okay so in light of covet 19 the job market has been um sent into a frenzy that's a any employers receive several hundred applications for job openings although the tech job market is stable hiring managers and recruiters workloads only allow them to spend a couple of seconds reading before deciding whether to move forward or not so this question is for jasmine and anthony we'll start with anthony what elements can be added to perfect a good resume and me and make it stand out and then after you have answered that what should candidates completely avoid putting on their resume i have i got two tools that can help you perfect a good resume um and also help you build up your resume and it builds off what you said chelsea about reading some of these job descriptions like if you're stressed if you're facing imposter syndrome if you're nervous we understand that so i would say a good homework assignment 10 job descriptions you're interested in and don't do anything else like don't pressure yourself to write a resume because what will happen is you start to just get comfortable with like oh wow i've seen java 15 times i've seen the word crossfunctional team eight times and you just start to get more comfortable with it and then i start thinking about your resume because now you have context for how you can position and market yourself so that's one second is the tools so one is called jobscan.co and another one is called recruiting.net so jobscan which you can do is you can paste a version of your resume even if it's like v1 first drive and you can paste the job description and what it'll do it'll run an algorithm and show you the words in the job description that you're missing and that's a free tool they have a paid version but you get a few free fences and the second is recruiting.net so what you can do is say like you said you want to be an analyst at att right what you can do is you can look up uh people who work at a t that are already analysts and linkedin and see okay what are the words that they're using um uh and it's jobscan.co actually okay um so yeah two tools and then one thing to do is just as we said think about how you market and position yourself and using these tools and as chelsea said reading a lot of uh reading a lot of job postings especially at the companies you want to work with that'll not only give you confidence but also more context for how to position yourself um jasmine would you like to add yeah very good i mean um that's really great advice i would say um leadership skills if you have any type of leadership skills um programming languages you know look at the market you know that is becoming um the norm to have some type of programming proficiency in some area so i have that um and then any type of organizations you know community impact i think is really really important now companies are looking more at you know what what you're connected to what you're passionate about and because that ultimately leads to what you bring to work and so and then vice versa we have the candidates that we interact with they want to know you know what what are you doing in the community what how how do you feel about philanthropic philanthropic work um so that's important um but you know what i would say the don'ts um don't have misspelled words on your resume that's like no that's number one um and then two you know if it's if it's light you know if it's you don't have much to put on that that's okay you know don't beat yourself up you're gonna get there to anthony's point you gotta get more confident in creating a resume around the the content that that leads to the content so um i would say no misspell words no you know weird margins um so all that all that all that normal stuff that you would think of and then if you're in college i can't stress this enough um and i speak from experience because i didn't take advantage of it enough when i was in like i said i had a lot of fun um but definitely you need to be attached at the hip to your career services office they provide invaluable time and information you know as a recruiter and you know in college recruiting i'm talking to them probably three to four times a week and so they they have the pulse on the industry um and what i also like to tell candidates too is you know doing all of those things it ultimately leads to ensuring that your your juice is worth the squeeze which means you know you you can back up what you what you have on that resume um so yeah that's mine that's my um feedback good stuff just love this panelist team and the questions in the chat are awesome um panelists feel free at any point to answer some of these questions i'm trying to to help the the scholars as well now i did find a tool earlier in the or an article earlier in the week that i wanted to share that i think is helpful and the article i'm just going to highlight a few things talked about the hard skills um or the technical skills that necessary particular roles and so i just wanted 30 seconds share them with you for those of you who are interested in web development proficiency in html css and javascript are typically a must for those who are interested in cyber security knowledge of programming and scripting languages is desired by employers along with a track record of analyzing maybe malware or data sets so anytime you're working with data or excel that can be helpful if you're interested in data science candidates should prop their expertise into modeling so some modeling analysis which also typically will require excel machine learning you'll want some proficiency in python or experience with gpu which is a computer and data mining system and the final one is programmers you should be strong in sas and language is like sql okay and so we've we've talked about that before let's get into some of the other questions because we've got um what do we have about 30 minutes together a little bit less than that um so our first question is around linkedin and we've been seeing in the chat a lot of questions about linkedin so linkedin seems to be the new resume for recruiters and employers should i list the same information on my resume as i do on my linkedin page who wants to tackle that one i'll start i'll start um i love this area because i loop you know um linkedin and instagram and all that you know i i loop it in together and i laugh i was joking you know earlier not really um that we do look at your social because we do and not necessarily as a gotcha moment but also like in a positive way you know if you're doing really cool things on instagram like on campus or in your community or what have you like i want to see i think that's awesome and we also use those type of platforms to recruit you know lots of companies when you're scrolling through instagram or scrolling through linkedin you see these uh targeted ads that you might even you know for your interviews announcement popped up you know on your um instagram feed all of those things are um are you know essential in marketing um yourself and so uh i certainly use linkedin a lot i post on linkedin i look at articles on linkedin companies now are pushing more information through linkedin we can connect with candidates via chat the you know different postings so it's a really cool tool um to engage with potential hires um and also to get some of the questions that you have answered and to anthony's point earlier about looking at you know goals that other people have that you may interested in that's a great way to do that you can see their linkedin profile you can see what they like you can see who they're connected to you know your people connect with my people type of thing and so um i you know believe that it is your digital resume it gives um a good idea of what your vibe is like you know what you're interested in type of thing so i've i've seen a lot of questions around you know how old do you have to be to have a linkedin you know what you need to do just create one if you don't have a a professional profile picture my background right now in my apartment is why you can put on a nice you know outfit and do just a complete little headshot and put that up there definitely doesn't need to be any selfies or anything like that but um but i i really do feel like um linkedin has been super beneficial to lots of companies and at t being them fantastic is there anyone else who wants to add in on linkedin it's a very important topic oh anthony yeah please hop in yeah i would say to jasmine's point just like other platforms right you have instagram i'm sure there's people you follow on instagram there's communities whether it's about fashion whether it's different things that you're into whether it's different brands that you follow right and linkedin is that powerful but for jobs right so even just even if you created like a bare minimum linkedin and all you did was just like post and follow people and companies again you just that also starts to build your confidence you're like oh like i understand this linkedin thing so also don't feel as though it's you have to figure out everything at once it's like oh i gotta have my great resume and my linkedin and my experience no like first starts to understand these tools and how powerful they are and then start to build upon that and including you know everything else that jasmine said awesome awesome all right let's go to the next question um so someone said i do not have particularly strong transcripts and also lack formal work experiences came up earlier how can i craft a compelling resume and still present myself as a strong candidate so if we can give for this question if we can think about any specific examples you all can think about like that you've had on the job where a student has really showed you strong skills regardless of grades or or anything that would be helpful so whoever would like to take it rachel do you have a thought yes i'll start on that one um so i think and i think we've touched on this several times tonight but um i think this is where you can really um highlight your leadership skills your volunteer activities your campus you know organizations projects that you've done in class right it doesn't always have to be formal work experience right um anything that highlights your interest and your skill sets um is great right you can link to like your github page if you have projects on there you can put that on your resume there are different ways to still you know project yourself in a good light outside of just your gpa right i think jasmine mentioned it before we we're looking for wellrounded right and that's not always in a number right and people have different circumstances on why that their gpa is the way that it is so we want to see kind of that broad horizon of different experiences that you're participating in um and i think one thing that's um important is the skill sets area right a lot of people sometimes have skills listed there right so you can add on different skills and then also putting something maybe unique now this is something this is a very particular story that i had super random um but i was interviewing a candidate right and she you know had had tons of leadership and community um you know she did fairly well in school and then in her interest area right um she was you know volunteering did it and then it said uh mallard duck caller if anybody so a mallard it's literally it's like the the green it's like a green and black duck so she literally one of her skills was mallard caller right and i literally followed up with her because that made her stand out in the pool of this is a super random skill slash interest and i was like i kind of want to know more right so sometimes also putting something very unique or specific to you that again shows your personality like anthony anthony was talking about marketing yourself right it's not always about marketing yes i know c plus and i know java but also i'm a mallard duck caller really what does that mean what do you do right that is also very intriguing to recruiters so adding a little bit of your personality will go a long way as well awesome awesome awesome um any other thoughts on that question yeah i would just say um i feel like people are going to start learning i know i'm like i'm reading the comments thanks for talking to the dogs from their bosses um so but from the gpa standpoint i'll give you a very real you know example you know i had a candidate that had a 25 gpa and um they worked through school they were a part of um or president of some particular organization and they were uh they didn't live on campus so all of these different things and but they had you know project experience or they had um community experience and they you know did other things now the qualifier for our program was a 30 but there was another area you know for this candidate to funnel in so all was not lost and and i really encourage students to not get hung hung up so much on the gp i mean do well in school but i you know everybody's not a you know 4.0 student everyone's not a 35 student some people are not a 3.0 student but you have those you know really strong interpersonal skills you have strong technical skills you know you may learn a different way or absorb information a different way it's about telling that right story to anthony and rachel's point marketing yourself in the right way and doing those things to make you you know even more competitive so but you can like have a super low gpa and you don't do that in school and you don't you know that's not gonna work either so um but you know you have to be wellrounded in all areas absolutely go ahead 20 seconds my two cents is that another example i don't know the young woman personally but a few years ago i saw a woman um young black woman who at an internship at spotify now again i don't know how her grades were but again back to this theme of marketing how do you position yourself right your story as jasmine spoke about maybe this young um candidate's resume or gpa wasn't high but the story in terms of what they did and a few years ago and i can share this article but this woman she applied to spotify with a playlist so she actually added spotify on twitter and said hey here's a playlist that represents my love for other black artists and why i would be a good fit for your internship so it's not always about let me get the right keywords for my resume and let me get the ets it's like how are you going to stand out and touch somebody like rachel or jasmine so so when they get on a panel they're actually mentioning you because you were so memorable right yeah anthony that's powerful because i think sometimes to the point of rachel brock sometimes the things we think are are least important are the things that catch people's eyes so if you're trying to craft a perfect resume it may not be so perfect so just just do be authentic and let your personality come through that's really powerful rachel um shared in the chat rachel you've been adding some really powerful stuff but rachel said hackathons are really great opportunities right um and i was also thinking about um if if students go to like grace hopper or any major conferences that are giving them exposure they should be adding them to their resume yes so i guess my point here is um other than things like hackathon and conferences is there any other like really interesting things that you love to see on on resumes student works um you know definitely i was you know i i was in sga i you know in a sorority all that stuff i mean it's great to be involved right like it's great to be a a member but i would love to see how you lead you know how you partner um you know what you again what you do in the community um and then you know also you know things that interest you like just in general i mean if you are a you know electrical engineering major or maybe a marketing major but you like gaming on the side you know that's also those transferable skills i i love to see that because you know i was a marketing major but i started in network engineering and so to be able to pivot you know in certain areas to you know anthony's point about being bold and marketing yourself in the right way you know to rachel's point about the hackathons all those things are really really cool and you have to you know don't saturate your resume with all that stuff don't put everything but put the most impactful the most authentic the most intentional um things on your resume yep and in 10 seconds can someone tell us what a hackathon is 10 seconds is short but it's like does someone have an ability to tell us what is a hackathon it was asked in the chat do we are we able to give so so my 10 hackathon is it's a competition where you're generally put on teams and you have some type of coding challenge to achieve in a specific time frame that's kind of a quickest exact explanation that's exactly it that's exactly it perfect rachel perfect and all of the into saying wow thank you so good so really quickly we do have one one more question on networking that i i can't wait for to ask the group but there was a question that i saw that came in that was on um like if you should be listing courses like relevant courses um how do you feel like what kind of of student or graduate should be listing under their degree um the courses that they they took is that a waste of space or is it helpful i would say no more than four i you know and they have to be very specific to the role so if you are you know um looking at a technical like a data analyst and you've yes um in advance statistics and some type of you know mathematical course though that's important um but if you're listing out you know your course catalog that's not gonna work so don't do that and i would i would just add to that that i really look at the course list thing as a filler a lot of times so in replacement of if you don't have experiences you know that can help sometimes fill up space so if you're a freshman um you know your first year and you want to focus on some of the core courses or your first year in your major and you don't have internship or specific experience or project experience yet then sometimes those key core courses um are helpful to to list out there as well yeah the only other thing that i would add is um if you're not if you're a nontechnical major um for any reason and you're interested in the tech space and so if you're doing a social science if you're doing a humanities major for instance but you're interested in going into tech you'll want to show the recruiter that you've taken classes that are related to the job so so great thank you thank you team for answering that um final question um so someone said i'm currently completing my last internship and will be graduating in the fall although i haven't completed the internship is it okay okay um is it okay to um connect with other recruiters so if you are in an internship you're not finished with your internship yet but you're thinking about other opportunities can you reach out if so how do you reach out effectively i'm sorry chelsea so you you looked away and then that second that you looked away we had an a special guest run in the background rachel sorry my twoyearold son made a break away my husband had to come and get him thank you for all the great comments everywhere this is a real live i love [Laughter] you it he wants to get in too that was really cute so that's all the um that was all the chat uh okay so question one more time say it one more time okay okay that was great because i'm like what's going on i'm missing it but the question is someone's in an internship and um they are not done with their internship but they're wanting to connect with another employer um how do you do that in an effective way like what does it look like for you to make the update and basically it's a network i think it's a networking and exposure conversation to other opportunities like how do you think that through i'll i'll start um i think it's always great to network and expand your network cast the net broadly um as long as you're not losing focus on what you're currently doing so as long as it's like a stepping stone so let's say if you intern somewhere and you are meeting all the requirements and you're doing everything you're supposed to do but you just really don't feel like you're going to be connected um ultimately with that company just based on how you feel and that happens i mean um so making connection to another company where you have some interest that's okay um it's just you're building that experience now don't do it in a way where you're you know like ghosting the other company that's why don't do that but but always be professional and just say hey i want to expand my network i want to have an informational interview um i love that because if you're not making anyone commit to anything yet you are kind of interviewing for something that you have an interest in so nothing nothing wrong with that just do it in a very professional manner yeah yeah and i definitely think as you get so if we're talking about summer internships for example as you get to the end of the summer you should be actively updating your resume one of the great things about updating your resume is doing it when the information is fresh right so honestly the end of your summer internship is the perfect time to update your resume because what you've done is fresh in your mind so it's okay to go ahead and update that and start applying um as jasmine mentioned you know be open with the current coming your intern interning with to see if there are current opportunities um you know and let them know that you're you're you know looking for future opportunities as well elsewhere and within the company yes yes and so perfect the perfect responses a few things that i wanted to highlight since we're talking the first one was there was a question from someone that said you say we should be specific to the role in which we're applying but also to diversify ourselves and show our interest this is a contradiction how can we manage the two so can someone just share or i'm happy to in a few seconds how do you balance being specific in your resume with those keywords and showing your competence but also showing your personality because that's really what the person's trying to get at what do you think i think personality can come through in a couple of different ways so it can come through in resume format or design right it can also come through in your skills or leadership activity section but being specific about the role in your skill sets should come through in you know coursework in technical skills in projects in work experience but there's always a section on leadership and community involvement and that's where you can highlight some more of your personality yep um there was a question also that i see ashley posed how many sections should you have on your resume how many bullets we all have four different answers i just would say make them even you know like you know don't let it be an odd number of bullets that's just me you know i i would say you know your education your experience your you know interest three and then the bullets under each would should be even um you don't want to put the entire job description under the specific job you're just highlighting the major points of the job or of the work or of the project you know um that's yeah that's what i would say and i would also say i i like the question but i think a better question is how are you resonating with the audience or the job that you're trying to get right um versus the number of bullets and the margin and right it's it's really okay if i want to work at a t and i want to be an analyst okay okay what do those profiles look like who do the people who work there look like what do other job descriptions right and getting context um and then general rule of thumb like keep it to our page right if jasmine is reviewing you know hundreds of resumes or working with our hiring managers right we have a few minutes to look at each resume if that right i think industry average is like six to ten seconds right so just like a youtube ad you can get you know next and but in order to stay top of mind and and and show your worth as as rachel mentioned it's being in alignment with have exactly the skill sets that you need and if you look at my linkedin for example 80 of my summary is like what i do and then there's like two sentences that say i love 90s hip hop i love nature and i love food that's it like that's true i don't have to make that up it's not right but majority of it when somebody comes to my page is like oh okay this person is a talent expert or a recruiting leader yep yep and there was a question that came in um i'm gonna attempt to try to ask it about girls who code like should you be putting that on your resume where do you put it absolutely you put it what do you mean girls who codes a global amazing network of the future leaders well the leaders of this world right [Laughter] better put girls who code but also on linkedin you can put it as well you can put it um there's the at the linkedin has a um organizational affiliation category that's at the bottom it's not towards the top but you can put organizations that you belong to of course girls who code has a company page on linkedin so you can add it and then add alumni okay so so please add that on um so panelists we are getting towards the end and i want you all um first of all thank you what a brilliant dynamic group of leaders thank you so much can you give like a word of wisdom to close us out um we'll start um from jasmine and work our way to anthony can you just share one um powerful take away for today for our scholars um yeah so nobody knows you better than you right nobody can tell your story better than you can and so um the ability to um weave your authenticity and your impact and your knowledge is just a powerful story to tell and you know the time the future is female no shade all good i would say if i just if i had to like give advice that i wanted to hear years ago and that i'm still implementing is two things one is uh you can jay shetty uh he's a kind of like a spiritual teacher i followed and read some of his books and he had a quote and he said um you can only take the world as far as you've traveled internally which lauryn hill also said you know how you're going to win if you ain't right with it so it's like also all of what we don't don't expect to take everything we said today and just go apply it and it just work tomorrow right like this is a journey be kind to yourself um and then the the other thing i would say is be of service um the reason that i'm on this panel the reason i've gotten so many opportunities is because i've gone out of my way to help others so yes i know it's a global pandemic you know you're looking for internships or you're changing jobs or maybe even lost a job but always be thinking about how you can add value to someone else and i promise you like later down in your career like those things start to come back tenfold when you least expect them um yeah be of service and uh go within rachel uh oh you're on beauty yes oh i got it so and there's my son again which is also the be yourself which sometimes is with a kid um so sorry no you're fine um okay so my my really would be be yourself right is honestly number one be who you are right um and that's kind of an ode to everything that jasmine was saying be yourself but i think the bigger thing sometimes is don't overthink it um i know you guys are probably literally like trying to take notes and everything we're saying they're like okay you need this in this section this and this okay only one page like but don't don't overthink it and i think anthony mentioned at one point like you have time to learn all these things like to focus on one thing at a time um this these skills they come with time like i said you're going to iterate a million times on your resume so don't put so much pressure on yourself right um that it's stressing yourself out or you're feeling like you're not succeeding right i would say give yourself grace if anything um it's something that you have to continuously tell yourself throughout your career you know you'll continuously tell yourself is give yourself grace that's looking at that man so give yourself grace be yourself don't overthink it yes turning into churches and closing it down exactly it's so funny because rachel took every ever took the what i was going to say give yourself grace so we're all we're all this this panelist team is is connected and um we're preparing to close out with our five minutes that's left um everybody who came today made time in the summer um you know it's almost eight o'clock on the east coast uh to be here to get this information to connect we're
