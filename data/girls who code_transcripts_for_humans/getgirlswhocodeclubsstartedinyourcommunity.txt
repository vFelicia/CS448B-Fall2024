00:00 - hello thank you so much for taking the
00:02 - time to hear more about girls who code
00:04 - let's start by introducing ourselves my
00:07 - name is Jackson Thomas and I'm a
00:09 - community partner manager at girls who
00:10 - code my name is ko and Wesson and I'm
00:13 - also a community partner manager at
00:14 - girls who code we're excited to tell you
00:17 - more about our programs and discuss how
00:19 - we can work together to bring computer
00:20 - science to girls in your community or
00:22 - build upon what you're already doing
00:26 - here's our agenda for this session we'll
00:28 - start by providing a brief overview of
00:30 - girls who code including our mission and
00:32 - the national problem we are working to
00:34 - address we will then transition into a
00:36 - more in-depth discussion of our clubs
00:37 - program including the program model and
00:40 - information about how to launch clubs in
00:42 - your community
00:42 - well then discuss the process for
00:44 - starting a formal partnership with girls
00:46 - who code over the next 20 minutes we'll
00:48 - cover everything you need to launch a
00:50 - club in your community we wanted to
00:53 - start off with a video that shows just
00:55 - how much a girls who code club can do to
00:57 - provide skills opportunity and a better
01:00 - future for girls in your community
01:09 - [Music]
01:12 - wake up work and it's got me pretty
01:18 - stressed out to the point where I don't
01:19 - don't really eat like I should I'm a
01:23 - fueler for a rental company in the
01:29 - wintertime it's a lot more strenuous he
01:32 - works you know anywhere from 7:00 in the
01:34 - morning until 4:00 in the morning the
01:36 - next day seven days a week straight my
01:39 - work is dangerous I'm basically driving
01:42 - a bomb around the truck full of fuel my
01:47 - dad works a lot he wakes up early and
01:50 - comes home late at night I wouldn't want
01:52 - a Courtney to do what I do I wanted to
01:54 - go to college I want her to have more
01:56 - opportunities in life that's why I put
02:00 - Courtney encoding the goal was really
02:08 - just trying to get them comfortable not
02:10 - being afraid to make mistakes okay
02:36 - company has taught me that nothing comes
02:39 - easy girl see code is a lot more than
02:42 - just coding we cover a lot of life
02:45 - skills asking questions
02:48 - working together teamwork coding makes
02:51 - you like be able to create stuff I get
02:54 - to see my what I create come to life I
02:57 - put her in these extracurricular
02:59 - activities so she can advance and have a
03:03 - career that's less labor-intensive
03:06 - I think coding will give them you know
03:08 - more opportunity for not only employment
03:11 - but it's also sort of the next craft
03:18 - kortnee is the center of my world I have
03:22 - had full custody ever since I was in the
03:26 - military she's kept me strong and
03:30 - focused my goal before I die is to just
03:34 - make sure that her life is comfortable
03:36 - this can be and I'm here as much as I
03:39 - can be for her I like to make stories
03:42 - which means I would like that they could
03:45 - have coming to life
03:46 - my dream is to probably work at Cartoon
03:48 - Network what she always wanted she puts
03:51 - her mind to it she can do anything she
03:52 - wants
03:53 - Courtney's smart she's kind and she's a
03:57 - coder we hope that gave you a better
04:05 - sense of exactly how important the club
04:07 - might turn out to be two girls in your
04:09 - community now that you've seen what a
04:13 - club looks like we'd like to take a step
04:15 - back and provide more context around
04:17 - girls you cloak code and the problem we
04:19 - are working to solve girls who code is a
04:22 - nonprofit dedicated to closing the
04:24 - gender gap in technology and preparing
04:25 - girls for the future of work we do this
04:28 - by providing free and flexible Cs
04:30 - programs for middle and high school
04:31 - students our programs educate equip and
04:35 - inspire girls with the computing skills
04:36 - they'll need to pursue 21st century
04:38 - opportunities let's talk more about the
04:40 - gender gap in technology although
04:44 - computing skills are the most sought
04:46 - after in the u.s. job market with demand
04:48 - growing at three times the national
04:50 - average
04:50 - girls across the u.s. are being left on
04:53 - the sidelines today less than a quarter
04:55 - of computing jobs are held by women and
04:57 - that number is declining making this a
04:59 - national concern research has found that
05:02 - to address the gender gap in technology
05:04 - we must introduce girls to tech at an
05:07 - earlier age girls who code programs are
05:10 - designed to get girls excited about
05:12 - computer science while girls interest in
05:14 - computer science declines over time the
05:16 - greatest drop off happens in middle and
05:18 - high school research has shown that a
05:20 - middle and high school girls interest in
05:22 - computer science declines dramatically
05:24 - at the same time that boys interest
05:26 - grows as a result girls are unlikely to
05:29 - major in computer science or
05:30 - in college or go into a career in tech
05:32 - if we can engage girls in computer
05:35 - science and middle high school we can
05:36 - begin to address that gender gap in tech
05:38 - and to fight against the gender gap in
05:42 - tech we created our summer immersion and
05:44 - clubs programs during this presentation
05:47 - will focus on our clubs program but for
05:49 - reference our summer immersion program
05:51 - is a free seven week summer program for
05:53 - current tenth and eleventh grade girls
05:55 - to learn coding and get exposure to tech
05:58 - jobs summer merchant programs are hosted
06:01 - by major tech companies and select
06:02 - cities across the country our largest
06:05 - program is our clubs program which is a
06:07 - free after-school program for middle and
06:09 - high school students through the club's
06:11 - program girls learn to use computer
06:13 - science to impact their community and
06:16 - join a supportive sisterhood of peers
06:18 - and role models across the u.s. our
06:20 - clubs are designed with three primary
06:22 - goals in mind the first is impact our
06:26 - curriculum is designed to teach girls
06:28 - that they can become problem solvers in
06:30 - their community girls work to solve
06:32 - real-world problems that they care about
06:34 - through code resulting in a computer
06:36 - science impact project which is the
06:38 - center of our curriculum
06:39 - the second is sisterhood it's important
06:42 - that girls and clubs learn that they
06:44 - don't need to address issues in their
06:45 - community alone that's why our clubs are
06:48 - designed to provide girls with a safe
06:49 - and supportive environment of peers and
06:52 - role models where girls can learn to see
06:54 - themselves as computer scientists the
06:57 - third is coding while they are
06:59 - brainstorming designing and building
07:00 - their CS impact project club girls learn
07:03 - key computer science concepts that form
07:05 - the foundation of all programming
07:07 - languages beyond hard coding skills
07:09 - girls gain exposure to real-world
07:11 - project management and problem-solving
07:13 - techniques girls who code clubs are easy
07:18 - to start in your community these are all
07:20 - of the things you need to host a club
07:21 - computer is an internet space to host
07:24 - the club and a volunteer to facilitate
07:26 - the club for one to two hours each week
07:28 - girls who code provides everything else
07:30 - ideally clubs for meet for a minimum of
07:33 - 15 to 20 sessions with some meeting
07:35 - first semester and others for an entire
07:37 - academic year we also have an option for
07:39 - a condensed Club that means for 10 weeks
07:42 - so the curriculum is flexible let's talk
07:44 - more about the volunteer facilitators
07:46 - who lead clubs clubs are led by
07:49 - volunteer facilitators from the
07:51 - community facilitators can be teachers
07:54 - after school educators college students
07:57 - librarians parents or volunteers from
08:00 - any background or field and that's
08:02 - because our curriculum is designed so
08:04 - that anyone can facilitate a club
08:05 - there's no computer science experience
08:08 - needed our clubs facilitators guide Club
08:11 - girls through the curriculum help them
08:13 - become better problem solvers and build
08:15 - their confidence
08:16 - we know that clubs need effective
08:18 - facilitators so we make facilitator
08:20 - support a priority girl Zuko provides
08:23 - facilitators with free training and
08:25 - support materials to ensure that each
08:27 - facilitator can successfully run their
08:29 - club here are some of the training and
08:31 - supports that we provide each
08:32 - facilitator now that we've covered
08:36 - logistics let's talk about the impact
08:38 - that clubs can have on girls and their
08:40 - communities clubs have a tremendous
08:43 - impact both in how to encourage girls to
08:45 - see computer science as a part of their
08:47 - future and in how they've created a
08:50 - movement to address the gender gap in
08:51 - tech according to our last survey 75% of
08:56 - our club students say they are more
08:57 - likely to take a computer science class
08:59 - after participating in a club
09:01 - 65% of clubs graduates said that they
09:04 - intend to major or minor in computer
09:06 - science
09:07 - girls who participate in clubs become
09:09 - passionate about computer science and
09:11 - come to see it as a key component of
09:13 - their college and career plans
09:14 - in 2016 we launched a thousand clubs in
09:18 - all 50 states reaching a total of 40,000
09:21 - girls across the u.s. to put that number
09:24 - in perspective only 10,000 girls
09:26 - graduate with a degree in computer
09:28 - science every year but as fantastic as
09:31 - that is we see this as just the
09:32 - beginning as we hope to reach many more
09:34 - girls and many more communities this
09:36 - year to help reach girls in your
09:39 - community consider a partnership with us
09:41 - to launch multiple clubs and reach more
09:43 - girls in your community girls do code is
09:46 - excited to explore a formal partnership
09:48 - with any organization committed to
09:50 - launching five or more clubs in their
09:51 - community our partners work more
09:54 - with girls eco to enhance the experience
09:56 - for the girls in their clubs
09:59 - partnerships come with a number of
10:01 - advantages girls who code provides its
10:04 - partners with a number of supplemental
10:05 - supports and benefits including priority
10:09 - consideration for field trips regional
10:11 - events and the club's fund a fund that
10:13 - distributes needs based grants to
10:15 - individual quests a summary impact
10:18 - report that highlights the impact of
10:20 - your clubs and the girls they serve and
10:22 - eligibility for reserve spots for our
10:25 - summer immersion program based on
10:27 - availability and location if a
10:29 - partnership is not feasible at this time
10:31 - you can still start clubs in your
10:33 - community we realize that not every
10:36 - organization is positioned to launch
10:38 - five clubs your organization can also
10:40 - work toward expanding clubs or apply to

hello thank you so much for taking the time to hear more about girls who code let's start by introducing ourselves my name is Jackson Thomas and I'm a community partner manager at girls who code my
