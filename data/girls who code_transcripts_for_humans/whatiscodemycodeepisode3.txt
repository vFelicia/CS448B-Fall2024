00:05 - hey there Shannon here Brittany here
00:08 - Audrey here I'm Margo and welcome back
00:10 - to another episode of my code in this
00:12 - episode we'll be explaining what code
00:14 - actually is code is the message you use
00:18 - to convey things code is a set of
00:21 - symbols created by computer programmers
00:23 - to help give meter to certain tasks when
00:25 - you're writing code you're basically
00:26 - giving your computer to do lists and
00:28 - then it runs through all the commands
00:29 - and does whatever you wanted me to do
00:30 - you can think of code as the recipe for
00:33 - your favorite chocolate chip cookies the
00:35 - recipe will tell you what ingredients
00:37 - you'll need how many of each ingredient
00:39 - you'll need and what exactly to do to
00:42 - make those cookies so if you type into a
00:44 - calculator 2 + 2 and it gives you back
00:46 - four
00:47 - you've just committed a calculator
00:48 - that's basically how code works except
00:50 - the commands get way more complexity you
00:52 - can build all kinds of awesome programs
00:53 - when I go to get into the car and I flip
00:56 - through the radio station channels all
00:58 - these things were coded so I can
01:00 - interact with them and control them the
01:04 - code means to create and write out the
01:05 - instructions for our computers whether
01:07 - it's brainstorming how you're going to
01:09 - structure a program or physically typing
01:11 - it out these both are part of the
01:13 - process of coming to code it means to
01:15 - communicate with a computer in a way you
01:17 - can only understand it for instance you
01:20 - can talk to me in English
01:22 - you can say like Oh Margo or Ola Margo
01:25 - and I'll understand throat code is a way
01:27 - of talking to a piece of technology like
01:29 - your computer and having it respondents
01:30 - subway when you write code you're
01:32 - basically giving you a computer a bunch
01:34 - of commands and then it gives you back
01:35 - the result of whatever those commands
01:37 - work code means to write out exactly
01:39 - what you want your computer to do the
01:40 - code is a transfer your ideas onto a
01:43 - computer using a programming language
01:44 - you can code a website a video game a
01:47 - robot or anything you wish all you have
01:49 - to do is type out some commands in the
01:51 - correct order it's fans you have
01:52 - yourself your very own coding creation I
01:56 - use code to do a lot from when I wake up
01:59 - in the morning and my alarm clock goes
02:01 - off to when I go to get a cup of coffee
02:03 - for my Keurig it's coded to let me know
02:06 - what time it is if I need to fill it up
02:08 - with water what size cup I should choose
02:11 - I use code to solve the problem that I
02:13 - encounter every single day for example
02:16 - when I had trouble keeping track of all
02:18 - my homework I created an app that told
02:20 - me when assignments are due it made me a
02:22 - thousand times more efficient and it
02:24 - made me proud of my coding skills I use
02:26 - code to make small tech space projects
02:28 - and then you just like Java sometimes
02:30 - these projects are simple with like a
02:31 - basic calculator but other times I'll
02:33 - spend weeks or even months creating like
02:35 - a choose your own adventure game I use
02:37 - codes create programs that can either
02:39 - help me or help change the world for the
02:42 - better you can use code to create art or
02:44 - to create the inventions that you want
02:46 - to see a reality all these things are
02:48 - coded so I can interact with them and
02:50 - control them I have been coding for the
02:52 - past four years and those four years
02:54 - I've mainly coded video games and in
02:57 - those video games
02:58 - I teach players how to recycle better
03:00 - and about social issues that are unknown
03:02 - these projects are really fun to make
03:04 - and they help me practice my coding
03:05 - skills well we hope you're a little more
03:07 - familiar with code now next week we'll
03:10 - be talking about programming with
03:12 - and what exactly they do questions write
03:14 - them in the comment section below
03:15 - see you right here next week bye guys
03:17 - bye
