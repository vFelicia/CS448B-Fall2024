03:51 - pretty sure
03:51 - um there's a bunch of cousins that you
03:54 - may know
03:54 - down there that of mine so wow small
03:57 - world
03:58 - small um so i'd like to share actually a
04:01 - learning platform that i
04:02 - find extremely influential it's called
04:05 - mind valley if you haven't heard of it

04:08 - it has some personal development
04:10 - professional development so if you
04:12 - consider yourself a lifelong
04:14 - learner definitely check it out one that
04:17 - actually
04:18 - really inspired me recently is around
04:21 - lofty questions
04:22 - so it's a question and affirmation
04:25 - method where instead of saying an
04:27 - affirmation
04:28 - like i am influential
04:31 - you ask yourself a question why am i
04:34 - influential and then it kind of does a
04:36 - brain trick where you start doing the
04:38 - little things
04:39 - to really become truly influential so
04:42 - it gave me such a sense of excitement
04:44 - and motivation so
04:46 - just wanted to share that wow the tips
04:48 - and tricks are coming and we're just
04:50 - doing our icebreaker
04:51 - thank you sasha that's so cool and lisa
04:55 - could you share with us a little about
04:56 - yourself
04:57 - and your media choice yeah lisa mcarthur
05:00 - she her i'm another user experience
05:02 - designer at g healthcare
05:04 - uh media is well non-traditional outside
05:06 - of my work but i really am binging on
05:08 - the renaissance of like victorian
05:10 - aesthetics and cottage core and dark
05:12 - academia
05:13 - and just the escapism movement that
05:15 - happened from the pandemic and how we're
05:18 - going back in history so that movement
05:20 - is just
05:20 - really interesting oh i love that thank
05:23 - you for sharing
05:24 - um and just to clarify i'm emily moss
05:27 - also she her
05:28 - and my um piece of media these days i
05:31 - found i was never a
05:32 - podcast listener pre pandemic but now i
05:35 - find when i'm puttering around my house
05:36 - and i'm
05:37 - folding laundry or cooking i've been
05:38 - listening to the daily from the new york
05:40 - times basically every day
05:42 - and each day is sort of a compact story
05:45 - and i really love it because i felt like
05:46 - i've become a lot more aware
05:48 - especially of international news and
05:50 - stories that maybe i wasn't
05:51 - following so if you're looking for a way
05:53 - to get more informed like a little 20 30
05:55 - minute podcast every day from the new
05:57 - york times the daily that's my
05:59 - my tip so one thing i noticed when i was
06:02 - reading and stumbling over your job
06:04 - descriptions
06:05 - my bad is that you all have complicated
06:08 - job titles
06:09 - so the first thing that i want to ask
06:11 - you is just to tell us a little bit
06:12 - about what your job title means
06:15 - specifically like what do you do all day
06:17 - um
06:18 - and what you know we heard ux we heard
06:20 - strategy we heard all these terms
06:22 - um so sasha would you kick us off remind
06:24 - us what your title is
06:26 - and then what does that actually mean
06:28 - right and i appreciate how that question
06:30 - is positioned what does it actually mean
06:33 - because the same job title can mean
06:35 - different things across companies
06:37 - especially
06:38 - depending on what department you sit in
06:40 - so i sit in the marketing department
06:42 - at new york life insurance company the
06:45 - title of director of web experiences
06:47 - means that i am the lead web producer
06:50 - for our brand's website new yorklife.com
06:53 - so that means the projects i focus on
06:55 - are what you would see if you visited
06:57 - the site whether it's the design of the
07:00 - site
07:01 - subsite sections built for special
07:04 - initiatives or landing pages
07:06 - built for marketing campaigns
07:10 - okay thank you sasha we're going to get
07:11 - into more of that in a moment
07:13 - um maria what is your title what does it
07:16 - actually mean
07:18 - so i think my title now is user
07:21 - experience architect
07:22 - um we kind of switch titles somewhat
07:25 - regularly
07:26 - um and my job is a fairly unique one i
07:30 - think in terms of
07:32 - user experience so user experience as a
07:34 - field is thinking about
07:36 - the usability and the general experience
07:40 - any anyone has with any kind of
07:43 - interface
07:44 - it could be a voice interface it could
07:45 - be your standard software interface it
07:48 - it could even expand out towards
07:50 - customer experience which i'm dabbling a
07:52 - little bit more in so when you think
07:54 - about
07:55 - apple they're the the kings of customer
07:58 - user experience thinking about the whole
08:01 - journey
08:02 - that someone takes when they're using
08:04 - their products
08:05 - so user experience is this it's a it's a
08:07 - somewhat fledgling field it's only been
08:10 - around
08:10 - since uh really in its current
08:14 - form probably about 25 years 30 years
08:18 - and i'd say even 25 years ago it was not
08:21 - something well known
08:23 - so what i do in my day-to-day job is i
08:26 - work
08:27 - so athena health is a medical revenue
08:30 - cycle an ehr so electronic health record
08:33 - software um so what you go in when you
08:36 - go see your doctor and they're typing
08:37 - into the system
08:39 - they're typing into one of these kinds
08:41 - of ehr systems
08:43 - and i work on the billing side of it so
08:46 - if you give them their insurance how you
08:48 - get paid so i'm
08:49 - really looking at all of the different
08:51 - users
08:52 - that impact um doctors getting
08:55 - reimbursed
08:56 - for their for their whatever work
08:59 - they're doing
09:00 - um so it's it's really thinking deeply
09:03 - about not just your typical oh it's the
09:06 - you know twitter user it's the
09:08 - but really like what is your medical
09:09 - biller doing in the system
09:11 - and how can we make it easier for them
09:14 - to
09:14 - to do their work how can we make it
09:16 - easier for a doctor
09:18 - not to burn out on spending time trying
09:21 - to just get reimbursed
09:23 - um so i love my job actually i think
09:26 - it's
09:27 - it's really fun to think about this
09:28 - level of complexity
09:30 - thanks maria i think one thing and we'll
09:32 - get to you in a second lisa one thing i
09:34 - want to
09:35 - point out is that we think of tech as
09:37 - being only a specific type of company
09:39 - but actually you know tech underlies so
09:42 - many things that guide our lives whether
09:44 - it's health care
09:45 - or our financial systems or the arts and
09:48 - the tv that we watch and the podcast we
09:50 - listen to
09:51 - there are engineers and ux folks and
09:53 - designers
09:54 - at every type of industry these days so
09:57 - when you're thinking about what you
09:58 - could do in tech
09:59 - that really is an endless field lisa can
10:01 - you tell us again about your title and
10:03 - what that actually means
10:06 - yeah so i am a staff user experience
10:08 - designer at ge healthcare
10:10 - i'm not in the actual creation of our
10:13 - physical machines but i'm actually on
10:14 - the digital side
10:16 - and in my roles like a staff level i
10:19 - work across products and uh
10:22 - so i touch on i mean more in the
10:24 - education space for the people who use
10:26 - our machine so helping them learn how to
10:28 - use say a ventilator
10:29 - a ct machine they have to have a lot of
10:33 - training to know how to use the machine
10:35 - proficiently
10:36 - so i work across that whole kind of
10:38 - education experience of like how can
10:40 - they get
10:40 - aware of the training get by the
10:43 - training
10:44 - take the training and ask and have
10:47 - questions and get support that's awesome
10:50 - i mean
10:50 - unfortunately and sadly ventilators are
10:52 - something we've all been thinking about
10:54 - so much lately
10:56 - um i want to take a moment and note for
10:58 - folks that joined us later that at the
11:00 - bottom of your screen there should be a
11:01 - button that says live
11:02 - transcript and if you want to turn on
11:04 - your closed captions we have enabled
11:06 - that for this event
11:08 - it's something that's new to me and i
11:10 - want to own that at girls who code we're
11:12 - thinking about accessibility for our
11:13 - programs really differently
11:15 - and trying to learn what the best
11:17 - practices are there and so captions are
11:19 - available at the bottom of the zoom now
11:22 - um i want to talk a little bit about
11:23 - what accessibility in tech that's the
11:25 - title of our conversation today
11:28 - for us at girls who code what we're
11:29 - thinking about is when we have a program
11:31 - like this conversation online
11:34 - how do we enable more people to be able
11:36 - to participate
11:37 - with the choices that we've made so for
11:40 - example if we had this event in new york
11:41 - city
11:42 - almost all of you could not have come
11:44 - right even having this event online
11:46 - in some ways is an accessibility choice
11:49 - on the other hand
11:50 - for somebody with different types of
11:51 - disabilities having an event on a
11:53 - computer screen is not their ideal setup
11:56 - right and so we have to be thinking
11:58 - about these balances and different tools
12:00 - like
12:00 - captions to make our programs across the
12:02 - code
12:03 - more accessible so i would love to hear
12:05 - from each of you
12:06 - a little bit about when you're in your
12:08 - work what does accessibility in tech
12:10 - mean at your organization or for your
12:13 - particular job
12:14 - and maybe lisa you could start this one
12:17 - sure so i'm on the digital side uh
12:20 - technology for me
12:21 - ours is i would say in where william at
12:23 - accessibility is kind of fledgling
12:25 - it's not i really thought about they
12:27 - have like a bias to thinking that
12:29 - everybody's able-bodied
12:30 - who operates our machines or who buys
12:32 - our machines
12:33 - uh for me when i'm doing this um my job
12:37 - is more about inclusion
12:38 - so if you can access it that means we're
12:41 - included you could buy this product you
12:43 - could use it
12:44 - and so that's kind of where i go from it
12:47 - awesome thank you for sharing sasha how
12:50 - about you what is accessibility in tech
12:52 - mean at your organization
12:53 - or with your work absolutely with my
12:56 - work
12:56 - as i mentioned it's the website consumer
12:59 - facing experiences what you may see when
13:01 - you come
13:02 - to new york life.com and our team needs
13:05 - to be strategic
13:06 - in the decisions we make so that it
13:08 - balances the user's
13:10 - experience and their needs and also
13:13 - meeting our businesses needs all while
13:15 - meeting the consumer needs
13:17 - so with the user experience and our
13:19 - website we need to ensure that any
13:21 - potential visitors coming to the site
13:23 - can access
13:24 - information in the best way that is for
13:27 - them
13:28 - and anyone coming to the website may
13:29 - have a certain range of abilities or
13:32 - disabilities and there's actually with
13:35 - the americans
13:36 - with disabilities act there's guidelines
13:39 - that we have to follow
13:40 - in order to make sure that our website
13:43 - is accessible
13:44 - but i know that their guidelines are not
13:46 - as they're not
13:48 - laid out very clearly so there's
13:49 - actually another set of guidelines
13:52 - the web content accessibility guidelines
13:54 - that most organizations follow
13:57 - and i won't get too into the details
13:59 - right now but there's
14:00 - so many different pieces of the
14:02 - guidelines that we consider
14:04 - when we develop our web experiences so
14:06 - definitely happy to dive
14:07 - deeper into those yeah we'll come back
14:10 - to that sasha because i would love to
14:11 - think about some of the things that you
14:12 - consider in that work um
14:15 - maria excuse me how about you does this
14:16 - all sound familiar or do you all think
14:18 - about it a little differently
14:20 - so um the we we have kind of a
14:25 - tale of two cities in terms of our
14:26 - software because we have
14:28 - patient-facing software and websites
14:32 - that
14:33 - must be accessible um because it is
14:36 - medical
14:37 - medical so you know getting your health
14:39 - record getting your billing getting all
14:41 - that
14:42 - so we have a big emphasis on the
14:44 - patient-facing side
14:46 - but then when you go to the the
14:49 - user interfaces that the doctors use
14:51 - that the billers use
14:52 - that software was designed 15-20 years
14:56 - ago when accessibility wasn't
14:58 - really a thing so
15:01 - what the company is trying to do what
15:02 - athena health is trying to do is figure
15:04 - out how we
15:06 - as we roll out new features and develop
15:09 - new ui
15:10 - user interfaces and uis and experiences
15:13 - how can we make those new experiences
15:16 - accessible
15:17 - and i think that the other
15:21 - thing that i'd like to think about about
15:22 - transactionality is
15:24 - it really is improving how we design
15:27 - overall
15:27 - it's not that we need to to to
15:31 - do something weird in some way that's
15:33 - only going to benefit
15:34 - someone with color blindness or someone
15:36 - with a hearing impairment or someone
15:38 - that has
15:39 - um some sort of cognitive impairment
15:42 - doing those things
15:43 - and keeping those types of users in mind
15:46 - is actually gonna
15:47 - benefit everyone overall
15:50 - um so that's been a very persuasive
15:52 - argument i've found as i've been
15:54 - arguing to have more accessibility
15:57 - standards in organizations that
15:59 - look it's really important to think
16:01 - about tab order and how a screen reader
16:03 - might read this
16:04 - this particular screen because if a
16:07 - screen reader can read it
16:08 - a person that doesn't need a screen
16:10 - reader is probably going to be able to
16:12 - understand and go through it more easily
16:14 - as well
16:16 - i love that point we were talking in our
16:19 - pre-pre-session
16:20 - conversation about how for example at
16:22 - girls who code
16:23 - we got some feedback from one of our
16:25 - students who doesn't have a hearing
16:26 - impairment but does have adhd
16:29 - and she mentioned to us that captions on
16:31 - videos really help her stay focused and
16:33 - get the most out of her sessions and
16:34 - she's been talking to her professors
16:36 - at school about adding captions to
16:38 - online lectures
16:40 - and finding ways you know i love what
16:42 - you said it benefits everybody right
16:45 - um one innovation that you might
16:46 - remember is like on a sidewalk where it
16:48 - goes down into the street they add those
16:50 - little bumps right for people who have
16:52 - sight impairments to know where the edge
16:53 - of the sidewalk is
16:55 - but how many of us have been walking on
16:56 - our phones not paying any attention
16:59 - and then you feel that bump and you're
17:00 - like i should not walk into traffic
17:02 - right
17:03 - these things they benefit all of us um i
17:05 - want to stay on screen readers for a
17:07 - moment maria because that's just a
17:08 - really interesting concept
17:10 - do you mind explaining what a screen
17:11 - reader is for folks if they're not
17:13 - familiar
17:13 - and if there's any other examples of
17:16 - kind of common accessibility tools
17:18 - that we might not be familiar with and
17:20 - sasha and lisa you can add on in a
17:22 - moment as well i'd love to just talk
17:23 - about some of those things that
17:24 - these days are kind of considered the
17:26 - baseline
17:28 - sure so a screen reader you can um i
17:32 - haven't actually used a screen reader in
17:33 - a while to test out
17:34 - any of the the uis that i've developed
17:37 - but um
17:38 - a screen reader will take the code the
17:41 - html code
17:42 - and look at the tags on images and read
17:45 - the information that's on the image out
17:48 - so that the
17:49 - any user who is using a screen reader
17:51 - will be able to
17:53 - understand the structure of the page
17:56 - based off of how the screen reader
17:59 - reads that information so it's super
18:01 - important
18:03 - to think about how you're laying out the
18:06 - elements on that page
18:07 - even if uh you think about the the
18:11 - the design of the visual versus the
18:13 - design of just the
18:14 - code and that is a really important
18:17 - difference because
18:18 - you don't have to have those be
18:20 - one-to-one
18:21 - in the sense of you can have styling
18:24 - that makes it render a certain way but
18:26 - then you can have the code be very clean
18:29 - and have it have a screen reader be able
18:31 - to read through it
18:32 - in a way that is very
18:36 - smooth sometimes you go through a screen
18:39 - reader and listen to how it reads a
18:40 - screen and it is the most excruciatingly
18:43 - painful experience you might have
18:44 - might ever imagine because it's it's
18:47 - saying a bunch of links that have
18:49 - bizarre numbering and it's it's
18:52 - awful so um so that's that's one of
18:56 - those tests that you can do
18:58 - as you're developing front-end uis to
19:00 - just listen to it
19:02 - i mean that's amazing i've noticed the
19:04 - trend in a good way on instagram where
19:06 - people write uh
19:08 - image descriptions so that if someone's
19:10 - using a screen reader
19:11 - on instagram and they're not able to see
19:13 - the image they still get a description
19:15 - of what was there and that's just like a
19:17 - very basic best practice
19:19 - um i don't know if you see the chat here
19:21 - payal just mentioned that netflix posted
19:23 - two versions of a trailer today
19:25 - one with an audio description with a
19:27 - voiceover describing the action
19:29 - if there's no dialogue that is such a
19:31 - cool innovation thank you for sharing
19:33 - that
19:33 - um sasha i would love to hear from you
19:35 - if there's any tools that you've seen
19:37 - becoming more common
19:39 - or that you've noticed that have really
19:41 - sort of changed the game around
19:42 - accessibility in tech
19:44 - yeah i'd actually love to first add on
19:46 - to what marie was saying with the screen
19:48 - readers
19:49 - where there's some of the guidelines
19:51 - around making sure you add
19:53 - alt tags for the images to describe
19:56 - what is in the image so when you look at
19:58 - the best practices for writing those
20:00 - descriptions
20:01 - you have to describe what you're seeing
20:03 - not what it's for
20:05 - so if you have a screen reader that's
20:07 - reading through the content and then it
20:08 - pauses on an image
20:10 - you don't want it to say marketing
20:12 - campaign image one
20:14 - you want it to say family enjoying
20:16 - picnic at the park
20:18 - so that's definitely um
20:21 - one of those screen readers and as far
20:25 - as other devices assistive devices
20:27 - i'm not too familiar with uh voice to
20:30 - text but i know that there's also
20:32 - um you know those who are have limited
20:34 - mobility being able to navigate websites
20:37 - with their voice um again not too
20:40 - familiar with those but i think that's
20:42 - super cool that they're able to do that
20:45 - and another one that i've been realizing
20:48 - is becoming more popular is being able
20:50 - to translate websites
20:53 - and apps into braille so i know the
20:55 - google play store has
20:56 - a device that is able to connect to it
20:59 - and translate so that is
21:01 - super innovative and exciting wow
21:04 - that's so cool i hadn't even heard about
21:05 - that um my colleague alyssa who's
21:07 - managing our zoom today just posted in
21:09 - the
21:10 - the chat and she said i love the text to
21:11 - speak uh
21:13 - tool for copy editing we've noticed that
21:15 - girls who code that
21:16 - you know if you write an essay or a
21:18 - blurb and then you have somebody read it
21:20 - out to you
21:21 - including your computer you notice copy
21:23 - editing mistakes and typos
21:25 - and that's like an incredible tool maria
21:27 - to your earlier point that benefits
21:29 - anybody but is designed to support
21:31 - people who need that specific skill
21:33 - um lisa what have you noticed in terms
21:35 - of new trends or
21:36 - innovations in this space so
21:40 - a lot of different things uh to prove
21:42 - the captions if you actually those are
21:43 - in movies you can have a different
21:45 - caption tracks one that has the audio
21:47 - like birds terping
21:48 - or it's just the dialogue and you can
21:50 - get that on the web
21:51 - um and the braille thing another one is
21:53 - you gotta think of there's tools for low
21:55 - vision users they actually use a screen
21:57 - magnifier
21:58 - where they start to blow up parts of the
21:59 - screen so you need to have a very
22:01 - structured
22:02 - content um trying to think oh i love the
22:05 - voice text like on the phones are
22:06 - getting so much better with their
22:07 - accessibility things
22:09 - um just be transparent i am hearing
22:11 - impaired um you can feel free to ask me
22:13 - about that
22:13 - i have been for almost half my life now
22:15 - i wear hearing aids
22:17 - so when i use my phone i have different
22:19 - settings that i can use that can connect
22:21 - to my hearing aids there are
22:23 - if you have vision problems you can bump
22:25 - up the size of your text you can
22:27 - increase the contrast ratio
22:29 - you can have the text voice so there's
22:32 - different ways of even using a touch
22:34 - device to make it accessible
22:37 - so cool and thank you for sharing a
22:38 - little bit about your personal story
22:39 - lisa um
22:40 - i do encourage folks to ask questions
22:42 - not just of lisa but
22:43 - of all of our panelists you can put them
22:45 - in the chat and if we have time
22:47 - in a few minutes we would love to hear
22:49 - your questions um you know one
22:51 - trick that i read about recently you
22:53 - know sometimes when you check a box it
22:55 - turns green like if you're filling out a
22:56 - form online
22:58 - and it shows you that you've completed
22:59 - that section because it it's green
23:01 - but if you're color blind maybe you
23:03 - don't see the change and so one of the
23:05 - design best practices is
23:06 - not only does it turn green a check box
23:09 - also appears right you're thinking about
23:11 - the iconography and the way that these
23:13 - images convey information
23:15 - um so i know we have two ux designers on
23:18 - the
23:19 - on the line here um i would love if we
23:21 - have students that are like really
23:23 - passionate about this kind of work and
23:26 - they want to learn more about
23:27 - accessibility in tech maybe they want to
23:28 - work in this field
23:30 - what have you noticed like what should
23:31 - they be studying in college
23:33 - or what kinds of industries should they
23:35 - consider working is ux the right field
23:38 - are there other areas to study um what
23:40 - would you
23:41 - give advice to students that are
23:43 - interested in studying um maria maybe
23:45 - start us off with this one so
23:48 - the the basic guidelines are the
23:52 - web accessibility guidelines that are
23:54 - published by the the government the
23:55 - wcag whatever i forget version they're
23:58 - on
23:59 - at this point um so just even starting
24:02 - by looking
24:02 - at what those guidelines are is is where
24:06 - i'd recommend
24:07 - getting your baseline they're extremely
24:10 - to session point they're a little
24:11 - confusing and
24:12 - and very thorough but
24:15 - there's lots of great websites and
24:18 - blogs and sources out there
24:22 - that go pretty deep into accessibility
24:25 - i think that it's an interesting field
24:29 - to go into right now um just because i
24:32 - do think that we're starting to build
24:34 - out more
24:36 - user interface frameworks that have
24:39 - accessibility built into them and so
24:42 - if you're interested in building
24:44 - components that will
24:46 - be used potentially by a lot of
24:48 - different applications
24:49 - that's a really interesting way to get
24:51 - involved is to
24:53 - find a place that's that's creating
24:56 - pattern libraries
24:57 - and working in that kind of space
25:02 - awesome lisa would you like to add
25:04 - anything
25:06 - yeah so i think there's books if you
25:07 - want to go into human factors or even
25:10 - uh psychology has a big play and um
25:14 - human computer interaction i would also
25:16 - if you're really interested in this i go
25:18 - seek all those people those communities
25:20 - that are disability communities i mean
25:23 - pick out like there's probably groups
25:25 - there is the deaf community they have
25:26 - these communities like there's the blind
25:28 - community the deaf community if you want
25:29 - to talk to them to learn more about
25:31 - it just expose yourself because i think
25:33 - the more you have exposure to that the
25:35 - more
25:35 - you you start to care about it and you
25:37 - might get more passionate about it and
25:39 - figure out what do these people what do
25:41 - the struggles do they
25:42 - face i think that's a great point as
25:44 - well rather than assuming what folks
25:46 - need
25:47 - talking to actual users which as we know
25:50 - is one of one of the basic components of
25:51 - user experience for anybody right we
25:53 - don't just take a guess
25:55 - we actually talk to our users um by the
25:57 - way alyssa has posted a couple of
25:59 - resources that have come
26:00 - up in the chat so you can grab those to
26:02 - look at later we'll also put them in our
26:04 - follow-up email
26:05 - sasha any other thoughts for folks that
26:07 - are curious about studying this or
26:09 - making a career in this field
26:12 - absolutely i think what maria mentioned
26:14 - around getting familiar with those
26:15 - guidelines
26:16 - is a good first step and then as lisa
26:19 - mentioned
26:20 - good next step is to actually speak to
26:23 - those who may be in those communities
26:26 - and then even
26:27 - challenging the status quo of what those
26:30 - guidelines are
26:31 - even looking at them today i feel like
26:34 - there's so much more
26:35 - that we can address that if you want to
26:38 - be innovative and think of new ideas
26:41 - there's so many opportunities to explore
26:44 - something else that i recently read is
26:45 - that microsoft has
26:47 - launched games that are completely
26:49 - controlled by eye movement
26:51 - so a lot of the guidelines don't address
26:54 - mobility
26:56 - maybe mobility around being able to
26:58 - navigate sites using your keyboard and
27:00 - tabbing but
27:01 - imagine if you can control every screen
27:03 - with your eye movement to scroll down or
27:05 - move to the side
27:07 - whatever it may be i mean we really are
27:09 - i think living kind of on the cusp
27:11 - right now of really incredible
27:13 - innovation um those are all really good
27:15 - pieces of
27:16 - pieces of advice and sasha something i
27:18 - love that you said was sort of
27:19 - challenging the status quo
27:20 - this goes for all of our college
27:22 - students and young professionals when
27:24 - you get into
27:25 - a new job if you see an opportunity to
27:28 - improve something
27:29 - a process or a product especially to
27:32 - make it more accessible
27:33 - i would personally say that's a pretty
27:35 - good way to impress someone
27:36 - right away if you were to say hey like i
27:39 - noticed that we don't have alt tags
27:41 - on our images you know could i do a
27:43 - project around making
27:45 - our uh making this more accessible for
27:47 - screen readers like if i were hiring you
27:49 - as an intern or an entry level employee
27:51 - i would be very impressed
27:52 - by that kind of initiative um so i
27:54 - actually would like to take a step back
27:56 - for all three of you to think about your
27:58 - early careers
27:59 - a little bit and without doing a whole
28:01 - resume of how you got to where you are
28:04 - but i would love to hear a little bit
28:05 - about maybe where you started and some
28:07 - advice that you wish you had known
28:09 - about the industry that you work in
28:11 - because i could tell you that i just
28:13 - i thought like okay there are doctors
28:15 - and teachers and lawyers and dentists
28:17 - and i'm not sure what else is out there
28:19 - until i got out there and so i would
28:20 - just love to sort of hear a little bit
28:22 - about that moment in your own career
28:23 - sasha would you start this one
28:25 - definitely and i love telling this story
28:27 - because it's a lot of self-realization
28:29 - moments
28:30 - um so starting way back when i was in my
28:33 - teens probably
28:34 - i was always the kid who was on the web
28:36 - funny i'm now working
28:38 - with the web but i i was you know
28:40 - modifying my aol profile with if you
28:43 - guys know what aol
28:44 - is with with um the html code and
28:47 - myspace and customizing it
28:49 - i had no idea i was working with code at
28:50 - that time i was just googling things
28:53 - and making my own special profiles
28:56 - um so after that you know going to
28:58 - college i actually interned at madison
29:00 - square garden
29:02 - and continued an additional five years
29:04 - of my career there
29:05 - in the traditional marketing space in
29:08 - that space i
29:09 - was able to dabble a little bit in web
29:11 - analytics and realize that
29:13 - i really loved to combining my
29:16 - subjective and objective mind
29:18 - and being able to make objective
29:21 - decisions using data so i actually
29:23 - switched my career path took a huge risk
29:26 - and learned a new skill and from there
29:29 - i started working a little bit more with
29:31 - web experiences
29:33 - analyzing them and being able to offer
29:36 - insights
29:37 - to enhance the user experience and
29:40 - then a next step from that i really
29:42 - loved the insights that i was sharing
29:44 - and everything i was observing
29:46 - that i wanted to be part of that journey
29:49 - in making the changes so i transitioned
29:51 - into this
29:52 - web experience a web producer role so
29:55 - it's all come full circle from
29:57 - customizing my aol profile to now
30:00 - customizing our brand's website
30:04 - if i could actually add through that
30:06 - journey
30:07 - i was always focused on job titles what
30:11 - do i want to do what's that job title i
30:13 - want
30:14 - what i wish i would have known is that
30:16 - focus on
30:17 - what you actually want to do because as
30:20 - i mentioned earlier
30:22 - not all job titles are the same your
30:26 - job title can be different things at a
30:28 - company and you may not be looking for
30:29 - it because you don't know that the role
30:30 - description is exactly what you want
30:33 - that's such good advice and i think you
30:35 - know if you're interviewing asking a
30:37 - question of like what is my day-to-day
30:39 - going to be in this role is this going
30:41 - to be a lot of spreadsheets
30:42 - is this going to be a lot of copywriting
30:44 - am i going to be in meetings all day
30:46 - is this project based trying to get a
30:48 - handle on that and then the
30:49 - self-knowledge
30:50 - to know what will actually bring you
30:52 - satisfaction um is really good advice
30:54 - lisa what advice and and tell us a
30:57 - little bit about your early career
30:58 - trajectory
30:59 - all right so i want to see if i was
31:02 - inspired by toy story i actually wanted
31:03 - to be a computer animator
31:05 - i couldn't find a four degree animation
31:07 - school in minnesota if my parents
31:08 - wouldn't pay for out of state so i went
31:10 - to computer science and graphic design
31:12 - and so boy that most of the college
31:14 - career i thought i was going to be a
31:15 - front-end web developer content creator
31:17 - uh graphic
31:18 - wise there and then i got exposed
31:20 - through an internship with
31:21 - uh other students with disabilities and
31:24 - i figured out no i really want to help
31:26 - people
31:26 - with technology and so then i went back
31:29 - to college and i heard about this
31:30 - usability testing i was like oh i want
31:32 - to get in there so i went to grad school
31:33 - and i got a master's in human computer
31:35 - interaction
31:37 - and that was more the start of the path
31:39 - down
31:40 - how do i help people how do we make sure
31:42 - that the things that we create are
31:44 - actually
31:45 - solving a problem and somebody's really
31:47 - facing
31:48 - and so then i went on to my career and i
31:50 - was a software engineer coming out for
31:52 - my first job but then i got to
31:53 - transition that
31:55 - career in that company and i actually
31:57 - built up they never had a ux designer
31:59 - before and i actually got them to switch
32:00 - me over to be a ux designer
32:04 - that's a really great story could you um
32:06 - is gonna indulge me here
32:08 - would you recommend a master's program
32:10 - in human computer interaction or
32:12 - under what circumstances would you
32:14 - recommend that kind of program
32:16 - yeah so this is that kind of program is
32:18 - if you really want to get in depth
32:20 - there are a lot of ux boot camps but a
32:22 - lot of them they don't
32:23 - give you a lot of depth to the field and
32:26 - what is available i would think
32:28 - in a degree if you want um to be really
32:31 - taken
32:31 - really seriously having a four year like
32:34 - having that masters
32:35 - coming out like yeah your user
32:37 - experience is like you got a masters you
32:39 - know what you're talking about so i had
32:40 - like instant credibility
32:42 - um you don't have to though so if you're
32:45 - already in the field and you're in your
32:47 - career and you want to make a switch
32:48 - then you don't have to get a master's
32:50 - you can start
32:51 - transitioning take those bootcamps takes
32:53 - those classes and you can still turn
32:55 - over i i appreciate that advice because
32:59 - everyone's situation is different right
33:00 - sometimes people
33:02 - can't afford to go to grad school they
33:03 - need a quicker transition or they need
33:05 - something part-time
33:06 - but there is a difference right between
33:08 - a boot camp that helps you kind of get
33:10 - your foot in the door
33:11 - versus the in-depth kind of program
33:13 - you're talking about
33:14 - and you know i think credentials in some
33:16 - ways can be really problematic and in
33:18 - other places i think especially for
33:20 - women sometimes having a credential can
33:22 - help you
33:22 - make the case for yourself and it
33:24 - shouldn't have to be that way to be
33:26 - super clear
33:27 - but sometimes you need that kind of
33:28 - backup um thank you so much for sharing
33:30 - some of that
33:31 - maria i saw you like nodding along with
33:33 - that conversation i would love to hear
33:35 - about your early career
33:37 - and some advice you might offer sure
33:39 - there's a lot of overlap here
33:41 - um so my earliest sort of ambitions
33:45 - going into college was that i wanted to
33:48 - study the brain in some way
33:51 - um i was very interested in biology and
33:53 - i thought i was going to go
33:54 - and work in a lab and cure cancer or
33:56 - something that was
33:57 - what i wanted to do as a high schooler i
34:00 - got to college i worked in the lab and
34:01 - it was
34:02 - miserable i hated it but the degree
34:05 - program i was in
34:06 - was a joint program between um it was
34:09 - called mind brain behavior so it was a
34:11 - joint degree program psychology biology
34:15 - um philosophy and computer science
34:19 - amazing um and so it sort of
34:22 - melded all these different areas that i
34:25 - was really interested in
34:27 - um and i graduated had no idea what i
34:30 - wanted to do with my life
34:31 - i was like maybe i should be an
34:33 - architect so i went and i worked at a
34:35 - landscape architecture firm and then i
34:37 - said no that's not right either and then
34:38 - i went to work for
34:39 - a professor who was in the psychology
34:42 - area and that wasn't really what i
34:44 - wanted to do either
34:45 - but he let me know about a master's
34:49 - program
34:50 - in human computer interaction um because
34:52 - that's the program he'd come out of
34:54 - and so he kind of sold me on it it took
34:56 - me a few years to really commit to it
34:58 - but then i i went and i got my master's
35:01 - degree and
35:02 - and it was an amazing experience the
35:05 - program that i was in was a very
35:06 - practical program i think that's another
35:08 - sort of factor you need to take into
35:11 - account when you're looking at
35:12 - a master's program in something that's
35:14 - related to user experience
35:16 - there's super deeply technically like
35:22 - human factors playing and i need to
35:25 - understand how to
35:27 - optimize for war kind of human factors
35:30 - and then there's a very practical
35:32 - program like the one i went to which is
35:33 - actually teaching you how to run a
35:35 - usability study how to
35:37 - um do certain methods teaching you
35:39 - statistics and
35:41 - business savvy that you need for user
35:43 - experience
35:44 - um so after that long and winding path
35:47 - to figuring out that ux was a good place
35:50 - for me i've been in ux now for
35:52 - almost 12 years and haven't really
35:54 - looked back
35:56 - i noticed if you see in the chat asthma
35:58 - wrote this sounds a lot like my
35:59 - experience with college haha
36:02 - i think you're not alone right this um i
36:05 - think each of your stories did you
36:07 - notice this you all started out doing
36:08 - something different
36:10 - and wound up here i mean we had
36:12 - landscape architecture we had computer
36:14 - science software development we had
36:15 - marketing
36:16 - right it's just fascinating and i think
36:19 - one thread i want to pull out for our
36:21 - listeners
36:22 - is that you are not committed to the
36:24 - first thing that you do
36:25 - right my first job was in advertising i
36:27 - worked on the ziploc
36:28 - account um and now i work at girls to
36:31 - code right like there's a journey
36:32 - here there's a path you're not locked in
36:35 - and i what i also love about your story
36:37 - maria is that like at each point you
36:39 - were learning like oh i don't really
36:40 - like this so i'm going to shift this
36:42 - direction okay i don't really like that
36:43 - as much
36:44 - and you find your way and it's just you
36:46 - know i think when you are
36:48 - 20 or 21 and you're considering your
36:49 - options it can be really overwhelming
36:51 - and you think well the first job i take
36:53 - is going to be what i do for the next 40
36:54 - years
36:55 - and that is not the case um so thank you
36:58 - all for sharing those journeys i would
36:59 - like to put one last question to you
37:02 - and this is just in your first job and
37:05 - i'm going to start this round i would
37:06 - like to hear a piece of advice
37:08 - for making the most of your first job
37:10 - whatever
37:11 - that field turns out to be whether it's
37:13 - landscape architecture or marketing
37:15 - or something totally different and i'll
37:18 - start so my piece of advice for folks
37:20 - when you're in your first job
37:21 - is to raise your hand and volunteer for
37:23 - things and we talked about one example
37:25 - already where you if you see something
37:27 - that is not as accessible as it could be
37:29 - you could do the research and figure out
37:30 - how to make it better and that could be
37:32 - something you could raise your hand for
37:34 - but i think it goes more beyond that you
37:36 - could say
37:37 - you know can i sit in on that meeting
37:39 - and just listen in
37:40 - right and invite yourself to meetings
37:41 - and sometimes your boss will say no that
37:43 - one's above your pay grade and that's
37:45 - fine
37:45 - but sometimes you get to listen and then
37:47 - afterwards you can ask questions and you
37:49 - can learn
37:50 - can i work on that project is there a
37:51 - way that i can help and starting to put
37:53 - yourself forward
37:54 - will give you opportunities that you
37:56 - wouldn't get if you sort of sat back on
37:57 - your heels
37:58 - so that's my advice in your first couple
38:00 - of jobs
38:01 - let's start with sasha advice for your
38:04 - first job
38:05 - sure i'll add on to yours and say that
38:09 - part of my internships at madison square
38:11 - garden which i will consider my first
38:13 - job
38:13 - is that i was able to hop around from
38:15 - department to department over the course
38:17 - of three semesters and they all worked
38:19 - together
38:20 - so what really made me a great
38:23 - employee once i was hired is that i
38:25 - understood how they all work together so
38:26 - i was a great partner
38:28 - within all of our projects i understood
38:30 - what they needed i understood how to
38:32 - speak to them
38:33 - and that's the same even when you start
38:35 - exploring how to speak to wider
38:37 - departments
38:38 - how does tech speak to marketing how
38:40 - does marketing
38:41 - speak to business etc so definitely
38:44 - agree with that one
38:46 - the other piece that i would say is
38:49 - as you're mentioning raise your hand but
38:51 - take the projects that scare you
38:54 - if you're not scared you're not going to
38:55 - learn and then you'll look back
38:58 - as you grow and say wow that i could
39:00 - actually do that in my sleep now
39:04 - that's some good advice for everyone at
39:06 - every stage in their career
39:07 - frankly because you otherwise you get
39:08 - stuck in a rut and you know i'm gonna
39:10 - file that one away from myself
39:12 - thank you sasha uh lisa
39:17 - uh so i started as a software developer
39:19 - that's not where i wanted to be
39:21 - so i would say keep your eyes out uh
39:23 - when your first job look around
39:24 - always be aware of the opportunities
39:26 - that exist for you and if you work
39:28 - hard and if you bring up a sound case of
39:31 - why you want to
39:32 - explore something and how it benefits
39:34 - that business they're likely to say yeah
39:36 - go ahead
39:37 - and and try it and we want we want to
39:40 - support you on that at least that's been
39:41 - my experience
39:43 - i love that um especially at large
39:45 - companies which is where a lot of our
39:47 - students start
39:48 - because there are great you know
39:49 - rotational programs and associate
39:51 - programs
39:52 - if you're looking left and right and
39:53 - you're like well that that's interesting
39:55 - i want to try that
39:57 - pitch it i mean maybe not on your second
39:58 - day give it a shot first
40:00 - right but that's such good advice
40:03 - man this has been such an amazing
40:05 - conversation um i
40:07 - i want to thank you all it is a busy
40:09 - thursday in the middle of july
40:10 - i am amazed by we have over 50 young
40:12 - women here with us today
40:14 - that's fantastic listening to this
40:15 - conversation for the
40:17 - listeners we are going to send a

40:21 - going to include some of these links
40:23 - the web standard guidelines the

Cleaned transcript:

accessibility and ux and project management and all of the fun stuff so that's why i work at girls who code and a fun fact about me is that i'm a yoga teacher and today was international selfcare day and i taught yoga for my colleagues on zoom today so that's my fun fact let's meet some of our panelists so first up we have sasha diamond i'm the director of web experiences at new york life insurance company we're really happy to hear sasha in her role she utilizes marketing web analytics and product management knowledge to lead strategy and execution of engaging customer facing digital experiences and i was talking with sasha before this event where we're gonna really dive into what that means and what she does all day when she's not working she loves sailing that's awesome and enjoys learning about neuroscience thank you for being here sasha next up we have lisa mcgarth wait lisa is a staff user experience designer um at ge uh and a defining moment in lisa's life was watching toy story everybody loves toy story the first computer animated movie that she had seen inspire and it inspired the technology excuse me it inspired the technology could be functional and creative and she pursued paths in graphic design and computer science such a cool combination lisa i can't wait to hear more about that when she is not at her computer we all live at our computers she can be found with her nose in a book and i'm also a huge reader lisa so i would love to hear what you're reading when we get into some more introductions um and last but not least we have maria garcia a user experience designer and strategist from athena health she enjoys breaking down complex problems to create simple more usable software and customer journeys maria has over a decade of experience working in healthcare and consumer products and while she's worked on everything from voice to television interfaces healthcare enterprise software has become her passion i mean we all need healthcare and software drives everything so i can't wait to hear more about it maria thank you for being here so for all the folks in the chat i can see people leaving comments i appreciate that feel free to introduce yourself tell us where you are in the country i'm in chicago we've got someone in milwaukee here we've got folks in new york we've got my colleague alyssa online in new jersey feel free to introduce yourself in the chat but i want to turn it over to our panelists here for a little bit of an icebreaker i would love to hear about a piece of media that you've been consuming lately that is inspiring you so that could be music that could be a tv show a book a podcast anything you'd like and also while you're at it if you could just share the name you prefer to use and your pronouns um and then we'll really get into this conversation maria would you mind kicking us off with a piece of media inspiring you sure so i am maria uh she her i am working at athena health as emily said in the introduction i am a user experience designer and i'm sure we'll get to talking what exactly user experience is when we dig into this um i am not currently consuming ted lasso but i'm eagerly awaiting ted lasso coming second season coming out tomorrow so really excited about that i have a watch party scheduled with my friends too thank you maria and i just wanted to point out we have folks okay we've got london virginia new zealand middletown connecticut plano texas california thank you all for being here for spending your thursday night with us it's great to have you um sasha what are your preferred name pronouns and a piece of media you're loving today yes i'm sasha diamond i go by she her and first shout out to afifa ali from trinidad my mom is from trinidad so i'm pretty sure um there's a bunch of cousins that you may know down there that of mine so wow small world small um so i'd like to share actually a learning platform that i find extremely influential it's called mind valley if you haven't heard of it it's it has some personal development professional development so if you consider yourself a lifelong learner definitely check it out one that actually really inspired me recently is around lofty questions so it's a question and affirmation method where instead of saying an affirmation like i am influential you ask yourself a question why am i influential and then it kind of does a brain trick where you start doing the little things to really become truly influential so it gave me such a sense of excitement and motivation so just wanted to share that wow the tips and tricks are coming and we're just doing our icebreaker thank you sasha that's so cool and lisa could you share with us a little about yourself and your media choice yeah lisa mcarthur she her i'm another user experience designer at g healthcare uh media is well nontraditional outside of my work but i really am binging on the renaissance of like victorian aesthetics and cottage core and dark academia and just the escapism movement that happened from the pandemic and how we're going back in history so that movement is just really interesting oh i love that thank you for sharing um and just to clarify i'm emily moss also she her and my um piece of media these days i found i was never a podcast listener pre pandemic but now i find when i'm puttering around my house and i'm folding laundry or cooking i've been listening to the daily from the new york times basically every day and each day is sort of a compact story and i really love it because i felt like i've become a lot more aware especially of international news and stories that maybe i wasn't following so if you're looking for a way to get more informed like a little 20 30 minute podcast every day from the new york times the daily that's my my tip so one thing i noticed when i was reading and stumbling over your job descriptions my bad is that you all have complicated job titles so the first thing that i want to ask you is just to tell us a little bit about what your job title means specifically like what do you do all day um and what you know we heard ux we heard strategy we heard all these terms um so sasha would you kick us off remind us what your title is and then what does that actually mean right and i appreciate how that question is positioned what does it actually mean because the same job title can mean different things across companies especially depending on what department you sit in so i sit in the marketing department at new york life insurance company the title of director of web experiences means that i am the lead web producer for our brand's website new yorklife.com so that means the projects i focus on are what you would see if you visited the site whether it's the design of the site subsite sections built for special initiatives or landing pages built for marketing campaigns okay thank you sasha we're going to get into more of that in a moment um maria what is your title what does it actually mean so i think my title now is user experience architect um we kind of switch titles somewhat regularly um and my job is a fairly unique one i think in terms of user experience so user experience as a field is thinking about the usability and the general experience any anyone has with any kind of interface it could be a voice interface it could be your standard software interface it it could even expand out towards customer experience which i'm dabbling a little bit more in so when you think about apple they're the the kings of customer user experience thinking about the whole journey that someone takes when they're using their products so user experience is this it's a it's a somewhat fledgling field it's only been around since uh really in its current form probably about 25 years 30 years and i'd say even 25 years ago it was not something well known so what i do in my daytoday job is i work so athena health is a medical revenue cycle an ehr so electronic health record software um so what you go in when you go see your doctor and they're typing into the system they're typing into one of these kinds of ehr systems and i work on the billing side of it so if you give them their insurance how you get paid so i'm really looking at all of the different users that impact um doctors getting reimbursed for their for their whatever work they're doing um so it's it's really thinking deeply about not just your typical oh it's the you know twitter user it's the but really like what is your medical biller doing in the system and how can we make it easier for them to to do their work how can we make it easier for a doctor not to burn out on spending time trying to just get reimbursed um so i love my job actually i think it's it's really fun to think about this level of complexity thanks maria i think one thing and we'll get to you in a second lisa one thing i want to point out is that we think of tech as being only a specific type of company but actually you know tech underlies so many things that guide our lives whether it's health care or our financial systems or the arts and the tv that we watch and the podcast we listen to there are engineers and ux folks and designers at every type of industry these days so when you're thinking about what you could do in tech that really is an endless field lisa can you tell us again about your title and what that actually means yeah so i am a staff user experience designer at ge healthcare i'm not in the actual creation of our physical machines but i'm actually on the digital side and in my roles like a staff level i work across products and uh so i touch on i mean more in the education space for the people who use our machine so helping them learn how to use say a ventilator a ct machine they have to have a lot of training to know how to use the machine proficiently so i work across that whole kind of education experience of like how can they get aware of the training get by the training take the training and ask and have questions and get support that's awesome i mean unfortunately and sadly ventilators are something we've all been thinking about so much lately um i want to take a moment and note for folks that joined us later that at the bottom of your screen there should be a button that says live transcript and if you want to turn on your closed captions we have enabled that for this event it's something that's new to me and i want to own that at girls who code we're thinking about accessibility for our programs really differently and trying to learn what the best practices are there and so captions are available at the bottom of the zoom now um i want to talk a little bit about what accessibility in tech that's the title of our conversation today for us at girls who code what we're thinking about is when we have a program like this conversation online how do we enable more people to be able to participate with the choices that we've made so for example if we had this event in new york city almost all of you could not have come right even having this event online in some ways is an accessibility choice on the other hand for somebody with different types of disabilities having an event on a computer screen is not their ideal setup right and so we have to be thinking about these balances and different tools like captions to make our programs across the code more accessible so i would love to hear from each of you a little bit about when you're in your work what does accessibility in tech mean at your organization or for your particular job and maybe lisa you could start this one sure so i'm on the digital side uh technology for me ours is i would say in where william at accessibility is kind of fledgling it's not i really thought about they have like a bias to thinking that everybody's ablebodied who operates our machines or who buys our machines uh for me when i'm doing this um my job is more about inclusion so if you can access it that means we're included you could buy this product you could use it and so that's kind of where i go from it awesome thank you for sharing sasha how about you what is accessibility in tech mean at your organization or with your work absolutely with my work as i mentioned it's the website consumer facing experiences what you may see when you come to new york life.com and our team needs to be strategic in the decisions we make so that it balances the user's experience and their needs and also meeting our businesses needs all while meeting the consumer needs so with the user experience and our website we need to ensure that any potential visitors coming to the site can access information in the best way that is for them and anyone coming to the website may have a certain range of abilities or disabilities and there's actually with the americans with disabilities act there's guidelines that we have to follow in order to make sure that our website is accessible but i know that their guidelines are not as they're not laid out very clearly so there's actually another set of guidelines the web content accessibility guidelines that most organizations follow and i won't get too into the details right now but there's so many different pieces of the guidelines that we consider when we develop our web experiences so definitely happy to dive deeper into those yeah we'll come back to that sasha because i would love to think about some of the things that you consider in that work um maria excuse me how about you does this all sound familiar or do you all think about it a little differently so um the we we have kind of a tale of two cities in terms of our software because we have patientfacing software and websites that must be accessible um because it is medical medical so you know getting your health record getting your billing getting all that so we have a big emphasis on the patientfacing side but then when you go to the the user interfaces that the doctors use that the billers use that software was designed 1520 years ago when accessibility wasn't really a thing so what the company is trying to do what athena health is trying to do is figure out how we as we roll out new features and develop new ui user interfaces and uis and experiences how can we make those new experiences accessible and i think that the other thing that i'd like to think about about transactionality is it really is improving how we design overall it's not that we need to to to do something weird in some way that's only going to benefit someone with color blindness or someone with a hearing impairment or someone that has um some sort of cognitive impairment doing those things and keeping those types of users in mind is actually gonna benefit everyone overall um so that's been a very persuasive argument i've found as i've been arguing to have more accessibility standards in organizations that look it's really important to think about tab order and how a screen reader might read this this particular screen because if a screen reader can read it a person that doesn't need a screen reader is probably going to be able to understand and go through it more easily as well i love that point we were talking in our prepresession conversation about how for example at girls who code we got some feedback from one of our students who doesn't have a hearing impairment but does have adhd and she mentioned to us that captions on videos really help her stay focused and get the most out of her sessions and she's been talking to her professors at school about adding captions to online lectures and finding ways you know i love what you said it benefits everybody right um one innovation that you might remember is like on a sidewalk where it goes down into the street they add those little bumps right for people who have sight impairments to know where the edge of the sidewalk is but how many of us have been walking on our phones not paying any attention and then you feel that bump and you're like i should not walk into traffic right these things they benefit all of us um i want to stay on screen readers for a moment maria because that's just a really interesting concept do you mind explaining what a screen reader is for folks if they're not familiar and if there's any other examples of kind of common accessibility tools that we might not be familiar with and sasha and lisa you can add on in a moment as well i'd love to just talk about some of those things that these days are kind of considered the baseline sure so a screen reader you can um i haven't actually used a screen reader in a while to test out any of the the uis that i've developed but um a screen reader will take the code the html code and look at the tags on images and read the information that's on the image out so that the any user who is using a screen reader will be able to understand the structure of the page based off of how the screen reader reads that information so it's super important to think about how you're laying out the elements on that page even if uh you think about the the the design of the visual versus the design of just the code and that is a really important difference because you don't have to have those be onetoone in the sense of you can have styling that makes it render a certain way but then you can have the code be very clean and have it have a screen reader be able to read through it in a way that is very smooth sometimes you go through a screen reader and listen to how it reads a screen and it is the most excruciatingly painful experience you might have might ever imagine because it's it's saying a bunch of links that have bizarre numbering and it's it's awful so um so that's that's one of those tests that you can do as you're developing frontend uis to just listen to it i mean that's amazing i've noticed the trend in a good way on instagram where people write uh image descriptions so that if someone's using a screen reader on instagram and they're not able to see the image they still get a description of what was there and that's just like a very basic best practice um i don't know if you see the chat here payal just mentioned that netflix posted two versions of a trailer today one with an audio description with a voiceover describing the action if there's no dialogue that is such a cool innovation thank you for sharing that um sasha i would love to hear from you if there's any tools that you've seen becoming more common or that you've noticed that have really sort of changed the game around accessibility in tech yeah i'd actually love to first add on to what marie was saying with the screen readers where there's some of the guidelines around making sure you add alt tags for the images to describe what is in the image so when you look at the best practices for writing those descriptions you have to describe what you're seeing not what it's for so if you have a screen reader that's reading through the content and then it pauses on an image you don't want it to say marketing campaign image one you want it to say family enjoying picnic at the park so that's definitely um one of those screen readers and as far as other devices assistive devices i'm not too familiar with uh voice to text but i know that there's also um you know those who are have limited mobility being able to navigate websites with their voice um again not too familiar with those but i think that's super cool that they're able to do that and another one that i've been realizing is becoming more popular is being able to translate websites and apps into braille so i know the google play store has a device that is able to connect to it and translate so that is super innovative and exciting wow that's so cool i hadn't even heard about that um my colleague alyssa who's managing our zoom today just posted in the the chat and she said i love the text to speak uh tool for copy editing we've noticed that girls who code that you know if you write an essay or a blurb and then you have somebody read it out to you including your computer you notice copy editing mistakes and typos and that's like an incredible tool maria to your earlier point that benefits anybody but is designed to support people who need that specific skill um lisa what have you noticed in terms of new trends or innovations in this space so a lot of different things uh to prove the captions if you actually those are in movies you can have a different caption tracks one that has the audio like birds terping or it's just the dialogue and you can get that on the web um and the braille thing another one is you gotta think of there's tools for low vision users they actually use a screen magnifier where they start to blow up parts of the screen so you need to have a very structured content um trying to think oh i love the voice text like on the phones are getting so much better with their accessibility things um just be transparent i am hearing impaired um you can feel free to ask me about that i have been for almost half my life now i wear hearing aids so when i use my phone i have different settings that i can use that can connect to my hearing aids there are if you have vision problems you can bump up the size of your text you can increase the contrast ratio you can have the text voice so there's different ways of even using a touch device to make it accessible so cool and thank you for sharing a little bit about your personal story lisa um i do encourage folks to ask questions not just of lisa but of all of our panelists you can put them in the chat and if we have time in a few minutes we would love to hear your questions um you know one trick that i read about recently you know sometimes when you check a box it turns green like if you're filling out a form online and it shows you that you've completed that section because it it's green but if you're color blind maybe you don't see the change and so one of the design best practices is not only does it turn green a check box also appears right you're thinking about the iconography and the way that these images convey information um so i know we have two ux designers on the on the line here um i would love if we have students that are like really passionate about this kind of work and they want to learn more about accessibility in tech maybe they want to work in this field what have you noticed like what should they be studying in college or what kinds of industries should they consider working is ux the right field are there other areas to study um what would you give advice to students that are interested in studying um maria maybe start us off with this one so the the basic guidelines are the web accessibility guidelines that are published by the the government the wcag whatever i forget version they're on at this point um so just even starting by looking at what those guidelines are is is where i'd recommend getting your baseline they're extremely to session point they're a little confusing and and very thorough but there's lots of great websites and blogs and sources out there that go pretty deep into accessibility i think that it's an interesting field to go into right now um just because i do think that we're starting to build out more user interface frameworks that have accessibility built into them and so if you're interested in building components that will be used potentially by a lot of different applications that's a really interesting way to get involved is to find a place that's that's creating pattern libraries and working in that kind of space awesome lisa would you like to add anything yeah so i think there's books if you want to go into human factors or even uh psychology has a big play and um human computer interaction i would also if you're really interested in this i go seek all those people those communities that are disability communities i mean pick out like there's probably groups there is the deaf community they have these communities like there's the blind community the deaf community if you want to talk to them to learn more about it just expose yourself because i think the more you have exposure to that the more you you start to care about it and you might get more passionate about it and figure out what do these people what do the struggles do they face i think that's a great point as well rather than assuming what folks need talking to actual users which as we know is one of one of the basic components of user experience for anybody right we don't just take a guess we actually talk to our users um by the way alyssa has posted a couple of resources that have come up in the chat so you can grab those to look at later we'll also put them in our followup email sasha any other thoughts for folks that are curious about studying this or making a career in this field absolutely i think what maria mentioned around getting familiar with those guidelines is a good first step and then as lisa mentioned good next step is to actually speak to those who may be in those communities and then even challenging the status quo of what those guidelines are even looking at them today i feel like there's so much more that we can address that if you want to be innovative and think of new ideas there's so many opportunities to explore something else that i recently read is that microsoft has launched games that are completely controlled by eye movement so a lot of the guidelines don't address mobility maybe mobility around being able to navigate sites using your keyboard and tabbing but imagine if you can control every screen with your eye movement to scroll down or move to the side whatever it may be i mean we really are i think living kind of on the cusp right now of really incredible innovation um those are all really good pieces of pieces of advice and sasha something i love that you said was sort of challenging the status quo this goes for all of our college students and young professionals when you get into a new job if you see an opportunity to improve something a process or a product especially to make it more accessible i would personally say that's a pretty good way to impress someone right away if you were to say hey like i noticed that we don't have alt tags on our images you know could i do a project around making our uh making this more accessible for screen readers like if i were hiring you as an intern or an entry level employee i would be very impressed by that kind of initiative um so i actually would like to take a step back for all three of you to think about your early careers a little bit and without doing a whole resume of how you got to where you are but i would love to hear a little bit about maybe where you started and some advice that you wish you had known about the industry that you work in because i could tell you that i just i thought like okay there are doctors and teachers and lawyers and dentists and i'm not sure what else is out there until i got out there and so i would just love to sort of hear a little bit about that moment in your own career sasha would you start this one definitely and i love telling this story because it's a lot of selfrealization moments um so starting way back when i was in my teens probably i was always the kid who was on the web funny i'm now working with the web but i i was you know modifying my aol profile with if you guys know what aol is with with um the html code and myspace and customizing it i had no idea i was working with code at that time i was just googling things and making my own special profiles um so after that you know going to college i actually interned at madison square garden and continued an additional five years of my career there in the traditional marketing space in that space i was able to dabble a little bit in web analytics and realize that i really loved to combining my subjective and objective mind and being able to make objective decisions using data so i actually switched my career path took a huge risk and learned a new skill and from there i started working a little bit more with web experiences analyzing them and being able to offer insights to enhance the user experience and then a next step from that i really loved the insights that i was sharing and everything i was observing that i wanted to be part of that journey in making the changes so i transitioned into this web experience a web producer role so it's all come full circle from customizing my aol profile to now customizing our brand's website if i could actually add through that journey i was always focused on job titles what do i want to do what's that job title i want what i wish i would have known is that focus on what you actually want to do because as i mentioned earlier not all job titles are the same your job title can be different things at a company and you may not be looking for it because you don't know that the role description is exactly what you want that's such good advice and i think you know if you're interviewing asking a question of like what is my daytoday going to be in this role is this going to be a lot of spreadsheets is this going to be a lot of copywriting am i going to be in meetings all day is this project based trying to get a handle on that and then the selfknowledge to know what will actually bring you satisfaction um is really good advice lisa what advice and and tell us a little bit about your early career trajectory all right so i want to see if i was inspired by toy story i actually wanted to be a computer animator i couldn't find a four degree animation school in minnesota if my parents wouldn't pay for out of state so i went to computer science and graphic design and so boy that most of the college career i thought i was going to be a frontend web developer content creator uh graphic wise there and then i got exposed through an internship with uh other students with disabilities and i figured out no i really want to help people with technology and so then i went back to college and i heard about this usability testing i was like oh i want to get in there so i went to grad school and i got a master's in human computer interaction and that was more the start of the path down how do i help people how do we make sure that the things that we create are actually solving a problem and somebody's really facing and so then i went on to my career and i was a software engineer coming out for my first job but then i got to transition that career in that company and i actually built up they never had a ux designer before and i actually got them to switch me over to be a ux designer that's a really great story could you um is gonna indulge me here would you recommend a master's program in human computer interaction or under what circumstances would you recommend that kind of program yeah so this is that kind of program is if you really want to get in depth there are a lot of ux boot camps but a lot of them they don't give you a lot of depth to the field and what is available i would think in a degree if you want um to be really taken really seriously having a four year like having that masters coming out like yeah your user experience is like you got a masters you know what you're talking about so i had like instant credibility um you don't have to though so if you're already in the field and you're in your career and you want to make a switch then you don't have to get a master's you can start transitioning take those bootcamps takes those classes and you can still turn over i i appreciate that advice because everyone's situation is different right sometimes people can't afford to go to grad school they need a quicker transition or they need something parttime but there is a difference right between a boot camp that helps you kind of get your foot in the door versus the indepth kind of program you're talking about and you know i think credentials in some ways can be really problematic and in other places i think especially for women sometimes having a credential can help you make the case for yourself and it shouldn't have to be that way to be super clear but sometimes you need that kind of backup um thank you so much for sharing some of that maria i saw you like nodding along with that conversation i would love to hear about your early career and some advice you might offer sure there's a lot of overlap here um so my earliest sort of ambitions going into college was that i wanted to study the brain in some way um i was very interested in biology and i thought i was going to go and work in a lab and cure cancer or something that was what i wanted to do as a high schooler i got to college i worked in the lab and it was miserable i hated it but the degree program i was in was a joint program between um it was called mind brain behavior so it was a joint degree program psychology biology um philosophy and computer science amazing um and so it sort of melded all these different areas that i was really interested in um and i graduated had no idea what i wanted to do with my life i was like maybe i should be an architect so i went and i worked at a landscape architecture firm and then i said no that's not right either and then i went to work for a professor who was in the psychology area and that wasn't really what i wanted to do either but he let me know about a master's program in human computer interaction um because that's the program he'd come out of and so he kind of sold me on it it took me a few years to really commit to it but then i i went and i got my master's degree and and it was an amazing experience the program that i was in was a very practical program i think that's another sort of factor you need to take into account when you're looking at a master's program in something that's related to user experience there's super deeply technically like human factors playing and i need to understand how to optimize for war kind of human factors and then there's a very practical program like the one i went to which is actually teaching you how to run a usability study how to um do certain methods teaching you statistics and business savvy that you need for user experience um so after that long and winding path to figuring out that ux was a good place for me i've been in ux now for almost 12 years and haven't really looked back i noticed if you see in the chat asthma wrote this sounds a lot like my experience with college haha i think you're not alone right this um i think each of your stories did you notice this you all started out doing something different and wound up here i mean we had landscape architecture we had computer science software development we had marketing right it's just fascinating and i think one thread i want to pull out for our listeners is that you are not committed to the first thing that you do right my first job was in advertising i worked on the ziploc account um and now i work at girls to code right like there's a journey here there's a path you're not locked in and i what i also love about your story maria is that like at each point you were learning like oh i don't really like this so i'm going to shift this direction okay i don't really like that as much and you find your way and it's just you know i think when you are 20 or 21 and you're considering your options it can be really overwhelming and you think well the first job i take is going to be what i do for the next 40 years and that is not the case um so thank you all for sharing those journeys i would like to put one last question to you and this is just in your first job and i'm going to start this round i would like to hear a piece of advice for making the most of your first job whatever that field turns out to be whether it's landscape architecture or marketing or something totally different and i'll start so my piece of advice for folks when you're in your first job is to raise your hand and volunteer for things and we talked about one example already where you if you see something that is not as accessible as it could be you could do the research and figure out how to make it better and that could be something you could raise your hand for but i think it goes more beyond that you could say you know can i sit in on that meeting and just listen in right and invite yourself to meetings and sometimes your boss will say no that one's above your pay grade and that's fine but sometimes you get to listen and then afterwards you can ask questions and you can learn can i work on that project is there a way that i can help and starting to put yourself forward will give you opportunities that you wouldn't get if you sort of sat back on your heels so that's my advice in your first couple of jobs let's start with sasha advice for your first job sure i'll add on to yours and say that part of my internships at madison square garden which i will consider my first job is that i was able to hop around from department to department over the course of three semesters and they all worked together so what really made me a great employee once i was hired is that i understood how they all work together so i was a great partner within all of our projects i understood what they needed i understood how to speak to them and that's the same even when you start exploring how to speak to wider departments how does tech speak to marketing how does marketing speak to business etc so definitely agree with that one the other piece that i would say is as you're mentioning raise your hand but take the projects that scare you if you're not scared you're not going to learn and then you'll look back as you grow and say wow that i could actually do that in my sleep now that's some good advice for everyone at every stage in their career frankly because you otherwise you get stuck in a rut and you know i'm gonna file that one away from myself thank you sasha uh lisa uh so i started as a software developer that's not where i wanted to be so i would say keep your eyes out uh when your first job look around always be aware of the opportunities that exist for you and if you work hard and if you bring up a sound case of why you want to explore something and how it benefits that business they're likely to say yeah go ahead and and try it and we want we want to support you on that at least that's been my experience i love that um especially at large companies which is where a lot of our students start because there are great you know rotational programs and associate programs if you're looking left and right and you're like well that that's interesting i want to try that pitch it i mean maybe not on your second day give it a shot first right but that's such good advice man this has been such an amazing conversation um i i want to thank you all it is a busy thursday in the middle of july i am amazed by we have over 50 young women here with us today that's fantastic listening to this conversation for the listeners we are going to send a followup email to tomorrow and we're going to include some of these links the web standard guidelines the accessibility guidelines some of the recommendations um sasha i don't remember the name of the website you posted the very beginning but we're going to include that too ted lasso for everybody who wants to watch some great tv we're going to put all these recommendations together and we hope that you got something out of this experience whether it's starting to think more critically about accessibility in our lives and our technology or just more broadly thinking about career paths and how winding and creative they can ultimately be i got a lot out of it i filed some advice away so i'm going to ask alyssa to put up a survey for you um for our listeners you can just grab your phone and take a quick screenshot or a quick photo and it will take you to our survey it's like a one minute real quick we would love to hear how this conversation was for you this is an ongoing series if you have ideas for our next conversation we would love to hear them um and i just want to plug for all our listeners that we do have a big event coming up in september it's the grocery code hiring summit so we will have 26 corporate partners some of the companies represented here will be there as well um hiring internships and entrylevel jobs so i'd love you to mark your calendar for september 15th and you will be on our email list that's probably how you got here tonight and you'll hear a lot more about that but we would love to connect you to some of these companies i mean think of the women that you met tonight and think of all the people that you can meet like that um oh ava said is there a different way to get the survey it'll be in the email for you tomorrow and thank you ava for your dedication to filling out our survey i appreciate it and i'm glad that you you're listening in on your phone that's an accessibility thing unto itself that one doesn't need a laptop to participate in these kinds of things so on that note thank you everybody we're gonna send you back out yes it was a great conversation thank you thank you rachel thank you pal yeah we were so glad that you're here panelists i'm going to email you tomorrow i really value your time thank you for sharing so much with us tonight thank you thank you they said your passionate stories amazing advice thank you a bunch thank you look at all those notes isn't that nice all right everybody have a good night thank you
