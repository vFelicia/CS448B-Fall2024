00:14 - and it had someone like you said hey we
00:17 - can do this yeah I think it would have
00:19 - changed the trajectory of my life so
00:21 - what can we do now I do you think all
00:23 - right so it's such a great question and
00:24 - the fact that you're even spotlighting
00:26 - on this segment today
00:28 - um is really really important we operate
00:30 - at girls who code on two levels we teach
00:32 - girls computer science but we also know
00:35 - how important it is to change the image
00:37 - of what a computer scientist looks like
00:39 - and does so what you're talking about is
00:42 - that our girls our non-binary students
00:44 - don't see themselves represented and so
00:47 - for us that's why we have these
00:48 - incredible campaigns we created the
00:51 - world's first ever quotable music video
00:53 - with Doja cat oh my gosh that's exciting
00:56 - very exciting I finally gained
00:58 - credibility with my teenage children
01:00 - right and you know we had this
01:02 - incredible um campaign last year where
01:04 - we had girls who code girls which was a
01:06 - way that any girl or any student could
01:09 - create their own avatar in their image
01:11 - because we know that a lot of video game
01:13 - characters have unrealistic portrayals
01:15 - of girls and women that's right and so
01:17 - part of what we're trying to say also to
01:19 - our girls is that you can bring your
01:22 - passion your creativity your Ingenuity
01:24 - and have it intersect with tech right if
01:27 - you're an artist you're a technologist
01:28 - that's right if you're in healthcare
01:30 - you're a technologist so we're far past
01:32 - the point where we can opt out of tech
01:34 - we have to remind our young people
01:35 - especially our girls because they don't
01:37 - see themselves enough in the field
01:38 - that's right
