03:30 - young muslim girls would have muslim
03:32 - women and as inspirational speakers for
03:35 - them and role models the day there is no
03:37 - longer tension between races because of
03:39 - their history i mean the suppressor
03:41 - mentality comes by nurture not nature so
03:43 - i want to see the day when the new
03:45 - generation just acts upon their pure
03:46 - instinct like children in 16 years from
03:49 - now i would like women to be treated
03:51 - better
03:52 - by each other
03:54 - men and society as a whole
03:56 - i would hope that we don't revert to war
04:00 - but rather
04:01 - have more peaceful solutions
04:04 - and when it comes to solving issues and
04:07 - i would hope that we deal with it
04:09 - in a more gentle compassionate
04:12 - and
04:13 - understanding approach
04:18 - how do you think we're gonna do that i
04:20 - just feel like
04:21 - i mean so cliche but like man in the
04:23 - mirror situation like just start with
04:25 - yourself
04:26 - you know like when you get on a plane
04:28 - and they tell you
04:30 - where your um
04:32 - oxygen mask first yeah so if you want
04:34 - success for yourself want that for
04:36 - someone else as well growing up i feel
04:38 - like i don't really have someone to look
04:41 - up to when i grow up 16 years from now
04:43 - i'll be that woman
04:45 - like everything that happens to us is
04:47 - based on how we were raised and how we
04:48 - were taught from a very young age i see
04:50 - a lot of parents
04:52 - like when their kids are still young
04:53 - they go like no you're a man you
04:55 - shouldn't cry you know you're yeah you
04:56 - know how do you have men know that they
04:58 - have to be more sensible that they can
05:00 - be more so tell them change comes with
05:02 - time like some people started going to
05:05 - sanctuaries instead of zoos which are
05:07 - way better they actually treat animals
05:08 - right and suggest it to schools that
05:10 - they start switching their field trips
05:12 - exactly starting from the ground up with
05:15 - almost everything that we've talked to
05:16 - exactly always comes down to us being
05:18 - kids or someone teaching us
05:21 - when we were younger what's our pact
05:23 - yeah what are what's our impact can we
05:25 - promise each other that every single day
05:27 - we'll do something small or big just
05:29 - something that'll contribute
05:31 - to making this change happen okay can we
05:34 - promise each other
05:35 - when we are mothers to treat our
05:37 - daughters and our sons as well in such a
05:40 - manner and just to be again very gentle
05:43 - but also
05:44 - try to
05:45 - you know say that sort of thing just
05:48 - and and continue on doing so i also
05:51 - think we should promise that we're
05:53 - loving people no matter what and we do
05:56 - everything with love in our hearts and
05:58 - happiness and joy and leave all the
06:00 - negativity and the bad vibes behind
06:03 - i don't know thank
06:05 - i think it's one by one we'll have to
06:07 - one by one here
06:09 - just okay
06:17 - [Music]
06:34 - before dawn and to be a girl
06:36 - means you rise
06:39 - changes its tune
06:42 - [Music]
06:51 - my name is naomi and i'm 11 years old i
06:54 - am here today to acknowledge and
06:55 - represent the african-american girls
06:56 - whose stories don't make the front page
06:58 - of every national newspaper
07:00 - it is my privilege to be here today i am
