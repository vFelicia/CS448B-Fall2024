00:06 - hi Audrey here Mikey Oh Janice here
00:09 - written here and welcome to our I speak
00:11 - code episode of my code this week we'll
00:13 - be talking about programming languages
00:15 - so let's dive right in a programming
00:19 - language is the method of using text to
00:21 - communicate to your computer exactly
00:23 - what you wanted to do the computer
00:24 - doesn't understand human language so use
00:27 - a computer language to tell it what to
00:29 - do it's kind of like a translation
00:31 - between two people who speak different
00:33 - languages just how French people
00:35 - communicate to each other in French and
00:36 - others can learn how to speak and write
00:38 - in French in order to communicate with
00:40 - them a programming language is a
00:42 - languages rules just like a spoken
00:44 - language each programming language has
00:45 - its own grammar or syntax that differs
00:48 - from all other programming languages
00:49 - although we're not computers we can
00:52 - learn how to communicate with them there
00:56 - are different programming languages
00:58 - because you need different tools to do
00:59 - different things like for example if you
01:02 - like video games you might want to try
01:03 - C++ because they're designed things
01:06 - specifically in C++ to help aid video
01:08 - game making it often doesn't matter
01:10 - which coding language you choose
01:11 - sometimes there are technical reasons
01:13 - for choosing one over the other but it's
01:14 - often just personal preference does have
01:16 - a pencil marker and color pencil are all
01:18 - used to draw in color but we obviously
01:20 - use them for different tasks there isn't
01:23 - always a reason to choose one language
01:24 - over another sometimes it's a technical
01:27 - reason but most times is just personal
01:29 - preference right now I'm pretty new in
01:33 - the coding scene so I've just finished
01:35 - my first web development class which was
01:37 - HTML and CSS and now I'm learning
01:40 - JavaScript I know how to code in Java
01:42 - HTML CSS JavaScript and a couple of
01:45 - JavaScript libraries that go with it
01:46 - like jQuery and processing.js and then
01:48 - also at any tiny bit of Python I learned
01:50 - dropper first because that's what the AP
01:52 - test is on and so my high school taught
01:55 - Java then I learned HTML because I
01:57 - wanted to make my own website then I
02:00 - learned sweats because I want to make my
02:02 - own app I know how to code in over eight
02:04 - languages I know how to code in Java
02:06 - HTML CSS JavaScript jQuery Ruby
02:10 - Python Adobe Flash CSX processing j/s
02:13 - and a few more a beginner could start
02:18 - out by learning HTML and CSS because
02:20 - they are super simple and super easy to
02:22 - learn HTML is the language that you use
02:24 - to make webpages and CSS is the language
02:26 - that goes along with it to make the
02:27 - webpages all pretty there are over 200
02:30 - programming languages and I started in
02:32 - Adobe pricey a sec I think a beginner to
02:35 - choose Java because it's the
02:36 - standardized language some most high
02:38 - schools use and the AP test is in Java
02:41 - I think pythons the easiest language
02:43 - because you can write a lot more with a
02:44 - lot less code thanks for tuning in next
02:46 - week we'll be covering what we've
02:48 - created with code be sure to let us know
02:49 - what you want to learn in the comment
02:51 - section down below
02:52 - see you next week
02:58 - you
