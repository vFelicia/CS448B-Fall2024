00:07 - hi Audrey here I'm Margo Shannon here
00:10 - Britney here and welcome to this week's
00:11 - episode of my code this week we'll be
00:14 - talking to you about what's it like to
00:15 - be a girl who codes let's get
00:19 - started to be a girl who codes is so
00:21 - rewarding to be a girl who codes we
00:23 - sometimes have to break the gender rules
00:26 - sometimes we might be the only girl in
00:27 - our computer science class your gender
00:29 - does not expect how good you are at
00:30 - computer science the main difference is
00:32 - in how other people treat you some
00:34 - people might think that it means you're
00:35 - worse at coding or that you deserve some
00:37 - kind of special treatment it's important
00:39 - to remember that your gender and your
00:40 - coding skills are not related being a
00:42 - girl who codes definitely pushes me to
00:44 - work harder because I know a lot of
00:46 - people aren't used to seeing women in
00:48 - Tech and might be doubtful that I even
00:50 - know what I'm doing but that just gives
00:52 - me the extra motivation to prove them
00:54 - wrong that feeling when you finally
00:56 - debug your code or when you finish a
00:58 - project makes you feel un
01:02 - stoppable I've heard comments before
01:04 - like oh you're a girl and you like
01:06 - coating you must be really into web
01:08 - design or since you're the only girl in
01:10 - our group you can work on the front end
01:12 - part of our project and make it really
01:13 - pretty I think one of the biggest myths
01:15 - I've encountered as a girl who codes is
01:17 - that we aren't as good as coding as boys
01:19 - which is entirely untrue anybody can be
01:23 - great at coding one of the biggest myths
01:24 - I've heard about coders is that if
01:26 - you're not a white male wearing a zipup
01:28 - hoodie then you're not going to fit into
01:29 - the coding seen some people might say
01:31 - that a girl who codes can only code that
01:33 - she can't be a girly girl or an athletic
01:36 - or a nature lover we like to hang out
01:38 - with friends listen to music and play
01:40 - sports a girly girl can be a coder or an
01:43 - athletic star can be a coder as well
01:45 - being a girl does not limit what parts
01:47 - of computer science you're allowed to
01:48 - like and be good
01:51 - at my absolute girl code is to support
01:54 - one another don't tear each other down
01:57 - or view each other as competition I
01:59 - think it's really important to finish
02:00 - any tasks you start and also keep any
02:02 - commitments you make my girl code is to
02:04 - dream every day learn as much as you can
02:06 - strive for the best my girl code is
02:09 - sometimes you just got to try it that
02:11 - doesn't mean you should work yourself to
02:12 - the Bone however if you need a mental
02:14 - physical emotional break take one as a
02:16 - first generation child I'll be the first
02:17 - in my family to go to college and I'll
02:19 - also be the first in my family to pursue
02:21 - a career in the stem field as a computer
02:23 - programmer if people are doubting your
02:25 - abilities the best way to prove them
02:27 - wrong is to stay focused and get your
02:29 - work done
02:30 - because the only thing better than
02:31 - saying what you're going to do is
02:33 - actually doing it people will
02:35 - underestimate you but if you view their
02:38 - criticisms as a challenge and if you
02:40 - stay persistent nothing will stop you
02:43 - thanks for tuning in to our hashir code
02:46 - episode we want to know what your girl
02:47 - code is make sure to write them down in
02:49 - the comment section below see you next
02:51 - week to talk about what code actually is
02:53 - thanks bye thanks bye
02:56 - [Music]
02:58 - guys
