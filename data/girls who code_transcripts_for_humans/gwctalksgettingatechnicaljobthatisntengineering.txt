01:52 - you
01:53 - we are going to start our conversation
01:55 - tonight this is part of an ongoing
01:57 - webinar series called girls who code
01:59 - talks and this series came out of the
02:01 - pandemic and i have to say it is one of
02:03 - the silver linings of an otherwise very
02:05 - tragic and traumatic experience and the
02:07 - silver lining here is that we're able to
02:09 - bring you expert speakers from across
02:10 - the country and you are able to join us
02:12 - from literally all over the country and
02:14 - i think we have a couple of
02:16 - international folks here too which is
02:17 - amazing and this is something that we
02:19 - weren't able to do before the pandemic
02:21 - or may rather we were able to do but we
02:23 - didn't think to do
02:24 - and it has been just an incredible
02:26 - series uh we've had a number of
02:28 - different talks on different topics all
02:30 - year long this is our last one of 2021
02:33 - so thank you uh for being here and jl
02:36 - great question yes this will be recorded
02:38 - we will send out the recording tomorrow
02:41 - um but to to kick it off just to
02:43 - introduce myself i'm emily heismos i'm
02:45 - the director of alumni programs at girls
02:47 - who code i've met a lot of you i see a
02:49 - lot of familiar names which is really
02:50 - incredible
02:52 - and i'm really excited about the topic
02:54 - tonight we are talking about getting a
02:55 - technical job that isn't engineering and
02:58 - i just want to say that's no shade on
03:00 - the engineers in the house if you end up
03:01 - an engineer at any point in your career
03:03 - that is amazing we support you that is
03:06 - part of our mission too but there are so
03:08 - many different technical roles in the
03:10 - industry and i think a lot of times when
03:12 - folks are new to this field
03:14 - you think like computer science engineer
03:16 - and you don't necessarily think about
03:17 - the full spectrum of options that are
03:20 - out there and that's what this is going
03:21 - to be a conversation about so with no
03:23 - further ado i'd like to invite cadence
03:25 - daniels to join me on stage cadence is
03:28 - our amazing moderator tonight
03:30 - and cadence is a senior ux which is user
03:34 - experience interaction designer we want
03:36 - to define our terms tonight at ge which
03:38 - is a girl suit code partner we are so
03:40 - happy that she is here to moderate this
03:42 - panel we've met earlier
03:44 - she has really big plans for you tonight
03:46 - and is you know pretty uh recently in
03:50 - this field herself and knows exactly
03:51 - what this transition is like
03:53 - um at ge she leads the growth of an
03:55 - in-house design system and component
03:57 - library and cadence you can tell us what
03:59 - that means
04:00 - after two years as a software developer
04:02 - and ui designer so here again we've got
04:05 - moving between different fields
04:06 - exploring different roles
04:08 - and beyond her efforts to elevate
04:10 - inclusion entrepreneurship and community
04:12 - development cadence is a devoted
04:15 - advocate for everyday people through
04:17 - innovation of human interaction
04:18 - creativity and empowerment kings that is
04:20 - a great bio that is a really wonderful
04:23 - video i would love to turn the floor
04:25 - over to you and you can tell us more
04:27 - about what that means and bring on our
04:28 - other panelists
04:30 - absolutely hello everyone i'm so so so
04:33 - excited we can talk about the bio but in
04:35 - reality it's just a fancy way of saying
04:38 - my job is to advocate for everyday
04:40 - people so thinking
04:42 - like engineers thinking like pms
04:45 - thinking like the people that actually
04:46 - use the tools that we build that's what
04:48 - i do on a day-to-day basis um and so i
04:51 - absolutely get where you guys are coming
04:52 - from and trying to navigate which of
04:54 - those functions you want to play a role
04:56 - in i get it i have had engineering roles
04:58 - i have had project management roles and
05:00 - so i completely understand
05:02 - and like emily said i'm not that far out
05:04 - i'm only four years into my career and
05:06 - so happy to sit here and mediate this
05:08 - conversation around all the different
05:10 - opportunities that you have um and i'm
05:12 - joined today with three amazing
05:14 - panelists we have lily mew who is our
05:17 - director of product management at
05:18 - transperfect we have mary d'angelo
05:21 - gutierrez who's the security consultant
05:23 - at accenture and marissa schmidt who is
05:26 - our senior director of product
05:27 - management at citrix
05:30 - i'm going to give
05:31 - them their own opportunity to introduce
05:33 - themselves and when you do so
05:35 - if we're going to talk about all the
05:37 - different career options we have we
05:38 - might as well take it from the beginning
05:40 - and when you introduce yourself i want
05:42 - you to tell me when you were a kid
05:44 - before college
05:45 - what did you want to be when you grew up
05:49 - and then tell me a little bit about what
05:50 - it is that you actually do now
05:53 - let's go lilly
05:55 - um hi
05:57 - i'm lily um well before
06:01 - i don't know i never really had a
06:04 - career path or very
06:07 - specific career that i wanted to pursue
06:11 - i guess in high school when i first
06:13 - started to have my first computer and
06:16 - that's how i
06:18 - had my interest in
06:20 - in learning more about computer getting
06:22 - into everything about a computer
06:25 - so when i went to college um i pursued a
06:30 - major in computer science
06:32 - um but
06:34 - i also learned that i really didn't
06:36 - enjoy
06:38 - programming that much
06:39 - so
06:41 - i
06:42 - ended up changing my major to
06:45 - information science and policy um it's
06:48 - um it's less programming i learned more
06:51 - about the internet um how to build
06:54 - website using front-end and back-end
06:57 - uh technology like firm and as an html
07:01 - uh to code the uh what you actually see
07:04 - today and when you log into a web page
07:08 - that's who you see and the backend is
07:10 - basically the server that hosts the
07:13 - the website so all of that
07:15 - i have more interest in that so i
07:17 - changed my major to that
07:19 - um after i graduated um
07:23 - i had a little bit hard time finding
07:26 - a job right i'm not i wasn't a
07:29 - programmer
07:30 - which
07:31 - uh
07:32 - most of the jobs out there um they have
07:35 - software developer
07:37 - programmer and that's not what i enjoy
07:40 - to do so
07:41 - i look for everything like webmaster
07:44 - uh
07:45 - web designer
07:46 - that kind of keywords so yeah and then i
07:51 - took on
07:52 - different uh odd jobs um
07:55 - like anything that has web in its job
07:59 - description so i applied for them i
08:01 - ended up working at a law firm and then
08:04 - a film academy not expecting that
08:07 - it's it's very weird like i
08:10 - i only dedicate about 10 of my time
08:13 - doing web
08:15 - tasks um and finally i
08:18 - um
08:20 - i got a call from from my current
08:23 - company and they're looking for a
08:24 - localization engineer
08:26 - and at a time i didn't even know what
08:29 - localization
08:30 - is
08:31 - later i learned it's really just another
08:33 - word for translation you're translating
08:36 - content for a specific region and that
08:39 - process is called localization
08:42 - so i started off as a localization
08:44 - engineer
08:45 - and then i moved
08:48 - to being a solutions engineer the
08:50 - difference is really one
08:53 - localization is
08:54 - you more working for production
08:57 - and then solutions engineer it's uh
09:00 - you're working more client-facing
09:02 - providing solution using the company's
09:05 - software
09:07 - so as i was working on both position i
09:10 - was involved with the initial product
09:12 - that my company had developed
09:15 - and i really and i wasn't really
09:18 - um
09:20 - handling the product as a product
09:22 - manager
09:23 - but i was um i was very interested in
09:27 - using the product gave a lot of feedback
09:29 - to our developers
09:32 - so slowly i
09:34 - sort of become unofficial product
09:37 - manager for the for the products
09:39 - so i finally i'll tell my
09:42 - my managers that i wanted to
09:45 - focus on managing the product because i
09:47 - see a lot of areas where i can spend
09:50 - more my my time and focus on um so i
09:54 - turn myself into a full-time product
09:56 - manager after
09:58 - all the engineering tasks so
10:01 - here i am
10:02 - i'm going to ask you more about what it
10:03 - means to be a product manager but there
10:05 - are many times that we get stuck in
10:07 - unofficial roles and have to actually
10:09 - ask to be in them officially so i get it
10:11 - what about you marie d'angelo
10:16 - so good evening good afternoon everyone
10:19 - so when i was a kid i wanted to be a
10:22 - fashion designer
10:25 - um
10:26 - yeah little did i know when i was um
10:32 - i was eight years old
10:34 - they
10:34 - i grew up in peru so they have these
10:37 - first computers those big ones
10:40 - grayish uh
10:42 - beige
10:43 - and i love them because they follow my
10:46 - instructions
10:47 - [Laughter]
10:50 - and that's when i became in love with
10:52 - computers
10:53 - nice so
10:55 - fashion designer now
10:57 - it's a hobby
10:59 - i go
11:01 - window shopping
11:03 - i love to learn about the latest and
11:05 - evers
11:06 - but
11:07 - computers were all
11:09 - started to become
11:12 - my first love
11:13 - after that i moved to the u.s
11:17 - and
11:19 - english wasn't my first language i had
11:21 - to learn the language and
11:24 - i guess the easiest classes for me were
11:27 - math
11:29 - so it was easier for me
11:32 - to do the math because you don't require
11:34 - a specific language it's just universal
11:38 - numbers
11:39 - and then after that i went to a
11:42 - community college
11:44 - i
11:44 - found the passion for computer science
11:47 - for
11:49 - my first job was as a tutor master or
11:52 - computer science tutor and that's when i
11:55 - learned to enjoy
11:56 - working with people
11:59 - right after that i moved to college i
12:02 - went to rochester institute of
12:04 - technology
12:06 - and there i went for computer science i
12:10 - believe that i wanted to have a strong
12:13 - technology background in order
12:16 - in order to see
12:19 - a lot of opportunities
12:22 - however
12:23 - the project the
12:25 - the degree requires a year of internship
12:28 - scopes
12:30 - and
12:31 - and i've
12:32 - entered in different companies and what
12:34 - i learned is that
12:37 - coding wasn't my passion anymore but it
12:40 - was uh the organization of everything
12:44 - um
12:46 - how
12:47 - this uh
12:48 - how testing worked
12:51 - um
12:53 - how software engineers work what was the
12:57 - what was the link between them what was
12:59 - missing between them how can you
13:01 - organize it in a way that it it works
13:04 - seamlessly and
13:06 - right after
13:08 - i
13:09 - i graduated actually two weeks after i
13:12 - joined accenture i've been at accenture
13:14 - for five years
13:16 - and i've worked as a security analyst
13:20 - cyber security analyst that's how i
13:22 - started i
13:25 - i love it because i wear many
13:28 - hats in consulting i'm able to do some
13:32 - project management
13:34 - so
13:36 - technology stuff
13:38 - assessments for different companies in
13:41 - different industries
13:43 - and
13:44 - [Music]
13:45 - i've i'm an ass
13:47 - um i
13:49 - i weren't learning anything that has to
13:52 - do with cyber security
13:54 - yeah
13:55 - nice i like that you talked about
13:58 - even though you wanted to be a fashion
14:01 - designer it's still a hobby right all
14:03 - the interests we have time don't go away
14:04 - they just have different roles in our
14:06 - lives so marissa what was it for you
14:10 - well when i was a kid all you did is
14:12 - watch
14:13 - the
14:14 - small tvs that show uh um either an
14:18 - actress or a
14:20 - singer or a dancer
14:22 - i wanted to be i wanted to dance i do
14:25 - love dancing
14:26 - yeah
14:27 - uh so i that was when i was still really
14:30 - young in um in the philippines and then
14:33 - uh we moved here in the bay area when i
14:35 - was young um
14:37 - and uh i wanted to get my radio working
14:40 - and it would not work so i took the
14:42 - radio apart put it back together and and
14:45 - see if
14:46 - you know
14:47 - uh how i can fix it and that and that to
14:50 - me was interesting
14:52 - uh taking things apart
14:55 - and so when when i uh went to high
14:59 - school
15:00 - and i was told to do something in a
15:01 - computer and i did the same thing i took
15:04 - the i opened the computer and figured
15:06 - out what's in there and i'm trying to
15:08 - figure out how to get the c prompt and
15:10 - all those things so so that was
15:12 - interesting to me so then my counselor
15:15 - says you know you like math you should
15:17 - do uh engineering that's how i went to
15:20 - computer engineering at cal poly
15:23 - and um
15:25 - but i still like dancing so throughout
15:27 - you know i took the dance classes i you
15:30 - know hip-hop dancing you know i grew up
15:33 - from oakland right so i want videos
15:37 - i want videos um yeah so so that is um
15:42 - so
15:43 - so even though i went to cal poly um in
15:45 - computer engineering
15:47 - i continued that that hobby of dancing
15:50 - and now i do you gem dancing while here
15:53 - but i went to the back to silicon valley
15:56 - um after college and
15:58 - i did
15:59 - do the going into the lab really getting
16:02 - into the details of how the whole
16:04 - networking infrastructure work how we
16:06 - create this cl uh
16:08 - cloud computing all these different
16:10 - things and
16:11 - and so yeah so that was a passion to me
16:14 - because it was again putting things
16:16 - together
16:18 - uh taking it apart
16:20 - um and making the internet work right
16:23 - um in one of the demos
16:26 - i was uh it was told to go in front of
16:28 - the customer and present
16:31 - on the product
16:33 - and
16:34 - that day
16:35 - i realized wow this thing is fun like
16:38 - showcasing the product
16:40 - uh you know besides telling what the
16:43 - product is and so forth and so that was
16:45 - so interesting to me
16:47 - and at the point where i got to know the
16:49 - product manager
16:50 - and and then after a few years uh
16:53 - working with the product manager and
16:55 - he's telling me how i should create this
16:57 - product
16:58 - and i said why do you think we should
17:00 - create that so i started to question all
17:03 - the things that he's asking so then
17:06 - one day
17:07 - because i said i really like the being
17:09 - in front of the customer i said i want
17:11 - to do your job
17:14 - and then
17:16 - the
17:17 - the gm the general manager at that time
17:20 - said
17:20 - i think you could
17:22 - i think it's a great um segway for you
17:24 - because you do like being in front of
17:26 - the customer
17:27 - so i did so i went to product management
17:31 - and uh i've been product management ever
17:34 - since and it's talking in front of
17:35 - customer
17:36 - about the technology i still have to be
17:39 - geeky and get technical with with
17:43 - with uh all of them and you have to but
17:46 - now in my uh ways of of speaking
17:51 - and i i traveled to 25 countries
17:54 - since then and and pretty much spoken in
17:58 - in in all different events from russia
18:01 - to
18:02 - korea to japan you name it um yeah uh
18:05 - talking about the product and i love it
18:07 - and i still do dancing so
18:09 - nice awesome i think the one thing i
18:12 - heard
18:13 - in all of your introductions is that
18:16 - before you even knew
18:18 - what opportunities were there there were
18:20 - certain skills that you had
18:22 - that other people saw and said okay
18:24 - they're going to be awesome in this
18:25 - other role summers i'm actually going to
18:27 - come back to you and ask the first
18:28 - question which is before we even get
18:30 - into depth about what those different
18:32 - jobs and roles are
18:34 - what were the skills that you just saw
18:36 - were so important to have in tough
18:38 - regardless of whether or not you're an
18:39 - engineer
18:41 - ah very good question question cadence
18:44 - um
18:44 - definitely the ability to
18:48 - establish rapport with
18:50 - the people that you're you're um they're
18:53 - talking to
18:54 - and just having that soft skills man i
18:57 - didn't know and trained that
18:59 - and i didn't when i was taking computer
19:01 - classes no one told me that i should be
19:03 - a great speaker
19:05 - uh or or just being able to speak to
19:08 - your to your colleagues and and explain
19:11 - something in whiteboards and things like
19:13 - that i did not know that i should be
19:16 - learning how to do powerpoint for
19:18 - goodness sake
19:19 - right
19:20 - uh soft skills definitely key and and
19:24 - really
19:26 - having that eye to eye connection with
19:28 - the engineer is actually very important
19:31 - and and and being in front of those
19:34 - customers no matter what job you take
19:37 - whether it's marketing product
19:39 - management whatever roles that uh comes
19:43 - that ability to communicate and
19:45 - and really establish that relationship
19:49 - across to all your different teams is
19:52 - critical yeah
19:53 - nice and elia i remember you were
19:55 - talking about
19:56 - when you were really really early fresh
19:59 - out of college you were looking at those
20:00 - different jobs and roles what sorts of
20:02 - skills did you see then that were kind
20:05 - of common across and and you even still
20:07 - see now that you think whether or not
20:09 - you're an engineer this is a core skill
20:11 - to have in the tech world
20:13 - um i would say soft skills is definitely
20:16 - a lot important than
20:19 - hardcore skills
20:20 - i mean i learned a lot of
20:23 - technical
20:24 - skills on my own through school
20:27 - but you'll find that a lot of these
20:30 - skills don't really
20:33 - aren't
20:34 - that used i mean it's not
20:37 - useful hundred percent i think a
20:39 - communication be able to communicate
20:43 - effectively and also ask questions um
20:46 - when you start out
20:48 - in a new company i think asking
20:50 - questions learn
20:53 - um communicate with colleagues
20:56 - definitely helps
20:58 - to get your
21:00 - um
21:01 - yourself started
21:04 - okay
21:04 - nice
21:05 - um
21:07 - mary dance i'm gonna ask you the next
21:08 - question which is
21:10 - a lot of the people in this audience are
21:12 - in school right now and so they're
21:14 - trying to figure out okay what skills do
21:15 - i have
21:16 - and for a college student
21:18 - the best association for a new job is
21:20 - their major
21:22 - and so for people that
21:24 - are maybe similar to you in which they
21:26 - like all the technical stuff
21:28 - but maybe you don't want to be the ones
21:29 - executing it
21:31 - what sorts of majors
21:33 - um
21:34 - do you recommend for them or or how can
21:37 - they they translate a major that they're
21:38 - currently in into a non-engineering role
21:43 - that's a great question so
21:45 - i'm gonna give you a little background i
21:48 - have my sister she major in biology
21:51 - and i have convinced her
21:54 - for years i tried to convince her her
21:56 - skills
21:57 - are wonderful for the technical role she
22:00 - works in a non-profit
22:03 - job where
22:04 - she deals with communities she deals
22:07 - with
22:08 - different issues
22:10 - and
22:12 - what i would say is
22:14 - no matter what degree you are in
22:18 - when you become a problem solver you
22:21 - will
22:22 - apply it to anything that comes to mind
22:26 - uh
22:27 - that is the biggest uh skill that you
22:30 - should have besides communication which
22:32 - is top
22:34 - number one i couldn't
22:35 - agree more with maurice and lily is
22:38 - problem solving skills because
22:41 - uh sometimes
22:44 - the problems can be even in terminology
22:46 - companies can be even
22:49 - as
22:50 - easy as
22:51 - emotional problems within the team and
22:54 - you need to be able to really understand
22:57 - okay
22:58 - why are people feeling
23:00 - why is it not being done this way
23:03 - how can we improve that
23:06 - um and if you have i
23:10 - it is more comfortable when you have a
23:12 - science background to move into the
23:15 - technical
23:17 - background so find your passion
23:19 - have um
23:21 - do what you really enjoy doing in
23:24 - college
23:25 - but besides that build yourself skills
23:28 - uh
23:29 - the best classes weren't the ones that
23:32 - were the technical as lydia mentioned
23:34 - where marisa mentioned
23:36 - where
23:37 - uh joining the leadership institute from
23:41 - my school working
23:43 - being part of groups
23:45 - starting my own club with my best friend
23:49 - we started a salsa dancing club and that
23:52 - showed me how to start something how to
23:54 - build a foundation how to
23:57 - um how to create relationships so that
24:00 - we can find someone that teaches it you
24:02 - will use those skills every day in your
24:05 - life
24:06 - yeah
24:08 - john
24:09 - yeah
24:11 - marissa i saw that you answered a
24:13 - question um
24:15 - in the chat and i actually think i want
24:16 - you to answer it for everyone so the
24:17 - question was do you think a cs major is
24:20 - necessary for the product management
24:22 - role um and then i also want to ask the
24:25 - the second part of that which is
24:27 - if that's not necessary what other
24:29 - majors may help for that role
24:32 - good question and i i tried to answer um
24:35 - in one of them is the
24:38 - so it depends on the company and the
24:41 - product that you're getting into uh
24:43 - usually in silicon valley
24:46 - especially at google facebook you name
24:49 - it you do need to have
24:51 - that
24:52 - engineering major where there's computer
24:54 - science i'm computer engineering so i
24:56 - could be both hardware and software so i
24:58 - wasn't tied to one thing so that helped
25:00 - me to actually be more broad so i was
25:04 - able to apply in different companies
25:07 - so it depends what uh
25:09 - but you know
25:11 - you don't have to
25:13 - do the computer programming apps outside
25:16 - of the college
25:17 - but having the engineering degree
25:20 - gives you more credibility in front of
25:22 - those engineers because you're telling
25:24 - them what to do product
25:26 - management is the owner of that product
25:29 - uh you know my in my company
25:32 - i own 80 of the product uh from a
25:35 - business perspective that's
25:37 - over 400 million right yeah so it's
25:40 - critical when that they have to listen
25:43 - uh
25:45 - you need to at least know and speak
25:47 - their language
25:49 - um and so yeah
25:51 - it's tough classes
25:53 - but at the end of the day you don't need
25:55 - to be a computer programmer but just
25:57 - finish
25:58 - an engineering degree whatever it is
26:01 - okay
26:02 - um
26:03 - lily i said i was going to come back to
26:05 - you with this question
26:07 - while we're talking about product
26:08 - managers can you help us differentiate
26:12 - product management versus project
26:14 - management versus program management to
26:17 - somebody not in tech those all mean the
26:19 - exact same thing
26:21 - well i think that these
26:24 - well program manager and project manager
26:26 - might mean different things in different
26:28 - companies
26:29 - in my company um project manager
26:33 - for production team they manages
26:36 - all of the the jobs are coming from
26:39 - clients
26:40 - scheduled um
26:43 - scheduled tasks
26:45 - for engineering work for translation for
26:48 - translator
26:49 - like they have to set timeline so
26:52 - that kind of things so it's not very
26:54 - technical at all
26:56 - we have a program manager
26:58 - program manager
27:00 - uh it's more for
27:03 - communication with a client um help them
27:07 - uh
27:08 - understand what their
27:10 - what their needs are in terms of getting
27:13 - getting their their products or their
27:15 - software
27:16 - uh translated and what is the scope what
27:19 - solutions we have um from our company uh
27:24 - like what technology we have in order to
27:26 - provide them
27:28 - uh the kind of solutions and the program
27:30 - manager are also
27:32 - they don't need to be technical but they
27:34 - do need to know uh the the software
27:38 - how it functions what functionalities
27:40 - are in there uh so that they can uh
27:43 - communicate to the client uh if there is
27:45 - anything that's too technical
27:48 - like for example if our clients is uh
27:51 - very technical and they ask certain
27:53 - questions that the program manager
27:55 - cannot
27:57 - answer then they they will contact um
28:00 - either product manager for more
28:02 - information or if product manager like
28:04 - myself cannot answer the question i go
28:07 - to our developers uh to find out more
28:10 - information
28:12 - um
28:13 - yeah so product manager
28:16 - for me i
28:17 - um
28:19 - the product that i'm managing is more
28:22 - technical than some of the other ones i
28:25 - know some
28:26 - my colleagues they don't have
28:28 - engineering background and there are
28:30 - managing some of the products as well so
28:33 - managing being a product manager
28:36 - doesn't always have to have engineering
28:39 - background but like marissa said it
28:41 - really helps a lot because when you
28:44 - communicate to
28:45 - uh developers especially you can define
28:49 - the requirements better you speak their
28:51 - language right so um you're not just uh
28:56 - putting your users requirement their
29:00 - words uh as uh
29:03 - the
29:04 - um requests to the developers i mean
29:07 - some developer has
29:09 - more understanding of what you're asking
29:12 - but sometimes they
29:14 - they don't always ask enough question
29:17 - back to you
29:19 - to
29:19 - define things more specifically and what
29:24 - would end up happening is the software
29:27 - gets developed and the functionality
29:29 - don't really meet the requirement of the
29:31 - user because of the the miscommunication
29:34 - so
29:35 - um so
29:37 - i mentioned communication is very
29:39 - important it's in not just in product
29:41 - management but in all areas right so
29:45 - um
29:47 - yeah so i guess um
29:49 - do you need a software engineering
29:52 - background i would say it helps and
29:56 - if you want to be a product manager you
29:58 - definitely should learn even if you
30:01 - don't have a degree in
30:04 - engineering but you um you do need to
30:07 - expect yourself to learn because
30:10 - uh if you don't
30:11 - uh keep up with the skills and knowledge
30:14 - uh you're not going to be successful
30:17 - yeah it's a combination of
30:19 - having literacy of engineering in
30:21 - general plus being able to be a planner
30:24 - plus kind of having that like sales
30:26 - aspect of being able to work with the
30:28 - people who are actually
30:30 - putting the money behind your project
30:31 - and who are deciding what kind of things
30:34 - they want the product to do in the
30:35 - future um
30:37 - and i will talk a little bit more about
30:39 - what it looks like to actually get these
30:41 - roles right like the interview process
30:42 - how do you navigate salaries and stuff
30:44 - like that but mary angelo i want to give
30:46 - you an opportunity to talk about
30:48 - your role as well um there's a couple
30:50 - questions that came in
30:52 - so one can you just explain to us what a
30:54 - tech consultant is because when i was in
30:56 - college
30:57 - consulting just sounded like answering
30:58 - questions if you look up the rule
30:59 - definition
31:01 - um but what is it actually and then on
31:04 - your day-to-day what does it look like
31:06 - so consultants are people that solve
31:11 - and define problems for our clients
31:15 - that's how i can resume that an
31:17 - undefined meaning because
31:20 - when we get our client tells us this is
31:23 - the problem and
31:26 - 95 of the time
31:29 - it turns out that the problem is not
31:30 - that one but it's something else
31:33 - and understanding
31:35 - the entire perspective from the
31:38 - business eye as well as the technical
31:41 - side is very important
31:43 - when we start in
31:46 - in consulting first you are analyst and
31:50 - your job is to
31:53 - understand the culture of the consulting
31:55 - company to learn as many skills as you
31:59 - can um
32:00 - [Music]
32:02 - certificate so you get trained depending
32:05 - on the company that you are in and then
32:07 - you can specialize in a particular
32:10 - service
32:12 - option or you can diverse for example
32:16 - uh
32:17 - i started as an identity and access
32:20 - management
32:22 - analyst
32:24 - it means
32:26 - every time you log in in your system
32:29 - uh
32:30 - we put the middleware in between
32:34 - um
32:35 - that platform
32:36 - and
32:38 - authenticating you verifying that who
32:40 - you are and where you are and so on and
32:43 - so forth
32:44 - and after that i
32:47 - also learned about security policy which
32:50 - is more of the
32:52 - standards
32:54 - of
32:55 - more like a
32:57 - law degree
32:58 - a small law degree then i also work in
33:04 - application security that's more
33:06 - hands-on technology
33:08 - and i'm currently in data
33:11 - loss prevention meaning a company
33:16 - should store their data
33:19 - in such a way that if there is a hack
33:22 - that forbids
33:23 - they are able to retrieve that data
33:26 - immediately
33:28 - and solve the problem as soon as
33:30 - possible but there are many steps into
33:33 - that
33:34 - and many companies forget about that and
33:37 - they apply it at the end so
33:40 - uh usually
33:43 - is a as a security
33:45 - consultant
33:47 - it's
33:48 - it is very difficult to sell a business
33:51 - person that security is important but
33:53 - it's but when the hacks
33:55 - happen and you don't know when it
33:57 - happened yeah now we have all-nighters
34:02 - and a lot of work to do
34:04 - right exactly that makes sense okay so
34:07 - boom we've gotten everybody's scope we
34:09 - know what everybody does on their day to
34:10 - day but we are only four people in a
34:13 - massive industry
34:14 - um outside of what you guys do what are
34:18 - the actual other opportunities that are
34:21 - in this field that are not um
34:24 - not necessarily engineering roles but
34:25 - just
34:27 - what else is out there maurice i know
34:28 - you talked about this a little bit for
34:29 - someone's question but how would you
34:31 - describe the entire scope of the options
34:34 - that are in tech
34:35 - okay
34:36 - i i can do it um so as a product so in
34:39 - tech
34:40 - uh it's a big silicon valley over here
34:42 - right
34:43 - uh usually it starts with the product
34:46 - yeah that product has um you know
34:49 - there's the engineering side which i
34:51 - know um
34:52 - is a is an
34:54 - option but um not the only option after
34:56 - the product
34:58 - is about to go launch
35:00 - you can have product marketing technical
35:02 - marketing
35:04 - field engineering they're the one
35:06 - hanging out talking to the customer
35:08 - day-to-day you can have do field
35:10 - marketing marketing that product in a
35:12 - specific region
35:14 - uh or market in in other regions uh lo
35:18 - lilly was talking about localization
35:20 - you can have uh field marketing for
35:22 - japan for example which is different
35:25 - from
35:25 - uh the ones that are in korea so they
35:28 - have different field marketing the
35:29 - different regions
35:31 - uh there's manufacturing supply chain
35:34 - all these different folks that's that
35:36 - works in my building uh
35:38 - that all supports the product
35:41 - uh they're not necessarily have to be
35:44 - technical like me with engineering but
35:47 - they support my product they're the one
35:49 - creating the web web designs and the
35:53 - website doing that collateral data
35:56 - sheets
35:57 - uh for my product and and they put all
36:00 - of the blogs the
36:02 - the
36:03 - webinars all this different planning
36:06 - for the products so many many different
36:08 - ways
36:09 - but based on a product in silicon valley
36:12 - or if you're at google facebook is
36:14 - similar thing and you'll need
36:16 - marketing you need uh field sales all
36:20 - those things does that help
36:22 - yeah i think so it's kind of like in
36:24 - these different pillars right so you
36:25 - have the people that are
36:27 - like the strategic thinkers you have the
36:29 - the product managers the program
36:31 - managers project managers
36:33 - and then this isn't about engineering
36:35 - per se but you have different
36:37 - engineering functions everything's not
36:39 - coding there are people that manage
36:40 - security there are people that manage
36:42 - making sure that everything stays up and
36:45 - doesn't shut down there are people that
36:47 - manage the front end side that the users
36:49 - do there are people that manage the back
36:51 - end which is all the data and where
36:53 - things are stored and then there's
36:55 - there's the designers and even within
36:57 - designers there are different types of
36:59 - functions right there's the people that
37:01 - manage research and testing there's the
37:03 - people that manage
37:05 - um
37:06 - the ui of it which is kind of like an
37:08 - advanced version of graphic design and
37:10 - there's the people that do experience
37:12 - that are pretty much like behavioral
37:14 - psychologists in a way um and then
37:16 - there's even
37:18 - the people that manage you know like
37:19 - when we talk about infrastructure the
37:21 - testing of the
37:22 - of the product and all of that at first
37:24 - glance that sounds very overwhelming
37:27 - because it's going to be hard to find an
37:28 - article that shows you this massive map
37:31 - of what all your opportunities are right
37:33 - and a lot of this stuff
37:36 - you have to
37:37 - work your way up to it nobody is going
37:40 - to get a
37:42 - director of product management position
37:43 - right out of undergrad it's just not
37:45 - gonna happen unless you did undergrad
37:48 - after you know halfway through your
37:49 - career
37:51 - and so um lily i think i'll ask you this
37:53 - question is
37:55 - for the larger scope what are the actual
37:57 - entry level jobs that our students may
38:00 - be seeing or which ones are the easiest
38:02 - to kind of
38:03 - get started and prepare for now
38:06 - [Music]
38:11 - with the
38:13 - with engineering background or without
38:15 - engineering background
38:17 - let's talk about without
38:19 - without engineering background in the
38:22 - technology
38:24 - industry
38:26 - um
38:28 - i think
38:29 - let me try to think um
38:34 - well my company is a translation company
38:37 - it wasn't a technology company
38:40 - um to start with uh initially
38:44 - uh
38:45 - chance perfect well i started uh with
38:48 - translation.com
38:50 - so
38:51 - um the company started as a sister
38:54 - company for chance perfect
38:56 - um it specializes in um
39:00 - translating websites for different
39:02 - companies we used to use other companies
39:05 - technology
39:06 - so we
39:08 - well it cost a lot of money to pay for
39:10 - our company
39:12 - to use their software so what we ended
39:14 - up doing is we um
39:16 - hire our own group of developers and
39:19 - build our own tools
39:21 - um
39:23 - so my experience is a little bit
39:25 - different
39:26 - i start off with a localization engineer
39:31 - i know that not all of my colleagues
39:34 - have engineering background
39:37 - so through
39:39 - trainings and um
39:42 - from the from the experienced
39:44 - colleagues
39:46 - it is doable even though it had the
39:49 - title has engineer it's not as scary uh
39:52 - as software engineer that you have to
39:54 - know how to code and it's
39:57 - it's not technical but it definitely
40:00 - requires
40:01 - um
40:01 - [Music]
40:03 - i guess
40:04 - a mindset to solve problems all right so
40:08 - um localization engine i think one of
40:11 - the the question uh someone had asked uh
40:14 - about that um so
40:17 - the company uh has to process a lot of
40:20 - different source file in order to get
40:22 - that translated so that process requires
40:25 - the engineer to know different
40:28 - uh different file formats um
40:30 - and you like office files are the most
40:33 - common ones that majority people know
40:36 - and then there are also the the website
40:39 - uh file formats like html php now it's
40:43 - more json file uh json files
40:47 - uh xml files these are the most common
40:52 - types of files
40:53 - so
40:55 - i think um localization engineer is is a
40:58 - good one
40:59 - it does require some
41:02 - engineering learning
41:03 - as you serve
41:07 - maybe a
41:08 - project manager would be a good start
41:11 - i know someone who has been working as a
41:16 - project manager for years
41:18 - and then she she learned how uh to use
41:22 - uh our products and she
41:24 - uh she's more familiar with the product
41:27 - and she wanted to be a product manager
41:30 - after a few years of working with
41:32 - product uh in fact there's some
41:35 - mike not on my team but someone else
41:38 - that i know
41:39 - um she worked as a
41:41 - localization engineer
41:43 - and then she um she
41:46 - move on to being a qa
41:49 - quality assurance
41:51 - of the products so she has more exposure
41:54 - with the products and then now she's
41:56 - also a product manager
41:58 - so it's all about
42:00 - um
42:02 - learning a new tool new
42:04 - learning about the
42:06 - uh the applications whether it's a
42:08 - mobile application web application or
42:11 - desktop application so anything
42:14 - that you use on your computer your
42:16 - mobile app
42:18 - if you have interested on it do some
42:20 - research just just google um like
42:23 - product management
42:25 - software development they just have some
42:28 - basic idea what it is
42:30 - and then you know like uh if you do
42:33 - interview at least you're you're not
42:35 - completely clueless of what it is right
42:39 - um yeah
42:41 - yeah nice um married angela what would
42:44 - you say are some of the
42:46 - entry-level roles
42:48 - that people can kind of start getting
42:50 - looking at or things that they may
42:51 - expect to see either titles
42:54 - that they could be comfortable
42:57 - feeling like they could actually get
42:58 - into out of graduation
43:01 - sure
43:02 - i would say
43:05 - a great way
43:06 - to
43:07 - see
43:08 - what you want is that many companies
43:12 - many companies that are not necessarily
43:15 - tech companies so
43:16 - broader your horizons think about okay
43:19 - you want to work in a fashion design
43:23 - brand
43:24 - or you want to work for a bank many of
43:27 - these companies have programs specific
43:30 - for entry-level students
43:33 - that they rotate you through different
43:36 - positions
43:38 - and they hire people from
43:41 - uh
43:42 - from physics degrees
43:44 - psychology degrees uh really i work with
43:48 - many many of them some of them get hired
43:51 - during the inter process some of them
43:54 - get higher
43:55 - and right
43:56 - before school
43:58 - you graduate before school so my
44:01 - suggestion is always go to the career
44:04 - fairs
44:06 - during your last year before graduation
44:09 - apply for as many jobs as possible
44:12 - because those programs are directly
44:15 - targeted for that
44:17 - they start some of them start as early
44:19 - as july and then october
44:23 - october maximum november if you go to
44:26 - conferences and so on and so forth but
44:29 - that's the time frame uh yeah
44:32 - i think
44:33 - without
44:34 - um flying i
44:37 - i interviewed for about a hundred
44:39 - companies so i
44:42 - brought down well i learned
44:45 - what i wanted how
44:47 - what it meant to interview how
44:50 - what culture i like what culture i
44:53 - didn't like
44:55 - what was my expectation how to make my
44:58 - expectations and how to have
45:01 - a broader perspective i chose consulting
45:04 - because i never
45:06 - i get bored easily so i want to try
45:09 - different things
45:10 - but there are other opportunities
45:13 - consulting is not the other only one is
45:16 - just
45:17 - about being informed following the
45:20 - trends in recruiting
45:22 - your career
45:24 - department is the most useful always
45:28 - make your best friend out of them it
45:31 - doesn't matter what your
45:33 - your degree is
45:35 - i would say
45:36 - go for it um
45:38 - don't only target the tech companies
45:41 - because
45:42 - you know
45:43 - those are going to be
45:47 - they are looking for a specific
45:49 - stereotype
45:50 - uh so besides those look somewhere else
45:55 - yeah
45:55 - they will
45:58 - they will impress you yeah
46:01 - you just told my entire career story and
46:03 - you didn't even know it so
46:05 - story time
46:06 - um when i was a
46:09 - junior in undergrad
46:10 - i was involved in the national society
46:12 - of black engineers who has a very large
46:14 - national convention every year just like
46:16 - many other
46:18 - collegiate and academic organizations
46:23 - at that career fair
46:25 - the strongest interview i had was with
46:27 - ge general electric
46:30 - i was hired
46:32 - as an intern for the summer between my
46:34 - junior and senior year
46:37 - as an internship for
46:39 - ge's rotational program
46:42 - end of the internship these this is the
46:44 - thing that's really nice about
46:44 - rotational programs because you end the
46:46 - internship and then they offer you the
46:47 - job for after graduation
46:50 - and so when i graduated
46:53 - i had a degree
46:55 - in what our school
46:57 - it had a different name but it was
46:58 - basically a human computer interaction
47:01 - and design program which i saw somebody
47:03 - in the chat talk about the gang gang
47:04 - um and i also had a minor in cs because
47:07 - i was one of those people where i was
47:08 - like i'm going to work in tech
47:11 - don't really want to do coding
47:14 - but i don't want it to be a fallback
47:16 - because it's not seen on my resume
47:18 - somewhere and so i got it as a minor
47:21 - entered into this rotational program
47:23 - where i moved every six months and tried
47:25 - out different functions right there's a
47:27 - there's
47:27 - they'll put you in a design role that
47:29 - puts you in an engineering world they'll
47:30 - put you in
47:31 - different types of management roles
47:34 - and
47:36 - last year's when i finished that program
47:38 - and entered into
47:39 - a different
47:41 - design role at ge ge is not a tech
47:43 - company
47:44 - don't let anybody convince you otherwise
47:46 - ge is an industrial company that does
47:48 - tech
47:49 - and just like lily what you were talking
47:51 - about is there are plenty of companies
47:53 - out there that have tech jobs so you do
47:56 - not have to go after the googles
47:58 - and the microsoft's and the apples um
48:01 - there are tech jobs everywhere because
48:03 - what we talk about as tech today is
48:04 - something that is globally needed and
48:06 - it's always going to be
48:08 - right the skills may change but it's
48:09 - always going to be in demand
48:11 - um
48:12 - and so for me
48:14 - and i'll i'll just kind of touch on this
48:15 - a little bit because we don't have any
48:16 - other designers here
48:19 - i knew
48:21 - that i wanted to go into design because
48:23 - like i said i just i really care about
48:24 - everyday people
48:25 - i really care about what we call
48:28 - business to consumer products that are
48:30 - directly to people
48:33 - and so
48:35 - for the people out there that are
48:37 - questioning
48:39 - whether design is right for them let me
48:41 - break down a couple of things for you
48:42 - because this field can be confusing
48:44 - when people talk about ux they're
48:47 - talking about user experience and
48:49 - they're talking about ui they're talking
48:50 - about user interface
48:52 - the difference
48:54 - um
48:55 - if someone who specializes in
48:57 - in ux
48:58 - specializes in the overall
49:02 - experience that any user has in a
49:04 - product
49:05 - so it's a mix of how they feel about the
49:07 - product how easily they can get their
49:09 - tasks done
49:10 - when you get um
49:13 - when it's time for you to get your
49:15 - grades back from a teacher
49:16 - how quickly can you log in
49:19 - check your grade and go handle your
49:21 - feelings if that takes 10 minutes it's
49:24 - probably not a good user experience if
49:25 - it takes 30 seconds you might be doing
49:27 - something right the product might be
49:29 - doing something right
49:30 - user interface
49:33 - people that specialize in that are
49:34 - probably
49:36 - visual designers so they specialize in
49:38 - making sure the buttons are gorgeous and
49:41 - that the layout is on point in a way
49:43 - that the user can very easily scan the
49:44 - information and get to what they need to
49:46 - do
49:49 - people enter
49:51 - the ux field because remember ux
49:53 - involves
49:54 - the interface right the entire
49:55 - experience also includes what it looks
49:58 - like
49:59 - people enter that field from
50:01 - all over
50:02 - from engineering from product management
50:06 - from
50:08 - roles that have nothing to do with tech
50:10 - because it is just about your ability to
50:13 - advocate
50:14 - for a user right it's not about
50:17 - um it's not the same as market research
50:19 - right where you're trying to sell
50:20 - somebody something no these users are
50:22 - coming here to do something they
50:23 - probably don't have a choice
50:25 - um
50:26 - and so when you're thinking about
50:28 - whether or not this this field is right
50:30 - for you
50:31 - or you know that it's what you want to
50:32 - do and you're trying to figure out
50:34 - how to get there
50:35 - what you'll hear the most is that the
50:37 - most important thing
50:38 - to get you an interview in this field is
50:40 - being able to communicate your design
50:41 - process
50:43 - right so having a portfolio online that
50:46 - has examples of your projects and how
50:48 - you
50:49 - think through
50:50 - the design thinking process which google
50:51 - that later
50:52 - how you think about iterations how you
50:54 - take what our product managers here will
50:57 - provide you
50:58 - as a new feature okay the user needs to
51:01 - be able to do this thing in our tool now
51:03 - and then how you translate that into
51:05 - what the actual visual and technical
51:07 - experience is going to look like is
51:08 - really important to have documented
51:11 - somewhere because this field is
51:12 - different
51:14 - than other ones in that
51:16 - this is a field where you have to have
51:18 - something that speaks on its own in
51:20 - order to make it through the interview
51:21 - process right
51:23 - um and so there are a couple questions
51:25 - out there about ux if you have more just
51:27 - throw them in there and i'll try to
51:28 - answer them either through our
51:29 - discussion or on my own um but where
51:32 - that does bring us is i do want to talk
51:34 - at least
51:35 - one person answer a question about
51:38 - the interview process
51:40 - so let's say we have our students out
51:42 - there that are
51:43 - [Music]
51:45 - they know what they want to do they have
51:46 - everything
51:48 - with their degree set up the way that's
51:50 - going to get them recognized
51:52 - marissa how does someone prepare
51:55 - for the different types of interviews
51:57 - that might come up for tech roles and
51:59 - how do they navigate salaries like all
52:01 - of that
52:02 - good question um
52:05 - uh
52:06 - for
52:07 - tech
52:07 - technical interviews definitely you do
52:10 - need to know the basics
52:13 - uh even just
52:15 - i know you're not gonna do programming
52:17 - things like that it depends what roles
52:20 - you're applying for but
52:22 - look at the requirements of the
52:25 - job description
52:27 - and they'll tell you actually
52:30 - this is a plus you need to know
52:32 - c c plus plus python whatever it is
52:36 - if those are required you probably
52:38 - should make sure you
52:40 - at least know
52:42 - and open your your um
52:44 - or your notes on this area because that
52:47 - will probably be in the interview
52:50 - so most of the time anything that
52:53 - requires um
52:55 - uh in the in that job description they
52:57 - tell you exactly what you need if you if
52:59 - you need some
53:00 - information for
53:02 - amazon how do you set something up in
53:04 - amazon or azure google cloud
53:07 - those are our important things to at
53:09 - least
53:10 - highlight and understand those before
53:12 - the interviews so very very good one to
53:14 - know and then um
53:17 - so that's for
53:18 - any technical interviews understanding
53:22 - and what you should also do is
53:24 - check out who your interviewer is
53:26 - go check him i know it's like stalking
53:29 - but you know in linkedin they have their
53:32 - profile there get them
53:34 - who they are
53:35 - yeah
53:37 - okay
53:38 - so um
53:39 - we only have a couple minutes left and
53:41 - so i want to
53:43 - provide the students with one last piece
53:45 - of advice so just really quick round
53:47 - robin
53:48 - what is the one piece of advice you
53:49 - would give
53:50 - to someone in this position of trying to
53:52 - look for a role being in school
53:55 - and wanting to see what opportunities
53:56 - are not necessarily engineering lily
53:59 - what would you say
54:03 - um
54:04 - well i think uh
54:06 - i mean if you want to get into the tech
54:08 - industry you probably
54:10 - have some idea what you want to do
54:13 - right so based on that
54:16 - do some
54:17 - research
54:18 - to see what kind of jobs are out there
54:22 - product manager it's very broad for uh
54:26 - like marissa said it could be hardware
54:28 - it could be software so if it's a
54:30 - software that you're
54:32 - you want to get into there's also
54:35 - um software that's not
54:37 - that that's not requiring a very
54:40 - technical background so um if that's
54:44 - what you want to do um just look for
54:46 - those and just check out different uh
54:49 - industry
54:50 - not necessarily the the big uh to name
54:53 - uh tech companies right so even your
54:56 - local
54:57 - um
54:59 - company that you know of um
55:02 - check
55:03 - to see if they have any job offer
55:05 - uh maybe some somebody wants to have a
55:07 - product manager for
55:09 - for um yeah
55:11 - for website um and also ux i mean i
55:16 - i do mockups for ui um
55:19 - but definitely
55:21 - not anywhere close to ux um
55:24 - but ux is super important for us for
55:28 - software development for mobile app for
55:30 - web application so anything any software
55:33 - that
55:34 - for a particular
55:36 - function you have to click
55:38 - 10 clicks in order to get to something
55:41 - it's it's really bad design so there's a
55:44 - lot of uh
55:46 - jobs out there with me people
55:49 - in ux
55:50 - uh experience like if you're
55:53 - you're very good at pinpointing these
55:56 - types of problems as you uh look at the
56:00 - the online application uh you're
56:02 - probably this is probably your area that
56:04 - you wanted to get into yeah yeah okay
56:08 - mary d'angelo really really quick one
56:10 - piece of advice
56:12 - one piece of advice is be confident
56:15 - no matter what you started
56:18 - what
56:19 - where you come from
56:21 - what your skills are
56:23 - be confident of who you are
56:25 - and show that in your interview yeah
56:29 - nice what about you marissa
56:31 - be yourself have fun
56:34 - uh
56:35 - you know
56:36 - the
56:37 - i want the kid to
56:39 - know that they can do what they want and
56:42 - and have that confident and have fun
56:44 - right yeah
56:46 - awesome and mine would be just to create
56:48 - your own experiences so
56:51 - thanks guys welcome back emily
56:53 - y'all i can't believe how fast this went
56:55 - by the questions in the audience were
56:57 - just so amazing um we will put some of
57:00 - your best advice in our follow-up email
57:03 - tomorrow i would like to ask all of our
57:05 - attendees to just grab your phone and
57:07 - tell us your thoughts um one thing i'll
57:09 - tell you is as a team we're planning
57:11 - more of these talks for 2022 and so if
57:14 - you have ideas for topics that you'd
57:15 - like to hear more about um put it in the
57:18 - survey tell us what you're interested in
57:20 - learning about and we will consider it
57:21 - for next year
57:23 - i want to also just cadence lilly
57:25 - marissa mary d'angelo like each of you
57:27 - had different experiences different
57:29 - journeys but the themes felt so similar
57:31 - and i feel like all of our attendees i'm
57:33 - hoping you took away some of these
57:35 - really concrete themes you know to
57:37 - believe in yourself to experiment to do
57:39 - research to consider different options
57:41 - not just the exact paths that everybody
57:43 - else is thinking about i also found your
57:46 - stories really inspiring um marissa i
57:48 - love that you continue to dance you know
57:50 - i love that you all shared a little bit
57:52 - about yourselves outside of work because
57:54 - we are all whole human beings that love
57:56 - tech and are interested in computer
57:58 - science but also have other interests
58:01 - and um this was just a delightful
58:02 - conversation and cadence thank you so
58:04 - much for bringing your moderation skills
58:06 - to us tonight and to all four of your

58:30 - watch maybe share it with your
58:31 - classmates or your colleagues
58:33 - and we will hope to catch you in 2022 at

Cleaned transcript:

introduce yourself and let us know a little bit about who you are and where you're from oh awesome rachel teaches compsci at a community college oh my god and you're a volunteer with the girls who code club we absolutely love to hear that thank you so much for volunteering hello roxanne studying cs in dc um for folks just joining we're gonna start in about a minute or two and we're just introducing ourselves in the chat so you can see who else is here participating in this session tonight oh my gosh hi michelle hello at ut austin oh my god cs majors hello alex hello losa we have compsci in business at usc it's so great to see so far we've got like every every coast i'm in chicago third coast hi jessie hi hello hello hi amanda hi tanya hi ayanna so great to have you all here ayanna i've seen your name before yeah girls who code alumni uh if you're an alum from girls to code programs feel free to tell us about that for everyone that just joined we are introducing ourselves in the chat we're going to start this panel in about 30 seconds to a minute i'm really excited to have you all here get settled grab a glass of water hi shreya yay hi bella hello everybody we have sip alums and an instructor from suny binghamton brianna hello hello lots of alyssa my colleague your colleague wrote i love seeing all these college loop members so glad to have a lot of our girls to code college loop folks here hello m hello elisa hi polak um thank you all so much for being here we know that your time is really valuable it is a busy time of year it is a thursday night i'm in chicago it is pitch black outside i'm sure it's the same for you unless you're in you know a better climate in which case congrats to you we are going to start our conversation tonight this is part of an ongoing webinar series called girls who code talks and this series came out of the pandemic and i have to say it is one of the silver linings of an otherwise very tragic and traumatic experience and the silver lining here is that we're able to bring you expert speakers from across the country and you are able to join us from literally all over the country and i think we have a couple of international folks here too which is amazing and this is something that we weren't able to do before the pandemic or may rather we were able to do but we didn't think to do and it has been just an incredible series uh we've had a number of different talks on different topics all year long this is our last one of 2021 so thank you uh for being here and jl great question yes this will be recorded we will send out the recording tomorrow um but to to kick it off just to introduce myself i'm emily heismos i'm the director of alumni programs at girls who code i've met a lot of you i see a lot of familiar names which is really incredible and i'm really excited about the topic tonight we are talking about getting a technical job that isn't engineering and i just want to say that's no shade on the engineers in the house if you end up an engineer at any point in your career that is amazing we support you that is part of our mission too but there are so many different technical roles in the industry and i think a lot of times when folks are new to this field you think like computer science engineer and you don't necessarily think about the full spectrum of options that are out there and that's what this is going to be a conversation about so with no further ado i'd like to invite cadence daniels to join me on stage cadence is our amazing moderator tonight and cadence is a senior ux which is user experience interaction designer we want to define our terms tonight at ge which is a girl suit code partner we are so happy that she is here to moderate this panel we've met earlier she has really big plans for you tonight and is you know pretty uh recently in this field herself and knows exactly what this transition is like um at ge she leads the growth of an inhouse design system and component library and cadence you can tell us what that means after two years as a software developer and ui designer so here again we've got moving between different fields exploring different roles and beyond her efforts to elevate inclusion entrepreneurship and community development cadence is a devoted advocate for everyday people through innovation of human interaction creativity and empowerment kings that is a great bio that is a really wonderful video i would love to turn the floor over to you and you can tell us more about what that means and bring on our other panelists absolutely hello everyone i'm so so so excited we can talk about the bio but in reality it's just a fancy way of saying my job is to advocate for everyday people so thinking like engineers thinking like pms thinking like the people that actually use the tools that we build that's what i do on a daytoday basis um and so i absolutely get where you guys are coming from and trying to navigate which of those functions you want to play a role in i get it i have had engineering roles i have had project management roles and so i completely understand and like emily said i'm not that far out i'm only four years into my career and so happy to sit here and mediate this conversation around all the different opportunities that you have um and i'm joined today with three amazing panelists we have lily mew who is our director of product management at transperfect we have mary d'angelo gutierrez who's the security consultant at accenture and marissa schmidt who is our senior director of product management at citrix i'm going to give them their own opportunity to introduce themselves and when you do so if we're going to talk about all the different career options we have we might as well take it from the beginning and when you introduce yourself i want you to tell me when you were a kid before college what did you want to be when you grew up and then tell me a little bit about what it is that you actually do now let's go lilly um hi i'm lily um well before i don't know i never really had a career path or very specific career that i wanted to pursue i guess in high school when i first started to have my first computer and that's how i had my interest in in learning more about computer getting into everything about a computer so when i went to college um i pursued a major in computer science um but i also learned that i really didn't enjoy programming that much so i ended up changing my major to information science and policy um it's um it's less programming i learned more about the internet um how to build website using frontend and backend uh technology like firm and as an html uh to code the uh what you actually see today and when you log into a web page that's who you see and the backend is basically the server that hosts the the website so all of that i have more interest in that so i changed my major to that um after i graduated um i had a little bit hard time finding a job right i'm not i wasn't a programmer which uh most of the jobs out there um they have software developer programmer and that's not what i enjoy to do so i look for everything like webmaster uh web designer that kind of keywords so yeah and then i took on different uh odd jobs um like anything that has web in its job description so i applied for them i ended up working at a law firm and then a film academy not expecting that it's it's very weird like i i only dedicate about 10 of my time doing web tasks um and finally i um i got a call from from my current company and they're looking for a localization engineer and at a time i didn't even know what localization is later i learned it's really just another word for translation you're translating content for a specific region and that process is called localization so i started off as a localization engineer and then i moved to being a solutions engineer the difference is really one localization is you more working for production and then solutions engineer it's uh you're working more clientfacing providing solution using the company's software so as i was working on both position i was involved with the initial product that my company had developed and i really and i wasn't really um handling the product as a product manager but i was um i was very interested in using the product gave a lot of feedback to our developers so slowly i sort of become unofficial product manager for the for the products so i finally i'll tell my my managers that i wanted to focus on managing the product because i see a lot of areas where i can spend more my my time and focus on um so i turn myself into a fulltime product manager after all the engineering tasks so here i am i'm going to ask you more about what it means to be a product manager but there are many times that we get stuck in unofficial roles and have to actually ask to be in them officially so i get it what about you marie d'angelo so good evening good afternoon everyone so when i was a kid i wanted to be a fashion designer um yeah little did i know when i was um i was eight years old they i grew up in peru so they have these first computers those big ones grayish uh beige and i love them because they follow my instructions [Laughter] and that's when i became in love with computers nice so fashion designer now it's a hobby i go window shopping i love to learn about the latest and evers but computers were all started to become my first love after that i moved to the u.s and english wasn't my first language i had to learn the language and i guess the easiest classes for me were math so it was easier for me to do the math because you don't require a specific language it's just universal numbers and then after that i went to a community college i found the passion for computer science for my first job was as a tutor master or computer science tutor and that's when i learned to enjoy working with people right after that i moved to college i went to rochester institute of technology and there i went for computer science i believe that i wanted to have a strong technology background in order in order to see a lot of opportunities however the project the the degree requires a year of internship scopes and and i've entered in different companies and what i learned is that coding wasn't my passion anymore but it was uh the organization of everything um how this uh how testing worked um how software engineers work what was the what was the link between them what was missing between them how can you organize it in a way that it it works seamlessly and right after i i graduated actually two weeks after i joined accenture i've been at accenture for five years and i've worked as a security analyst cyber security analyst that's how i started i i love it because i wear many hats in consulting i'm able to do some project management so technology stuff assessments for different companies in different industries and i've i'm an ass um i i weren't learning anything that has to do with cyber security yeah nice i like that you talked about even though you wanted to be a fashion designer it's still a hobby right all the interests we have time don't go away they just have different roles in our lives so marissa what was it for you well when i was a kid all you did is watch the small tvs that show uh um either an actress or a singer or a dancer i wanted to be i wanted to dance i do love dancing yeah uh so i that was when i was still really young in um in the philippines and then uh we moved here in the bay area when i was young um and uh i wanted to get my radio working and it would not work so i took the radio apart put it back together and and see if you know uh how i can fix it and that and that to me was interesting uh taking things apart and so when when i uh went to high school and i was told to do something in a computer and i did the same thing i took the i opened the computer and figured out what's in there and i'm trying to figure out how to get the c prompt and all those things so so that was interesting to me so then my counselor says you know you like math you should do uh engineering that's how i went to computer engineering at cal poly and um but i still like dancing so throughout you know i took the dance classes i you know hiphop dancing you know i grew up from oakland right so i want videos i want videos um yeah so so that is um so so even though i went to cal poly um in computer engineering i continued that that hobby of dancing and now i do you gem dancing while here but i went to the back to silicon valley um after college and i did do the going into the lab really getting into the details of how the whole networking infrastructure work how we create this cl uh cloud computing all these different things and and so yeah so that was a passion to me because it was again putting things together uh taking it apart um and making the internet work right um in one of the demos i was uh it was told to go in front of the customer and present on the product and that day i realized wow this thing is fun like showcasing the product uh you know besides telling what the product is and so forth and so that was so interesting to me and at the point where i got to know the product manager and and then after a few years uh working with the product manager and he's telling me how i should create this product and i said why do you think we should create that so i started to question all the things that he's asking so then one day because i said i really like the being in front of the customer i said i want to do your job and then the the gm the general manager at that time said i think you could i think it's a great um segway for you because you do like being in front of the customer so i did so i went to product management and uh i've been product management ever since and it's talking in front of customer about the technology i still have to be geeky and get technical with with with uh all of them and you have to but now in my uh ways of of speaking and i i traveled to 25 countries since then and and pretty much spoken in in in all different events from russia to korea to japan you name it um yeah uh talking about the product and i love it and i still do dancing so nice awesome i think the one thing i heard in all of your introductions is that before you even knew what opportunities were there there were certain skills that you had that other people saw and said okay they're going to be awesome in this other role summers i'm actually going to come back to you and ask the first question which is before we even get into depth about what those different jobs and roles are what were the skills that you just saw were so important to have in tough regardless of whether or not you're an engineer ah very good question question cadence um definitely the ability to establish rapport with the people that you're you're um they're talking to and just having that soft skills man i didn't know and trained that and i didn't when i was taking computer classes no one told me that i should be a great speaker uh or or just being able to speak to your to your colleagues and and explain something in whiteboards and things like that i did not know that i should be learning how to do powerpoint for goodness sake right uh soft skills definitely key and and really having that eye to eye connection with the engineer is actually very important and and and being in front of those customers no matter what job you take whether it's marketing product management whatever roles that uh comes that ability to communicate and and really establish that relationship across to all your different teams is critical yeah nice and elia i remember you were talking about when you were really really early fresh out of college you were looking at those different jobs and roles what sorts of skills did you see then that were kind of common across and and you even still see now that you think whether or not you're an engineer this is a core skill to have in the tech world um i would say soft skills is definitely a lot important than hardcore skills i mean i learned a lot of technical skills on my own through school but you'll find that a lot of these skills don't really aren't that used i mean it's not useful hundred percent i think a communication be able to communicate effectively and also ask questions um when you start out in a new company i think asking questions learn um communicate with colleagues definitely helps to get your um yourself started okay nice um mary dance i'm gonna ask you the next question which is a lot of the people in this audience are in school right now and so they're trying to figure out okay what skills do i have and for a college student the best association for a new job is their major and so for people that are maybe similar to you in which they like all the technical stuff but maybe you don't want to be the ones executing it what sorts of majors um do you recommend for them or or how can they they translate a major that they're currently in into a nonengineering role that's a great question so i'm gonna give you a little background i have my sister she major in biology and i have convinced her for years i tried to convince her her skills are wonderful for the technical role she works in a nonprofit job where she deals with communities she deals with different issues and what i would say is no matter what degree you are in when you become a problem solver you will apply it to anything that comes to mind uh that is the biggest uh skill that you should have besides communication which is top number one i couldn't agree more with maurice and lily is problem solving skills because uh sometimes the problems can be even in terminology companies can be even as easy as emotional problems within the team and you need to be able to really understand okay why are people feeling why is it not being done this way how can we improve that um and if you have i it is more comfortable when you have a science background to move into the technical background so find your passion have um do what you really enjoy doing in college but besides that build yourself skills uh the best classes weren't the ones that were the technical as lydia mentioned where marisa mentioned where uh joining the leadership institute from my school working being part of groups starting my own club with my best friend we started a salsa dancing club and that showed me how to start something how to build a foundation how to um how to create relationships so that we can find someone that teaches it you will use those skills every day in your life yeah john yeah marissa i saw that you answered a question um in the chat and i actually think i want you to answer it for everyone so the question was do you think a cs major is necessary for the product management role um and then i also want to ask the the second part of that which is if that's not necessary what other majors may help for that role good question and i i tried to answer um in one of them is the so it depends on the company and the product that you're getting into uh usually in silicon valley especially at google facebook you name it you do need to have that engineering major where there's computer science i'm computer engineering so i could be both hardware and software so i wasn't tied to one thing so that helped me to actually be more broad so i was able to apply in different companies so it depends what uh but you know you don't have to do the computer programming apps outside of the college but having the engineering degree gives you more credibility in front of those engineers because you're telling them what to do product management is the owner of that product uh you know my in my company i own 80 of the product uh from a business perspective that's over 400 million right yeah so it's critical when that they have to listen uh you need to at least know and speak their language um and so yeah it's tough classes but at the end of the day you don't need to be a computer programmer but just finish an engineering degree whatever it is okay um lily i said i was going to come back to you with this question while we're talking about product managers can you help us differentiate product management versus project management versus program management to somebody not in tech those all mean the exact same thing well i think that these well program manager and project manager might mean different things in different companies in my company um project manager for production team they manages all of the the jobs are coming from clients scheduled um scheduled tasks for engineering work for translation for translator like they have to set timeline so that kind of things so it's not very technical at all we have a program manager program manager uh it's more for communication with a client um help them uh understand what their what their needs are in terms of getting getting their their products or their software uh translated and what is the scope what solutions we have um from our company uh like what technology we have in order to provide them uh the kind of solutions and the program manager are also they don't need to be technical but they do need to know uh the the software how it functions what functionalities are in there uh so that they can uh communicate to the client uh if there is anything that's too technical like for example if our clients is uh very technical and they ask certain questions that the program manager cannot answer then they they will contact um either product manager for more information or if product manager like myself cannot answer the question i go to our developers uh to find out more information um yeah so product manager for me i um the product that i'm managing is more technical than some of the other ones i know some my colleagues they don't have engineering background and there are managing some of the products as well so managing being a product manager doesn't always have to have engineering background but like marissa said it really helps a lot because when you communicate to uh developers especially you can define the requirements better you speak their language right so um you're not just uh putting your users requirement their words uh as uh the um requests to the developers i mean some developer has more understanding of what you're asking but sometimes they they don't always ask enough question back to you to define things more specifically and what would end up happening is the software gets developed and the functionality don't really meet the requirement of the user because of the the miscommunication so um so i mentioned communication is very important it's in not just in product management but in all areas right so um yeah so i guess um do you need a software engineering background i would say it helps and if you want to be a product manager you definitely should learn even if you don't have a degree in engineering but you um you do need to expect yourself to learn because uh if you don't uh keep up with the skills and knowledge uh you're not going to be successful yeah it's a combination of having literacy of engineering in general plus being able to be a planner plus kind of having that like sales aspect of being able to work with the people who are actually putting the money behind your project and who are deciding what kind of things they want the product to do in the future um and i will talk a little bit more about what it looks like to actually get these roles right like the interview process how do you navigate salaries and stuff like that but mary angelo i want to give you an opportunity to talk about your role as well um there's a couple questions that came in so one can you just explain to us what a tech consultant is because when i was in college consulting just sounded like answering questions if you look up the rule definition um but what is it actually and then on your daytoday what does it look like so consultants are people that solve and define problems for our clients that's how i can resume that an undefined meaning because when we get our client tells us this is the problem and 95 of the time it turns out that the problem is not that one but it's something else and understanding the entire perspective from the business eye as well as the technical side is very important when we start in in consulting first you are analyst and your job is to understand the culture of the consulting company to learn as many skills as you can um certificate so you get trained depending on the company that you are in and then you can specialize in a particular service option or you can diverse for example uh i started as an identity and access management analyst it means every time you log in in your system uh we put the middleware in between um that platform and authenticating you verifying that who you are and where you are and so on and so forth and after that i also learned about security policy which is more of the standards of more like a law degree a small law degree then i also work in application security that's more handson technology and i'm currently in data loss prevention meaning a company should store their data in such a way that if there is a hack that forbids they are able to retrieve that data immediately and solve the problem as soon as possible but there are many steps into that and many companies forget about that and they apply it at the end so uh usually is a as a security consultant it's it is very difficult to sell a business person that security is important but it's but when the hacks happen and you don't know when it happened yeah now we have allnighters and a lot of work to do right exactly that makes sense okay so boom we've gotten everybody's scope we know what everybody does on their day to day but we are only four people in a massive industry um outside of what you guys do what are the actual other opportunities that are in this field that are not um not necessarily engineering roles but just what else is out there maurice i know you talked about this a little bit for someone's question but how would you describe the entire scope of the options that are in tech okay i i can do it um so as a product so in tech uh it's a big silicon valley over here right uh usually it starts with the product yeah that product has um you know there's the engineering side which i know um is a is an option but um not the only option after the product is about to go launch you can have product marketing technical marketing field engineering they're the one hanging out talking to the customer daytoday you can have do field marketing marketing that product in a specific region uh or market in in other regions uh lo lilly was talking about localization you can have uh field marketing for japan for example which is different from uh the ones that are in korea so they have different field marketing the different regions uh there's manufacturing supply chain all these different folks that's that works in my building uh that all supports the product uh they're not necessarily have to be technical like me with engineering but they support my product they're the one creating the web web designs and the website doing that collateral data sheets uh for my product and and they put all of the blogs the the webinars all this different planning for the products so many many different ways but based on a product in silicon valley or if you're at google facebook is similar thing and you'll need marketing you need uh field sales all those things does that help yeah i think so it's kind of like in these different pillars right so you have the people that are like the strategic thinkers you have the the product managers the program managers project managers and then this isn't about engineering per se but you have different engineering functions everything's not coding there are people that manage security there are people that manage making sure that everything stays up and doesn't shut down there are people that manage the front end side that the users do there are people that manage the back end which is all the data and where things are stored and then there's there's the designers and even within designers there are different types of functions right there's the people that manage research and testing there's the people that manage um the ui of it which is kind of like an advanced version of graphic design and there's the people that do experience that are pretty much like behavioral psychologists in a way um and then there's even the people that manage you know like when we talk about infrastructure the testing of the of the product and all of that at first glance that sounds very overwhelming because it's going to be hard to find an article that shows you this massive map of what all your opportunities are right and a lot of this stuff you have to work your way up to it nobody is going to get a director of product management position right out of undergrad it's just not gonna happen unless you did undergrad after you know halfway through your career and so um lily i think i'll ask you this question is for the larger scope what are the actual entry level jobs that our students may be seeing or which ones are the easiest to kind of get started and prepare for now with the with engineering background or without engineering background let's talk about without without engineering background in the technology industry um i think let me try to think um well my company is a translation company it wasn't a technology company um to start with uh initially uh chance perfect well i started uh with translation.com so um the company started as a sister company for chance perfect um it specializes in um translating websites for different companies we used to use other companies technology so we well it cost a lot of money to pay for our company to use their software so what we ended up doing is we um hire our own group of developers and build our own tools um so my experience is a little bit different i start off with a localization engineer i know that not all of my colleagues have engineering background so through trainings and um from the from the experienced colleagues it is doable even though it had the title has engineer it's not as scary uh as software engineer that you have to know how to code and it's it's not technical but it definitely requires um i guess a mindset to solve problems all right so um localization engine i think one of the the question uh someone had asked uh about that um so the company uh has to process a lot of different source file in order to get that translated so that process requires the engineer to know different uh different file formats um and you like office files are the most common ones that majority people know and then there are also the the website uh file formats like html php now it's more json file uh json files uh xml files these are the most common types of files so i think um localization engineer is is a good one it does require some engineering learning as you serve maybe a project manager would be a good start i know someone who has been working as a project manager for years and then she she learned how uh to use uh our products and she uh she's more familiar with the product and she wanted to be a product manager after a few years of working with product uh in fact there's some mike not on my team but someone else that i know um she worked as a localization engineer and then she um she move on to being a qa quality assurance of the products so she has more exposure with the products and then now she's also a product manager so it's all about um learning a new tool new learning about the uh the applications whether it's a mobile application web application or desktop application so anything that you use on your computer your mobile app if you have interested on it do some research just just google um like product management software development they just have some basic idea what it is and then you know like uh if you do interview at least you're you're not completely clueless of what it is right um yeah yeah nice um married angela what would you say are some of the entrylevel roles that people can kind of start getting looking at or things that they may expect to see either titles that they could be comfortable feeling like they could actually get into out of graduation sure i would say a great way to see what you want is that many companies many companies that are not necessarily tech companies so broader your horizons think about okay you want to work in a fashion design brand or you want to work for a bank many of these companies have programs specific for entrylevel students that they rotate you through different positions and they hire people from uh from physics degrees psychology degrees uh really i work with many many of them some of them get hired during the inter process some of them get higher and right before school you graduate before school so my suggestion is always go to the career fairs during your last year before graduation apply for as many jobs as possible because those programs are directly targeted for that they start some of them start as early as july and then october october maximum november if you go to conferences and so on and so forth but that's the time frame uh yeah i think without um flying i i interviewed for about a hundred companies so i brought down well i learned what i wanted how what it meant to interview how what culture i like what culture i didn't like what was my expectation how to make my expectations and how to have a broader perspective i chose consulting because i never i get bored easily so i want to try different things but there are other opportunities consulting is not the other only one is just about being informed following the trends in recruiting your career department is the most useful always make your best friend out of them it doesn't matter what your your degree is i would say go for it um don't only target the tech companies because you know those are going to be they are looking for a specific stereotype uh so besides those look somewhere else yeah they will they will impress you yeah you just told my entire career story and you didn't even know it so story time um when i was a junior in undergrad i was involved in the national society of black engineers who has a very large national convention every year just like many other collegiate and academic organizations at that career fair the strongest interview i had was with ge general electric i was hired as an intern for the summer between my junior and senior year as an internship for ge's rotational program end of the internship these this is the thing that's really nice about rotational programs because you end the internship and then they offer you the job for after graduation and so when i graduated i had a degree in what our school it had a different name but it was basically a human computer interaction and design program which i saw somebody in the chat talk about the gang gang um and i also had a minor in cs because i was one of those people where i was like i'm going to work in tech don't really want to do coding but i don't want it to be a fallback because it's not seen on my resume somewhere and so i got it as a minor entered into this rotational program where i moved every six months and tried out different functions right there's a there's they'll put you in a design role that puts you in an engineering world they'll put you in different types of management roles and last year's when i finished that program and entered into a different design role at ge ge is not a tech company don't let anybody convince you otherwise ge is an industrial company that does tech and just like lily what you were talking about is there are plenty of companies out there that have tech jobs so you do not have to go after the googles and the microsoft's and the apples um there are tech jobs everywhere because what we talk about as tech today is something that is globally needed and it's always going to be right the skills may change but it's always going to be in demand um and so for me and i'll i'll just kind of touch on this a little bit because we don't have any other designers here i knew that i wanted to go into design because like i said i just i really care about everyday people i really care about what we call business to consumer products that are directly to people and so for the people out there that are questioning whether design is right for them let me break down a couple of things for you because this field can be confusing when people talk about ux they're talking about user experience and they're talking about ui they're talking about user interface the difference um if someone who specializes in in ux specializes in the overall experience that any user has in a product so it's a mix of how they feel about the product how easily they can get their tasks done when you get um when it's time for you to get your grades back from a teacher how quickly can you log in check your grade and go handle your feelings if that takes 10 minutes it's probably not a good user experience if it takes 30 seconds you might be doing something right the product might be doing something right user interface people that specialize in that are probably visual designers so they specialize in making sure the buttons are gorgeous and that the layout is on point in a way that the user can very easily scan the information and get to what they need to do people enter the ux field because remember ux involves the interface right the entire experience also includes what it looks like people enter that field from all over from engineering from product management from roles that have nothing to do with tech because it is just about your ability to advocate for a user right it's not about um it's not the same as market research right where you're trying to sell somebody something no these users are coming here to do something they probably don't have a choice um and so when you're thinking about whether or not this this field is right for you or you know that it's what you want to do and you're trying to figure out how to get there what you'll hear the most is that the most important thing to get you an interview in this field is being able to communicate your design process right so having a portfolio online that has examples of your projects and how you think through the design thinking process which google that later how you think about iterations how you take what our product managers here will provide you as a new feature okay the user needs to be able to do this thing in our tool now and then how you translate that into what the actual visual and technical experience is going to look like is really important to have documented somewhere because this field is different than other ones in that this is a field where you have to have something that speaks on its own in order to make it through the interview process right um and so there are a couple questions out there about ux if you have more just throw them in there and i'll try to answer them either through our discussion or on my own um but where that does bring us is i do want to talk at least one person answer a question about the interview process so let's say we have our students out there that are they know what they want to do they have everything with their degree set up the way that's going to get them recognized marissa how does someone prepare for the different types of interviews that might come up for tech roles and how do they navigate salaries like all of that good question um uh for tech technical interviews definitely you do need to know the basics uh even just i know you're not gonna do programming things like that it depends what roles you're applying for but look at the requirements of the job description and they'll tell you actually this is a plus you need to know c c plus plus python whatever it is if those are required you probably should make sure you at least know and open your your um or your notes on this area because that will probably be in the interview so most of the time anything that requires um uh in the in that job description they tell you exactly what you need if you if you need some information for amazon how do you set something up in amazon or azure google cloud those are our important things to at least highlight and understand those before the interviews so very very good one to know and then um so that's for any technical interviews understanding and what you should also do is check out who your interviewer is go check him i know it's like stalking but you know in linkedin they have their profile there get them who they are yeah okay so um we only have a couple minutes left and so i want to provide the students with one last piece of advice so just really quick round robin what is the one piece of advice you would give to someone in this position of trying to look for a role being in school and wanting to see what opportunities are not necessarily engineering lily what would you say um well i think uh i mean if you want to get into the tech industry you probably have some idea what you want to do right so based on that do some research to see what kind of jobs are out there product manager it's very broad for uh like marissa said it could be hardware it could be software so if it's a software that you're you want to get into there's also um software that's not that that's not requiring a very technical background so um if that's what you want to do um just look for those and just check out different uh industry not necessarily the the big uh to name uh tech companies right so even your local um company that you know of um check to see if they have any job offer uh maybe some somebody wants to have a product manager for for um yeah for website um and also ux i mean i i do mockups for ui um but definitely not anywhere close to ux um but ux is super important for us for software development for mobile app for web application so anything any software that for a particular function you have
