01:03 - for doing this with us and certainly
01:05 - send up a flare if you have to excuse
01:07 - your stuff during this time and another
01:10 - fun fact about our panelists they are
01:12 - both first-generation college graduates
01:15 - who elected to go into academia to make
01:18 - the college transition and experience
01:20 - smoother for future students so we're
01:23 - really really grateful to have their
01:24 - perspectives but Before we jump in I
01:27 - want to be sure to manage expectations
01:29 - we know that you all have urgent
01:32 - personal specific questions about your
01:35 - situations heading into college
01:36 - internships or the job market we cannot
01:40 - answer each of your individual questions
01:42 - tonight and we wouldn't presume to know
01:44 - what's best for you or your family but
01:47 - we do hope to give you some perspectives
01:49 - from experts some questions to think
01:51 - about and a reminder that you are not
01:54 - alone in making these decisions there
01:56 - are hundreds of other young women like
01:58 - you on this call and so with that we're
02:02 - gonna start the evening off with an
02:03 - icebreaker that will require you to
02:05 - reminisce on the best days of your
02:07 - undergraduate career so our question is
02:10 - what may your college experience worth
02:13 - while for those of you who are loved
02:16 - we will be asking you to participate in
02:18 - polls throughout this webinar so for now
02:20 - join us and share your answer to the
02:22 - Icebreaker if you're currently in
02:24 - college what is making your experience
02:26 - worthwhile okay
02:36 - Marielle are actually going to start
02:37 - with you what made your college
02:39 - experience worthwhile hello everyone and
02:42 - thank you for the introduction and the
02:44 - fun facts so I broke down community when
02:49 - you mention the icebreaker because I
02:52 - think everyone puts like such a huge
02:55 - emphasis on like what your dreams are
02:57 - gonna be when you go to college but I
02:58 - think what made it worthwhile for me
03:00 - were all the different communities that
03:02 - I was able to be a part of right and it
03:04 - wasn't just like okay I love you know
03:08 - creating TV episodes so I'm gonna stick
03:11 - with the TV Club it was also like no I'm
03:14 - gonna study abroad I'm gonna join this
03:16 - club I'm gonna join a sorority I'm gonna
03:18 - try this and different things so I think
03:20 - what made it worthwhile was being able
03:23 - to broaden kind of this social
03:26 - interaction and allow myself the
03:29 - opportunity to interact with different
03:31 - communities that I wouldn't have thought
03:34 - of in high school but College gave me
03:35 - the opportunity to so branch out thank
03:39 - you so much Mariela and then difficult
03:40 - for me Derrick when you think back and
03:43 - reminisce what comes to mind oh goodness
03:46 - what comes to mind first off thank you
03:48 - all for having me today I'm very excited
03:50 - to be here um what comes to mind about
03:53 - my college experience I guess really
03:54 - kind of stems from really the experience
03:57 - as a whole right I think that there's so
03:59 - much learning that happens inside of the
04:02 - classroom which is awesome but there's
04:04 - also so much learning that occurs
04:06 - outside of the classroom it's really I
04:09 - think kind of the combination of those
04:10 - two things that really made my college
04:13 - experience amazing I learned you know
04:18 - just as much outside of the classroom
04:19 - and in some cases even more about life
04:22 - about how to go along with people about
04:24 - how to really be
04:26 - a person for others during my college
04:30 - experience and so I look back very
04:33 - fondly on my college days and partially
04:37 - that's why I still work because I like
04:40 - you know being around students kind of
04:45 - development process I love that thank
04:49 - you so much and for sure I can say that
04:52 - what I learned outside of classes was
04:55 - probably even more valuable than what I
04:57 - learned in classes and you're not
04:58 - supposed to say that but in fact you
04:59 - learned how to actually interact with
05:00 - people and frankly people from different
05:03 - cultures and you know just so much I
05:05 - think that you know I was a Poli Sci
05:07 - major and actually running for student
05:09 - government I learned more political
05:11 - science that I did in class so that
05:13 - totally resonates all right with that I
05:16 - think I want to take a peek at our poll
05:18 - and see what folks said so most viewers
05:22 - selected personal development as their
05:24 - main answer'd followed by social
05:26 - gathering and then coursework and
05:28 - subject matter that's what's up
05:29 - you pretty much agreed with us in terms
05:32 - of what you thought was really valuable
05:34 - about the undergraduate experience okay
05:36 - thank you so much viewers for
05:38 - participating in the poll so now that
05:40 - we've broken the ice and are a little
05:42 - bit more acquainted we're gonna jump
05:43 - right into tonight's panel discussion so
05:47 - the questions that we're gonna ask are
05:49 - gonna address the concerns of girls who
05:51 - code college staged alumni and students
05:53 - across the country who are either
05:55 - beginning matriculating or ending their
05:57 - college experience let's start with the
06:00 - college admissions process so students
06:03 - entering into the collegiate space in
06:05 - the next two years or so will be
06:06 - venturing into the unknown a lot is
06:09 - going to change about the college
06:11 - application process making it very
06:13 - different from what students have
06:15 - actually prepared years for with schools
06:18 - converting to pass or fail grading
06:20 - systems and suspending standardized test
06:23 - requirements for incoming students what
06:25 - other selection criteria and data points
06:28 - do you think are important for students
06:30 - to share Derrick this is like right in
06:32 - your wheelhouse
06:33 - I'd love to start with you can you tell
06:35 - us what you think yeah absolutely so you
06:38 - know for me I think it's so and
06:39 - for folks to understand and recognize
06:42 - that the college admissions process
06:43 - really is a process right you know there
06:47 - is not a right or a wrong way really to
06:50 - go through the college admissions
06:51 - process and and you know I think so many
06:54 - folks get so kind of just caught up in
06:57 - you know the excitement of it which is
07:00 - exciting obviously they get caught up in
07:02 - in the fear of the unknown they don't
07:04 - know you know that there are real people
07:07 - on the other side of the desk that are
07:09 - actually reading those applications and
07:12 - really getting to know you as in the
07:13 - joint as a student and so I think the
07:15 - biggest thing that I can really give
07:17 - advice in terms of the college
07:18 - admissions process is to first off stay
07:21 - true to yourself make sure that you are
07:23 - really presenting yourself in such a way
07:25 - where the college can really get to know
07:27 - you as an individual outside of what's
07:29 - actually going to be listening on the
07:31 - transcript your high school transcript
07:33 - outside of any test scores that you
07:34 - might have you know really make sure
07:37 - that you are providing a great writing
07:40 - sample you are allowing us as admissions
07:43 - professionals to really get to know you
07:44 - in what it is that you are looking for
07:47 - and what you would actually bring to our
07:48 - college campus you know when you really
07:51 - think about kind of the pass/fail
07:52 - situation you think about standardized
07:54 - test scores knowing kind of the
07:56 - environment in which that we are in
07:57 - right now due to the coronavirus I think
08:00 - that it's important to know that all of
08:01 - us even s on the college side are also
08:04 - in the same boat as you are as well and
08:06 - so you know I think there's really going
08:08 - to be a lot of grace from a lot of
08:10 - colleges in terms of kind of the
08:12 - pass/fail situation and you know what
08:14 - your grades might look like during
08:16 - certain times of your transcript just
08:18 - because of the nature of where we are
08:21 - you know at this very moment in time I
08:24 - think the other thing to kind of keep in
08:26 - mind especially when it comes to test
08:27 - scores is that there really is a growing
08:29 - movement across the country for a
08:31 - different colleges and universities to
08:33 - go test optional so you know I work at
08:36 - Columbia College Chicago where in arts
08:38 - and media focus institution in Chicago
08:40 - and we've been test optional for as long
08:42 - as I can remember and there are now over
08:44 - 1,000 colleges and universities in the
08:47 - country that are test optional as well
08:50 - there's a really great website that I
08:51 - usually encourage you to look at in it's
08:53 - fair test org and fair test org you can
08:57 - actually see a list of different test
09:00 - optional colleges and really learn a
09:02 - little bit more about the test optional
09:04 - movement I think it's just so important
09:06 - to note that when it comes to testing
09:08 - obviously um you know it's something
09:11 - that you should do you should make sure
09:13 - that you're taking your a CPA or an SAT
09:14 - if you can but know that I think many
09:17 - colleges out there are really starting
09:19 - to understand that you know three hours
09:21 - of testing that you're doing on a
09:24 - Saturday does not negate four years of
09:27 - preparation and hard work that you've
09:30 - really put it into your high school
09:32 - career right and so it's just really
09:33 - important to know that testing is not
09:36 - the end all and be all you know I have a
09:38 - lot of challenges with text testing in
09:40 - my own way engines biases that are kind
09:43 - of located within testing in white
09:45 - mannequins so I think it's just really
09:46 - important to know that anything else
09:48 - that you can provide with your personal
09:50 - statement with a portfolio with whatever
09:52 - that might be can really be helpful in
09:54 - the college admissions process Derrick
09:58 - thank you so much that answer I know is
10:00 - probably causing a lot of our viewers
10:01 - right now to breathe a sigh of relief in
10:05 - that there is a movement where it's a
10:07 - much bigger picture than just a test
10:09 - score also what really resonated for me
10:11 - is what you said about grace the fact
10:13 - that we're all in this together right
10:14 - now and that everything looks really
10:16 - different and so this seems like the
10:18 - right time for a student also test you
10:19 - said to tell their story and their
10:21 - particular predicament and also what
10:23 - kind of defines them as they're trying
10:25 - to think about that opportunity so that
10:28 - is really hopeful Mariela I would love
10:30 - to hear from you and just get your
10:31 - thoughts on this topic yeah I was
10:35 - nodding throughout Derrick's entire
10:37 - answer because it's so true and I loved
10:40 - how he picked grace as the word to
10:42 - describe it because I think that we keep
10:46 - talking about like when's everything
10:47 - gonna go back to normal you know when's
10:48 - New York City off pause when such and
10:51 - such country like you know open again
10:53 - and I think that there's this tremendous
10:55 - opportunity for us to think about what
10:59 - comes next for us right because colleges
11:01 - right now are figuring out okay well
11:03 - you know before they would cap an online
11:06 - class at 40 students but then now
11:09 - certain colleges had to create online
11:11 - classes from 4,000 students right so I
11:13 - think it's forcing all of us to figure
11:16 - out different ways to get the
11:18 - information and to get to our next step
11:20 - so I think my biggest tip for college
11:23 - admissions right now whether you're high
11:26 - school you know freshman or a high
11:28 - school senior or let's say you're at a
11:31 - community college right now and you were
11:32 - thinking of transferring I think the
11:34 - best thing you can do right now is just
11:36 - research right so if you keep a college
11:40 - list I love Google Docs and Google
11:43 - sheets for this cuz I would always ask
11:45 - my students to share it with me so we
11:46 - can kind of correspond that way but keep
11:49 - a list what are the schools that you are
11:51 - thinking of applying for monitor their
11:52 - deadlines are they waving their fees so
11:55 - they have virtual you know like right
11:57 - now we're doing a great virtual exchange
11:59 - do they have one coming up join their
12:01 - mailing list right and make an account
12:04 - there are so many different things that
12:05 - we can do right now virtually and I
12:07 - think if we get organized and we
12:09 - research and we kind of you know pace
12:12 - ourselves through it we have this
12:14 - tremendous opportunity to figure out you
12:16 - know what comes next because the
12:18 - colleges are also figuring it out also
12:20 - right so I think I would definitely
12:23 - suggest so that all my high school
12:25 - students or even current college
12:27 - students that were thinking of
12:28 - transferring do your research right now
12:31 - you know don't be afraid to call the
12:33 - college and see if maybe they have an
12:35 - admissions rep that's working from home
12:37 - who's going to be willing to answer your
12:39 - questions right and I think Derek
12:42 - mentioned and he said real people and I
12:44 - think that's one thing that the kids
12:46 - excuse me I always see kids that
12:48 - students always forget is that there are
12:51 - real people reading your apps and if you
12:54 - give yourself the opportunity now to
12:55 - figure out like what Columbia College
12:58 - expects from you then we can plan that
13:01 - out you know you can have a conversation
13:02 - with a college counselor you can have a
13:04 - conversation with a somebody that you
13:07 - know that already went to college and
13:08 - figure out what story can I add to my
13:12 - application right what doesn't my
13:14 - application say yes
13:17 - got all seven DS my freshman year but
13:19 - then during this pandemic XY and Z
13:22 - happened and now like this is my focus
13:25 - right so don't be afraid to tell your
13:28 - journey to colleges about what happened
13:32 - during this pandemic so I think that's I
13:34 - absolutely agree with Derek and I think
13:36 - that would be the two things that I
13:38 - would add just research absolutely and
13:41 - pace yourself but we have plenty of time
13:44 - to plan out what we're gonna do so I
13:47 - think that's a that's what I would okay
13:51 - Mariela thank you so much what I loved
13:53 - about your answer so many things but I
13:55 - love it because it's about student
13:57 - agency and empowerment and that there is
14:01 - a way for students even in the midst of
14:02 - such a difficult time so I advocate for
14:05 - them exactly that's why I really really
14:07 - love about that answer and I hope that
14:08 - the folks that are listening feel a
14:10 - sense of that because it's very very
14:12 - inspiring so again thank you both for
14:16 - sharing our next question speaks to
14:18 - matriculating students who are confused
14:20 - and looking to make educated decisions
14:22 - around moving forward with their college
14:24 - careers so we did some digging and we
14:28 - found a survey by the ed tech company
14:31 - circled in where we saw about 70% of
14:34 - over a thousand student respondents said
14:36 - Colvin 19 will likely affect their
14:39 - financial situation and more than 25%
14:42 - said it'll affect their ultimate college
14:44 - choice related the Department of
14:47 - Education announced that Dhaka and
14:49 - international students would not be
14:51 - eligible for emergency aid from the
14:53 - cares Act so before we get more info
14:56 - from our panelists viewers we want to
14:59 - ask you will you be completing your
15:01 - FAFSA form for the fall this is gonna
15:05 - we're gonna give you about 30 seconds to
15:07 - respond while folks are kind of
15:10 - responding to that question Mariela and
15:13 - Derrick the next question we have for
15:15 - you is how will Colvin affect financial
15:18 - aid packages and should students still
15:21 - complete their FAFSA forms you know what
15:26 - would your thinking through your answers
15:29 - Mary Ellen Derrick I'll let
15:31 - you know how our viewers responded
15:32 - taking a quick look based on the foal
15:35 - the pole rather 75% of viewers said yes
15:38 - they would be completing their FAFSA
15:40 - forms and 24% of them saying no they
15:43 - won't
15:43 - so Mariela I want to start with you and
15:45 - viewers of course thank you so much for
15:47 - your candor it's really helpful when you
15:48 - give us a sense of where you're at with
15:50 - your thinking Mariela give us your
15:53 - thoughts on this this question yes so
15:56 - this question makes like my brain
15:58 - explode because financial aid is
16:00 - something that we've been trying to
16:02 - figure out from my students that are
16:06 - currently in college figuring out like
16:09 - okay well I'm no longer on campus does
16:11 - that mean I get you know my room and
16:13 - board reimbursed because I'm not
16:15 - physically there right and we all know
16:17 - that online classes have a set price and
16:19 - then room and board is a set price right
16:21 - and then for my high school seniors
16:24 - figuring out okay well my mom had XY and
16:28 - Z job and she was willing to give me XML
16:31 - so I can go to school but now we don't
16:34 - have that money anymore
16:35 - right or I had my job throughout high
16:38 - school and I would pay for my own
16:39 - MetroCard so I was going to commute to
16:42 - school so there are so many different
16:44 - factors and then even with the FAFSA one
16:47 - of the things that I've noticed is that
16:48 - financial aid is definitely going to be
16:50 - an even more extensive process because
16:54 - specifically with FAFSA it lets you use
16:55 - your taught your parents taxes or your
16:58 - guardians taxes from the previous year
17:01 - right so fast for house what they call
17:02 - the prior prior rule and so now I'm
17:06 - thinking about okay well a lot of people
17:08 - what are we up to now 22 million people
17:10 - are currently unemployed so it's one of
17:13 - those things where you're gonna fill out
17:15 - your FAFSA with your parent or guardians
17:17 - you know taxes but that income isn't
17:20 - reflective of what you're in current you
17:22 - know economic situation is and so one of
17:25 - the things that my colleagues and I have
17:26 - been trying to do is figure out well
17:28 - what do students need to do now with
17:30 - their parents in order to demonstrate
17:32 - this change in income right because for
17:36 - a lot of our students your financial aid
17:38 - is directly tied to your expected Family
17:41 - Contribution right and again a lot of
17:43 - these questions
17:44 - we have no idea what the answer is
17:47 - because FAFSA as an institution hasn't
17:50 - really said a lot about what's happening
17:52 - and even with like the IRS right we're
17:55 - supposed to file taxes and that got
17:56 - pushed back so we're wondering okay well
17:59 - does that mean that fastball will no
18:01 - longer open in October someone just
18:03 - asked what happens if you have a sibling
18:05 - in college
18:07 - so usually when you have a sibling in
18:09 - college it's I don't like saying easier
18:12 - but it is more kind of streamlined to
18:14 - fill out your FAFSA
18:15 - because you already have someone in
18:18 - college they're usually mirrors that but
18:21 - I think what it comes down to is we have
18:24 - to talk about money right and we have to
18:26 - ask questions and we can't be shameful
18:30 - about what happened to our parents
18:33 - employment to our employment or to our
18:35 - economic situation in general because
18:38 - then we're not gonna get it we're not
18:41 - gonna get anywhere that we keep talking
18:43 - about advocacy for financial aid we need
18:46 - to advocate even more and especially I
18:49 - have to throw a plug in there if you're
18:52 - 18 and up please register to vote
18:54 - because FAFSA is directly tied to our
18:59 - federal government and so we literally
19:01 - have politicians that are people who
19:03 - make decisions for you so please sign up
19:05 - register to vote but yes definitely
19:08 - start off by having a conversation with
19:10 - your parents if you're a high school if
19:13 - you're in high school and then if you're
19:15 - a college student right now I would say
19:18 - reach out to your financial aid
19:19 - counselor at your campus and see what
19:21 - their guidelines are because everything
19:24 - is rapidly changing right now and I
19:26 - think that unfortunately you might have
19:28 - to make a decision based on what's best
19:30 - for you and your family financially
19:32 - whereas before you know we were probably
19:36 - gonna go with what your dream school is
19:37 - and we might have to pause or find like
19:40 - another route to get there in the future
19:44 - Mariella thank you so much there's so
19:46 - much that you had in your answer and the
19:48 - thing that I think it really underscores
19:50 - too is that not only is it like changing
19:54 - on the financial aid front but it could
19:56 - be that from the time you
19:57 - even apply to the when you know your
20:01 - family situation could radically change
20:03 - and we've never seen the likes of this
20:06 - kind of uncertainty across so many
20:09 - people that I think a lot of you know
20:13 - the women on this call are probably
20:14 - thinking to themselves oh wow I need act
20:16 - with my counselor I just threw out
20:18 - what's going on how do I tell my story
20:20 - and Derek I think what you were
20:21 - literally about to climb into the screen
20:25 - mean with everything Mary Ellis said can
20:28 - you please add anything that you think
20:30 - Mariela didn't share or echo some of
20:31 - what resonated for you yeah Mary love
20:34 - herself is spot-on right I think one of
20:36 - the biggest things that resonated with
20:37 - me so much is to ask questions one of
20:40 - the things and I'm gonna speak as a
20:41 - first-generation college student I
20:43 - didn't know that I could go back to a
20:45 - college and see if I could get more
20:47 - money in order to help me College
20:49 - forward right right the people that have
20:51 - money tend to be the ones to know that
20:53 - they can go back and ask for money right
20:55 - and so if you're a student who is a
20:57 - first-generation college - you haven't
20:59 - gone through the process before make
21:01 - sure that you are asking your questions
21:04 - and someone likes how I talk with my
21:05 - hands thank you thank you so so that's
21:09 - number one I I want to do maybe if you
21:11 - don't mind just a little bit of
21:12 - education about kind of the FAFSA so
21:14 - just so everyone on the call knows asked
21:16 - us the Free Application for Federal
21:17 - Student Aid it is a form that you fill
21:20 - out to the federal government and the
21:22 - federal government comes up with what
21:24 - they call an EFC is your expected Family
21:27 - Contribution and that is what the
21:29 - government says that your family should
21:32 - be able to contribute to your education
21:34 - as a student and I always encourage
21:37 - every single student that I work with to
21:39 - file the FAFSA FAFSA FAFSA
21:42 - part of that is obviously there's
21:44 - federal aid and potentially some state
21:47 - aid that you might qualify for just by
21:50 - filing the FAFSA right federal loans as
21:53 - an example is something that you can
21:55 - qualify for it just by calling the FAFSA
21:57 - I'm the second thing that I want to say
21:58 - about that is that there are some
22:00 - colleges and universities out there that
22:02 - provide scholarships for you just by
22:04 - filing the FAFSA and this is where I
22:05 - have to do my little plug about Columbia
22:07 - College Chicago but we provide
22:09 - scholarships for students
22:10 - just by filing the FAFSA doesn't matter
22:12 - what your family's financial background
22:14 - is right so make sure that you take the
22:16 - time to go through that process because
22:18 - you never know if you're gonna be
22:19 - missing out on free money or again
22:22 - federal loans if you don't follow passes
22:24 - so that's thing number one second thing
22:26 - I want to mention is make sure if you
22:29 - are currently enrolled in college that
22:31 - you are talking to the college or the
22:33 - university that you're currently
22:34 - enrolled at again many colleges are
22:36 - giving out again refunds maybe for a
22:39 - room & board that was unused for the
22:41 - rest of the time so you want to make
22:43 - sure that you're getting that
22:44 - information you want to make sure that
22:46 - you are asking questions about the cares
22:47 - actually mentioned that earlier that's
22:49 - Mack the Congress pass to provide
22:51 - colleges with funding to be able to give
22:54 - some of that funding back to students
22:56 - for all of the challenges that you've
22:58 - kind of been dealing with right now so
23:00 - make sure that you are going through
23:02 - that process as well and working with
23:04 - the colleges that you're going to the
23:07 - third thing that I'm going to say is if
23:09 - you are a new student coming in make
23:12 - sure that you are also working with the
23:14 - colleges that you are looking to enroll
23:16 - in for the Fall there are many colleges
23:19 - that have a reevaluation of financial
23:21 - aid process so it kind of gets back to
23:23 - what Mariela was really saying about you
23:26 - know your taxes from two years ago it's
23:28 - what's influencing your financial aid
23:29 - package today which is kind of weird but
23:31 - it's it's the situation that we're in
23:33 - and so a lot of colleges have these
23:36 - reevaluation of financial aid or
23:39 - processes to allow you to say you know
23:41 - what I my parent lost a job or my
23:44 - guardian is really struggling right now
23:46 - how can we really kind of make this work
23:48 - and they're typically again as some sort
23:50 - of process that you can go through in
23:52 - order to appeal for additional financial
23:54 - aid so you know if you file the FAFSA if
23:57 - you ask questions if you talk to your
24:01 - especially if you're coming in to
24:02 - college talk to your admissions
24:03 - representatives we are here to really
24:05 - make sure that this process goes
24:07 - smoothly for you Derrick thank you so
24:11 - much so much education there in terms of
24:13 - what you shared and really really
24:15 - valuable for the folks that we're
24:16 - viewing right now so you know I think
24:20 - our last question before we get into the
24:21 - Q&A section we want to talk about
24:24 - next steps could potentially look like
24:26 - for soon-to-be graduates some
24:29 - conversations with our alumni show that
24:31 - there's a heightened sense of anxiety
24:32 - for graduating college students students
24:35 - who are once looking to enter the
24:36 - workforce or move into a postgraduate
24:38 - education opportunities are now thinking
24:41 - of taking a gap year using your
24:44 - experience as academic professionals how
24:47 - would you advise students in this
24:48 - predicament to proceed and Derek we can
24:52 - have you start that's a really really
24:56 - really great question I you know I I I
24:59 - can say that I relate in some ways to to
25:02 - that so I graduated from college in 2008
25:05 - and if anyone knows anything what
25:07 - happened in 2008 we had a big stock
25:10 - market crash and you know it was hard it
25:13 - was hard for folks who graduated in 2007
25:16 - 2008 2009 in order to find full-time
25:19 - employment and go through that process
25:21 - and so um you know I think that one of
25:24 - the things that I encouraged you to do
25:25 - is really to be open to any and all
25:28 - opportunities that might be available
25:29 - for you after you graduate from college
25:32 - right you know there are opportunities
25:35 - for internships there should still be
25:37 - some job opportunities out there I'm
25:39 - really interested you know obviously how
25:42 - the tech industry kind of changes you
25:45 - know knowing that we're relying a lot
25:46 - more on technology nowadays and so there
25:48 - may be some really interesting cool
25:50 - opportunities for many of you who are
25:52 - enrolled in a program that's more on the
25:56 - computer science side or you know at
25:58 - Columbia College Chicago we have a great
25:59 - game design program that's really tech
26:01 - heavy you're programming a program
26:03 - that's really tech heavy and so I think
26:05 - just keeping an open mind in terms of
26:07 - location you know where is it right that
26:09 - you might want to move once you graduate
26:11 - from college are there opportunities and
26:13 - some bigger tech hubs around the country
26:15 - that might be really great for you to
26:18 - kind of think about how can you maybe
26:20 - take some time off and maybe travel a
26:22 - little bit I think that you know I I
26:23 - believe that this time is really
26:25 - interesting because I think it's forcing
26:27 - this as a not just as a country here I
26:29 - know there's many viewers who are living
26:31 - in different parts of the world as well
26:33 - but I think it's a really interesting
26:35 - time for us to kind
26:36 - slow down a little bit and really kind
26:38 - of take some time to reflect on really
26:41 - how we want to build our lives as we
26:43 - move forward and so you know I think
26:45 - that you know as best as you can stay
26:48 - focus on whatever that ultimate goal is
26:50 - for you again whether that is entering
26:52 - that workforce whether that is going to
26:55 - grad school once you graduate you know a
26:56 - lot of colleges and universities are
26:58 - going to be looking I think for more
27:00 - students to enroll in grad school at
27:02 - this point in time and so that could be
27:04 - an option for you to really think about
27:06 - so you know just I think it's a perfect
27:09 - time just to kind of reflect and to
27:11 - really think about what's important for
27:13 - you as a human being in your life and
27:16 - how you really want to move forward kind
27:18 - of through this and you know for me it
27:20 - was I was an education major in ecology
27:22 - so I ended up going into education once
27:25 - I graduated I was a substitute teacher
27:27 - on for a year after I graduated and you
27:30 - know it really allowed me to use the
27:32 - skill set that I learned in college
27:33 - obviously for my education program but I
27:36 - also went to a liberal arts college
27:37 - where they teach me critical thinking
27:39 - skills communication skills writing
27:41 - skills
27:42 - those things that are so important for
27:44 - you regardless of what industry it is
27:46 - that you go into after you graduate and
27:48 - so you know if you've got a really great
27:50 - solid well-rounded skillset I think that
27:53 - you're going to be successful and you're
27:55 - gonna find your way Derek thank you so
27:58 - much Mariela I would love to get your
28:00 - take on that question for the soon-to-be
28:02 - graduates okay yeah so what I wrote down
28:08 - on my notes as soon as you said that
28:10 - question was Glenn right I think that a
28:15 - gap year is an amazing opportunity if
28:18 - you planned it out right and if you have
28:20 - the resources that you're going to need
28:22 - if it's it's kind of this
28:24 - well-thought-out plan and some of them
28:26 - someone said does a gap year make it
28:28 - easier or harder and I want to mention
28:31 - that because you don't choose to go on a
28:34 - gap year because it's easier right if
28:37 - you're choosing to go on a gap year it's
28:39 - because you've already thought of okay
28:41 - I'm gonna try this to see if you know I
28:45 - want to study international policy in
28:48 - school so I'm gonna go on this guy
28:50 - year so I can travel to another country
28:53 - and you know use my skills learn new
28:58 - ones and see if this is something that I
29:00 - really want to do right because then
29:02 - that gap your experience I can bring it
29:04 - into now my grad school application my
29:07 - college application etc so I don't want
29:10 - you to look at things as okay well is it
29:12 - easier if I do it this way where it's
29:13 - gonna be harder don't make decisions
29:15 - like that we have to make decisions that
29:17 - are going to align with what your goals
29:20 - are and like the person that you want to
29:22 - be once you're done with that and I'm
29:25 - taking advantage of those things like I
29:27 - didn't have this kind of four year
29:29 - college path it actually took me six
29:32 - years to graduate from a bachelor's
29:35 - because I kept taking breaks in-between
29:37 - right and mainly one of the reasons was
29:40 - because I was financially supporting my
29:42 - family but the other reason was I got to
29:45 - travel with my school so I've been to
29:47 - Australia I've been to my native
29:49 - Dominican Republic I've traveled all
29:51 - over the United States literally doing
29:53 - education workshops and things like that
29:55 - and all of that continuously led me
29:59 - towards a career in education right it
30:01 - wasn't kind of this easy way but it
30:04 - taught me a lot about myself and you
30:06 - know it aligned with what my future
30:08 - goals were going to be so please don't
30:10 - make decision based on if it's gonna be
30:12 - easier if it's gonna be hard I think you
30:14 - should plan it out and then base your
30:16 - decision on is this plan going to work
30:20 - it does this plan aligned with what I
30:21 - want for my future and Derek mentioned
30:25 - the technology aspect there are people
30:28 - working from home right now that a year
30:32 - ago would have never thought that they
30:35 - can be sitting in their living room
30:36 - still producing the same outcomes that
30:40 - they were having in the office right so
30:42 - when we talk about opportunity and
30:44 - advocacy again a remote internship
30:47 - that's like unheard of
30:49 - but companies and colleges made it
30:52 - happen because they needed to adapt to
30:54 - the times right and that's the same
30:56 - thing that you have to do kind of adapt
30:59 - to it but I think you also get to
31:01 - reinvent it and figure things out
31:04 - for yourself and then the last thing I
31:07 - think is the mental health part I saw
31:10 - this meme going around on Instagram that
31:12 - talked about you know if you're not
31:14 - productive during this time you lack
31:15 - discipline and I'm like okay we're gonna
31:19 - put a sticky note on that because one
31:23 - don't let anyone shame you if you're not
31:25 - being productive reach and to you know
31:28 - like don't don't do that - don't believe
31:30 - everything you see on the Internet's
31:32 - because that'll just make you feel
31:33 - inadequate every single time I think
31:36 - that one of the things you can do during
31:38 - this time is pay attention to your
31:40 - mental health there are a lot of apps
31:42 - right now then they're not paying me to
31:45 - advertise but headspace isn't giving 30
31:48 - to like 60 days free there's another one
31:51 - called breath work and it's just like
31:53 - very like simple kind of entry level
31:56 - like meditation things for you to do
31:58 - because it's a really you know roller
32:02 - coaster of a time for our emotions so I
32:05 - think definitely pay attention to your
32:07 - mental health cuz it'll give you the
32:09 - clarity for you to figure everything
32:11 - else out - so can I have like one more
32:15 - thing what you're saying I think there
32:19 - are two two other things I want to add I
32:20 - think one is there I think there's a
32:22 - really awesome opportunity to freelance
32:24 - I know that sounds really weird but I
32:26 - think that there's I think we office our
32:28 - skill sets right that we can't really
32:30 - provide to the world and so thinking
32:32 - about how can you okay maybe I can't
32:34 - find a job at a particular organization
32:36 - that I really want to work for how can I
32:38 - make that opportunity for myself right
32:40 - so thinking about freelance how you can
32:41 - do that second thing I would say is
32:43 - really hone in on your creativity skills
32:45 - right I think one of the things that is
32:48 - so important for folks to understand and
32:50 - for folks to know I'm LinkedIn did a
32:51 - study probably about a month ago and
32:54 - what they did is they went through all
32:56 - of the different job descriptions that
32:57 - are listed out on LinkedIn right in the
33:00 - number one skill set that companies and
33:02 - organizations are looking for nowadays
33:04 - is creativity okay and so as much as you
33:09 - can really make sure that you are honing
33:11 - in on your creativity you know how to
33:12 - think critically
33:13 - again the writing skills the
33:14 - communication skills those things are
33:16 - going to be
33:17 - so crucial for you as you navigate the
33:19 - workforce throughout the rest of your
33:21 - career right you know we are trying to
33:23 - prepare you for careers that don't even
33:25 - exist nowadays yeah that creativity
33:27 - piece is just so incredibly important
33:29 - for you all and you know I think tech
33:33 - schools obviously I think can provide a
33:35 - lot of that creativity but you know III
33:37 - personally am so biased towards liberal
33:39 - arts institutions because that's where I
33:41 - went that's what I know and so like that
33:43 - liberal arts core really teaching you
33:47 - how to think critically and being
33:48 - creative I think are so important for
33:50 - folks think about you and now I will
33:52 - stop talking no that was great no thank
33:57 - you both I'm glad you kind of naturally
33:59 - got there because my question you gave
34:01 - such wonderful answers just sort of you
34:04 - know soon-to-be graduates what's
34:06 - happening what does a gap year look like
34:08 - we're at a time where like what gap here
34:10 - what does that mean when you can't get
34:12 - on a plane when you can't go anywhere
34:14 - and when you're not sure what you can do
34:16 - so I love that you talked about
34:18 - potentially virtual internships you
34:20 - talked about freelancing you talked
34:22 - about honing your skills even in the in
34:24 - your home because I think we kind of
34:27 - have to think outside the box because so
34:29 - many of us are in the same spot and
34:31 - everyone is scrambling and thinking so
34:33 - thank you for sharing both what I would
34:35 - call traditional concrete ways to plan
34:38 - and sync that never gets stale that are
34:41 - always applicable but also kind of
34:43 - making note of the time we're in and how
34:45 - we have to ask our students to act
34:47 - differently so really really appreciate
34:49 - that and with that we're gonna move over
34:51 - actually to take some questions from our
34:55 - viewers and so that's the end of the
34:57 - panel part of it we've selected
34:59 - questions from our girls of quote alumni
35:01 - who are viewing this conversation and
35:04 - we'd like to further would like further
35:05 - guidance around navigating the college
35:07 - experience during this pandemic we're
35:10 - gonna ask our panelists to answer two
35:13 - questions individually and one together
35:15 - okay the first question comes from
35:17 - Juliet Shepherd and is for Mariela what
35:22 - are the best ways for high school
35:23 - students to effectively move forward and
35:25 - not lose ground over the months to come
35:27 - as they look to prepare for college
35:29 - do you have any
35:30 - specific tools practices resources or
35:32 - just milestones that students should be
35:34 - thinking about yes so I love using the
35:37 - word milestones when it comes to this
35:40 - like the college application process
35:41 - because there is literally something
35:44 - that you can do down the road whether
35:46 - you're in 9th 10th 11th middle school
35:48 - etc so one of the things that I love is
35:51 - on college board people well the
35:54 - majority of students will know it
35:56 - because they apply for to take the SAT
35:59 - there but College Board has an
36:01 - incredible amount of like checklists and
36:05 - different resources so I always point my
36:08 - students towards college board has a
36:12 - college access checklist but I grade so
36:15 - if you go onto the College Board website
36:17 - college board and you go into resources
36:21 - they actually have a checklist where
36:23 - it's like a ninth-grade checklist a
36:24 - tenth-grade checklist and it basically
36:26 - gives you like different things that you
36:28 - should be doing during that time so what
36:30 - I would suggest is kind of right now you
36:33 - have to counsel yourself right because
36:36 - it's very easy to walk into your
36:39 - counselors you know office and have this
36:41 - face-to-face conversation but now like I
36:43 - have to ask if it's okay for me to like
36:45 - Skype or write or make an appointment
36:47 - right so I think one of the best things
36:50 - you can do again going back to advocacy
36:52 - going back to planning going back to
36:55 - research is to look at what are things
36:58 - you can do on your own for the process
37:01 - and I think one of the best things you
37:03 - can do is look at the checklist research
37:06 - what you want to do and start making a
37:08 - list so that's what I would suggest that
37:11 - you do because even if you do have a
37:13 - question as a counselor it'll be a lot
37:16 - easier for me to advise you if you
37:19 - already have an idea if you come to me
37:22 - and you're like MS I don't know what to
37:23 - do okay but you don't know what to do
37:25 - about what like you know is there like
37:29 - you don't know what to do about the fact
37:31 - that like you can't go outside you don't
37:33 - know what to do about the fact that you
37:34 - wanted to apply to Columbia College and
37:36 - now you know you missed their deadline
37:39 - let's call them and see if they you know
37:42 - you're still taking a half with
37:44 - patience we are still taking
37:45 - applications true lady a college in
37:50 - Chicago is accepting apps quite quick
37:53 - question about that cuz I do that right
37:55 - now
37:55 - do you have you noticed that colleges
37:57 - have reopened or their time lines have
37:59 - changed 20% across the board so if you
38:02 - miss that opportunity to get your app in
38:04 - that you should actually check on
38:06 - whether or not they're taking you yes
38:08 - absolutely and they are waiving fees so
38:13 - there isn't like a universal list and
38:16 - unfortunately even though it would be
38:17 - awesome if we just had like this Google
38:20 - Doc of you know all the colleges but you
38:22 - just have to go directly on their
38:24 - website and they've been a couple of
38:26 - colleges that we've called ourselves and
38:29 - they've given us the information over
38:31 - the phone so I think it's as simple as
38:33 - you looking up you know Columbia College
38:37 - Admissions Office and then they either
38:40 - are gonna have their contact info or
38:42 - they'll have a banner at the top that'll
38:44 - say do to covet like here's our process
38:46 - now yeah and I mean one of them one of
38:50 - the lists that's coming out just so you
38:52 - all do you know there is a list through
38:53 - the National Association for college
38:56 - admission counseling it's not AK in a
38:58 - CAC their website is not AK net dot org
39:03 - which is kind of a rear website but
39:05 - shortly after May 1 they will be putting
39:08 - out a list where they collect
39:09 - information from different colleges in
39:11 - terms of theirs if they're still taking
39:12 - applications and going through that
39:14 - process so so that is at least a 1 list
39:17 - that I know of that will be coming up
39:19 - because I just filled out that
39:20 - information
39:20 - earlier this week so yeah so so that is
39:23 - something that you all can hashtag
39:25 - rolling admissions Mariola
39:30 - thank you so much and Derek thank you
39:32 - for just providing that little bit of
39:33 - tidbit about extra information there so
39:36 - our next question is for derek from
39:40 - katie couric with the new grading
39:43 - systems and lack of knowledge around how
39:45 - grades will be integrated do you have
39:47 - any recommendations for students who
39:49 - were strongly considering going to
39:51 - college internationally that's a really
39:54 - good question so um so here is my
39:57 - biggest recommendation and honestly it
39:59 - kind of goes back to one of the things
40:00 - that I said earlier is because we are
40:02 - all in the same boat I think you're
40:07 - gonna really again see some grace and
40:08 - see some flexibility with grades and
40:10 - with that process kind of as we move
40:12 - forward I'm probably over the course of
40:14 - the next several years when it comes to
40:16 - college admissions the biggest thing
40:18 - again the Mariella really said is get to
40:20 - know and call your admissions
40:21 - representative and I I typed that out as
40:23 - well again you know these colleges these
40:26 - universities there are people like me
40:27 - who are there to help you navigate the
40:31 - process right and so if you are someone
40:33 - who's really looking at going to college
40:34 - abroad you really want to check with
40:37 - those colleges about their processes
40:38 - their procedures I'm get a sense of how
40:41 - they might evaluate your transcript
40:43 - Helmuth how they might evaluate your
40:45 - application I think the second thing
40:47 - though that really makes International
40:48 - Admissions really interesting is
40:50 - typically in at least you know when
40:52 - students are coming from other countries
40:55 - into the United States you have to get a
40:57 - student visa in order to study here in
41:00 - the United States and many colleges
41:01 - you're gonna have something or excuse me
41:03 - many countries are going to have
41:04 - something similar to that and so it
41:06 - really also believes you to really check
41:09 - with the State Department in the
41:11 - particular countries in which that you
41:13 - are looking at to see what that visa
41:15 - process really looks like you know
41:18 - that's one of the things that you know
41:19 - with today's political climate that we
41:22 - are in who knows what kind of visas the
41:25 - US government is going to be granting to
41:27 - international students to actually be
41:29 - able to study here in the States and so
41:31 - you really want to you know if you're
41:32 - looking to go to England or you know you
41:35 - want to go to Nigeria you want to go to
41:37 - Japan whatever that might be you really
41:39 - want to check with those countries in
41:40 - their State Department's and really try
41:42 - to get a sense of how that process works
41:44 - and how that process might have shifted
41:47 - here over the course of the last month
41:49 - and a half since we well month and a
41:52 - half obviously here in Chicago but you
41:54 - know around the world you know since as
41:55 - early as November you really want to
41:57 - check with countries and in really get a
41:59 - sense of what those processes and
42:01 - procedures look like Derrick thank you
42:04 - so much we are down to I believe what is
42:07 - our last question and it's for both of
42:08 - you and we can start with Mariela
42:11 - working at home is harder than if I was
42:14 - on campus
42:15 - are there any supports or resources that
42:17 - all schools are providing to help
42:19 - students in similar situations I'm sorry
42:23 - can you say that one more time
42:24 - I caught the last bit of it I'm sorry oh
42:26 - no worries
42:28 - working at home is harder than if I was
42:30 - on campus
42:31 - are there any supports or resources that
42:34 - all schools are providing to help
42:36 - students in similar situations
42:38 - yes so particularly for me I know that
42:43 - for New York City the Department of
42:45 - Education one of the things that I
42:48 - talking about the interactions I've had
42:50 - with my colleagues is we've done a lot
42:52 - of like tutorials and a lot of like
42:55 - virtual one-on-one meetings and virtual
42:58 - check-ins but I want to put a sticky
43:01 - note on that really quick I want to
43:03 - remind all of the students that are on
43:05 - to this that the majority of you group
43:09 - up with the internet and you know how to
43:13 - do things on it that myself and Derrick
43:17 - and anyone else I don't know what talk
43:20 - is right I don't know I downloaded the
43:25 - tic-tock app and I just watch the videos
43:27 - cuz I don't even know where to start
43:30 - right now if you want me to make you a
43:33 - PowerPoint um on it a thousand percent
43:36 - right but you ladies and gentlemen
43:40 - you're not looking at powerpoints right
43:42 - you're literally sharing information on
43:44 - a video app right so I think it's it's
43:47 - always interesting when I've been asked
43:50 - this question before and I'm like you
43:54 - guys should be teaching us because I'm
43:56 - over here trying to figure out how I can
43:59 - do a college office tik-tok about you
44:03 - know what rolling admissions and what
44:05 - the FAFSA means so I think it's
44:07 - interesting because as working
44:09 - professionals and working from home and
44:11 - people that consistently have like this
44:14 - direct student service we're always
44:16 - trying to figure out ways to connect
44:17 - with you and that usually means no me
44:23 - technology and being up to date with Ted
44:25 - and I used to think I was pretty hip but
44:28 - then I'm like okay I'm I don't even
44:30 - think they use the word shape anymore so
44:33 - one of the things that we started doing
44:34 - is actually hosting circles and asking
44:38 - the students what's the best way for
44:40 - that they think is is um for them to
44:43 - receive information and I think what
44:46 - that's creating is again this creative
44:49 - way for students to pitch how they can
44:54 - learn right cuz one of the things I was
44:57 - telling them is like I need you to learn
44:59 - this stuff anyways I just have to figure
45:01 - out how you're going to learn it so for
45:04 - example one of the students asked me if
45:06 - I can
45:07 - whatsapp them instead for me in my head
45:12 - I'm used to okay let me send you a Zune
45:14 - link let's do a google hangout and
45:16 - they're like oh can I whatsapp you I was
45:18 - like oh I guess that would be easier
45:21 - right because we always have our phone
45:24 - and I'm already home because we're
45:26 - quarantine so it's very odd because I
45:28 - would I would flip that question on its
45:31 - head and just say like as did this kind
45:34 - of generation Z population you have the
45:37 - ability to transform so many things for
45:42 - us like I'm pretty sure that you know
45:46 - Tariq I don't know how old your daughter
45:47 - is but I'm pretty sure she could teach
45:49 - you something about technology that
45:51 - would probably take Derek and I a couple
45:55 - Google searches they like make all
45:57 - manner of videos they're like a YouTube
45:59 - channel and like what are you saying
46:01 - right and people get paid to do this
46:04 - like Derek mentioned freelancing like
46:07 - people will literally pay you to set up
46:10 - a YouTube account for their brand or
46:13 - their organization like schools will
46:16 - literally like pay you to do these
46:18 - things companies will literally pay to
46:19 - do these things so I would ask everyone
46:22 - that's logged on right now to think
46:25 - about their unique skill set and so
46:27 - think about all the people that are
46:28 - working from home right now and how like
46:32 - what a big part technology is playing
46:35 - and what can you add to the conversation
46:38 - how
46:39 - you and reinvent or upgrade or make it
46:43 - more effective how we're currently
46:44 - communicating right there's like a
46:46 - hundred and something of us on this chat
46:50 - someone had to send out all the
46:52 - invitations to coordinate this right and
46:54 - someone got paid to do it
46:56 - and look how fantastic she did because
46:59 - it worked we're here we have the polls
47:03 - going we have the questions going so
47:05 - it's like one of those things that it's
47:07 - like the sky is really the limit like
47:10 - absolutely we're in a pandemic and it
47:12 - has so many emotions but there are so
47:14 - many resources in so many different ways
47:16 - that this can go about but going back to
47:20 - the question one of the things that
47:22 - we've done is community circles but we
47:25 - try to pick a different topic every day
47:27 - that doesn't necessarily relate to our
47:30 - productivity so for example last week we
47:34 - did in essential oils like community
47:39 - circle where the students and the staff
47:41 - and everyone that was working from home
47:43 - and chiming in learned about how you can
47:45 - use lavender oil to de-stress and there
47:49 - was one it was one of those things that
47:51 - it was beautiful because it's like we're
47:53 - not just logging on to take attendance
47:54 - and for someone to micromanage us that
47:57 - we are not done but now that like we
48:00 - actually care about other aspects
48:02 - holistically from ourselves but yeah man
48:06 - it's a have that conversation with your
48:09 - friends on with each other because it's
48:11 - such a beautiful silver lining right now
48:14 - like it's just amazing like look at us
48:17 - right now it's about to be a p.m. ya
48:21 - know isn't that amazing it is and I love
48:25 - what you're saying because again similar
48:27 - to how you in question earlier the
48:30 - empowerment the idea that you know the
48:33 - way the question was posed is that it's
48:34 - harder for students and we don't want to
48:36 - negate that we know that this is turning
48:38 - our typical learning on its head but
48:40 - what I liked about how you inserted is
48:42 - that there is empowerment to be found
48:43 - even when we feel like the resources
48:46 - aren't in front of us or something is
48:48 - not happening I think you're again sort
48:50 - of saying wait let's be strengths
48:52 - and situation how do I turn it around or
48:57 - think about it differently during almost
48:59 - that time do you want to jump in with a
49:01 - quick thing before we wrap up yeah um
49:04 - the one thing that I just wanted to
49:05 - mention is that most colleges and
49:07 - universities do have a career center of
49:09 - some sort and that is a great resource
49:11 - for you all to really use as you're
49:13 - navigating again going into the
49:15 - workforce you're starting to navigate
49:17 - how do you work from home how does this
49:18 - process really work what technology is
49:21 - good to use you know how do i structure
49:23 - my day in such a way that I can still
49:25 - stay focused and get what I need to get
49:26 - done I'm so utilize the Career Services
49:29 - centers that you have at your colleges
49:31 - universities because they provide some
49:34 - really great I think resources for you
49:36 - all and they're learning - right now as
49:39 - we kind of navigate I'm kind of this
49:41 - this situation and then the second thing
49:43 - I would say is find a really great
49:44 - mentor you know if you have people older
49:47 - cousins friends other folks who are in
49:49 - the workforce and you know there they
49:52 - are also navigating this time right now
49:53 - reach out to those folks and you know
49:56 - make sure that you're staying in
49:57 - communication with them I'm the one
49:59 - thing that I am going to do in the chat
50:01 - box is I'm gonna put both my Twitter
50:03 - account a my eat because I am young
50:05 - enough to use Twitter's I do know how to
50:06 - do that one put my Twitter account in my
50:10 - email address in the chat box and I am
50:12 - literally I really am like available and
50:16 - happy to be a resource for folks as you
50:18 - navigate the process and if I don't have
50:22 - answers for you I have a lot of friends
50:24 - in college admissions all across the
50:25 - country and so like you know I can
50:28 - easily connect you with some other folks
50:31 - I don't get back to you you know - too
50:34 - too soon please be patient I supervise a
50:37 - team of 40 and things are kind of crazy

Cleaned transcript:

I am very pleased to introduce Derek Brinkley Derek is the assistant vice president of undergraduate admissions at Columbia College and he helped launch this amazing twoyear program designed for lowincome firstgeneration college students at Loyola University in Chicago and in terms of what Derek enjoys doing outside of his work he likes spending time with friends scuba diving and doing Crossfit I'm also very very pleased to introduce Mariela regalado and Mariela is a college access consultant and receives the Daily News hometown hero an education award for the work she has accomplished in college access and in terms of free time Mariela enjoys writing about her multidimensional experience through poetry and prose traveling abroad and spending time with her Yorkie Lola another fun fact about Mariela is that she's actually 38 weeks pregnant so thank you Mary Alice so much for doing this with us and certainly send up a flare if you have to excuse your stuff during this time and another fun fact about our panelists they are both firstgeneration college graduates who elected to go into academia to make the college transition and experience smoother for future students so we're really really grateful to have their perspectives but Before we jump in I want to be sure to manage expectations we know that you all have urgent personal specific questions about your situations heading into college internships or the job market we cannot answer each of your individual questions tonight and we wouldn't presume to know what's best for you or your family but we do hope to give you some perspectives from experts some questions to think about and a reminder that you are not alone in making these decisions there are hundreds of other young women like you on this call and so with that we're gonna start the evening off with an icebreaker that will require you to reminisce on the best days of your undergraduate career so our question is what may your college experience worth while for those of you who are loved we will be asking you to participate in polls throughout this webinar so for now join us and share your answer to the Icebreaker if you're currently in college what is making your experience worthwhile okay Marielle are actually going to start with you what made your college experience worthwhile hello everyone and thank you for the introduction and the fun facts so I broke down community when you mention the icebreaker because I think everyone puts like such a huge emphasis on like what your dreams are gonna be when you go to college but I think what made it worthwhile for me were all the different communities that I was able to be a part of right and it wasn't just like okay I love you know creating TV episodes so I'm gonna stick with the TV Club it was also like no I'm gonna study abroad I'm gonna join this club I'm gonna join a sorority I'm gonna try this and different things so I think what made it worthwhile was being able to broaden kind of this social interaction and allow myself the opportunity to interact with different communities that I wouldn't have thought of in high school but College gave me the opportunity to so branch out thank you so much Mariela and then difficult for me Derrick when you think back and reminisce what comes to mind oh goodness what comes to mind first off thank you all for having me today I'm very excited to be here um what comes to mind about my college experience I guess really kind of stems from really the experience as a whole right I think that there's so much learning that happens inside of the classroom which is awesome but there's also so much learning that occurs outside of the classroom it's really I think kind of the combination of those two things that really made my college experience amazing I learned you know just as much outside of the classroom and in some cases even more about life about how to go along with people about how to really be a person for others during my college experience and so I look back very fondly on my college days and partially that's why I still work because I like you know being around students kind of development process I love that thank you so much and for sure I can say that what I learned outside of classes was probably even more valuable than what I learned in classes and you're not supposed to say that but in fact you learned how to actually interact with people and frankly people from different cultures and you know just so much I think that you know I was a Poli Sci major and actually running for student government I learned more political science that I did in class so that totally resonates all right with that I think I want to take a peek at our poll and see what folks said so most viewers selected personal development as their main answer'd followed by social gathering and then coursework and subject matter that's what's up you pretty much agreed with us in terms of what you thought was really valuable about the undergraduate experience okay thank you so much viewers for participating in the poll so now that we've broken the ice and are a little bit more acquainted we're gonna jump right into tonight's panel discussion so the questions that we're gonna ask are gonna address the concerns of girls who code college staged alumni and students across the country who are either beginning matriculating or ending their college experience let's start with the college admissions process so students entering into the collegiate space in the next two years or so will be venturing into the unknown a lot is going to change about the college application process making it very different from what students have actually prepared years for with schools converting to pass or fail grading systems and suspending standardized test requirements for incoming students what other selection criteria and data points do you think are important for students to share Derrick this is like right in your wheelhouse I'd love to start with you can you tell us what you think yeah absolutely so you know for me I think it's so and for folks to understand and recognize that the college admissions process really is a process right you know there is not a right or a wrong way really to go through the college admissions process and and you know I think so many folks get so kind of just caught up in you know the excitement of it which is exciting obviously they get caught up in in the fear of the unknown they don't know you know that there are real people on the other side of the desk that are actually reading those applications and really getting to know you as in the joint as a student and so I think the biggest thing that I can really give advice in terms of the college admissions process is to first off stay true to yourself make sure that you are really presenting yourself in such a way where the college can really get to know you as an individual outside of what's actually going to be listening on the transcript your high school transcript outside of any test scores that you might have you know really make sure that you are providing a great writing sample you are allowing us as admissions professionals to really get to know you in what it is that you are looking for and what you would actually bring to our college campus you know when you really think about kind of the pass/fail situation you think about standardized test scores knowing kind of the environment in which that we are in right now due to the coronavirus I think that it's important to know that all of us even s on the college side are also in the same boat as you are as well and so you know I think there's really going to be a lot of grace from a lot of colleges in terms of kind of the pass/fail situation and you know what your grades might look like during certain times of your transcript just because of the nature of where we are you know at this very moment in time I think the other thing to kind of keep in mind especially when it comes to test scores is that there really is a growing movement across the country for a different colleges and universities to go test optional so you know I work at Columbia College Chicago where in arts and media focus institution in Chicago and we've been test optional for as long as I can remember and there are now over 1,000 colleges and universities in the country that are test optional as well there's a really great website that I usually encourage you to look at in it's fair test org and fair test org you can actually see a list of different test optional colleges and really learn a little bit more about the test optional movement I think it's just so important to note that when it comes to testing obviously um you know it's something that you should do you should make sure that you're taking your a CPA or an SAT if you can but know that I think many colleges out there are really starting to understand that you know three hours of testing that you're doing on a Saturday does not negate four years of preparation and hard work that you've really put it into your high school career right and so it's just really important to know that testing is not the end all and be all you know I have a lot of challenges with text testing in my own way engines biases that are kind of located within testing in white mannequins so I think it's just really important to know that anything else that you can provide with your personal statement with a portfolio with whatever that might be can really be helpful in the college admissions process Derrick thank you so much that answer I know is probably causing a lot of our viewers right now to breathe a sigh of relief in that there is a movement where it's a much bigger picture than just a test score also what really resonated for me is what you said about grace the fact that we're all in this together right now and that everything looks really different and so this seems like the right time for a student also test you said to tell their story and their particular predicament and also what kind of defines them as they're trying to think about that opportunity so that is really hopeful Mariela I would love to hear from you and just get your thoughts on this topic yeah I was nodding throughout Derrick's entire answer because it's so true and I loved how he picked grace as the word to describe it because I think that we keep talking about like when's everything gonna go back to normal you know when's New York City off pause when such and such country like you know open again and I think that there's this tremendous opportunity for us to think about what comes next for us right because colleges right now are figuring out okay well you know before they would cap an online class at 40 students but then now certain colleges had to create online classes from 4,000 students right so I think it's forcing all of us to figure out different ways to get the information and to get to our next step so I think my biggest tip for college admissions right now whether you're high school you know freshman or a high school senior or let's say you're at a community college right now and you were thinking of transferring I think the best thing you can do right now is just research right so if you keep a college list I love Google Docs and Google sheets for this cuz I would always ask my students to share it with me so we can kind of correspond that way but keep a list what are the schools that you are thinking of applying for monitor their deadlines are they waving their fees so they have virtual you know like right now we're doing a great virtual exchange do they have one coming up join their mailing list right and make an account there are so many different things that we can do right now virtually and I think if we get organized and we research and we kind of you know pace ourselves through it we have this tremendous opportunity to figure out you know what comes next because the colleges are also figuring it out also right so I think I would definitely suggest so that all my high school students or even current college students that were thinking of transferring do your research right now you know don't be afraid to call the college and see if maybe they have an admissions rep that's working from home who's going to be willing to answer your questions right and I think Derek mentioned and he said real people and I think that's one thing that the kids excuse me I always see kids that students always forget is that there are real people reading your apps and if you give yourself the opportunity now to figure out like what Columbia College expects from you then we can plan that out you know you can have a conversation with a college counselor you can have a conversation with a somebody that you know that already went to college and figure out what story can I add to my application right what doesn't my application say yes got all seven DS my freshman year but then during this pandemic XY and Z happened and now like this is my focus right so don't be afraid to tell your journey to colleges about what happened during this pandemic so I think that's I absolutely agree with Derek and I think that would be the two things that I would add just research absolutely and pace yourself but we have plenty of time to plan out what we're gonna do so I think that's a that's what I would okay Mariela thank you so much what I loved about your answer so many things but I love it because it's about student agency and empowerment and that there is a way for students even in the midst of such a difficult time so I advocate for them exactly that's why I really really love about that answer and I hope that the folks that are listening feel a sense of that because it's very very inspiring so again thank you both for sharing our next question speaks to matriculating students who are confused and looking to make educated decisions around moving forward with their college careers so we did some digging and we found a survey by the ed tech company circled in where we saw about 70% of over a thousand student respondents said Colvin 19 will likely affect their financial situation and more than 25% said it'll affect their ultimate college choice related the Department of Education announced that Dhaka and international students would not be eligible for emergency aid from the cares Act so before we get more info from our panelists viewers we want to ask you will you be completing your FAFSA form for the fall this is gonna we're gonna give you about 30 seconds to respond while folks are kind of responding to that question Mariela and Derrick the next question we have for you is how will Colvin affect financial aid packages and should students still complete their FAFSA forms you know what would your thinking through your answers Mary Ellen Derrick I'll let you know how our viewers responded taking a quick look based on the foal the pole rather 75% of viewers said yes they would be completing their FAFSA forms and 24% of them saying no they won't so Mariela I want to start with you and viewers of course thank you so much for your candor it's really helpful when you give us a sense of where you're at with your thinking Mariela give us your thoughts on this this question yes so this question makes like my brain explode because financial aid is something that we've been trying to figure out from my students that are currently in college figuring out like okay well I'm no longer on campus does that mean I get you know my room and board reimbursed because I'm not physically there right and we all know that online classes have a set price and then room and board is a set price right and then for my high school seniors figuring out okay well my mom had XY and Z job and she was willing to give me XML so I can go to school but now we don't have that money anymore right or I had my job throughout high school and I would pay for my own MetroCard so I was going to commute to school so there are so many different factors and then even with the FAFSA one of the things that I've noticed is that financial aid is definitely going to be an even more extensive process because specifically with FAFSA it lets you use your taught your parents taxes or your guardians taxes from the previous year right so fast for house what they call the prior prior rule and so now I'm thinking about okay well a lot of people what are we up to now 22 million people are currently unemployed so it's one of those things where you're gonna fill out your FAFSA with your parent or guardians you know taxes but that income isn't reflective of what you're in current you know economic situation is and so one of the things that my colleagues and I have been trying to do is figure out well what do students need to do now with their parents in order to demonstrate this change in income right because for a lot of our students your financial aid is directly tied to your expected Family Contribution right and again a lot of these questions we have no idea what the answer is because FAFSA as an institution hasn't really said a lot about what's happening and even with like the IRS right we're supposed to file taxes and that got pushed back so we're wondering okay well does that mean that fastball will no longer open in October someone just asked what happens if you have a sibling in college so usually when you have a sibling in college it's I don't like saying easier but it is more kind of streamlined to fill out your FAFSA because you already have someone in college they're usually mirrors that but I think what it comes down to is we have to talk about money right and we have to ask questions and we can't be shameful about what happened to our parents employment to our employment or to our economic situation in general because then we're not gonna get it we're not gonna get anywhere that we keep talking about advocacy for financial aid we need to advocate even more and especially I have to throw a plug in there if you're 18 and up please register to vote because FAFSA is directly tied to our federal government and so we literally have politicians that are people who make decisions for you so please sign up register to vote but yes definitely start off by having a conversation with your parents if you're a high school if you're in high school and then if you're a college student right now I would say reach out to your financial aid counselor at your campus and see what their guidelines are because everything is rapidly changing right now and I think that unfortunately you might have to make a decision based on what's best for you and your family financially whereas before you know we were probably gonna go with what your dream school is and we might have to pause or find like another route to get there in the future Mariella thank you so much there's so much that you had in your answer and the thing that I think it really underscores too is that not only is it like changing on the financial aid front but it could be that from the time you even apply to the when you know your family situation could radically change and we've never seen the likes of this kind of uncertainty across so many people that I think a lot of you know the women on this call are probably thinking to themselves oh wow I need act with my counselor I just threw out what's going on how do I tell my story and Derek I think what you were literally about to climb into the screen mean with everything Mary Ellis said can you please add anything that you think Mariela didn't share or echo some of what resonated for you yeah Mary love herself is spoton right I think one of the biggest things that resonated with me so much is to ask questions one of the things and I'm gonna speak as a firstgeneration college student I didn't know that I could go back to a college and see if I could get more money in order to help me College forward right right the people that have money tend to be the ones to know that they can go back and ask for money right and so if you're a student who is a firstgeneration college you haven't gone through the process before make sure that you are asking your questions and someone likes how I talk with my hands thank you thank you so so that's number one I I want to do maybe if you don't mind just a little bit of education about kind of the FAFSA so just so everyone on the call knows asked us the Free Application for Federal Student Aid it is a form that you fill out to the federal government and the federal government comes up with what they call an EFC is your expected Family Contribution and that is what the government says that your family should be able to contribute to your education as a student and I always encourage every single student that I work with to file the FAFSA FAFSA FAFSA part of that is obviously there's federal aid and potentially some state aid that you might qualify for just by filing the FAFSA right federal loans as an example is something that you can qualify for it just by calling the FAFSA I'm the second thing that I want to say about that is that there are some colleges and universities out there that provide scholarships for you just by filing the FAFSA and this is where I have to do my little plug about Columbia College Chicago but we provide scholarships for students just by filing the FAFSA doesn't matter what your family's financial background is right so make sure that you take the time to go through that process because you never know if you're gonna be missing out on free money or again federal loans if you don't follow passes so that's thing number one second thing I want to mention is make sure if you are currently enrolled in college that you are talking to the college or the university that you're currently enrolled at again many colleges are giving out again refunds maybe for a room & board that was unused for the rest of the time so you want to make sure that you're getting that information you want to make sure that you are asking questions about the cares actually mentioned that earlier that's Mack the Congress pass to provide colleges with funding to be able to give some of that funding back to students for all of the challenges that you've kind of been dealing with right now so make sure that you are going through that process as well and working with the colleges that you're going to the third thing that I'm going to say is if you are a new student coming in make sure that you are also working with the colleges that you are looking to enroll in for the Fall there are many colleges that have a reevaluation of financial aid process so it kind of gets back to what Mariela was really saying about you know your taxes from two years ago it's what's influencing your financial aid package today which is kind of weird but it's it's the situation that we're in and so a lot of colleges have these reevaluation of financial aid or processes to allow you to say you know what I my parent lost a job or my guardian is really struggling right now how can we really kind of make this work and they're typically again as some sort of process that you can go through in order to appeal for additional financial aid so you know if you file the FAFSA if you ask questions if you talk to your especially if you're coming in to college talk to your admissions representatives we are here to really make sure that this process goes smoothly for you Derrick thank you so much so much education there in terms of what you shared and really really valuable for the folks that we're viewing right now so you know I think our last question before we get into the Q&A section we want to talk about next steps could potentially look like for soontobe graduates some conversations with our alumni show that there's a heightened sense of anxiety for graduating college students students who are once looking to enter the workforce or move into a postgraduate education opportunities are now thinking of taking a gap year using your experience as academic professionals how would you advise students in this predicament to proceed and Derek we can have you start that's a really really really great question I you know I I I can say that I relate in some ways to to that so I graduated from college in 2008 and if anyone knows anything what happened in 2008 we had a big stock market crash and you know it was hard it was hard for folks who graduated in 2007 2008 2009 in order to find fulltime employment and go through that process and so um you know I think that one of the things that I encouraged you to do is really to be open to any and all opportunities that might be available for you after you graduate from college right you know there are opportunities for internships there should still be some job opportunities out there I'm really interested you know obviously how the tech industry kind of changes you know knowing that we're relying a lot more on technology nowadays and so there may be some really interesting cool opportunities for many of you who are enrolled in a program that's more on the computer science side or you know at Columbia College Chicago we have a great game design program that's really tech heavy you're programming a program that's really tech heavy and so I think just keeping an open mind in terms of location you know where is it right that you might want to move once you graduate from college are there opportunities and some bigger tech hubs around the country that might be really great for you to kind of think about how can you maybe take some time off and maybe travel a little bit I think that you know I I believe that this time is really interesting because I think it's forcing this as a not just as a country here I know there's many viewers who are living in different parts of the world as well but I think it's a really interesting time for us to kind slow down a little bit and really kind of take some time to reflect on really how we want to build our lives as we move forward and so you know I think that you know as best as you can stay focus on whatever that ultimate goal is for you again whether that is entering that workforce whether that is going to grad school once you graduate you know a lot of colleges and universities are going to be looking I think for more students to enroll in grad school at this point in time and so that could be an option for you to really think about so you know just I think it's a perfect time just to kind of reflect and to really think about what's important for you as a human being in your life and how you really want to move forward kind of through this and you know for me it was I was an education major in ecology so I ended up going into education once I graduated I was a substitute teacher on for a year after I graduated and you know it really allowed me to use the skill set that I learned in college obviously for my education program but I also went to a liberal arts college where they teach me critical thinking skills communication skills writing skills those things that are so important for you regardless of what industry it is that you go into after you graduate and so you know if you've got a really great solid wellrounded skillset I think that you're going to be successful and you're gonna find your way Derek thank you so much Mariela I would love to get your take on that question for the soontobe graduates okay yeah so what I wrote down on my notes as soon as you said that question was Glenn right I think that a gap year is an amazing opportunity if you planned it out right and if you have the resources that you're going to need if it's it's kind of this wellthoughtout plan and some of them someone said does a gap year make it easier or harder and I want to mention that because you don't choose to go on a gap year because it's easier right if you're choosing to go on a gap year it's because you've already thought of okay I'm gonna try this to see if you know I want to study international policy in school so I'm gonna go on this guy year so I can travel to another country and you know use my skills learn new ones and see if this is something that I really want to do right because then that gap your experience I can bring it into now my grad school application my college application etc so I don't want you to look at things as okay well is it easier if I do it this way where it's gonna be harder don't make decisions like that we have to make decisions that are going to align with what your goals are and like the person that you want to be once you're done with that and I'm taking advantage of those things like I didn't have this kind of four year college path it actually took me six years to graduate from a bachelor's because I kept taking breaks inbetween right and mainly one of the reasons was because I was financially supporting my family but the other reason was I got to travel with my school so I've been to Australia I've been to my native Dominican Republic I've traveled all over the United States literally doing education workshops and things like that and all of that continuously led me towards a career in education right it wasn't kind of this easy way but it taught me a lot about myself and you know it aligned with what my future goals were going to be so please don't make decision based on if it's gonna be easier if it's gonna be hard I think you should plan it out and then base your decision on is this plan going to work it does this plan aligned with what I want for my future and Derek mentioned the technology aspect there are people working from home right now that a year ago would have never thought that they can be sitting in their living room still producing the same outcomes that they were having in the office right so when we talk about opportunity and advocacy again a remote internship that's like unheard of but companies and colleges made it happen because they needed to adapt to the times right and that's the same thing that you have to do kind of adapt to it but I think you also get to reinvent it and figure things out for yourself and then the last thing I think is the mental health part I saw this meme going around on Instagram that talked about you know if you're not productive during this time you lack discipline and I'm like okay we're gonna put a sticky note on that because one don't let anyone shame you if you're not being productive reach and to you know like don't don't do that don't believe everything you see on the Internet's because that'll just make you feel inadequate every single time I think that one of the things you can do during this time is pay attention to your mental health there are a lot of apps right now then they're not paying me to advertise but headspace isn't giving 30 to like 60 days free there's another one called breath work and it's just like very like simple kind of entry level like meditation things for you to do because it's a really you know roller coaster of a time for our emotions so I think definitely pay attention to your mental health cuz it'll give you the clarity for you to figure everything else out so can I have like one more thing what you're saying I think there are two two other things I want to add I think one is there I think there's a really awesome opportunity to freelance I know that sounds really weird but I think that there's I think we office our skill sets right that we can't really provide to the world and so thinking about how can you okay maybe I can't find a job at a particular organization that I really want to work for how can I make that opportunity for myself right so thinking about freelance how you can do that second thing I would say is really hone in on your creativity skills right I think one of the things that is so important for folks to understand and for folks to know I'm LinkedIn did a study probably about a month ago and what they did is they went through all of the different job descriptions that are listed out on LinkedIn right in the number one skill set that companies and organizations are looking for nowadays is creativity okay and so as much as you can really make sure that you are honing in on your creativity you know how to think critically again the writing skills the communication skills those things are going to be so crucial for you as you navigate the workforce throughout the rest of your career right you know we are trying to prepare you for careers that don't even exist nowadays yeah that creativity piece is just so incredibly important for you all and you know I think tech schools obviously I think can provide a lot of that creativity but you know III personally am so biased towards liberal arts institutions because that's where I went that's what I know and so like that liberal arts core really teaching you how to think critically and being creative I think are so important for folks think about you and now I will stop talking no that was great no thank you both I'm glad you kind of naturally got there because my question you gave such wonderful answers just sort of you know soontobe graduates what's happening what does a gap year look like we're at a time where like what gap here what does that mean when you can't get on a plane when you can't go anywhere and when you're not sure what you can do so I love that you talked about potentially virtual internships you talked about freelancing you talked about honing your skills even in the in your home because I think we kind of have to think outside the box because so many of us are in the same spot and everyone is scrambling and thinking so thank you for sharing both what I would call traditional concrete ways to plan and sync that never gets stale that are always applicable but also kind of making note of the time we're in and how we have to ask our students to act differently so really really appreciate that and with that we're gonna move over actually to take some questions from our viewers and so that's the end of the panel part of it we've selected questions from our girls of quote alumni who are viewing this conversation and we'd like to further would like further guidance around navigating the college experience during this pandemic we're gonna ask our panelists to answer two questions individually and one together okay the first question comes from Juliet Shepherd and is for Mariela what are the best ways for high school students to effectively move forward and not lose ground over the months to come as they look to prepare for college do you have any specific tools practices resources or just milestones that students should be thinking about yes so I love using the word milestones when it comes to this like the college application process because there is literally something that you can do down the road whether you're in 9th 10th 11th middle school etc so one of the things that I love is on college board people well the majority of students will know it because they apply for to take the SAT there but College Board has an incredible amount of like checklists and different resources so I always point my students towards college board has a college access checklist but I grade so if you go onto the College Board website college board and you go into resources they actually have a checklist where it's like a ninthgrade checklist a tenthgrade checklist and it basically gives you like different things that you should be doing during that time so what I would suggest is kind of right now you have to counsel yourself right because it's very easy to walk into your counselors you know office and have this facetoface conversation but now like I have to ask if it's okay for me to like Skype or write or make an appointment right so I think one of the best things you can do again going back to advocacy going back to planning going back to research is to look at what are things you can do on your own for the process and I think one of the best things you can do is look at the checklist research what you want to do and start making a list so that's what I would suggest that you do because even if you do have a question as a counselor it'll be a lot easier for me to advise you if you already have an idea if you come to me and you're like MS I don't know what to do okay but you don't know what to do about what like you know is there like you don't know what to do about the fact that like you can't go outside you don't know what to do about the fact that you wanted to apply to Columbia College and now you know you missed their deadline let's call them and see if they you know you're still taking a half with patience we are still taking applications true lady a college in Chicago is accepting apps quite quick question about that cuz I do that right now do you have you noticed that colleges have reopened or their time lines have changed 20% across the board so if you miss that opportunity to get your app in that you should actually check on whether or not they're taking you yes absolutely and they are waiving fees so there isn't like a universal list and unfortunately even though it would be awesome if we just had like this Google Doc of you know all the colleges but you just have to go directly on their website and they've been a couple of colleges that we've called ourselves and they've given us the information over the phone so I think it's as simple as you looking up you know Columbia College Admissions Office and then they either are gonna have their contact info or they'll have a banner at the top that'll say do to covet like here's our process now yeah and I mean one of them one of the lists that's coming out just so you all do you know there is a list through the National Association for college admission counseling it's not AK in a CAC their website is not AK net dot org which is kind of a rear website but shortly after May 1 they will be putting out a list where they collect information from different colleges in terms of theirs if they're still taking applications and going through that process so so that is at least a 1 list that I know of that will be coming up because I just filled out that information earlier this week so yeah so so that is something that you all can hashtag rolling admissions Mariola thank you so much and Derek thank you for just providing that little bit of tidbit about extra information there so our next question is for derek from katie couric with the new grading systems and lack of knowledge around how grades will be integrated do you have any recommendations for students who were strongly considering going to college internationally that's a really good question so um so here is my biggest recommendation and honestly it kind of goes back to one of the things that I said earlier is because we are all in the same boat I think you're gonna really again see some grace and see some flexibility with grades and with that process kind of as we move forward I'm probably over the course of the next several years when it comes to college admissions the biggest thing again the Mariella really said is get to know and call your admissions representative and I I typed that out as well again you know these colleges these universities there are people like me who are there to help you navigate the process right and so if you are someone who's really looking at going to college abroad you really want to check with those colleges about their processes their procedures I'm get a sense of how they might evaluate your transcript Helmuth how they might evaluate your application I think the second thing though that really makes International Admissions really interesting is typically in at least you know when students are coming from other countries into the United States you have to get a student visa in order to study here in the United States and many colleges you're gonna have something or excuse me many countries are going to have something similar to that and so it really also believes you to really check with the State Department in the particular countries in which that you are looking at to see what that visa process really looks like you know that's one of the things that you know with today's political climate that we are in who knows what kind of visas the US government is going to be granting to international students to actually be able to study here in the States and so you really want to you know if you're looking to go to England or you know you want to go to Nigeria you want to go to Japan whatever that might be you really want to check with those countries in their State Department's and really try to get a sense of how that process works and how that process might have shifted here over the course of the last month and a half since we well month and a half obviously here in Chicago but you know around the world you know since as early as November you really want to check with countries and in really get a sense of what those processes and procedures look like Derrick thank you so much we are down to I believe what is our last question and it's for both of you and we can start with Mariela working at home is harder than if I was on campus are there any supports or resources that all schools are providing to help students in similar situations I'm sorry can you say that one more time I caught the last bit of it I'm sorry oh no worries working at home is harder than if I was on campus are there any supports or resources that all schools are providing to help students in similar situations yes so particularly for me I know that for New York City the Department of Education one of the things that I talking about the interactions I've had with my colleagues is we've done a lot of like tutorials and a lot of like virtual oneonone meetings and virtual checkins but I want to put a sticky note on that really quick I want to remind all of the students that are on to this that the majority of you group up with the internet and you know how to do things on it that myself and Derrick and anyone else I don't know what talk is right I don't know I downloaded the tictock app and I just watch the videos cuz I don't even know where to start right now if you want me to make you a PowerPoint um on it a thousand percent right but you ladies and gentlemen you're not looking at powerpoints right you're literally sharing information on a video app right so I think it's it's always interesting when I've been asked this question before and I'm like you guys should be teaching us because I'm over here trying to figure out how I can do a college office tiktok about you know what rolling admissions and what the FAFSA means so I think it's interesting because as working professionals and working from home and people that consistently have like this direct student service we're always trying to figure out ways to connect with you and that usually means no me technology and being up to date with Ted and I used to think I was pretty hip but then I'm like okay I'm I don't even think they use the word shape anymore so one of the things that we started doing is actually hosting circles and asking the students what's the best way for that they think is is um for them to receive information and I think what that's creating is again this creative way for students to pitch how they can learn right cuz one of the things I was telling them is like I need you to learn this stuff anyways I just have to figure out how you're going to learn it so for example one of the students asked me if I can whatsapp them instead for me in my head I'm used to okay let me send you a Zune link let's do a google hangout and they're like oh can I whatsapp you I was like oh I guess that would be easier right because we always have our phone and I'm already home because we're quarantine so it's very odd because I would I would flip that question on its head and just say like as did this kind of generation Z population you have the ability to transform so many things for us like I'm pretty sure that you know Tariq I don't know how old your daughter is but I'm pretty sure she could teach you something about technology that would probably take Derek and I a couple Google searches they like make all manner of videos they're like a YouTube channel and like what are you saying right and people get paid to do this like Derek mentioned freelancing like people will literally pay you to set up a YouTube account for their brand or their organization like schools will literally like pay you to do these things companies will literally pay to do these things so I would ask everyone that's logged on right now to think about their unique skill set and so think about all the people that are working from home right now and how like what a big part technology is playing and what can you add to the conversation how you and reinvent or upgrade or make it more effective how we're currently communicating right there's like a hundred and something of us on this chat someone had to send out all the invitations to coordinate this right and someone got paid to do it and look how fantastic she did because it worked we're here we have the polls going we have the questions going so it's like one of those things that it's like the sky is really the limit like absolutely we're in a pandemic and it has so many emotions but there are so many resources in so many different ways that this can go about but going back to the question one of the things that we've done is community circles but we try to pick a different topic every day that doesn't necessarily relate to our productivity so for example last week we did in essential oils like community circle where the students and the staff and everyone that was working from home and chiming in learned about how you can use lavender oil to destress and there was one it was one of those things that it was beautiful because it's like we're not just logging on to take attendance and for someone to micromanage us that we are not done but now that like we actually care about other aspects holistically from ourselves but yeah man it's a have that conversation with your friends on with each other because it's such a beautiful silver lining right now like it's just amazing like look at us right now it's about to be a p.m. ya know isn't that amazing it is and I love what you're saying because again similar to how you in question earlier the empowerment the idea that you know the way the question was posed is that it's harder for students and we don't want to negate that we know that this is turning our typical learning on its head but what I liked about how you inserted is that there is empowerment to be found even when we feel like the resources aren't in front of us or something is not happening I think you're again sort of saying wait let's be strengths and situation how do I turn it around or think about it differently during almost that time do you want to jump in with a quick thing before we wrap up yeah um the one thing that I just wanted to mention is that most colleges and universities do have a career center of some sort and that is a great resource for you all to really use as you're navigating again going into the workforce you're starting to navigate how do you work from home how does this process really work what technology is good to use you know how do i structure my day in such a way that I can still stay focused and get what I need to get done I'm so utilize the Career Services centers that you have at your colleges universities because they provide some really great I think resources for you all and they're learning right now as we kind of navigate I'm kind of this this situation and then the second thing I would say is find a really great mentor you know if you have people older cousins friends other folks who are in the workforce and you know there they are also navigating this time right now reach out
