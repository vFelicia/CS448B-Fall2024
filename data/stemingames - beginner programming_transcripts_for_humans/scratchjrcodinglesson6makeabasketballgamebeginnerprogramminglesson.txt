00:10 - welcome to scratch junior coding this is
00:13 - a series of videos to help you learn to
00:15 - code using scratch junior
00:18 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:20 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:23 - else you want to create
00:25 - you're in control of everything and the
00:27 - programs that you write
00:29 - you will need the scratch junior app on
00:31 - your ipad android tablet or computer
00:35 - scratch junior is a free download and
00:38 - you'll have to get it so that you can do
00:40 - coding with us
00:41 - today you're going to create something
00:43 - like this
00:48 - she's going to dribble the basketball
00:50 - and then make a score
00:53 - click on the plus icon to start a new
00:55 - project
00:57 - hold down on the default character
01:01 - until the x pops up
01:03 - and then delete it
01:05 - click on the landscape up here to bring
01:08 - up the background gallery
01:10 - and we want the basketball court
01:15 - and we need a character to dribble the
01:17 - basketball so we'll hit the plus over
01:19 - here to get a new character
01:26 - and out of all the people here i thought
01:28 - she looked like she was dribbling a
01:30 - basketball so i picked her
01:36 - we're also going to need a basketball so
01:38 - i'll go ahead and get that character
01:51 - so when i select my teen
01:53 - this is the coding area all the
01:55 - instructions for her will be here
01:57 - when i select the basketball
02:00 - this is the coding area for the
02:01 - basketball and all the instructions for
02:03 - the basketball will be here
02:09 - for the teen
02:10 - she's gonna
02:13 - go almost to the goal and then stop
02:18 - so she has to move to the right
02:27 - i'll just say 11 times
02:30 - so i'll put 11
02:32 - right there
02:34 - and it'll tell it to go right 11 times
02:37 - reset her here
02:41 - and that works out good
02:46 - so i'm going to tell it to go right 11
02:48 - times when i hit the green flag
02:53 - and that works good
02:56 - and then she'll just stop
03:00 - there's another way to do this exact
03:03 - same thing to make her go right 11 times
03:06 - and that's using
03:07 - this loop
03:09 - this repeat block
03:12 - if i tell her to go right one time
03:15 - and i repeat that
03:17 - 11 times
03:22 - then it does the same thing it doesn't
03:24 - matter we can do it this way or this way
03:27 - since we're learning something new today
03:30 - we'll just have it
03:32 - do our new way with our loop
03:41 - so put her back at the beginning and now
03:43 - we have to write the code for the
03:44 - basketball
03:53 - we want to make it start going right
03:56 - whenever there's a green flag
04:04 - we'll go
04:05 - right
04:08 - one time
04:09 - and repeat that 11
04:12 - times see how that looks
04:20 - the ball needs to bounce up and down
04:22 - like it's being
04:26 - dribbled what if i put
04:30 - up and down
04:35 - inside our loop
04:46 - so it goes to the right and then it goes
04:49 - up and down then it goes to the right
04:51 - and then it goes up and down we need
04:54 - we need it to go up and down the same
04:57 - time that it's going to the right
05:02 - so let's add
05:07 - some more code so when the green flag is
05:10 - hit
05:11 - at the same time as it's going to the
05:13 - right it'll start going up and down
05:22 - and we're going to have to repeat that
05:26 - let's just leave it at four and see what
05:28 - happens
05:35 - so let's maybe repeat the bounces three
05:37 - times
05:38 - and see what happens
05:44 - so three was about right
05:47 - now let's make the basketball let's let
05:49 - her shoot a goal
05:54 - so after she gets to here it needs to go
05:56 - up
05:58 - and then over and then back down
06:12 - sew up
06:19 - and then over
06:26 - and then back down let's see if those
06:28 - numbers are about right
06:37 - it's a little bit too far right
06:39 - let's just make that a one
06:42 - and whenever it goes back down let's
06:43 - make it go back down a lot more than
06:45 - that
06:56 - when
06:58 - it leaves her hand it just seems to be
07:00 - going too slow that's a good speed for
07:02 - her to be dribbling it
07:04 - but i want it to go faster once she
07:06 - shoots the ball
07:08 - so our speed block is right here
07:17 - we want the speed to stay medium in the
07:19 - beginning
07:21 - but then right before she shoots it
07:24 - it's going to speed up
07:26 - let's see what that looks like
07:32 - that's pretty close
07:38 - put an ending block
07:51 - let's name this project
07:54 - up here at the top
07:55 - [Music]
07:56 - it's going to automatically say project
07:59 - and whatever the next number is
08:03 - let's call it basketball
08:13 - and where all our
08:15 - projects are
08:17 - you'll see it has a name
08:22 - somehow i ended up with this empty
08:23 - project
08:25 - so project 8
08:27 - if i hold down on it
08:29 - i can click the x
08:32 - to delete it
08:36 - that's the end of this lesson
08:38 - now it's your turn
08:40 - create a new project
08:43 - and add the basketball court
08:45 - right here at the backgrounds
08:47 - and add a couple of characters
08:49 - one of the people
08:51 - and a ball
08:53 - and make the ball bounce up and down
08:55 - across the court
08:56 - and have the character dribble in the
08:58 - ball
08:59 - the main thing that you need to learn
09:01 - from this lesson
09:02 - is using this repeat block this loop
09:06 - instead of just having the character
09:08 - move 11 times to the right
09:10 - make them loop 11 times
09:13 - to go to the right
09:15 - and with this
09:17 - dribble
09:22 - if i try to put
09:24 - 11 right there
09:27 - it just makes it go up and down 11.
09:30 - it doesn't make it repeat 11 times so
09:33 - you have to have that repeat block
09:43 - so use this loop this repeat block
09:47 - if you can use the repeat block to make
09:49 - the ball dribble then congratulations
09:52 - you've mastered this lesson
09:55 - this free kids coding lesson was
09:57 - provided by stem in games subscribe
10:00 - watch more lessons and keep practicing
10:03 - and soon you will be creating new worlds
10:05 - and games and making your ideas come to
10:08 - life i'll see you next time
