00:01 - welcome to scratch coding this is a
00:04 - series of videos to help you learn to
00:06 - code using scratch with scratch you can
00:10 - create your own stories puzzles and
00:13 - games and whatever else you want to
00:15 - create you're in control of everything
00:18 - in the programs that you write
00:20 - create a free account at scratch.mit.edu
00:25 - so you can do coding with us today we're
00:28 - going to create a racing game
00:33 - [Music]
00:55 - [Music]
01:01 - the blue car won
01:03 - if the car touches the wall during a
01:05 - race he has to start over
01:11 - and if the cars touch each other it
01:13 - makes a crashing sound
01:15 - let's look at the code
01:20 - let's look at the background
01:23 - if we go to the backdrops tab
01:26 - we can see there's two backgrounds
01:28 - the start screen and the race track
01:31 - and there's no code for that
01:33 - but there is code
01:35 - for this finish line
01:39 - and this start button so when the green
01:41 - flag is clicked
01:43 - the code for the start button says to
01:45 - show
01:47 - so it's not invisible anymore but when
01:49 - you click the start button
01:50 - it's going to change to the other
01:52 - backdrop and then it'll hide the start
01:54 - button
01:57 - i just added all that code for fun
02:00 - we don't have to do that in the code
02:01 - today but you can add that to your
02:03 - program if you want to
02:05 - let's look at the cars
02:09 - you see i picked a car that has a top
02:12 - and a bottom that made it complicated
02:14 - when i wrote the code
02:16 - when the cars get all the way around
02:18 - here i don't want them to drive upside
02:20 - down on this part of the track and so i
02:22 - had to flip them around
02:24 - so i had to add this code just to flip
02:27 - the car around
02:29 - this if touching color black
02:32 - there's nothing else black on the screen
02:34 - so whenever a car goes all the way
02:36 - around
02:37 - and then gets to right here
02:39 - he'll say i won
02:41 - the red car has the same code
02:50 - if the red car touches the black he'll
02:52 - say i won when the green flag is clicked
02:55 - the car has to hide
02:58 - or else they'd show up here on my start
02:59 - screen
03:01 - so when the green flag is clicked they
03:03 - hide
03:04 - and they go to their beginning spot
03:07 - and they point to the right
03:11 - and then forever it checks and if
03:14 - they're touching
03:18 - this code right here
03:19 - if they're touching yellow then they
03:21 - have to start over
03:29 - and you'll see if i have it pointing
03:30 - sideways when they start over they point
03:34 - back
03:35 - in the 90 degree direction
03:42 - if the blue car
03:44 - is touching the red car
03:47 - then it's going to play that crunching
03:48 - sound
03:55 - and in the last lesson
03:56 - we learned how to navigate a sprite
03:58 - around the only thing different about
04:01 - moving the cars around than in the last
04:03 - lesson when we did a maze
04:05 - is we have two cars instead of just one
04:08 - character going around a maze we have
04:09 - two cars going around a track
04:12 - and so the blue one
04:16 - uses
04:17 - the right arrow left arrow
04:20 - and up arrow
04:25 - and the red one uses the a d and w keys
04:30 - so one person's gonna have to use w
04:33 - to go forward
04:34 - and the other person in the race will
04:36 - use the arrow key if you can write this
04:38 - code you'll be able to race your friends
04:40 - let's start a new project
04:42 - and see if we can do this again
04:50 - first let's get a new stage or
04:51 - background
04:53 - there's not one already there so we need
04:55 - to draw one will go to paint you could
04:57 - get the paint brush and draw a track if
05:00 - you wanted to but today i'm going to
05:01 - start off with a circle
05:10 - this reshape tool
05:12 - will make it so it's not exactly a
05:14 - circle
05:15 - i'll show you
05:18 - i can add a couple more dots
05:25 - and then drag this part in
05:31 - as you're dragging this around and
05:33 - fixing your track keep an eye on this up
05:35 - here because this is what the game
05:37 - actually looks like after you like the
05:39 - shape of your track go back to the
05:41 - select tool
05:43 - and copy it
05:46 - and paste it now you have two of them
05:48 - and make one of them smaller
05:57 - and make him feel
05:59 - with green
06:05 - i should have colored the whole
06:06 - background green in the beginning
06:08 - because now i can't
06:10 - just dump a bucket
06:12 - of green in the back
06:14 - i have to make a shape
06:17 - to dump into the back so when you're
06:18 - doing it make sure you draw a rectangle
06:21 - over the whole thing and make it
06:22 - whatever color you want your background
06:24 - to be
06:26 - because now i have to add the background
06:28 - color
06:29 - and then bring all these shapes to the
06:31 - front
06:32 - see they're behind that so i'm going to
06:34 - just click on it
06:38 - and bring it to the front and click on
06:40 - this one
06:42 - and bring it to the front
06:47 - it's like they're sitting on top of each
06:48 - other and you can just set them behind
06:50 - each other so now i can get this one
06:53 - and make it cover the whole back but it
06:55 - would be easier if i did the green
06:56 - background first
06:59 - so there's my race track oh this is
07:01 - going to be really tough right here this
07:02 - skinny part
07:11 - when you have the reshape tool selected
07:15 - and you select one of your dots
07:21 - see how that changes the shape when you
07:23 - manipulate these lines
07:25 - you can turn them
07:28 - to change your angle and make it it
07:30 - didn't look quite round and so that's
07:32 - why i wanted to go back and mess with it
07:35 - see just making that a little longer
07:40 - made it go a little rounder instead of
07:42 - turning so sharp now we have a race
07:44 - track we need a car
07:46 - let's get rid of scratch
07:48 - you're welcome to look in your sprites
07:50 - and see if you have a race car that you
07:52 - like
07:53 - but i don't have one from the top and
07:55 - i'm not going to select these i want to
07:57 - draw my own
08:01 - and i do that with the paint brush just
08:02 - like we did for the background
08:07 - [Music]
08:33 - [Music]
08:37 - i need to get all these different pieces
08:39 - of the car to be in a group together
08:43 - so i've got the select tool
08:47 - select all the parts
08:49 - and group them together
08:52 - then i'll be able to move them at the
08:53 - same time
08:55 - and i need to center my car
09:00 - right in the middle
09:02 - of my picture and then over here he
09:04 - needs to be smaller
09:11 - really small so you can get around the
09:12 - track
09:14 - now i see a problem with my background
09:17 - if one of my cars runs into the other
09:20 - car
09:20 - they're going to be touching black
09:21 - because the tires are black i need to
09:23 - change
09:24 - the color of the edge of my track
09:36 - and i want it to be the same color
09:38 - yellow
09:39 - for the inside of the track so i'll grab
09:41 - my dropper
09:44 - and suck up some yellow now all the
09:46 - edges the same color yellow now how are
09:48 - we going to make our car move
09:52 - click on the car
09:55 - right here you're drawing him in his
09:57 - costume we're going to go to code and we
09:59 - want him to move when we hit the arrows
10:04 - you touch a key that's an event
10:07 - when
10:10 - up arrow is pressed
10:13 - his motion
10:16 - is going to be to go 10 steps
10:21 - that works
10:23 - so we need more events for the other
10:26 - keys
10:40 - when right arrow is pressed
10:43 - we're going to turn right 15 degrees
10:48 - when left arrow is pressed we'll turn
10:51 - left 15 degrees
10:55 - and when down arrow is pressed
11:00 - we'll move
11:01 - backwards so that's going to be a
11:03 - negative 10.
11:09 - so already
11:16 - we could go around the track
11:19 - and if we just copied that code
11:22 - you could race your friends with just
11:24 - this much of the game
11:26 - let's draw in a finish line go to the
11:28 - backdrops
11:31 - not the code for the backdrop
11:35 - but the picture
11:37 - let's make the finish line a different
11:39 - color
11:49 - and go back to the code for the car
11:58 - and we need to say when he's touching
12:00 - that blue color
12:04 - that he's going to say i won
12:12 - so if he's touching that blue color
12:21 - he'll say
12:23 - i won
12:25 - when i add some cheers
12:28 - what kind of sounds do we have
12:33 - all we have is a popping sound
12:36 - this sprite
12:38 - only has a popping sound
12:40 - we need to go get another sound
12:45 - click on the sounds tab
12:47 - and go down here to choose a sound
13:00 - now we have a sound
13:02 - let's go back to the code for the car
13:05 - now we have that sound still we still
13:07 - have the pop and we also have the
13:09 - clapping sound
13:12 - so when we cross the finish line
13:14 - we want the crowd to clap for us
13:17 - if we ran this code
13:18 - it would check to see if he's touching
13:20 - blue
13:21 - and he's not
13:22 - and so it would just pass this code up
13:25 - we need to continuously keep checking to
13:27 - see if he's touching blue
13:33 - we need that in a forever loop
13:42 - so when the green flag is clicked
13:44 - forever it's going to keep checking to
13:45 - see if he's touching blue
13:52 - i'm going to cheat i'm just going to go
13:53 - backwards
13:57 - instead of going around the whole track
13:59 - and we see that it works where is my car
14:01 - right now
14:05 - you see he's on 28 73 is his location
14:10 - when the green flag is clicked i want
14:12 - him to go back to 2873 no matter where
14:14 - he's at
14:15 - but also
14:20 - if he's ever touching yellow i want him
14:23 - to go back
14:26 - to 2873
14:29 - and i want him to point to the right
14:35 - so if he's touching yellow that's
14:37 - something that he's going to sense
14:42 - that he's touching
14:45 - the color click the color
14:50 - get the dropper
14:52 - suck up some yellow paint
14:59 - and put that in the forever loop so
15:01 - forever it's going to check to see if
15:02 - he's touching blue or yellow
15:07 - and it'll make him start over
15:12 - i also want him
15:15 - to point to the right
15:17 - when i hit the green flag
15:20 - we need somebody to race
15:24 - we can right click
15:26 - on our car
15:27 - and duplicate
15:31 - let's go to car number two
15:34 - change his costume
15:40 - and make him red
15:42 - we just need to change a few things
15:44 - about his code and we'll be done
15:48 - so one of the things we have to change
15:50 - about the red car is what keys are used
15:52 - to move him because right now they both
15:55 - do the same thing
15:57 - when i hit the arrows
16:02 - but the red car needs to use
16:07 - w
16:09 - right should be d
16:13 - left should be a
16:17 - and down is s
16:20 - another thing we need to do
16:23 - is they don't need to start off in the
16:24 - same place
16:26 - the red car needs to be
16:28 - up here so his x position can start off
16:31 - at 28
16:34 - but his y position needs to be 105.
16:40 - and that's it
16:42 - now we have another racing game
17:02 - hmm
17:06 - now it's your turn
17:08 - draw your background
17:10 - and a car
17:11 - and make it move with the arrows and
17:13 - then create another car and make it move
17:15 - with other keys and race your friends
17:19 - this free coding lesson was provided by
17:21 - stem games watch more lessons and keep
17:24 - practicing so you can create new worlds
17:26 - and games and make your ideas come to
17:29 - life i'll see you next time bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to scratch coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles and games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write create a free account at scratch.mit.edu so you can do coding with us today we're going to create a racing game the blue car won if the car touches the wall during a race he has to start over and if the cars touch each other it makes a crashing sound let's look at the code let's look at the background if we go to the backdrops tab we can see there's two backgrounds the start screen and the race track and there's no code for that but there is code for this finish line and this start button so when the green flag is clicked the code for the start button says to show so it's not invisible anymore but when you click the start button it's going to change to the other backdrop and then it'll hide the start button i just added all that code for fun we don't have to do that in the code today but you can add that to your program if you want to let's look at the cars you see i picked a car that has a top and a bottom that made it complicated when i wrote the code when the cars get all the way around here i don't want them to drive upside down on this part of the track and so i had to flip them around so i had to add this code just to flip the car around this if touching color black there's nothing else black on the screen so whenever a car goes all the way around and then gets to right here he'll say i won the red car has the same code if the red car touches the black he'll say i won when the green flag is clicked the car has to hide or else they'd show up here on my start screen so when the green flag is clicked they hide and they go to their beginning spot and they point to the right and then forever it checks and if they're touching this code right here if they're touching yellow then they have to start over and you'll see if i have it pointing sideways when they start over they point back in the 90 degree direction if the blue car is touching the red car then it's going to play that crunching sound and in the last lesson we learned how to navigate a sprite around the only thing different about moving the cars around than in the last lesson when we did a maze is we have two cars instead of just one character going around a maze we have two cars going around a track and so the blue one uses the right arrow left arrow and up arrow and the red one uses the a d and w keys so one person's gonna have to use w to go forward and the other person in the race will use the arrow key if you can write this code you'll be able to race your friends let's start a new project and see if we can do this again first let's get a new stage or background there's not one already there so we need to draw one will go to paint you could get the paint brush and draw a track if you wanted to but today i'm going to start off with a circle this reshape tool will make it so it's not exactly a circle i'll show you i can add a couple more dots and then drag this part in as you're dragging this around and fixing your track keep an eye on this up here because this is what the game actually looks like after you like the shape of your track go back to the select tool and copy it and paste it now you have two of them and make one of them smaller and make him feel with green i should have colored the whole background green in the beginning because now i can't just dump a bucket of green in the back i have to make a shape to dump into the back so when you're doing it make sure you draw a rectangle over the whole thing and make it whatever color you want your background to be because now i have to add the background color and then bring all these shapes to the front see they're behind that so i'm going to just click on it and bring it to the front and click on this one and bring it to the front it's like they're sitting on top of each other and you can just set them behind each other so now i can get this one and make it cover the whole back but it would be easier if i did the green background first so there's my race track oh this is going to be really tough right here this skinny part when you have the reshape tool selected and you select one of your dots see how that changes the shape when you manipulate these lines you can turn them to change your angle and make it it didn't look quite round and so that's why i wanted to go back and mess with it see just making that a little longer made it go a little rounder instead of turning so sharp now we have a race track we need a car let's get rid of scratch you're welcome to look in your sprites and see if you have a race car that you like but i don't have one from the top and i'm not going to select these i want to draw my own and i do that with the paint brush just like we did for the background i need to get all these different pieces of the car to be in a group together so i've got the select tool select all the parts and group them together then i'll be able to move them at the same time and i need to center my car right in the middle of my picture and then over here he needs to be smaller really small so you can get around the track now i see a problem with my background if one of my cars runs into the other car they're going to be touching black because the tires are black i need to change the color of the edge of my track and i want it to be the same color yellow for the inside of the track so i'll grab my dropper and suck up some yellow now all the edges the same color yellow now how are we going to make our car move click on the car right here you're drawing him in his costume we're going to go to code and we want him to move when we hit the arrows you touch a key that's an event when up arrow is pressed his motion is going to be to go 10 steps that works so we need more events for the other keys when right arrow is pressed we're going to turn right 15 degrees when left arrow is pressed we'll turn left 15 degrees and when down arrow is pressed we'll move backwards so that's going to be a negative 10. so already we could go around the track and if we just copied that code you could race your friends with just this much of the game let's draw in a finish line go to the backdrops not the code for the backdrop but the picture let's make the finish line a different color and go back to the code for the car and we need to say when he's touching that blue color that he's going to say i won so if he's touching that blue color he'll say i won when i add some cheers what kind of sounds do we have all we have is a popping sound this sprite only has a popping sound we need to go get another sound click on the sounds tab and go down here to choose a sound now we have a sound let's go back to the code for the car now we have that sound still we still have the pop and we also have the clapping sound so when we cross the finish line we want the crowd to clap for us if we ran this code it would check to see if he's touching blue and he's not and so it would just pass this code up we need to continuously keep checking to see if he's touching blue we need that in a forever loop so when the green flag is clicked forever it's going to keep checking to see if he's touching blue i'm going to cheat i'm just going to go backwards instead of going around the whole track and we see that it works where is my car right now you see he's on 28 73 is his location when the green flag is clicked i want him to go back to 2873 no matter where he's at but also if he's ever touching yellow i want him to go back to 2873 and i want him to point to the right so if he's touching yellow that's something that he's going to sense that he's touching the color click the color get the dropper suck up some yellow paint and put that in the forever loop so forever it's going to check to see if he's touching blue or yellow and it'll make him start over i also want him to point to the right when i hit the green flag we need somebody to race we can right click on our car and duplicate let's go to car number two change his costume and make him red we just need to change a few things about his code and we'll be done so one of the things we have to change about the red car is what keys are used to move him because right now they both do the same thing when i hit the arrows but the red car needs to use w right should be d left should be a and down is s another thing we need to do is they don't need to start off in the same place the red car needs to be up here so his x position can start off at 28 but his y position needs to be 105. and that's it now we have another racing game hmm now it's your turn draw your background and a car and make it move with the arrows and then create another car and make it move with other keys and race your friends this free coding lesson was provided by stem games watch more lessons and keep practicing so you can create new worlds and games and make your ideas come to life i'll see you next time bye bye
