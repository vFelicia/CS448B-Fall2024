00:01 - welcome to scratch coding this is a
00:04 - series of videos to help you learn to
00:06 - code using scratch with scratch you can
00:10 - create your own stories puzzles and
00:13 - games and whatever else you want to
00:15 - create you're in control of everything
00:18 - in the programs that you write
00:20 - create a free account at scratch.mit.edu
00:25 - so you can do coding with us
00:27 - today we're going to create a jumping
00:30 - game
00:36 - that stores the score up at the top
00:40 - every time we jump over an obstacle
00:43 - we saw in the last video that there's
00:46 - lots of different ways to make a
00:47 - character jump one of the easiest ways
00:50 - is just to make the character glide up
00:52 - and back down
00:56 - another way is to use a variable
00:58 - so as the character goes up they slow
01:00 - down and as they come back down they
01:02 - speed up
01:04 - like this
01:07 - i like that way better so that's what
01:08 - i'm going to put in my game
01:12 - let's go see how to code a jumping game
01:14 - i'm going to start a new project
01:18 - and pick a stage
01:23 - let's keep scratch and get another
01:26 - sprite
01:39 - i'm going to make this banana sprite
01:42 - change into a strawberry and then change
01:44 - into a taco
01:48 - i'm going to go to my strawberry sprite
01:50 - my strawberry character go into his
01:53 - costumes
01:54 - and drag this costume
01:58 - over to my bananas
02:01 - and let it go
02:02 - then i'm going to go to my taco sprite
02:06 - and drag this taco
02:10 - over to my bananas
02:12 - and then you'll see when i go to bananas
02:14 - i have bananas and a strawberry and a
02:17 - taco so i don't need these other ones
02:19 - anymore
02:26 - i just think it would be funny if
02:28 - scratch was jumping over some fruit
02:31 - so that's what i'm gonna make my game do
02:38 - we'll have this crazy monkey throwing
02:40 - fruit at him
02:45 - we don't want the fruit to be too big or
02:48 - scratch won't be able to jump over it
02:51 - let's make it about 80 of what it was
02:53 - before and my start location for my
02:56 - fruit
02:57 - you notice when i move my bananas around
02:59 - this go-to block changes
03:05 - so if i want my fruit to start right
03:06 - here
03:08 - in the beginning of the program i can
03:10 - tell it to go to that x and y spot
03:15 - so when the green flag is clicked no
03:17 - matter what happens my fruit is going to
03:19 - start off right there
03:25 - then i want it to glide
03:32 - all the way over here
03:39 - what is that position
03:42 - right now he's at
03:44 - minus 233
03:46 - minus 160. so i'll just change this to
03:49 - that
03:51 - to those numbers
03:56 - let's see what that looks like
04:02 - and then we don't want the bananas just
04:03 - hanging out over here so let's hide them
04:08 - so every time i click the green flag
04:14 - i didn't make them reappear they're
04:15 - still hiding
04:17 - i need to show them at the beginning
04:20 - so every time i click the green flag
04:23 - the monkey's throwing some bananas at
04:25 - scratch
04:28 - well i don't want to just keep clicking
04:30 - the green flag so i need to get that in
04:32 - a loop
04:35 - that's a control block
04:38 - so
04:40 - forever won't you just keep doing that
04:54 - maybe we'll give scratch a little bit of
04:56 - a break
05:01 - we'll wait
05:03 - how about 0.2 seconds
05:07 - just a little bit of a break there
05:09 - i don't want it to always be bananas
05:12 - let's change it up
05:28 - i think that taco is too big
05:30 - let me go change that costume
05:34 - we have the fruit selected i'll go to
05:36 - costumes
05:38 - select the taco
05:45 - just drag that a little smaller
05:48 - i need to make sure
05:50 - the little plus that's the middle of the
05:51 - taco is in the middle of
05:53 - my image
05:57 - that makes the taco the same size as the
05:59 - other fruit all right scratch cat we
06:01 - need some code for you let's click on
06:03 - scratch cat
06:06 - change his name to scratch
06:11 - i want him to jump when i press the
06:12 - space bar
06:17 - and in case he's somewhere else on the
06:19 - screen
06:24 - we want to make him go to a starting
06:26 - position
06:27 - which scratch makes it so easy right
06:30 - here where scratch is right now
06:32 - is where my blocks say
06:34 - to put him to i don't even have to
06:36 - figure out what the x and y is it's
06:38 - already
06:46 - there if i wanted to make him glide up
06:49 - there
06:53 - and then glide back down
07:00 - that would be an easy jump
07:09 - but i want it to look a little better
07:11 - than that
07:21 - if i want to repeat for 10
07:25 - that i want to change y by 10
07:28 - and he would just keep going up
07:32 - and then if i did a minus
07:38 - then it would come back down
07:40 - but i don't want him to do it at the
07:42 - same speed we need a variable
07:47 - make a variable called speed
07:54 - first we're going to change
07:56 - speed to be 15.
07:59 - at first speed will be 15 and so y is
08:02 - going to change by 15.
08:09 - but every
08:10 - loop my speed is going to go down
08:16 - so every time through the loop speed
08:18 - will get smaller
08:19 - and y will get smaller
08:22 - and then we got to bring him back down
08:24 - if we repeat this
08:26 - say 30 times
08:28 - let's see what will happen
08:35 - and we just need to change y one more
08:37 - time to get him back to a starting spot
08:57 - oh
08:59 - food's coming way too fast
09:03 - let's look at the code for the food
09:06 - we need to glide over
09:08 - what does two seconds look like
09:21 - about one and a half seconds
09:32 - i think we're gonna have to get that
09:34 - food a little smaller
09:37 - he's going to lose a lot
09:40 - all right
09:44 - let's make another variable
09:47 - to keep track of our score
09:52 - we can just call it score
09:56 - let's make it a capital s so it'll look
09:58 - better
09:59 - because it's going to be on the screen
10:03 - right there we don't need speed up there
10:05 - let me uncheck speed
10:08 - but we do want score
10:11 - and every time
10:12 - we glide past scratch
10:15 - without him getting hit we want to add a
10:17 - point to our score
10:20 - so we'll change
10:27 - score by
10:30 - one and see it just keeps going up
10:36 - and we need to add the code to scratch
10:40 - so that it'll stop the game whenever he
10:42 - gets hit
10:46 - we need this code always running always
10:48 - being ready to find out if we've been
10:51 - hit
10:52 - so it has to have a separate green flag
11:00 - and it's going to keep running forever
11:12 - and it's going to say if
11:15 - scratch is touching some food
11:17 - then it's going to stop the code
11:25 - so if he senses that he's touching some
11:28 - food so it's under a sensing block
11:36 - if he's touching
11:42 - bananas
11:47 - all right after i put this code here i
11:49 - haven't hit the green flag yet and so
11:52 - it's not working
11:54 - but as soon as i hit the green flag it's
11:56 - going to make us lose
11:59 - see he senses that he's touching some
12:01 - fruit now so it stopped all the code
12:04 - and my score is 61.
12:07 - if i hit the green flag it's just gonna
12:09 - keep my score like that so i need to
12:10 - reset my score to zero every time the
12:13 - game is started
12:18 - my score is a variable so it's under the
12:20 - variables
12:23 - at the beginning of the game
12:25 - set
12:26 - score to zero
12:36 - it works
12:47 - we made a jumping game
12:56 - that's the end of this lesson
12:58 - click like and subscribe below so i can
13:00 - keep making tutorials and more people
13:03 - can find them
13:04 - now it's your turn to create a jumping
13:06 - game
13:07 - select any background that you like and
13:09 - any main character that you like and
13:12 - think about what you would like to glide
13:14 - over or roll over as an obstacle to your
13:17 - character you'll have to add the code to
13:20 - make your character jump whether you use
13:22 - repeat or glide it doesn't matter
13:25 - and you'll have to add the code to stop
13:27 - the game whenever your character is
13:29 - touching the obstacle if you can make
13:31 - your character jump over an obstacle
13:33 - then congratulations you've mastered
13:35 - this lesson this free coding lesson was
13:38 - provided by stem in games watch more
13:41 - lessons and keep practicing so you can
13:43 - create new worlds and games and make
13:46 - your ideas come to life i'll see you

welcome to scratch coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles and games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write create a free account at scratch.mit.edu so you can do coding with us today we're going to create a jumping game that stores the score up at the top every time we jump over an obstacle we saw in the last video that there's lots of different ways to make a character jump one of the easiest ways is just to make the character glide up and back down another way is to use a variable so as the character goes up they slow down and as they come back down they speed up like this i like that way better so that's what i'm going to put in my game let's go see how to code a jumping game i'm going to start a new project and pick a stage let's keep scratch and get another sprite i'm going to make this banana sprite change into a strawberry and then change into a taco i'm going to go to my strawberry sprite my strawberry character go into his costumes and drag this costume over to my bananas and let it go then i'm going to go to my taco sprite and drag this taco over to my bananas and then you'll see when i go to bananas i have bananas and a strawberry and a taco so i don't need these other ones anymore i just think it would be funny if scratch was jumping over some fruit so that's what i'm gonna make my game do we'll have this crazy monkey throwing fruit at him we don't want the fruit to be too big or scratch won't be able to jump over it let's make it about 80 of what it was before and my start location for my fruit you notice when i move my bananas around this goto block changes so if i want my fruit to start right here in the beginning of the program i can tell it to go to that x and y spot so when the green flag is clicked no matter what happens my fruit is going to start off right there then i want it to glide all the way over here what is that position right now he's at minus 233 minus 160. so i'll just change this to that to those numbers let's see what that looks like and then we don't want the bananas just hanging out over here so let's hide them so every time i click the green flag i didn't make them reappear they're still hiding i need to show them at the beginning so every time i click the green flag the monkey's throwing some bananas at scratch well i don't want to just keep clicking the green flag so i need to get that in a loop that's a control block so forever won't you just keep doing that maybe we'll give scratch a little bit of a break we'll wait how about 0.2 seconds just a little bit of a break there i don't want it to always be bananas let's change it up i think that taco is too big let me go change that costume we have the fruit selected i'll go to costumes select the taco just drag that a little smaller i need to make sure the little plus that's the middle of the taco is in the middle of my image that makes the taco the same size as the other fruit all right scratch cat we need some code for you let's click on scratch cat change his name to scratch i want him to jump when i press the space bar and in case he's somewhere else on the screen we want to make him go to a starting position which scratch makes it so easy right here where scratch is right now is where my blocks say to put him to i don't even have to figure out what the x and y is it's already there if i wanted to make him glide up there and then glide back down that would be an easy jump but i want it to look a little better than that if i want to repeat for 10 that i want to change y by 10 and he would just keep going up and then if i did a minus then it would come back down but i don't want him to do it at the same speed we need a variable make a variable called speed first we're going to change speed to be 15. at first speed will be 15 and so y is going to change by 15. but every loop my speed is going to go down so every time through the loop speed will get smaller and y will get smaller and then we got to bring him back down if we repeat this say 30 times let's see what will happen and we just need to change y one more time to get him back to a starting spot oh food's coming way too fast let's look at the code for the food we need to glide over what does two seconds look like about one and a half seconds i think we're gonna have to get that food a little smaller he's going to lose a lot all right let's make another variable to keep track of our score we can just call it score let's make it a capital s so it'll look better because it's going to be on the screen right there we don't need speed up there let me uncheck speed but we do want score and every time we glide past scratch without him getting hit we want to add a point to our score so we'll change score by one and see it just keeps going up and we need to add the code to scratch so that it'll stop the game whenever he gets hit we need this code always running always being ready to find out if we've been hit so it has to have a separate green flag and it's going to keep running forever and it's going to say if scratch is touching some food then it's going to stop the code so if he senses that he's touching some food so it's under a sensing block if he's touching bananas all right after i put this code here i haven't hit the green flag yet and so it's not working but as soon as i hit the green flag it's going to make us lose see he senses that he's touching some fruit now so it stopped all the code and my score is 61. if i hit the green flag it's just gonna keep my score like that so i need to reset my score to zero every time the game is started my score is a variable so it's under the variables at the beginning of the game set score to zero it works we made a jumping game that's the end of this lesson click like and subscribe below so i can keep making tutorials and more people can find them now it's your turn to create a jumping game select any background that you like and any main character that you like and think about what you would like to glide over or roll over as an obstacle to your character you'll have to add the code to make your character jump whether you use repeat or glide it doesn't matter and you'll have to add the code to stop the game whenever your character is touching the obstacle if you can make your character jump over an obstacle then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free coding lesson was provided by stem in games watch
