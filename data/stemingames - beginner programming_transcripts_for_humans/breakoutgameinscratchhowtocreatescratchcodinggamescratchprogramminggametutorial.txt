00:01 - welcome to scratch coding with scratch
00:04 - you can create your own stories puzzles
00:06 - games and whatever else you want to
00:08 - create
00:09 - you're in control of everything and the
00:11 - programs that you write
00:15 - today we're going to create something
00:17 - like this
00:19 - it's a breakout game you move the paddle
00:23 - and break all the bricks away
00:28 - breakout's been around since the 1970s
00:30 - but it's still fun
00:35 - my favorite part about playing this game
00:36 - is whenever i can get the ball past the
00:39 - top row and it just bounces around and
00:41 - gets all the bricks for me
00:45 - and this is what it would look like if
00:47 - you miss
00:50 - so let's start at the beginning
00:52 - and create a new project
00:57 - get rid of scratch cat and we need some
01:00 - bricks
01:03 - and this button will work just fine
01:05 - let's look at the costumes for this
01:07 - button
01:09 - we have just blue and gray
01:14 - i could just fill the whole thing in one
01:15 - color
01:18 - but i kind of like the shading
01:20 - so i'll do the the left color
01:22 - a lighter red and the right color a
01:25 - darker red
01:32 - and i'll duplicate that to make another
01:34 - color
01:36 - and rename the button to button one
01:40 - the next one i'll do orange
01:43 - just click on the outside
01:46 - get the select tool and click on the
01:48 - outside
01:51 - change the left color to a lighter
01:54 - orange
01:56 - and the right color
01:58 - to a darker orange
02:02 - and then click on the middle part and do
02:04 - the same thing
02:06 - a lighter orange on the left and a
02:08 - darker orange on the right
02:11 - and then duplicate that one
02:13 - so that we can make a yellow one
02:16 - and pick a light and dark yellow
02:19 - and do the same thing on the inside
02:23 - and i'll jump off a minute to make some
02:25 - more buttons
02:26 - i still have the blue
02:28 - but i added a green and a purple brick
02:31 - now let's see what code we need
02:36 - if we wanted our game to only have
02:40 - about six bricks across then we could
02:42 - leave him this size but i want it to
02:43 - have more
02:44 - so i'll make it about 30 percent let's
02:47 - see how big that is
02:49 - that's a good size to give us a bunch of
02:51 - bricks
02:57 - and i want him to start off as the first
02:59 - brick
03:04 - that'll be a red one
03:07 - and i want him to go to where he's at
03:09 - right now
03:13 - and the go to block is going to be the
03:15 - position the xy position of your brick
03:18 - right then and what i want him to do is
03:20 - to just keep drawing
03:22 - copies of himself all the way across and
03:24 - i'm not sure how many that's going to be
03:26 - just yet
03:30 - let's repeat 10 times
03:33 - and create a clone of himself
03:38 - and then he'll just move over
03:40 - so he'll create a clone of himself move
03:43 - over by 10 create a clone of himself
03:45 - move over by 10 create a clone of
03:46 - himself repeat that 10 times
03:51 - okay those are too close
03:53 - let's change our x
03:56 - by 30.
04:01 - we're going to have to stop it to get
04:02 - rid of the first ones
04:06 - and we need more of them
04:09 - how about 16
04:13 - we need to make that original guy
04:16 - not be visible because we want to just
04:18 - see the clones
04:23 - so the original sprite is hidden
04:26 - but if he starts off as a clone
04:30 - we want him to be visible so we add a
04:32 - show for him
04:34 - and then we start the other code when
04:35 - the green flag is clicked
04:39 - i'm going to adjust the numbers a little
04:41 - to make them fit better
04:44 - that's good spacing
04:47 - so we've got 16 going across
04:50 - and then we want it to go to the next
04:52 - row and do 16 more across that's a
04:54 - different color
04:59 - and remember we have
05:02 - six different colors
05:07 - so we need this one to repeat six times
05:11 - inside this repeat six times first it's
05:13 - going to draw the first row
05:20 - then it's going to go to the next
05:21 - costume which will just get a different
05:23 - color brick
05:25 - we want it to move down on the y-axis
05:28 - it's going to be a negative
05:30 - but how much
05:34 - change y by let's just say negative 10.
05:39 - and our x to start off with was a
05:41 - negative 225 so we need to go back to
05:43 - there too
05:48 - so it drew them all
05:50 - but we just need to go negative y more
05:53 - we'll try 20 negative 20.
05:58 - let's try negative 18.
06:01 - i like that spacing
06:03 - all right wait hold stop everything
06:06 - this is what the program looks like
06:09 - after it's already done but i wanted to
06:11 - add this in here because i just figured
06:12 - something out right here where it says
06:14 - next costume and we spent all that time
06:17 - working on all these costumes we didn't
06:19 - even have to do that
06:22 - it takes a while to figure out what all
06:24 - these bricks do what all this code does
06:27 - but you don't have to do next costume
06:29 - and change to the next color
06:31 - there's change color effect
06:35 - that would do the same thing
06:40 - i got a couple of rows of green here so
06:41 - let me change color effect by 30 instead
06:44 - of 25.
06:48 - and it's going to draw all those things
06:49 - for me i didn't have to do that so this
06:52 - is what the program's going to look like
06:53 - when it's completely done but i wanted
06:55 - to jump in here and show you this
06:57 - before you wasted a lot of time drawing
07:00 - all the different colors because you
07:01 - don't really have to i don't like the
07:03 - white background
07:05 - we could draw a rectangle and color it
07:08 - in
07:13 - or we could just convert to a bitmap
07:16 - and color it in that way
07:18 - okay now let's get a ball
07:22 - yellow ball is fine
07:26 - when the flags clicked
07:30 - i want him to go
07:31 - i think 30 percent of work
07:36 - i want him to go to the middle
07:42 - and forever
07:46 - move
07:48 - and bounce
07:58 - let's make him start off
08:02 - pointing
08:06 - just a little to the right
08:08 - so his life will be a little bit more
08:10 - interesting
08:12 - we need a paddle but i can't really pick
08:14 - a sprite that we already have let's draw
08:17 - one
08:19 - so we'll draw a rectangle
08:21 - i want kind of a
08:23 - greenish
08:28 - and then i want three different little
08:30 - rectangles
08:31 - so i'll copy and paste
08:33 - so i have three areas here
08:37 - and i want them to be slightly different
08:38 - colors the reason i want him to have
08:41 - three different colors is because when
08:43 - he bounces in the middle i want it to
08:45 - make the ball go straight back up and if
08:47 - he bounces on each side i want it to go
08:49 - at an angle so that we'll have a little
08:51 - bit of control when we hit the ball
08:53 - that'll be more like the original game
08:56 - and if i group them together
08:58 - i can make sure they're in the center
09:01 - we'll drag him down here to where he
09:02 - goes
09:04 - and then my go to block
09:06 - will show the right place
09:09 - when the game starts he's going to go to
09:11 - the middle
09:13 - i need a set size block
09:17 - if you want your game to be harder make
09:19 - your paddle smaller
09:21 - and what we want him to do
09:23 - you could use your arrow keys
09:30 - but what i'm going to do
09:32 - is set the x value that's how far left
09:35 - or right it is set that to the mouse
09:37 - value
09:41 - so then it just follows my mouse
09:45 - i like that better than the arrows for
09:47 - this game let's go back to the code for
09:49 - the ball
09:52 - sure it bounces when it hits the edge
09:54 - but we want it to bounce when it hits
09:55 - the paddle or when it hits a brick
09:58 - so we need some ifs
10:04 - it's touching something
10:06 - what's my bricks called that's just
10:09 - called button let's call that bricks
10:13 - so now our sprite for the bricks is
10:15 - actually called bricks
10:18 - and if our ball is touching bricks then
10:21 - let's make him change directions
10:24 - we'll make him point in a different
10:26 - direction
10:29 - it'll be direction plus
10:31 - 170 so he'll
10:34 - almost completely change direction
10:36 - because if we did it plus 180 it would
10:38 - go in the complete opposite direction
10:42 - i need another if
10:44 - if he's touching the middle
10:50 - of my paddle
10:52 - i want him to bounce straight up
10:55 - point in direction
10:58 - it's going to be zero degrees
11:00 - right click and duplicate that if
11:03 - if he's touching
11:06 - let's suck up some of that left color
11:09 - if he's touching the left of the paddle
11:16 - then we'll make him go back that way
11:22 - and if he's touching the right of the
11:23 - paddle
11:27 - will make him go a little bit bounce to
11:29 - the right
11:30 - at 45 degrees
11:34 - that has to be in that forever loop
11:43 - that's looking pretty good but
11:45 - we still need more code
11:48 - so what happens when i miss
11:50 - nothing
11:52 - let's change the background to have a
11:54 - different color down here
11:56 - because then we'll be able to sense if
11:58 - the ball missed the paddle and hit that
12:00 - color
12:05 - we'll go to a gray color
12:09 - we'll just draw a rectangle
12:13 - let's get it way down so you can barely
12:15 - see it
12:16 - go back to the code for the ball
12:24 - and have another condition
12:29 - ball if you're touching that gray color
12:33 - i gotta pick the gray color
12:42 - then broadcast
12:45 - game
12:50 - over and then stop this forever loop
13:01 - all right it worked it stopped the game
13:03 - we could add the code so we could have
13:04 - three lives but let's just leave it at
13:06 - one for now
13:09 - let's go back to the code for the bricks
13:12 - i need a forever loop for the bricks
13:14 - that it just keeps checking to see if
13:16 - it's touching the ball
13:21 - because when it gets hit by the ball it
13:23 - needs to disappear
13:25 - we need an if inside the forever loop
13:29 - so forever
13:31 - if you're touching the ball
13:35 - then hide
13:40 - and delete yourself
13:50 - it works they're disappearing
13:53 - i wish i could get it to go above the
13:55 - top row and just start bouncing around
14:02 - oh and i love it when that happens
14:04 - they just
14:05 - start bouncing around and i just keep
14:07 - racking up the points speaking of points
14:09 - we don't have any points let's get a
14:11 - score
14:14 - we're going to make a variable and call
14:16 - it score
14:20 - when the game first starts
14:22 - score is zero
14:24 - and every time we break a brick
14:30 - we want to add one to the score
14:33 - i need to add another if statement here
14:36 - if the score is ever
14:39 - so much that it means he broke all the
14:41 - bricks then we need to say that he won
14:44 - he won the game
14:45 - you could go on to a new level or
14:46 - something but i'm just going to say that
14:48 - he won the game if he clears the screen
14:50 - one time
14:51 - i need to add the code if score is
14:54 - greater than a certain amount
14:59 - so if we've got 16 across
15:03 - and we've got six rows
15:06 - that's 96
15:08 - so we're going to have 96 bricks
15:11 - so if the score is greater than 95
15:13 - that means he won
15:15 - i need to broadcast
15:18 - that he won
15:19 - i'll just say win message
15:23 - if i leave it like this there's going to
15:25 - be a brick left at the end
15:28 - i want him to hide
15:30 - before we say he won or that last brick
15:32 - will still be there
15:37 - instead of starting with the green flag
15:39 - let's add a start button
15:47 - and i'll just write the word start on a
15:49 - button that they already have
15:52 - next we're going to need a sprite to
15:54 - show whenever they win the game and
15:56 - another sprite to show whenever they
15:58 - lose the game
16:02 - so i'll create some text
16:05 - and say game over
16:09 - i want to make that red
16:13 - and then put some yellow highlight on it
16:20 - that looks good
16:27 - i need to right click that sprite and
16:29 - make a copy duplicate it
16:36 - and make that say winner
16:45 - so the winner sprite
16:47 - the code for that
16:50 - when the green flag is clicked
16:53 - he'll hide
16:55 - but when he receives the message win
16:56 - message
17:01 - then he'll show
17:03 - the game over message is just the
17:04 - opposite i'm going to drag the code over
17:06 - from
17:07 - from the winning message
17:10 - so when the green flag is clicked he's
17:12 - going to hide
17:14 - but whenever he receives the message
17:16 - that the game's over then he'll show
17:22 - so the game over message works we've got
17:24 - to get the start button working
17:28 - so this ball doesn't need to move until
17:30 - we click start
17:39 - when the green flag is clicked
17:42 - the start button needs to show
17:49 - and when the start button is clicked
17:52 - he needs to broadcast the message
17:58 - start pressed
18:05 - and then he needs to hide and just get
18:06 - out of the way
18:12 - now we've got to tell the ball to wait
18:14 - for the start press
18:17 - so this whole forever loop
18:21 - needs to be when the start's pressed
18:24 - when space no
18:26 - when i receive start press that's it
18:31 - and whenever
18:33 - the game is won when he receives the
18:36 - message win message
18:37 - the ball needs to stop bouncing around
18:43 - so stop all the other scripts in this
18:45 - sprite
18:48 - so the ball is just waiting on us now
18:54 - what do you think of the speed
19:05 - and hitting the middle of the paddle
19:06 - makes it go straight up that's good
19:12 - if i hit the left it goes left
19:15 - it's perfect
19:16 - we could add some code
19:18 - to where at the beginning of the game
19:20 - you could say how hard you want the game
19:21 - to be and make the paddle bigger or
19:23 - smaller
19:24 - or make the ball go faster or slower
19:27 - depending on how hard the
19:29 - player wanted the game to be
19:32 - let's give it a sound for when the ball
19:33 - hits the brick
19:36 - it's going to be in here whenever it's
19:37 - touching the ball
19:39 - and the brick disappears
19:42 - let's make it make a sound
19:44 - if we go to our sounds
19:49 - that's all we have we have to add a new
19:51 - sound
19:53 - i'm going to grab this
19:56 - boop bang thing
20:04 - i want to grab just one of these sounds
20:13 - and once i have what i want i just copy
20:15 - it to a new sound
20:17 - and that's the sound that i want and
20:20 - i'll rename that sound
20:23 - just bop
20:26 - let's see what it sounds like
20:28 - if we do that every time we hit a brick
20:33 - what we need
20:36 - is to play the sound bop
20:39 - in that if loop if it's touching the
20:41 - ball
20:43 - but we need to hide it before we play
20:45 - the sound
20:47 - it's hard to get these blocks exactly
20:49 - where you want them
20:52 - all right i got my sound turned on
20:56 - i wanted you to be able to hear that
20:58 - sound that i added
21:01 - it really adds to the game

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to scratch coding with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write today we're going to create something like this it's a breakout game you move the paddle and break all the bricks away breakout's been around since the 1970s but it's still fun my favorite part about playing this game is whenever i can get the ball past the top row and it just bounces around and gets all the bricks for me and this is what it would look like if you miss so let's start at the beginning and create a new project get rid of scratch cat and we need some bricks and this button will work just fine let's look at the costumes for this button we have just blue and gray i could just fill the whole thing in one color but i kind of like the shading so i'll do the the left color a lighter red and the right color a darker red and i'll duplicate that to make another color and rename the button to button one the next one i'll do orange just click on the outside get the select tool and click on the outside change the left color to a lighter orange and the right color to a darker orange and then click on the middle part and do the same thing a lighter orange on the left and a darker orange on the right and then duplicate that one so that we can make a yellow one and pick a light and dark yellow and do the same thing on the inside and i'll jump off a minute to make some more buttons i still have the blue but i added a green and a purple brick now let's see what code we need if we wanted our game to only have about six bricks across then we could leave him this size but i want it to have more so i'll make it about 30 percent let's see how big that is that's a good size to give us a bunch of bricks and i want him to start off as the first brick that'll be a red one and i want him to go to where he's at right now and the go to block is going to be the position the xy position of your brick right then and what i want him to do is to just keep drawing copies of himself all the way across and i'm not sure how many that's going to be just yet let's repeat 10 times and create a clone of himself and then he'll just move over so he'll create a clone of himself move over by 10 create a clone of himself move over by 10 create a clone of himself repeat that 10 times okay those are too close let's change our x by 30. we're going to have to stop it to get rid of the first ones and we need more of them how about 16 we need to make that original guy not be visible because we want to just see the clones so the original sprite is hidden but if he starts off as a clone we want him to be visible so we add a show for him and then we start the other code when the green flag is clicked i'm going to adjust the numbers a little to make them fit better that's good spacing so we've got 16 going across and then we want it to go to the next row and do 16 more across that's a different color and remember we have six different colors so we need this one to repeat six times inside this repeat six times first it's going to draw the first row then it's going to go to the next costume which will just get a different color brick we want it to move down on the yaxis it's going to be a negative but how much change y by let's just say negative 10. and our x to start off with was a negative 225 so we need to go back to there too so it drew them all but we just need to go negative y more we'll try 20 negative 20. let's try negative 18. i like that spacing all right wait hold stop everything this is what the program looks like after it's already done but i wanted to add this in here because i just figured something out right here where it says next costume and we spent all that time working on all these costumes we didn't even have to do that it takes a while to figure out what all these bricks do what all this code does but you don't have to do next costume and change to the next color there's change color effect that would do the same thing i got a couple of rows of green here so let me change color effect by 30 instead of 25. and it's going to draw all those things for me i didn't have to do that so this is what the program's going to look like when it's completely done but i wanted to jump in here and show you this before you wasted a lot of time drawing all the different colors because you don't really have to i don't like the white background we could draw a rectangle and color it in or we could just convert to a bitmap and color it in that way okay now let's get a ball yellow ball is fine when the flags clicked i want him to go i think 30 percent of work i want him to go to the middle and forever move and bounce let's make him start off pointing just a little to the right so his life will be a little bit more interesting we need a paddle but i can't really pick a sprite that we already have let's draw one so we'll draw a rectangle i want kind of a greenish and then i want three different little rectangles so i'll copy and paste so i have three areas here and i want them to be slightly different colors the reason i want him to have three different colors is because when he bounces in the middle i want it to make the ball go straight back up and if he bounces on each side i want it to go at an angle so that we'll have a little bit of control when we hit the ball that'll be more like the original game and if i group them together i can make sure they're in the center we'll drag him down here to where he goes and then my go to block will show the right place when the game starts he's going to go to the middle i need a set size block if you want your game to be harder make your paddle smaller and what we want him to do you could use your arrow keys but what i'm going to do is set the x value that's how far left or right it is set that to the mouse value so then it just follows my mouse i like that better than the arrows for this game let's go back to the code for the ball sure it bounces when it hits the edge but we want it to bounce when it hits the paddle or when it hits a brick so we need some ifs it's touching something what's my bricks called that's just called button let's call that bricks so now our sprite for the bricks is actually called bricks and if our ball is touching bricks then let's make him change directions we'll make him point in a different direction it'll be direction plus 170 so he'll almost completely change direction because if we did it plus 180 it would go in the complete opposite direction i need another if if he's touching the middle of my paddle i want him to bounce straight up point in direction it's going to be zero degrees right click and duplicate that if if he's touching let's suck up some of that left color if he's touching the left of the paddle then we'll make him go back that way and if he's touching the right of the paddle will make him go a little bit bounce to the right at 45 degrees that has to be in that forever loop that's looking pretty good but we still need more code so what happens when i miss nothing let's change the background to have a different color down here because then we'll be able to sense if the ball missed the paddle and hit that color we'll go to a gray color we'll just draw a rectangle let's get it way down so you can barely see it go back to the code for the ball and have another condition ball if you're touching that gray color i gotta pick the gray color then broadcast game over and then stop this forever loop all right it worked it stopped the game we could add the code so we could have three lives but let's just leave it at one for now let's go back to the code for the bricks i need a forever loop for the bricks that it just keeps checking to see if it's touching the ball because when it gets hit by the ball it needs to disappear we need an if inside the forever loop so forever if you're touching the ball then hide and delete yourself it works they're disappearing i wish i could get it to go above the top row and just start bouncing around oh and i love it when that happens they just start bouncing around and i just keep racking up the points speaking of points we don't have any points let's get a score we're going to make a variable and call it score when the game first starts score is zero and every time we break a brick we want to add one to the score i need to add another if statement here if the score is ever so much that it means he broke all the bricks then we need to say that he won he won the game you could go on to a new level or something but i'm just going to say that he won the game if he clears the screen one time i need to add the code if score is greater than a certain amount so if we've got 16 across and we've got six rows that's 96 so we're going to have 96 bricks so if the score is greater than 95 that means he won i need to broadcast that he won i'll just say win message if i leave it like this there's going to be a brick left at the end i want him to hide before we say he won or that last brick will still be there instead of starting with the green flag let's add a start button and i'll just write the word start on a button that they already have next we're going to need a sprite to show whenever they win the game and another sprite to show whenever they lose the game so i'll create some text and say game over i want to make that red and then put some yellow highlight on it that looks good i need to right click that sprite and make a copy duplicate it and make that say winner so the winner sprite the code for that when the green flag is clicked he'll hide but when he receives the message win message then he'll show the game over message is just the opposite i'm going to drag the code over from from the winning message so when the green flag is clicked he's going to hide but whenever he receives the message that the game's over then he'll show so the game over message works we've got to get the start button working so this ball doesn't need to move until we click start when the green flag is clicked the start button needs to show and when the start button is clicked he needs to broadcast the message start pressed and then he needs to hide and just get out of the way now we've got to tell the ball to wait for the start press so this whole forever loop needs to be when the start's pressed when space no when i receive start press that's it and whenever the game is won when he receives the message win message the ball needs to stop bouncing around so stop all the other scripts in this sprite so the ball is just waiting on us now what do you think of the speed and hitting the middle of the paddle makes it go straight up that's good if i hit the left it goes left it's perfect we could add some code to where at the beginning of the game you could say how hard you want the game to be and make the paddle bigger or smaller or make the ball go faster or slower depending on how hard the player wanted the game to be let's give it a sound for when the ball hits the brick it's going to be in here whenever it's touching the ball and the brick disappears let's make it make a sound if we go to our sounds that's all we have we have to add a new sound i'm going to grab this boop bang thing i want to grab just one of these sounds and once i have what i want i just copy it to a new sound and that's the sound that i want and i'll rename that sound just bop let's see what it sounds like if we do that every time we hit a brick what we need is to play the sound bop in that if loop if it's touching the ball but we need to hide it before we play the sound it's hard to get these blocks exactly where you want them all right i got my sound turned on i wanted you to be able to hear that sound that i added it really adds to the game leave a comment below if you'd like to see anything else added to this game or if you've done a breakout game give this video a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel so you won't miss any of the other games that i do and it'll make it easier for people to find them
