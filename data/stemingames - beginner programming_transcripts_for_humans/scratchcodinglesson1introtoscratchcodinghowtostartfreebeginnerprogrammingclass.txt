00:01 - welcome to scratch coding this is a
00:04 - series of videos to help you learn to
00:06 - code using scratch
00:08 - with scratch you can create your own
00:11 - stories puzzles and games and whatever
00:14 - else you want to create you're in
00:16 - control of everything in the programs
00:19 - that you write
00:20 - create a free account at scratch.mit.edu
00:25 - so you can do coding with us
00:28 - once you get to scratch.m
00:32 - you could jump right in
00:33 - click on create and start writing code
00:36 - but i recommend that you go to join
00:38 - scratch by just making up a username and
00:42 - password so that you can save your
00:44 - project if you don't want to be online
00:46 - you can download scratch
00:49 - and install it on your computer
00:51 - look down at the bottom where it says
00:53 - download
00:55 - today we're going to create something
00:57 - like this
00:59 - [Music]
01:04 - here in the middle is the code that
01:07 - makes my character move up here is the
01:09 - stage
01:10 - where you can see what's going to happen
01:12 - when you run the code
01:13 - below the stage are all the characters
01:16 - that are in your program i only have one
01:18 - character the lady that's dancing to the
01:21 - right of the characters are the stages
01:24 - for this program there's only one stage
01:27 - on the left side
01:28 - are all the blocks that you use to write
01:31 - your code
01:32 - the blocks that you want to use you'll
01:34 - drag out into the coding area and
01:36 - connect them together
01:40 - different types of blocks have different
01:42 - colors
01:44 - the code for this program says when the
01:46 - green flag is clicked that's up here
01:50 - then i want you to loop forever just
01:52 - keep looping
01:54 - and within that loop go to the next
01:56 - costume
01:58 - and wait for
01:59 - one half of a second
02:01 - and that's the costume for our character
02:04 - this is the code
02:05 - for the one character that we have when
02:07 - we click the green flag
02:09 - [Music]
02:13 - it plays music and goes to the next
02:15 - costume so let's start a new project and
02:18 - i'll show you how i did it once you've
02:20 - created your account then click on
02:22 - create to create a new project the
02:24 - default character is this scratch cat
02:27 - i'll click on the trash can right here
02:29 - to delete him and i want a new
02:31 - background for my stage
02:33 - so
02:35 - i'll go here to choose a backdrop scroll
02:38 - down
02:39 - and pick the spotlight stage and you see
02:42 - up here in my preview
02:43 - i can see that the stage is selected
02:46 - this area here my characters are called
02:48 - sprites
02:50 - scratch calls characters sprites so it
02:53 - says the sprite name
02:55 - different information about the sprites
02:57 - but right here
02:59 - i'll choose a sprite when you pointed a
03:01 - sprite
03:02 - you can see all the different costumes
03:04 - that they have it cycles through the
03:06 - different ones
03:08 - cassie is the one that i had before that
03:10 - was dancing
03:13 - so i can see if any of these other ones
03:15 - are dancing
03:18 - so i'll pick champ this time and you'll
03:20 - see champ is on my preview he's too big
03:23 - for my stage so i'm gonna have to use
03:26 - code to make him smaller how big he is
03:28 - is how he looks and so that's going to
03:31 - be in my looks blocks so i'll click on
03:33 - looks to jump to the purple blocks
03:36 - right now his size is one hundred
03:38 - percent
03:40 - let me see what sixty percent looks like
03:43 - and i'll click on it to run this code
03:46 - and that's much better
03:49 - don't be overwhelmed by all the
03:51 - different kinds of blocks that we have
03:53 - to write code with you don't have to
03:54 - know it all in the beginning and you'll
03:56 - learn what all of these do
03:58 - so we want champ to start dancing when
04:01 - we hit the green flag
04:05 - that's an event
04:07 - when the green flag is clicked
04:10 - there's different ways to make your
04:11 - sprite move but today we're going to
04:14 - just change their costume
04:16 - let's look at champs costumes
04:20 - these are all the different costumes
04:21 - that he has
04:23 - we're just going to make him change from
04:24 - one costume to the other
04:26 - and that's going to be his dance
04:29 - i'll go back to the code
04:31 - so when the green flag is clicked i want
04:34 - him to change costumes that's going to
04:36 - be how he looks
04:37 - we'll go to the next costume
04:40 - so when the green flag is clicked
04:42 - he goes to the next costume
04:45 - but we don't want to keep clicking on
04:47 - that to make it work
04:48 - we want it to loop
04:50 - looping
04:51 - is in the controls blocks
04:59 - so we want him to keep dancing forever
05:02 - so we'll pick the forever loop
05:05 - so when the green flag is clicked we're
05:08 - going to keep looping forever and go to
05:10 - the next costume then the next costume
05:15 - but it's way too fast
05:17 - so we want to pause after he goes to the
05:20 - next costume we want it to pause we can
05:23 - do that with this weight block
05:28 - he's going to wait one second
05:32 - now it
05:33 - goes to the next costume waits a second
05:36 - goes to the next costume waits a second
05:39 - but one second is too slow
05:41 - let's do a half a second which is point
05:43 - five
05:56 - that's a pretty good speed
06:00 - now we just need some music
06:02 - we want the music to start when the
06:04 - green flag is clicked
06:09 - that's an event
06:12 - the music is in the sounds blocks
06:19 - we're going to play the dance celebrate
06:21 - song
06:22 - when the green flag is clicked it's
06:24 - going to play the song dance celebrate
06:27 - but then it's going to stop
06:29 - so we want to make that loop forever so
06:32 - that it'll keep in the song as long as
06:34 - champ wants to dance
06:43 - let's see how that works
06:45 - [Music]
06:53 - hey
06:53 - [Music]
06:55 - the loop is working
06:57 - we'll find out how to get different
06:59 - songs in a later episode
07:01 - let's see how it looks full screen
07:07 - [Music]
07:15 - hey
07:18 - [Music]
07:24 - that's the end of this lesson
07:26 - now it's your turn
07:28 - create a scratch account and create a
07:30 - new project add a background and a
07:33 - character
07:34 - and make your character dance
07:37 - be sure when you select a character
07:39 - that it has multiple costumes
07:41 - so that you can just choose next costume
07:44 - to make your character dance
07:46 - remember you can just point at the
07:47 - character to see all the different
07:50 - movements that they have in their
07:51 - costumes if you can select a background
07:54 - and make a character dance then
07:56 - congratulations you've mastered this
07:59 - lesson
08:00 - this free coding lesson was provided by
08:02 - stem games watch more lessons and keep
08:05 - practicing so you can create new worlds
08:08 - and games and make your ideas come to
08:10 - life i'll see you next time bye
