00:10 - welcome to scratch junior coding this is
00:13 - a series of videos to help you learn to
00:15 - code using scratch junior
00:18 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:20 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:23 - else you want to create
00:25 - you're in control of everything and the
00:27 - programs that you write
00:29 - you will need the scratch junior app on
00:31 - your ipad android tablet or computer
00:35 - scratch junior is a free download and
00:38 - you'll have to get it so that you can do
00:40 - coding with us
00:41 - today you're going to create something
00:43 - like this
00:47 - it's a maze game
00:49 - to make the frog move through the maze
00:53 - i have to click on the arrows
00:58 - and if he hits a wall
00:59 - he just goes back
01:03 - and has to start over
01:09 - but if he can maneuver through all the
01:11 - corners
01:12 - and not touch the wall
01:19 - then he'll make it to the finish
01:22 - you won
01:25 - this maze game
01:26 - is lesson number eight
01:28 - you'll be using a lot of things that
01:30 - you've already learned and there'll be
01:32 - some new things
01:33 - so if this goes too fast for you then
01:36 - you might want to go back and watch the
01:37 - first seven lessons or maybe watch this
01:40 - video a couple times
01:44 - one thing
01:46 - that's new is i have two different
01:48 - screens
01:49 - i have one that's got the maze on it and
01:52 - then once he wins the game then it goes
01:54 - to this one that says you won
01:57 - that's two different scenes
02:01 - and on this scene i have all this
02:03 - confetti falling down
02:06 - and the words you won
02:09 - and on the first scene i have our little
02:11 - frog
02:12 - and the maze
02:14 - and then the finish line is a different
02:17 - character
02:18 - and then all of these different arrows
02:21 - are different characters
02:22 - whenever you click on one of the arrow
02:25 - characters it makes the frog move in
02:27 - that direction
02:29 - like i said this game is more
02:31 - complicated than what we've worked on so
02:34 - far but it really is a lot of fun
02:36 - are you ready to create your own maze
02:39 - click on the plus icon to start a new
02:42 - project
02:44 - and remove the default character
02:47 - and like we did before when we learned
02:49 - how to use the editor
02:51 - we're going to click here on the
02:52 - paintbrush
02:53 - and we have to make a maze
02:55 - what i did
02:57 - with the other one is draw a bunch of
03:00 - rectangles
03:02 - and fill them in
03:06 - and just turned them in all the
03:07 - different directions that i needed
03:11 - but that
03:12 - surely takes a lot more time
03:18 - i like the way it turned out though
03:21 - but what would be even easier
03:24 - is if i picked the line tool
03:26 - and picked a really thick line
03:28 - and just drew a maze
03:45 - we'll go this way
03:48 - that way
03:59 - and to fill the whole screen
04:01 - we have to select it
04:04 - and pick the way it looks blocks
04:08 - and make it look bigger
04:12 - we need another character to go through
04:14 - the maze
04:18 - i had the frog before i think i'll pick
04:19 - him again i like him
04:23 - and i have the frog selected
04:25 - and he's too big he'd be bumping into
04:27 - the walls for sure
04:31 - so let's make him smaller
04:36 - this can be his starting place
04:42 - we have to make the finish line
04:46 - i like green for that
04:54 - just to start out we're going to just
04:56 - put the finish line right here
05:00 - to make it really simple
05:02 - we need one more
05:04 - for now
05:06 - and that's going to be our right arrow
05:10 - but i'll show you how i drew that
05:16 - i made a triangle
05:22 - and let's turn it to the right
05:28 - and move it over
05:31 - fill it with some blue
05:35 - and i made a rectangle
05:39 - if you wanted to
05:42 - you could just as easily
05:46 - pick the line tool
05:48 - and just
05:49 - draw an arrow that works just as good
05:53 - so my arrow is too big
05:58 - i have to
05:59 - pick the blue arrow
06:02 - and then i can make it smaller
06:08 - now what i want is when i click the blue
06:10 - arrow
06:12 - i want the frog to move to the right
06:16 - so we've seen some of these blocks that
06:18 - cause things to happen if you tap on
06:20 - something
06:21 - you can make it do things if something
06:23 - runs into something you can make it do
06:25 - things
06:26 - if you hit the green flag you can make
06:28 - it do things but how can the blue flag
06:32 - say hey i've been touched
06:35 - frog you move right how can he send a
06:37 - message
06:38 - to the frog
06:40 - and tell him to move right
06:42 - what he can do is put it in this
06:44 - envelope
06:45 - he's going to send a message in the
06:47 - envelope to the frog
06:50 - and tell the frog to go right
06:52 - so just to help me remember
06:54 - right i'm going to do red red for right
06:56 - they both start with r
07:03 - so this is the right arrow
07:06 - when it's touched it's going to send a
07:08 - red letter
07:11 - it really doesn't even know where it's
07:12 - in the letter it just knows that if it's
07:14 - touched it's going to send a red letter
07:17 - let's go to the code for the frog
07:20 - so frog
07:21 - if you see
07:23 - somebody has sent out a red letter
07:26 - i want you to open that
07:29 - and then go
07:30 - right
07:36 - let's see if that works
07:39 - and every time
07:41 - i touch the blue arrow the frog goes
07:44 - right
07:46 - now nothing happens when he hits the
07:47 - finish line
07:49 - or hits the walls of the maze
07:51 - we haven't written the code for that
07:54 - but really the new part that you're
07:55 - learning for this lesson
07:57 - is going to be sending a message from
07:59 - this blue arrow to the frog
08:06 - will tell the green finish line
08:10 - when somebody runs into you
08:21 - then i want you to say
08:26 - you won
08:33 - let's see what that looks like
08:37 - so the finish line is going to tell the
08:39 - frog that he won
08:41 - so let's edit the finish line
08:45 - and tell it
08:46 - to spin around
08:52 - and then let's move it over here
08:58 - because we've got to get our frog all
09:00 - the way over here to the other side of
09:01 - the maze
09:03 - so the code for the blue arrow to the
09:06 - right
09:07 - is send a red message
09:11 - we've got to do that three more times
09:12 - for up down and left
09:15 - in a previous lesson you learned how to
09:17 - copy characters
09:20 - let's do that again
09:23 - we're going to copy this character by
09:25 - dragging it over here to our scene
09:30 - and we're going to copy that blue flag
09:32 - again
09:34 - by dragging it into our scene
09:37 - and one more time
09:39 - to make four of them
09:43 - so now we have four arrows
09:45 - we need to edit this one
09:54 - and make it point up
09:57 - edit this one
10:02 - to go left and edit this one
10:15 - to point down
10:17 - so we have right up left down
10:20 - all sending a red message we have to do
10:22 - something different every time
10:25 - and i need to make every one of them
10:27 - smaller
10:51 - so right is red
10:54 - for up
10:57 - let's see it ends with so let's do
10:58 - purple
11:00 - for left
11:03 - let's do yellow
11:06 - for down
11:08 - let's do green
11:09 - [Music]
11:11 - i think we can remember all my codes
11:14 - so let's tell the frog to receive all
11:17 - these messages
11:19 - so red is right
11:25 - there's four different directions we're
11:26 - going to have to figure out
11:30 - we got right
11:33 - left
11:35 - up
11:37 - and down
11:45 - okay left was
11:48 - with the l it's yellow
11:50 - up is
11:52 - purple
11:54 - down is green
11:57 - better remember that right
12:03 - down
12:05 - left
12:08 - we didn't tell him to start over when he
12:10 - hits a wall
12:11 - up
12:12 - right
12:13 - down so all our arrows are working
12:15 - that's good
12:16 - we got to tell him when he hits the wall
12:18 - hey dude you got to start over
12:22 - so we need another code for the frog we
12:24 - have him picked
12:26 - we're going to tell him
12:28 - when you run into something
12:33 - you're going to have to just start over
12:38 - let's see how that works
12:43 - right's working if he goes down and runs
12:45 - into the wall makes him start over if he
12:47 - keeps hitting the wall he has to keep
12:49 - starting over
12:53 - goes right
12:55 - down
12:56 - go froggy you can do it run froggy down
13:00 - froggy finish line
13:03 - yay you won
13:09 - go froggy
13:13 - have you been making any new games
13:15 - do you wait and watch my videos are you
13:17 - coming up with stuff on your own
13:19 - you have learned so much and done so
13:21 - much you could start making some stories
13:23 - and games all on your own
13:27 - that's the end of this lesson
13:30 - now it's your turn
13:32 - create a project
13:33 - and get a character
13:35 - make a maze
13:37 - and make your character move using
13:39 - arrows that you create
13:42 - if you're one of my younger students it
13:44 - is perfectly fine for you to have the
13:46 - finish line right over here
13:48 - and just program one arrow
13:52 - and make your character finish the
13:53 - finish line just right by going over to
13:56 - the right
13:58 - if you can create a maze and make your
14:00 - character move through the maze by
14:02 - tapping on arrows then congratulations
14:06 - you've mastered this lesson
14:09 - this free kids coding lesson was
14:11 - provided by stem and games subscribe
14:14 - watch more lessons and keep practicing
14:16 - and soon you will be creating new worlds
14:19 - and games and making your ideas come to
14:22 - life i'll see you next time

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write you will need the scratch junior app on your ipad android tablet or computer scratch junior is a free download and you'll have to get it so that you can do coding with us today you're going to create something like this it's a maze game to make the frog move through the maze i have to click on the arrows and if he hits a wall he just goes back and has to start over but if he can maneuver through all the corners and not touch the wall then he'll make it to the finish you won this maze game is lesson number eight you'll be using a lot of things that you've already learned and there'll be some new things so if this goes too fast for you then you might want to go back and watch the first seven lessons or maybe watch this video a couple times one thing that's new is i have two different screens i have one that's got the maze on it and then once he wins the game then it goes to this one that says you won that's two different scenes and on this scene i have all this confetti falling down and the words you won and on the first scene i have our little frog and the maze and then the finish line is a different character and then all of these different arrows are different characters whenever you click on one of the arrow characters it makes the frog move in that direction like i said this game is more complicated than what we've worked on so far but it really is a lot of fun are you ready to create your own maze click on the plus icon to start a new project and remove the default character and like we did before when we learned how to use the editor we're going to click here on the paintbrush and we have to make a maze what i did with the other one is draw a bunch of rectangles and fill them in and just turned them in all the different directions that i needed but that surely takes a lot more time i like the way it turned out though but what would be even easier is if i picked the line tool and picked a really thick line and just drew a maze we'll go this way that way and to fill the whole screen we have to select it and pick the way it looks blocks and make it look bigger we need another character to go through the maze i had the frog before i think i'll pick him again i like him and i have the frog selected and he's too big he'd be bumping into the walls for sure so let's make him smaller this can be his starting place we have to make the finish line i like green for that just to start out we're going to just put the finish line right here to make it really simple we need one more for now and that's going to be our right arrow but i'll show you how i drew that i made a triangle and let's turn it to the right and move it over fill it with some blue and i made a rectangle if you wanted to you could just as easily pick the line tool and just draw an arrow that works just as good so my arrow is too big i have to pick the blue arrow and then i can make it smaller now what i want is when i click the blue arrow i want the frog to move to the right so we've seen some of these blocks that cause things to happen if you tap on something you can make it do things if something runs into something you can make it do things if you hit the green flag you can make it do things but how can the blue flag say hey i've been touched frog you move right how can he send a message to the frog and tell him to move right what he can do is put it in this envelope he's going to send a message in the envelope to the frog and tell the frog to go right so just to help me remember right i'm going to do red red for right they both start with r so this is the right arrow when it's touched it's going to send a red letter it really doesn't even know where it's in the letter it just knows that if it's touched it's going to send a red letter let's go to the code for the frog so frog if you see somebody has sent out a red letter i want you to open that and then go right let's see if that works and every time i touch the blue arrow the frog goes right now nothing happens when he hits the finish line or hits the walls of the maze we haven't written the code for that but really the new part that you're learning for this lesson is going to be sending a message from this blue arrow to the frog will tell the green finish line when somebody runs into you then i want you to say you won let's see what that looks like so the finish line is going to tell the frog that he won so let's edit the finish line and tell it to spin around and then let's move it over here because we've got to get our frog all the way over here to the other side of the maze so the code for the blue arrow to the right is send a red message we've got to do that three more times for up down and left in a previous lesson you learned how to copy characters let's do that again we're going to copy this character by dragging it over here to our scene and we're going to copy that blue flag again by dragging it into our scene and one more time to make four of them so now we have four arrows we need to edit this one and make it point up edit this one to go left and edit this one to point down so we have right up left down all sending a red message we have to do something different every time and i need to make every one of them smaller so right is red for up let's see it ends with so let's do purple for left let's do yellow for down let's do green i think we can remember all my codes so let's tell the frog to receive all these messages so red is right there's four different directions we're going to have to figure out we got right left up and down okay left was with the l it's yellow up is purple down is green better remember that right down left we didn't tell him to start over when he hits a wall up right down so all our arrows are working that's good we got to tell him when he hits the wall hey dude you got to start over so we need another code for the frog we have him picked we're going to tell him when you run into something you're going to have to just start over let's see how that works right's working if he goes down and runs into the wall makes him start over if he keeps hitting the wall he has to keep starting over goes right down go froggy you can do it run froggy down froggy finish line yay you won go froggy have you been making any new games do you wait and watch my videos are you coming up with stuff on your own you have learned so much and done so much you could start making some stories and games all on your own that's the end of this lesson now it's your turn create a project and get a character make a maze and make your character move using arrows that you create if you're one of my younger students it is perfectly fine for you to have the finish line right over here and just program one arrow and make your character finish the finish line just right by going over to the right if you can create a maze and make your character move through the maze by tapping on arrows then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free kids coding lesson was provided by stem and games subscribe watch more lessons and keep practicing and soon you will be creating new worlds and games and making your ideas come to life i'll see you next time
