00:11 - welcome to scratch junior coding this is
00:14 - a series of videos to help you learn to
00:16 - code using scratch junior
00:19 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:21 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:24 - else you want to create you're in
00:26 - control of everything in the programs
00:28 - that you write today you're going to
00:30 - create something like this
00:38 - it's a dance party
00:40 - did you get the scratch junior app after
00:42 - the first lesson like i said last time
00:45 - you need an ipad or android tablet with
00:48 - the scratch junior app it's a free
00:50 - download from the apple app store or
00:53 - google play
00:54 - i downloaded scratch junior onto my
00:56 - laptop computer that is available too so
01:00 - get someone to get scratch junior for
01:01 - you however you can get it so that you
01:04 - can do coding with us
01:06 - when you launch scratch junior
01:09 - you'll get this screen
01:10 - go to home you may have other projects
01:13 - here if you've been playing around or if
01:16 - you were with us for lesson one
01:18 - but to create a new project
01:20 - click the plus
01:22 - when you start a project the default
01:24 - character this is called a sprite
01:27 - will appear in scratch junior a sprite
01:30 - is just another name for the characters
01:32 - animals and other things that you
01:34 - control in scratch junior
01:37 - if you want to change this default
01:39 - sprite just click and press on the
01:41 - sprite until an x appears
01:45 - and then click the x and he'll go away
01:48 - to select a new sprite you go to the
01:51 - plus
01:53 - to select a new background you go to
01:56 - this landscape icon
01:57 - and we're going to do a dance party so
02:00 - first i'm going to click the dance stage
02:04 - i'm going to go select the dance stage
02:07 - so this is all my different backgrounds
02:10 - and here is our dance stage
02:13 - with the light shining down on the stage
02:18 - and then i'm going to pick a couple of
02:19 - characters to dance on the stage
02:22 - so click the plus over on the left
02:28 - we want a boy and a girl to dance
02:32 - so we'll pick a girl
02:36 - and then the check mark to select her
02:39 - and i'll just move her
02:42 - move her over a little bit as soon as
02:45 - you hold down on something you have to
02:46 - start moving it if i just hold down on
02:48 - it
02:49 - without starting to move it'll think i
02:51 - want to delete it
02:53 - so i have to hold down on it and then
02:55 - move really quick
02:57 - or it's going to select it to delete it
02:59 - you'll get the hang of it it takes a
03:01 - little practice
03:02 - so now i want to select a boy i'll pick
03:05 - the
03:06 - click on the plus
03:08 - and go down to where the boys and girls
03:10 - are
03:12 - which boy should we pick
03:18 - and then check mark
03:20 - and then he's on the stage so we'll drag
03:23 - him over
03:24 - if you were with us for the last lesson
03:26 - you'll know that this area down here is
03:29 - the programming area and whatever you
03:31 - want the sprite to do
03:33 - has to go into this area
03:35 - well what's new for this lesson is we
03:37 - have two sprites on the page two
03:39 - characters on the page
03:42 - and you have to remember to pick the
03:43 - right one when you're doing
03:45 - the movements for them or the
03:47 - programming for that character
03:49 - you see the boy here
03:52 - the boy is selected right here
03:54 - if i select the girl
03:57 - then you see the little girl picture
03:59 - right here anything that goes right here
04:01 - is going to make the girl move
04:03 - when i pick the boy
04:05 - anything that goes right here will make
04:07 - the boy move
04:09 - you'll see
04:12 - so if i do
04:13 - a right movement
04:16 - it makes the boy move right
04:19 - if i select the girl
04:20 - you'll see she doesn't have any
04:22 - programming yet
04:24 - let's make her go left
04:30 - and if we connect a couple of blocks
04:32 - together
04:33 - then she go left and then right
04:36 - let's make her dance
04:40 - we're going to
04:41 - a green flag to start the program
04:45 - and then go back to the movement blocks
04:47 - which are br blue
04:50 - we'll make her
04:51 - kind of spin to the right a little bit
04:54 - and spin to the left
04:57 - and then jump
04:59 - let's see what that looks like
05:02 - does that look like she's dancing
05:10 - now if we pick the boy
05:11 - we'll see he doesn't have much
05:14 - let's make him
05:16 - jump
05:18 - and then
05:19 - move
05:21 - and
05:22 - then spin a little bit
05:25 - and spin a little more
05:28 - let's see what that looks like
05:33 - if i click this green flag up
05:36 - here it makes the girl move but not the
05:39 - boy
05:40 - do you know why
05:44 - let's look at her code
05:49 - she has a green flag this tells her
05:51 - start whenever somebody clicks the green
05:53 - flag
05:58 - the boy doesn't have that
06:00 - we forgot to put that on there
06:06 - another good thing to do
06:09 - is put an ending block
06:12 - at the end of the code
06:16 - so that tells it to stop
06:18 - but for today's lesson we don't really
06:20 - want him to stop dancing
06:23 - this
06:24 - means just keep going and going and
06:26 - going and going so when i put this on
06:28 - here
06:32 - he'll just keep dancing and keep dancing
06:34 - and keep dancing
06:37 - so let me stop him
06:40 - put him back to where he was in the
06:41 - beginning
06:42 - and click the green flag and that'll
06:44 - make him both dance
06:48 - but she's not still dancing what
06:50 - happened
06:53 - let's stop him
06:56 - what's wrong with her code
06:59 - she doesn't have this repeat block
07:02 - that'll make her just keep dancing
07:04 - forever
07:06 - this little arrow here makes them go
07:09 - back to their starting place
07:14 - and it works they're both dancing are
07:16 - you happy with the way
07:17 - they're dancing
07:21 - you could add more spins and higher
07:23 - jumps
07:24 - and do whatever you want
07:27 - it's your movie that you're making
07:32 - this is going to make it into a bigger
07:34 - screen
07:36 - and then we click the green
07:39 - and they're dancing on the stage
07:44 - there's a way that we can bring some
07:45 - music in here
07:47 - but the only kind of music that they
07:48 - have
07:49 - is this pop
07:51 - let's see what that sounds like
07:54 - is that close enough to some music
07:59 - we're going to tell it
08:02 - whenever you hear whenever you um see
08:05 - the green flag clicked
08:07 - then just pop
08:10 - forever
08:11 - what does that sound like
08:15 - is that good enough for dance music
08:22 - now it's your turn
08:24 - open your scratch junior app
08:28 - click the home
08:30 - click the plus to create a new project
08:33 - you'll probably have scratched the cat
08:35 - whenever you first open it up and you
08:37 - could keep him
08:40 - or you could decide to use different
08:42 - ones
08:48 - get the stage background
08:50 - or if you want your characters to dance
08:52 - somewhere else that's fine
09:14 - pick any two characters that you want
09:20 - add as many movements as you want
09:28 - and make it repeat
09:30 - and then select your other character
09:35 - and see he has no programming done yet
09:37 - you didn't do it yet
09:42 - and then add whatever movements you want
09:43 - for him
09:55 - and make it repeat
10:00 - and then you could use your own voice
10:04 - to make some sounds for their dance
10:06 - or you could add some pops
10:08 - and make that repeat
10:10 - if you can add two characters and make
10:12 - them both dance then congratulations
10:15 - you've mastered the second lesson
10:19 - what else would you like to make your
10:20 - character do
10:22 - would you like to make a longer movie
10:24 - with him
10:28 - would you like to turn him into a video
10:29 - game
10:36 - keep practicing and you'll be creating
10:38 - games and longer stories soon
10:41 - i'll be back to help you on your
10:43 - learning journey
10:44 - be sure to watch the next lesson of
10:46 - scratch junior coding and click

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything in the programs that you write today you're going to create something like this it's a dance party did you get the scratch junior app after the first lesson like i said last time you need an ipad or android tablet with the scratch junior app it's a free download from the apple app store or google play i downloaded scratch junior onto my laptop computer that is
