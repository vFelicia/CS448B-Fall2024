00:00 - [Music]
00:10 - welcome to scratch junior coding this is
00:13 - a series of videos to help you learn to
00:15 - code using scratch junior
00:18 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:20 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:23 - else you want to create you're in
00:25 - control of everything and the programs
00:28 - that you write
00:30 - today you're going to create a story and
00:33 - make your character change the way they
00:35 - look
00:37 - here's an example
00:39 - this is pete and he loves his new white
00:41 - shoes
00:46 - he says i love my white shoes
00:49 - i love my white shoes what's going to
00:52 - happen in this story have you heard this
00:54 - story before
00:57 - and pete's going along and he goes
01:00 - through some strawberries
01:02 - oh
01:03 - what happened to pete's new white shoes
01:07 - they turned all red
01:09 - did pete cry
01:10 - goodness no
01:12 - he just kept going along singing his
01:15 - song
01:16 - i love my red shoes
01:19 - i love my red shoes
01:22 - pete's so cool
01:24 - you like pete's story
01:26 - pick a story of your own
01:29 - and make your character change the way
01:31 - they look
01:33 - in this first scene
01:35 - pete has white shoes
01:37 - and in these other scenes
01:39 - pete has red shoes
01:41 - how can you change the way a character
01:44 - looks
01:46 - we've learned from previous lessons that
01:48 - you can change the way a character looks
01:50 - with the paintbrush
01:53 - but how can you change it right in the
01:55 - middle of your story
01:58 - the secret is
02:00 - in this first scene
02:02 - this is one character
02:04 - and then the one with the red shoes is a
02:06 - completely different character
02:10 - and all of my characters i have some
02:13 - with blue shoes i was going to make him
02:15 - step in some blueberries i've got some
02:18 - pizza cats with no shoes on at
02:20 - all that i was practicing drawing with
02:24 - here's my pile of strawberries that i
02:26 - drew
02:29 - here's the button that i drew that makes
02:31 - you go to a new page
02:33 - let's look at the code for this story
02:36 - when i hit the green flag
02:39 - it's going to start these two pieces of
02:42 - code it's going to make pete go to the
02:44 - right
02:45 - at the same time that he jumps
02:49 - and then it circles around and he jumps
02:51 - again
02:52 - so he's going to go to the right and
02:54 - he's going to jump twice
02:56 - let's see what happens when i hit the
02:58 - green flag
03:01 - so he jumped twice and he went to the
03:03 - right eight steps
03:06 - and he said
03:08 - i love my white shoes
03:12 - and then it just stops
03:14 - until
03:15 - he gets an orange letter
03:18 - how does he get an orange letter
03:20 - when somebody clicks on this
03:23 - orange triangle let's look at the code
03:25 - for the orange triangle
03:28 - it says when somebody clicks on me or
03:31 - touches me
03:32 - then send an orange letter that's all
03:35 - this little triangle has to do
03:37 - and when pete sees that an orange letter
03:39 - has been sent to him
03:41 - he keeps going to the right
03:43 - and jumping
03:45 - and then he goes to scene two
03:50 - and then it just goes to scene two
03:54 - when you get to scene two
03:56 - pete's code
03:58 - says go to the right and jump three
04:00 - times
04:02 - and just wait there until you get a red
04:04 - letter
04:08 - and that's what the orange
04:09 - triangle does it just sends a red letter
04:14 - to let you know to keep going with the
04:15 - code
04:18 - when pete sees the red letter
04:21 - he says i love my red shoes right here
04:25 - and then he jumps off
04:27 - and goes to scene three let's go back
04:29 - and look at scene two again
04:32 - so he jumps a couple times moves to the
04:35 - right but that would not make it go to
04:37 - scene three just moving over to the
04:40 - right will not make it go to scene three
04:43 - the fact that i have scene three right
04:45 - here is what makes it go to scene three
04:49 - let's watch it one more time
04:55 - here's pete the cat and his new shoes
04:57 - we'll hit the green flag
05:01 - i love my white shoes
05:05 - there he goes
05:08 - now he has red shoes
05:10 - and when we hit the orange
05:12 - triangle again
05:15 - i love my red shoes
05:18 - he's just a happy cat whether he has red
05:20 - shoes or white shoes the
05:22 - end so let's start from the beginning
05:27 - click the plus to create a new project
05:32 - hold down on this and then hit the red x
05:34 - to get rid of it
05:36 - and what do i want for a background
05:40 - we'll have our background in the park
05:45 - what do we want for a character i'll hit
05:47 - the plus over there
05:50 - let's get this blue lizard
05:54 - oh he's so big he looks almost like a
05:57 - dinosaur
06:00 - so when we start
06:02 - we'll make our blue lizard move
06:05 - to the right some
06:08 - we need to add something here to give
06:10 - our lizard something to walk through
06:15 - the way i did these strawberries
06:20 - i spent a lot of time
06:23 - drawing a bunch of little circles
06:30 - and then getting my bucket of paint and
06:33 - change into red
06:35 - and then paint them all red
06:48 - and we can make our lizard walk through
06:50 - the strawberries
06:51 - so we could
06:53 - let's go to the code for the lizard
06:55 - we could just
06:57 - see well that's three
07:01 - he needs more we'll try six
07:04 - see what that does
07:06 - but what i want to happen in this story
07:08 - is for our lizard to turn red
07:11 - so we need a red lizard
07:13 - can we change him to red
07:16 - let's see
07:21 - there he is now he's red
07:29 - but now he's already red before he even
07:31 - goes through the strawberries
07:34 - so that won't work for a good story we
07:37 - need a blue lizard
07:39 - and a red lizard
07:43 - let's go get the blue lizard
07:47 - i'm gonna make him just wait
07:55 - we'll start the red guy off right here
08:04 - and he's got to start off invisible
08:08 - all right so this is the way the scene
08:10 - will start and let's see what happens
08:12 - when we hit the green flag
08:16 - let's put an ending block on this code
08:21 - and an ending block on this code
08:25 - just kind of cleaning our program up a
08:27 - little bit
08:33 - so our story can be
08:36 - there was this blue lizard walking in
08:37 - the park one day and he ran over a pile
08:40 - of strawberries
08:42 - and then he was a red lizard
08:44 - or he could be a chameleon that changes
08:47 - colors
08:48 - ooh
08:49 - we could make him a green lizard here
09:06 - and a red lizard when he's on the
09:08 - strawberries and then he changes back to
09:10 - green
09:12 - i hold down on it and drag him to our
09:14 - scene
09:16 - and now i have another green lizard
09:21 - this green lizard right now is invisible
09:27 - where is he
09:29 - right here
09:35 - so let's make him back invisible
09:38 - all right now think about our story when
09:40 - the red lizard gets to the end
09:43 - we want him to turn green but really
09:46 - he's going to be going
09:48 - invisible so we need to add going
09:51 - invisible to the end of his code
09:55 - and for the second green one
09:58 - we need to rename him lizard too
10:02 - they can't both be lizard
10:07 - so for lizard two
10:09 - he needs to just wait
10:16 - and then become visible
10:24 - now how long should he wait we could
10:27 - send a message block a letter
10:30 - one of these letter colors
10:33 - or we could just wait a certain amount
10:35 - of time
10:37 - but we're gonna have to figure out how
10:38 - long
10:39 - let me just make it up 28
10:42 - and then become visible let's see if
10:44 - that works
10:45 - all right reset everybody
10:47 - and go
10:52 - that worked
10:56 - so our chameleon
10:58 - our chameleon lizard is green on the
11:00 - grass
11:01 - when he walks across the strawberries he
11:03 - turns red he gets back on the grass he
11:06 - turns green again
11:07 - good job lizard
11:09 - now i just made up that silly little
11:11 - story
11:12 - you could use any book or any story that
11:14 - you want to do and make at least a
11:17 - couple copies of your character
11:19 - and change the way they look if your
11:22 - story needs multiple scenes
11:24 - then you can just click over here to get
11:26 - a new scene
11:31 - you can change the scene
11:37 - move some things around so it looks like
11:39 - your lizard or your character or whoever
11:41 - it is
11:42 - walked around somewhere
11:49 - so my scene two looks a little different
11:50 - than my scene one
11:52 - and this is where my lizard's gonna walk
11:54 - to
11:56 - going back to scene one i gotta make
11:59 - this lizard two
12:01 - go to the right sum after he appears
12:07 - he's gotta go to the right about three
12:10 - let me turn off that grid
12:13 - then it's gonna go to scene two
12:15 - so i just need to go to my ending blocks
12:19 - and grab scene two
12:21 - we don't need this one
12:22 - anymore and then on scene two
12:26 - i need my green lizard
12:31 - a really fast way to get him
12:33 - is just hold on down on him and drag him
12:36 - over to scene 2. that'll bring all his
12:39 - code and everything with him we don't
12:41 - need all that really
12:45 - he doesn't have to wait or become
12:47 - visible
12:51 - but he is gonna walk over let's make him
12:53 - walk over about six
12:56 - and then end it
12:58 - and up here i want it to say the end
13:00 - that's the end of my little story
13:04 - i'll make that a little bigger
13:11 - make it full screen and see if it works
13:13 - like we think
13:15 - so green flag
13:17 - he turns red then he turns green he goes
13:20 - to the next scene and he says the end
13:23 - that's the end of this lesson now it's
13:25 - your turn
13:26 - create a new project
13:29 - draw a character or select it from some
13:31 - that's already there
13:32 - and change the way they look within your
13:34 - story
13:36 - pick any story that you want or make
13:38 - something up pick a book
13:40 - or a show that you've seen
13:42 - and then use your words to tell the
13:44 - story
13:45 - if you can make one character disappear
13:48 - and another one appear
13:49 - or change characters when you go to
13:51 - another scene so it looks like your
13:53 - character changed the way they look
13:55 - then congratulations you've mastered
13:57 - this lesson
13:59 - this free coding lesson was provided by
14:01 - stem in games watch more lessons and
14:04 - keep practicing so you can create new
14:06 - worlds and games and make your ideas
14:09 - come to life i'll see you next time bye
14:11 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write today you're going to create a story and make your character change the way they look here's an example this is pete and he loves his new white shoes he says i love my white shoes i love my white shoes what's going to happen in this story have you heard this story before and pete's going along and he goes through some strawberries oh what happened to pete's new white shoes they turned all red did pete cry goodness no he just kept going along singing his song i love my red shoes i love my red shoes pete's so cool you like pete's story pick a story of your own and make your character change the way they look in this first scene pete has white shoes and in these other scenes pete has red shoes how can you change the way a character looks we've learned from previous lessons that you can change the way a character looks with the paintbrush but how can you change it right in the middle of your story the secret is in this first scene this is one character and then the one with the red shoes is a completely different character and all of my characters i have some with blue shoes i was going to make him step in some blueberries i've got some pizza cats with no shoes on at all that i was practicing drawing with here's my pile of strawberries that i drew here's the button that i drew that makes you go to a new page let's look at the code for this story when i hit the green flag it's going to start these two pieces of code it's going to make pete go to the right at the same time that he jumps and then it circles around and he jumps again so he's going to go to the right and he's going to jump twice let's see what happens when i hit the green flag so he jumped twice and he went to the right eight steps and he said i love my white shoes and then it just stops until he gets an orange letter how does he get an orange letter when somebody clicks on this orange triangle let's look at the code for the orange triangle it says when somebody clicks on me or touches me then send an orange letter that's all this little triangle has to do and when pete sees that an orange letter has been sent to him he keeps going to the right and jumping and then he goes to scene two and then it just goes to scene two when you get to scene two pete's code says go to the right and jump three times and just wait there until you get a red letter and that's what the orange triangle does it just sends a red letter to let you know to keep going with the code when pete sees the red letter he says i love my red shoes right here and then he jumps off and goes to scene three let's go back and look at scene two again so he jumps a couple times moves to the right but that would not make it go to scene three just moving over to the right will not make it go to scene three the fact that i have scene three right here is what makes it go to scene three let's watch it one more time here's pete the cat and his new shoes we'll hit the green flag i love my white shoes there he goes now he has red shoes and when we hit the orange triangle again i love my red shoes he's just a happy cat whether he has red shoes or white shoes the end so let's start from the beginning click the plus to create a new project hold down on this and then hit the red x to get rid of it and what do i want for a background we'll have our background in the park what do we want for a character i'll hit the plus over there let's get this blue lizard oh he's so big he looks almost like a dinosaur so when we start we'll make our blue lizard move to the right some we need to add something here to give our lizard something to walk through the way i did these strawberries i spent a lot of time drawing a bunch of little circles and then getting my bucket of paint and change into red and then paint them all red and we can make our lizard walk through the strawberries so we could let's go to the code for the lizard we could just see well that's three he needs more we'll try six see what that does but what i want to happen in this story is for our lizard to turn red so we need a red lizard can we change him to red let's see there he is now he's red but now he's already red before he even goes through the strawberries so that won't work for a good story we need a blue lizard and a red lizard let's go get the blue lizard i'm gonna make him just wait we'll start the red guy off right here and he's got to start off invisible all right so this is the way the scene will start and let's see what happens when we hit the green flag let's put an ending block on this code and an ending block on this code just kind of cleaning our program up a little bit so our story can be there was this blue lizard walking in the park one day and he ran over a pile of strawberries and then he was a red lizard or he could be a chameleon that changes colors ooh we could make him a green lizard here and a red lizard when he's on the strawberries and then he changes back to green i hold down on it and drag him to our scene and now i have another green lizard this green lizard right now is invisible where is he right here so let's make him back invisible all right now think about our story when the red lizard gets to the end we want him to turn green but really he's going to be going invisible so we need to add going invisible to the end of his code and for the second green one we need to rename him lizard too they can't both be lizard so for lizard two he needs to just wait and then become visible now how long should he wait we could send a message block a letter one of these letter colors or we could just wait a certain amount of time but we're gonna have to figure out how long let me just make it up 28 and then become visible let's see if that works all right reset everybody and go that worked so our chameleon our chameleon lizard is green on the grass when he walks across the strawberries he turns red he gets back on the grass he turns green again good job lizard now i just made up that silly little story you could use any book or any story that you want to do and make at least a couple copies of your character and change the way they look if your story needs multiple scenes then you can just click over here to get a new scene you can change the scene move some things around so it looks like your lizard or your character or whoever it is walked around somewhere so my scene two looks a little different than my scene one and this is where my lizard's gonna walk to going back to scene one i gotta make this lizard two go to the right sum after he appears he's gotta go to the right about three let me turn off that grid then it's gonna go to scene two so i just need to go to my ending blocks and grab scene two we don't need this one anymore and then on scene two i need my green lizard a really fast way to get him is just hold on down on him and drag him over to scene 2. that'll bring all his code and everything with him we don't need all that really he doesn't have to wait or become visible but he is gonna walk over let's make him walk over about six and then end it and up here i want it to say the end that's the end of my little story i'll make that a little bigger make it full screen and see if it works like we think so green flag he turns red then he turns green he goes to the next scene and he says the end that's the end of this lesson now it's your turn create a new project draw a character or select it from some that's already there and change the way they look within your story pick any story that you want or make something up pick a book or a show that you've seen and then use your words to tell the story if you can make one character disappear and another one appear or change characters when you go to another scene so it looks like your character changed the way they look then congratulations you've mastered this lesson this free coding lesson was provided by stem in games watch more lessons and keep practicing so you can create new worlds and games and make your ideas come to life i'll see you next time bye bye
