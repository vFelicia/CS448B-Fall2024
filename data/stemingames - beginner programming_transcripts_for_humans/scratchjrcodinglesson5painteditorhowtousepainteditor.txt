00:29 - today
00:30 - you're going to create your own
00:32 - characters
00:33 - when i created this game
00:35 - i had to create these alien characters
00:37 - they weren't already in scratch
00:42 - i had to create these bullets to shoot
00:44 - the aliens
00:46 - and the arrows
00:48 - to make my rocket ship move
00:51 - today you're going to create your own
00:53 - character
00:55 - i'm going to show you how by creating
00:57 - this spinner
01:04 - you will need the scratch junior app on
01:06 - your ipad android tablet or computer
01:09 - scratch jr is a free download
01:12 - and you'll have to get it so that you
01:14 - can do coding with us
01:16 - launch scratch junior and click on the
01:18 - home icon
01:20 - click on the plus to start a new project
01:23 - you can hold your finger down on
01:25 - whatever character is on the screen
01:28 - and click the x to delete it
01:31 - up here you can pick any background that
01:33 - you want
01:34 - we've done that on all the exercises
01:37 - that we've done so far
01:38 - the new thing that we're going to do
01:40 - today is learn how to draw our own
01:42 - characters
01:44 - you can put characters on the screen
01:47 - right here by clicking this plus
01:52 - the ones up at the top are the ones that
01:54 - i've created you'll see the alien that i
01:56 - used and the arrows that i used to do
01:59 - that game
02:01 - these are all the characters
02:04 - that come with scratch junior
02:06 - but if they don't have the character
02:08 - that you want or you want to draw your
02:10 - own
02:11 - you can just click on this little
02:12 - paintbrush
02:15 - these are different shapes that you can
02:16 - make
02:17 - the squiggly line means that you can
02:19 - draw whatever kind of squiggly line or
02:22 - straight line or anything that you want
02:27 - this left arrow undoes things that you
02:30 - do
02:32 - the right arrow will redo it back
02:38 - this circle thing
02:39 - makes a circle
02:42 - square thing makes a square or a
02:44 - rectangle
02:47 - triangle you guessed it
02:50 - if i pick a different color
02:52 - then i can be doing the same kind of
02:54 - thing
02:57 - in the other color
03:01 - these change how thick it is so if i
03:04 - have a triangle picked
03:05 - and a really thick line in the color red
03:09 - it's going to draw me a thick tr red
03:11 - triangle
03:13 - this bucket over here dumps a bucket of
03:15 - paint
03:18 - inside whatever you want
03:21 - i'll pick some yellow paint
03:30 - and if this is the character that i like
03:35 - i could put it right on my screen
03:37 - and like the other character i can hold
03:39 - down on this and delete it
03:42 - and i want to do a different character
03:47 - the spinner thing that i made is a
03:48 - little tricky
03:50 - i need a circle in the middle
03:52 - and it really has to be in the middle of
03:54 - my screen
03:56 - or it's going to
03:59 - so wobble
03:59 - just use a circle and drag a little red
04:01 - circle there
04:04 - i want the blades of my spinner to be
04:07 - blue
04:12 - and instead of dragging a circle i'll
04:14 - make those
04:17 - an oval shape
04:21 - and i want to fill it in with blue
04:25 - and then i don't have to keep drawing a
04:27 - bunch of different blades i can take my
04:29 - stamp tool which is really just a copy
04:32 - and copy that
04:35 - copy it again how many blades do we need
04:39 - about five
04:43 - the arrow will let me drag things away
04:47 - to wherever i want
04:50 - this rotate
04:52 - lets me rotate them
05:03 - and then pick my select tool and drag
05:05 - them
05:19 - what i'm drawing for you today is a
05:20 - little complicated but you can draw
05:23 - anything that you want
05:27 - when i'm happy with what i've drawn
05:29 - i'll click the check to save it and it
05:31 - sticks it right there on the screen
05:34 - now i want a stem to hold up my
05:36 - spinner so i have to have another
05:39 - character that's just the stick
05:42 - and you'll see in my other project i did
05:44 - already have a stick but i'm going to do
05:45 - a new stick
05:48 - we will have
05:50 - blues fine we'll make it about this
05:52 - thick
05:54 - and it needs to come from the middle
05:57 - about right there
05:59 - whoops got to pick my drawing line
06:12 - and i want my spinner to be in front
06:22 - so a lot of times
06:24 - we have
06:25 - the screen flag to start our programs
06:29 - but today i want
06:30 - the spinner to spin
06:32 - whenever i touch it whenever i tap on it
06:36 - or whenever i click on it with my arrow
06:42 - so once i click on it it's going to spin
06:45 - and keep doing that
06:50 - so that would be good if it was a
06:52 - windmill
06:55 - if the wind just kept blowing it and
06:57 - blowing it
07:05 - but what i want to do today
07:12 - is make it spin
07:14 - when i touch it so i'm going to tell it
07:16 - to just spin a little bit 50 times
07:28 - this you'll remember
07:30 - makes it go faster
07:32 - if i pick
07:33 - the one on the right it goes faster so
07:35 - it's going to spin 50 times
07:37 - faster
07:40 - then i'm going to slow it down a little
07:41 - bit
07:46 - and then make it spin
07:47 - [Music]
07:49 - about 20 more times
08:01 - and then slow it down even more
08:05 - and spin about five more times
08:08 - so
08:10 - i want to make it look like i touch it
08:12 - and then it spins for a while and then
08:15 - it slows down and then it finally stops
08:20 - and then if i touch it again it goes
08:22 - fast
08:25 - and slows down and stops
08:29 - so
08:30 - it says do the code whenever you touch
08:32 - it
08:33 - make the spinner go really fast for 50
08:36 - times
08:37 - then medium speed for 20 times
08:40 - and then slow speed for five more times
08:56 - let's look at the different parts in the
08:58 - paint editor
09:01 - this first one over here
09:03 - if you click on this that'll help you
09:05 - undo something that you've done and if
09:08 - you change your mind then
09:10 - this arrow to the right will redo
09:13 - something that you've undone
09:16 - all of these are different shapes that
09:18 - you can
09:20 - make and going to number four
09:23 - you can change the name of whatever it
09:25 - is that you've drawn right here
09:29 - these scissors
09:31 - cut something
09:32 - basically delete it
09:34 - this stamp
09:37 - makes another copy of something
09:40 - you use seven
09:41 - these arrows to rotate something make it
09:44 - spin around
09:46 - arrow select something and then you can
09:48 - drag it around and move it around on the
09:50 - screen
09:51 - nine is
09:52 - you click the check whenever you want to
09:54 - save something
09:58 - 10 is a paint bucket whenever you want
10:00 - to fill in
10:01 - something a certain color you just dump
10:03 - a bucket of paint on it
10:06 - 11 is a camera whenever you want to take
10:08 - a picture of what you've done
10:11 - 12 all of these are all the different
10:13 - colors that you have available
10:18 - 13 these are all the different lines
10:22 - that you have if you want a really thick
10:24 - line you would pick this one
10:26 - if you want a really thin line you would
10:27 - pick this one
10:29 - if we go to this
10:31 - old project i did a long time ago
10:43 - and we wanted to pretend that the
10:46 - students in here were learning some math
10:50 - i could create a math problem in here
10:59 - i'm going to select the black marker
11:02 - and
11:04 - the squiggly line means i can write
11:05 - whatever i want
11:07 - i'm going to write 1
11:09 - plus
11:11 - 1.
11:15 - and save that
11:17 - and it put that right on my screen
11:22 - if we wanted some birds flying in the
11:24 - sky
11:25 - for this project
11:29 - i could go to create a new sprite
11:33 - click on the paint brush
11:42 - well i didn't like the way that one
11:43 - turned out neither one of those let's
11:44 - cut those out
11:47 - do you ever draw a bird like that
11:51 - cut
11:52 - that
11:54 - and draw with the black
12:11 - all right i'll save my birds
12:19 - we need to make them smaller too
12:28 - they're flying out of that tree right
12:30 - there
12:32 - there
12:34 - now it's your turn
12:36 - what would you like to draw
12:39 - after you create your character you
12:40 - could
12:41 - of course make it
12:43 - jump or roll or do whatever you want
12:46 - but the main point of this lesson is to
12:48 - be able to draw your own character
12:50 - and if you can draw your own character
12:52 - then congratulations you've mastered
12:54 - this lesson
12:58 - this free kids coding lesson was
13:00 - provided by stem and games subscribe
13:03 - watch more lessons and keep practicing
13:06 - and soon you will be creating new worlds
13:08 - and games and making your ideas come to
13:11 - life i'll see you next time
