00:10 - welcome to scratch junior coding this is
00:13 - a series of videos to help you learn to
00:15 - code using scratch junior
00:18 - on scratch junior you can create your
00:20 - own stories riddles games and whatever
00:23 - else you want to create
00:25 - you're in control of everything and the
00:27 - programs that you write
00:29 - for today's lesson we're going to
00:31 - explore some built-in help that you'll
00:33 - find in scratch junior i know you're
00:35 - familiar with the area down here that
00:38 - has all your projects have you looked
00:40 - across the top the question mark
00:43 - or this book
00:44 - let's look what's in this book
00:46 - there's tabs down at the bottom
00:50 - and this
00:51 - this one says interface guide
00:54 - it shows you all the different parts of
00:56 - your screen
00:58 - so for example if you don't know what
01:01 - this little yellow tab is over on the
01:03 - top right
01:06 - you can click on it and it says that's
01:08 - project information
01:09 - that's where you can change the title of
01:11 - your project
01:13 - see when the project was created and
01:16 - share the project so if you have any
01:18 - questions about part of your screen what
01:20 - it does you can just click on it and
01:22 - play with it or you could come here to
01:24 - the interface guide and read about it
01:26 - the paint editor guide
01:28 - shows you all the different parts of the
01:30 - paint editor
01:31 - if you've wondered what the scissors do
01:34 - and you couldn't figure it out in the
01:35 - paint editor
01:39 - you can see that that's cut
01:41 - after selecting the cut tool you can tap
01:43 - the character or shape to remove it from
01:46 - the canvas
01:47 - so you click on the scissors and then
01:50 - you would click on part of your picture
01:51 - and it'll cut it out and there's one
01:53 - more guide in here
01:55 - the blocks guide
01:58 - that goes through all the different
02:00 - blocks and tells you what they do
02:02 - it's really easy to just pull a block
02:05 - into the programming area
02:07 - and play with it and see what it does
02:09 - but if you would rather read about it or
02:11 - you can't figure it out then you can
02:13 - come to the blocks guide and read about
02:15 - what each block does
02:17 - you can read about all the different
02:18 - triggering blocks and what each of those
02:20 - does
02:22 - the different motion blocks
02:27 - all the different looks blocks the
02:29 - purple ones what does each one of those
02:31 - do
02:34 - the sound blocks
02:36 - all the different
02:38 - control blocks are the orange ones
02:42 - and finally the end blocks the red ones
02:45 - it tells you what each of those does
02:47 - looking across the top again
02:51 - we could go home or go to scratch junior
02:53 - but this is the same question mark that
02:56 - we saw whenever we were looking at the
02:58 - projects
02:59 - let me go ahead and go back home
03:01 - so you can see
03:03 - see that's the same question mark we
03:05 - were just in the books that's where we
03:07 - found all the guides
03:09 - let's go see what's under the question
03:11 - mark
03:12 - there's a video here you could watch
03:14 - these are sample projects
03:17 - scratch junior gives you eight sample
03:19 - projects to look and see what the code
03:22 - does for example under the c let me
03:24 - click on that
03:26 - you'll see in this project there's four
03:28 - characters
03:29 - there's one scene i'll click the
03:31 - green flag to see what it does
03:36 - so we have a sea horse going up and down
03:39 - and the fish looks like they're dancing
03:40 - with each other let's look at the code
03:42 - to see what the seahorse is doing
03:46 - so he's moving to the right
03:49 - at the same time that he's going up
03:51 - and then down
03:52 - up and then down in a loop
03:55 - oh i didn't see the starfish down here
03:57 - let's see what he's doing
04:02 - this set his speed
04:05 - and then
04:06 - this code makes him turn to the right
04:09 - and then he turns to the left two and
04:11 - then he turns to the right again let's
04:13 - see if we change his speed
04:19 - look how fast he's going now
04:22 - let's change something that the seahorse
04:24 - does
04:25 - let's make him go
04:28 - up
04:30 - five
04:36 - he's jumping up a lot higher now
04:38 - let's change something about the green
04:40 - fish
04:42 - let's make him
04:44 - twist
04:52 - you see that this is different than your
04:54 - other projects you can't add a scene you
04:57 - can't add characters but you can play
04:59 - with the code just to learn how to do it
05:01 - it's a great place to practice
05:05 - if i go back into under the sea after i
05:08 - left that project you see the changes
05:10 - that i made did not stay
05:13 - so you can't mess these projects up you
05:15 - can't save your changes but you also
05:17 - can't mess them up so feel free to come
05:19 - in here and just play with them
05:22 - let's see what the project dance is all
05:24 - about
05:25 - i'll make this full screen and then
05:27 - we'll click the green flag
05:30 - [Music]
05:51 - well that was fun
05:56 - in the first scene
05:58 - this makes the sound
06:00 - this makes the boy move
06:02 - and it repeats two times
06:04 - and then it waits
06:05 - and then goes to scene two
06:09 - and in scene two this is its recorded
06:11 - sound
06:13 - and it repeats all this twice
06:16 - and it moves over to the right and goes
06:18 - to scene three
06:20 - and then in scene three
06:23 - this is repeated three times
06:25 - and then all of this is repeated two
06:28 - times
06:29 - did you know that you could have a loop
06:31 - inside of a loop
06:33 - you could add anything that you want
06:35 - into the code and see how it changes
06:37 - things
06:39 - [Music]
06:42 - yeah
06:43 - inside that loop i made it go up
06:50 - but for today what you need to do is
06:52 - come into these sample projects and just
06:55 - play around with it and open them up and
06:57 - look at the code and see what they're
06:58 - doing come look at these animals and see
07:00 - that whenever you tap the pig
07:04 - it's gonna make this sound
07:06 - and then jump up
07:08 - or when you
07:10 - when you tap the horse
07:12 - what does it do
07:15 - it plays this recorded sound
07:19 - and then he wiggles back and forth
07:21 - so play around with those sample
07:23 - projects see what you can learn from
07:25 - them and that's the end of this lesson
07:27 - this free coding lesson was provided by
07:29 - stem in games watch more lessons and
07:32 - keep practicing so you can create new
07:34 - worlds and games and make your ideas
07:37 - come to life i'll see you next time bye

welcome to scratch junior coding this is a series of videos to help you learn to code using scratch junior on scratch junior you can create your own stories riddles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write for today's lesson we're going to explore some builtin help that you'll find in scratch junior i know you're familiar with the area down here that has all your projects have you looked across the top the question mark or this book let's look what's in this book there's tabs down at the bottom and this this one says interface guide it shows you all the different parts of your screen so for example if you don't know what this little yellow tab is over on the top right you can click on it and it says that's project

blocks guide and read about what each block does you can read about all the different triggering blocks and what each of those does the different motion blocks all the different looks blocks the purple ones what does each one of those do the sound blocks all the different control blocks are the orange ones and finally the end blocks the red ones it tells you what each of those does looking across the top again we could go home or go to scratch junior but this is the same question mark that we saw whenever we were looking at the projects let me go ahead and go back home so you can see see that's the same question mark we were just in the books that's where we found all the guides let's go see what's under the question mark there's a video here you could watch these are sample projects scratch junior gives you eight sample projects to look and see what the code does for example under the c let me click on that you'll see in this project there's four characters there's one
