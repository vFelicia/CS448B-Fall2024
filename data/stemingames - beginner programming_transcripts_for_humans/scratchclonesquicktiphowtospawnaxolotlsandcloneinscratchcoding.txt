00:01 - welcome scratchers today we're doing a
00:04 - quick tip about how to clone sprites
00:08 - many times in our games we need a lot of
00:10 - sprites
00:12 - and the best way to do that is with
00:14 - clones
00:15 - these are the three blocks that you'll
00:17 - need when creating a clone
00:20 - this starting block when i start as a
00:21 - clone
00:22 - all the code underneath that will tell
00:24 - your sprite what to do when he starts as
00:26 - a clone
00:27 - i'm on this yellow axolotl right now
00:30 - all this underneath here tells him what
00:32 - to do when he starts as a clone if i
00:35 - just click create clone of myself
00:38 - that will make this yellow axolotl
00:40 - create a clone of himself inside the
00:42 - code here it changes the color it's why
00:44 - it's blue
00:45 - and i can just click that as many times
00:47 - as i want
00:52 - inside my program
00:54 - the egg code
00:55 - says whenever i click the egg that's
00:57 - what creates the clone
01:00 - it's going to create a clone of whatever
01:02 - type i have selected
01:05 - let's start with something simpler
01:07 - so we just have some basic code to make
01:09 - this axolotl do something
01:13 - but instead of creating one when the
01:15 - green flag is clicked we want to do
01:17 - clones
01:20 - clones are under the control blocks
01:24 - and when i start as a clone i want to do
01:26 - all this
01:30 - just drag the code from when green flag
01:32 - clicked over to when i start as a clone
01:35 - and the way you start a clone
01:38 - is by creating a clone
01:41 - since the code is in with this purple
01:43 - axolotl
01:44 - it's going to be a clone of himself
01:47 - if we wanted it to be in
01:50 - another sprite
01:52 - we wouldn't have this
01:54 - egg
01:55 - axolotl egg create a clone of himself
01:58 - he's going to create a clone of the
02:00 - purple axolotl
02:05 - and there he created a clone i can click
02:08 - create another clone
02:13 - just create as many as i want
02:18 - when you get done with a clone you want
02:20 - to use the block delete this clone but
02:23 - in this case i'm not done with the
02:24 - axolotl so i'm not going to delete them
02:27 - we can just keep creating more
02:30 - let's look at some other examples
02:33 - in my full axolotl game
02:35 - you'll see that these axolotls have a
02:37 - lot of code when they start as a clone
02:46 - and the regular sprite stays hidden the
02:48 - whole time
02:53 - the clones are created in the code for
02:55 - the egg
02:57 - because when i click on the egg
02:59 - i want it to create a clone of the type
03:01 - of axolotl that you've selected
03:10 - in my pizza clicker game every time you
03:12 - click
03:13 - a tiny pizza clone flies out
03:23 - and that's in this code when i started a
03:25 - clone
03:26 - you can watch the full video for how to
03:28 - create this pizza clicker game but
03:31 - creating the clone is hidden in this
03:33 - dough code
03:37 - if the mouse is down
03:40 - it creates a clone of tiny pizza right
03:42 - here
03:50 - one more example is my breakout game
03:54 - all of these bricks are drawn by this
03:57 - one sprite they're all clones
04:00 - when he starts as a clone then he has
04:02 - all the code that he needs to be a clone
04:05 - when he gets hit by the ball he's going
04:06 - to disappear and delete this clone right
04:08 - here you'll see i have the code for
04:10 - delete the clone because once it gets
04:12 - hit by the ball it's not needed anymore
04:27 - even though there's not an infinite
04:28 - number of blocks that need to be created
04:30 - i still thought it was best to use clone
04:32 - for this
04:34 - so the way i did that
04:36 - six times because i'm going to need six
04:38 - rows i did a repeat loop
04:41 - and then 16 across
04:45 - so it creates a clone creates a clone
04:47 - creates a clone 16 times
04:50 - and then it goes to the next one
04:52 - does that 16 times goes to the next one
04:54 - and it does that six times
04:57 - so it's just
04:58 - a loop inside a loop
05:00 - and inside there it creates a clone of
05:02 - myself
05:06 - because there's so many blocks that need
05:08 - to be created
05:10 - in my tic tac toe game i could have used
05:13 - clones for this
05:14 - there's
05:15 - three across and three down so there's
05:17 - nine clones here of where the x's and
05:20 - o's can go and i've seen other
05:22 - programmers use clones to do that
05:25 - but i thought the best way to do that
05:27 - was to just have nine
05:29 - sprites
05:31 - so i didn't use clones to make the
05:33 - tic-tac-toe game
05:35 - i hope you've enjoyed this quick tip
05:37 - give me a thumbs up and subscribe below
05:40 - whenever you have to create a lot of
05:41 - characters remember to use these three
05:44 - coding blocks to clone your sprite i'll
05:46 - see you next time bye bye

welcome scratchers today we're doing a quick tip about how to clone sprites many times in our games we need a lot of sprites and the best way to do that is with clones these are the three blocks that you'll need when creating a clone this starting block when i start as a clone all the code underneath that will tell your sprite what to do when he starts as a clone i'm on this yellow axolotl right now all this underneath here tells him what to do when he starts as a clone if i just click create clone of myself that will make this yellow axolotl create a clone of himself inside the code here it changes the color it's why it's blue and i can just click that as many times as i want inside my program the egg code says whenever i click the egg that's what creates the clone it's going to create a clone of whatever type i have selected let's start with something simpler so we just have some basic code to make this axolotl do something but instead of creating one when the green flag is clicked we want to do clones clones are under the control blocks and when i start as a clone i want to do all this just drag the code from when green flag clicked over to when i start as a clone and the way you start a clone is by creating a clone since the code is in with this purple axolotl it's going to be a clone of himself if we wanted it to be in another sprite we wouldn't have this egg axolotl egg create a clone of himself he's going to create a clone of the purple axolotl and there he created a clone i can click create another clone just create as many as i want when you get done with a clone you want to use the block delete this clone but in this case i'm not done with the axolotl so i'm not going to delete them we can just keep creating more let's look at some other examples in my full axolotl game you'll see that these axolotls have a lot of code when they start as a clone and the regular sprite stays hidden the whole time the clones are created in the code for the egg because when i click on the egg i want it to create a clone of the type of axolotl that you've selected in my pizza clicker game every time you click a tiny pizza clone flies out and that's in this code when i started a clone you can watch the full video for how to create this pizza clicker game but creating the clone is hidden in this dough code if the mouse is down it creates a clone of tiny pizza right here one more example is my breakout game all of these bricks are drawn by this one sprite they're all clones when he starts as a clone then he has all the code that he needs to be a clone when he gets hit by the ball he's going to disappear and delete this clone right here you'll see i have the code for delete the clone because once it gets hit by the ball it's not needed anymore even though there's not an infinite number of blocks that need to be created i still thought it was best to use clone for this so the way i did that six times because i'm going to need six rows i did a repeat loop and then 16 across so it creates a clone creates a clone creates a clone 16 times and then it goes to the next one does that 16 times goes to the next one and it does that six times so it's just a loop inside a loop and inside there it creates a clone of myself because there's so many blocks that need to be created in my tic tac toe game i could have used clones for this there's three across and three down so there's nine clones here of where the x's and o's can go and i've seen other programmers use clones to do that but i thought the best way to do that was to just have nine sprites so i didn't use clones to make the tictactoe game i hope you've enjoyed this quick tip give me a thumbs up and subscribe below whenever you have to create a lot of characters remember to use these three coding blocks to clone your sprite i'll see you next time bye bye
