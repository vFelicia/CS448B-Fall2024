00:01 - welcome to scratch coding with scratch
00:04 - you can create your own stories puzzles
00:06 - games and whatever else you want to
00:08 - create
00:09 - you're in control of everything and the
00:11 - programs that you write
00:14 - today we're going to create a game where
00:17 - you can spawn axolotls
00:19 - you can pick different colors and spawn
00:21 - as many as you want
00:25 - if you're a novice at scratch then you
00:28 - can remix my code and i'll give you a
00:30 - link to that project in the description
00:33 - below
00:34 - if you're more hardcore
00:36 - then you can just remix my project
00:38 - axolotl resources and write all the code
00:40 - yourself
00:42 - if you're a code ninja then you may want
00:44 - to create a new project
00:46 - and get your own resources and write
00:48 - your code
00:50 - so we're going to start at novice level
00:53 - there's a link below to my project spawn
00:56 - axolotls you can remix this project and
00:59 - change whatever you want first let's run
01:01 - the program and see what it does
01:04 - when you click on the egg it spawns
01:05 - axolotls
01:10 - you can also hit the space bar
01:13 - this is the easter color axolotls
01:16 - there's also camouflage
01:22 - neon color
01:27 - and this button
01:28 - makes an axolotl let's keep an eye on
01:30 - him that changes color as he goes along
01:34 - so the axolotls just go off the screen a
01:36 - little bit turn around and come back in
01:37 - another direction as they go back and
01:40 - forth they get smaller
01:41 - and darker the axolotls go at different
01:44 - speeds and as they get smaller into the
01:47 - background you can really tell that some
01:48 - of them are going really slow and others
01:50 - are going fast it's fun to just create a
01:53 - bunch of these and let them swim around
01:55 - like you have an aquarium
01:57 - let's look at the code for the egg when
02:00 - the program starts the first type of
02:02 - axolotl that it's going to make
02:04 - is this purple kind
02:06 - and it goes to the front layer
02:08 - because you want the egg in front of all
02:10 - the other axolotls that have been
02:12 - created
02:13 - when this sprite is clicked when the egg
02:15 - is clicked it makes the egg move it
02:18 - glides a little bit
02:19 - and it creates a clone of the type of
02:21 - axolotl that's selected
02:25 - it does the same thing when the space
02:27 - key is pressed
02:30 - notice on these buttons
02:32 - whichever one i select has a yellow
02:34 - border
02:37 - let's look at the code for the buttons
02:39 - when i click the easter button
02:42 - it's going to select this purple axolotl
02:44 - as the type
02:46 - but you can't see it okay this is the
02:48 - purple one brown yellow
02:50 - and this one is all colors so it's going
02:52 - to select this purple one as the type
02:55 - and it's going to broadcast easter
02:58 - to let all the other buttons know that
02:59 - easter is selected let's look at the
03:01 - costumes for the easter button
03:04 - b is just the normal easter
03:07 - and b2 is the one that has a yellow
03:09 - border for when it's selected
03:12 - and you'll see the code whenever it's
03:14 - clicked it selects the one that has the
03:16 - yellow border b2
03:18 - if anything else is clicked then it
03:20 - changes back to the one
03:23 - that has easter not selected when the
03:25 - game starts or if it's clicked on it's
03:28 - going to change to b2 because that's the
03:30 - one that's highlighted but if any of
03:32 - these other ones are selected then it's
03:34 - going to change it back to just b
03:36 - which is not a yellow border same thing
03:38 - for all these other buttons they have a
03:39 - couple of different costumes and they
03:41 - switch to the highlighted one whenever
03:43 - they're clicked on so all this extra
03:45 - code whenever it receives these messages
03:47 - is just to change the border around the
03:49 - biggest part of this is setting the
03:51 - right type so if camo is clicked on then
03:54 - it's going to change the type that's
03:56 - just a variable to brown
03:59 - if neon is clicked on
04:01 - then it's going to change the type
04:03 - to yellow so these buttons all they do
04:06 - is set the variable type so you don't
04:08 - know what type of axolotl to create
04:11 - the axolotl actually gets created in the
04:14 - egg code right here whenever it's
04:16 - clicked
04:17 - create a clone of whatever type is
04:19 - selected and inside the axolotls
04:24 - when he starts as a clone it has all the
04:26 - code to move back and forth to get
04:28 - smaller to get darker
04:30 - so the main sprite is hidden whenever
04:32 - the green flag is clicked but every time
04:35 - it starts as a clone it's going to pick
04:37 - a random color
04:39 - and a random speed between 6 and 10
04:42 - it sets the size
04:44 - tells him to go in front of all these
04:45 - other axolotls but then go backward so
04:48 - you're not in front of the egg or in
04:50 - front of the buttons
04:51 - point in a random direction
04:54 - and you're going to be moving left and
04:55 - right
04:56 - not spinning all around
04:59 - and forever you just keep moving back
05:00 - and forth
05:02 - as long as they're pretty big it's going
05:03 - to make it smaller
05:05 - and make it go slower because when
05:07 - things are further away it looks like
05:08 - they're going slower also when things
05:10 - are further away especially if they're
05:12 - in the water then they're not going to
05:14 - look so bright so we change the
05:16 - brightness as they go back
05:18 - we also go to next costume i didn't show
05:20 - you that
05:21 - we're going through
05:23 - 40 different costumes to make him swim
05:25 - around
05:28 - so the motion just going through next
05:29 - costume next costume makes it look like
05:31 - he's swimming and the code for all these
05:33 - axolotls is the same when they start as
05:36 - a clone
05:37 - they do the same thing
05:38 - and this random color effect even though
05:40 - i picked neon
05:42 - it's going to be a random neon kind of
05:44 - color they're not all the same because
05:46 - of this random color effect if you were
05:48 - to remix this project what would you
05:51 - want to add what could we change to make
05:53 - it even better leave a comment below
05:55 - about what should be added to make this
05:57 - even better and after you've made
05:59 - changes yourself add your project to my
06:01 - axolotl studio
06:04 - if you're not a novice and you're more
06:06 - hardcore
06:07 - then you may want to start with this
06:10 - i'm also going to share this project
06:13 - axolotl resources
06:17 - i've given you the background
06:23 - and the costumes for the sprites
06:30 - but not the code
06:31 - you'll have to write your own code let's
06:34 - just write something real quick
06:36 - so for this yellow axolotl
06:40 - we need when green flag clicked
06:43 - and we need him to show
06:46 - he's too small
06:50 - he's at 20 right there
06:55 - let's set him to 40.
07:03 - go to a random position
07:10 - we don't want him spinning around so
07:11 - we'll set the rotation style to left and
07:14 - right
07:19 - and forever
07:23 - we want him to move
07:27 - and then bounce when he gets to the edge
07:32 - we want him to do this when he starts as
07:33 - a clone so we can have more than one
07:35 - axolotl
07:40 - so that's down here in the control
07:42 - blocks
07:44 - when i start as a clone
07:47 - so create a clone of myself and there he
07:49 - goes
07:55 - now all these are
07:56 - yellow we can put this code
07:59 - in the all axolotl colors
08:05 - create a clone of myself
08:10 - oh and i need to make him show
08:18 - but they're still not changing color
08:22 - i forgot to make him change costumes
08:26 - costumes is going to be in the looks
08:31 - we just need the next costume block
08:37 - we also want the code for this one to
08:39 - change costumes
08:42 - yeah that makes them look like they're
08:43 - swimming
08:46 - when they start we want the original one
08:48 - to be hidden though
08:51 - we want the
08:52 - clones to show
08:54 - but we want the original one to hide
09:00 - i want to add this set color effect too
09:03 - so we can get some variation in the
09:04 - colors
09:14 - and this one needs to hide when the
09:15 - green flag is clicked
09:18 - and you can change the speed and the
09:20 - size and the color and everything
09:22 - and just do as much as you want with
09:24 - this
09:25 - starting with my project axolotl
09:27 - resources
09:30 - but if you're a code ninja
09:32 - then you can do everything all on your
09:34 - own
09:35 - just do a new project
09:39 - and choose a backdrop
09:46 - that would be a good one for some
09:47 - axolotls to swim around in or you can
09:50 - upload a backdrop
09:53 - the backdrop from my other project
09:56 - i just did a screenshot when i was
09:57 - playing minecraft
10:00 - just click upload backdrop
10:03 - and then select the file that you got
10:05 - off the internet or you saved while you
10:07 - were playing
10:09 - i'll just select this jpeg that i made
10:12 - background.jpg
10:15 - and after it imports we have another
10:17 - background
10:19 - drag it to cover the whole screen
10:22 - and just resize it position it however
10:24 - you want
10:27 - next we need some sprites
10:30 - i uploaded a sprite for the egg
10:35 - again i got that off minecraft
10:37 - i just copied that and edited it out and
10:40 - made the background transparent to make
10:42 - a png file
10:49 - and then just resized and positioned
10:51 - that and that looks just like my other
10:53 - game
10:56 - for the axolotls
10:58 - we have to upload a sprite
11:03 - and i found a gif file
11:05 - on the internet that had a lot of
11:07 - different costumes
11:09 - let me show you get one gif file
11:11 - that moves
11:14 - and once it's imported in
11:19 - look at the costumes for that
11:23 - that has all the different colors
11:30 - there's 40 white ones 40 yellow ones 40
11:33 - brown ones
11:37 - i'm gonna just right click on this
11:39 - axolotl and duplicate it
11:45 - rename it yellow
11:54 - and delete all the costumes that aren't
11:56 - yellow
12:11 - and now it's just the yellow one
12:14 - let's add a little code for this guy
12:18 - forever
12:20 - go to the next costume
12:24 - so forever he goes to the next costume
12:28 - and just like in the other projects
12:30 - we can make clones of him and make him
12:32 - move around and change colors and
12:35 - and do whatever we want
12:37 - so whether you're a novice hardcore or a
12:39 - code ninja add your projects to my

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to scratch coding with scratch you can create your own stories puzzles games and whatever else you want to create you're in control of everything and the programs that you write today we're going to create a game where you can spawn axolotls you can pick different colors and spawn as many as you want if you're a novice at scratch then you can remix my code and i'll give you a link to that project in the description below if you're more hardcore then you can just remix my project axolotl resources and write all the code yourself if you're a code ninja then you may want to create a new project and get your own resources and write your code so we're going to start at novice level there's a link below to my project spawn axolotls you can remix this project and change whatever you want first let's run the program and see what it does when you click on the egg it spawns axolotls you can also hit the space bar this is the easter color axolotls there's also camouflage neon color and this button makes an axolotl let's keep an eye on him that changes color as he goes along so the axolotls just go off the screen a little bit turn around and come back in another direction as they go back and forth they get smaller and darker the axolotls go at different speeds and as they get smaller into the background you can really tell that some of them are going really slow and others are going fast it's fun to just create a bunch of these and let them swim around like you have an aquarium let's look at the code for the egg when the program starts the first type of axolotl that it's going to make is this purple kind and it goes to the front layer because you want the egg in front of all the other axolotls that have been created when this sprite is clicked when the egg is clicked it makes the egg move it glides a little bit and it creates a clone of the type of axolotl that's selected it does the same thing when the space key is pressed notice on these buttons whichever one i select has a yellow border let's look at the code for the buttons when i click the easter button it's going to select this purple axolotl as the type but you can't see it okay this is the purple one brown yellow and this one is all colors so it's going to select this purple one as the type and it's going to broadcast easter to let all the other buttons know that easter is selected let's look at the costumes for the easter button b is just the normal easter and b2 is the one that has a yellow border for when it's selected and you'll see the code whenever it's clicked it selects the one that has the yellow border b2 if anything else is clicked then it changes back to the one that has easter not selected when the game starts or if it's clicked on it's going to change to b2 because that's the one that's highlighted but if any of these other ones are selected then it's going to change it back to just b which is not a yellow border same thing for all these other buttons they have a couple of different costumes and they switch to the highlighted one whenever they're clicked on so all this extra code whenever it receives these messages is just to change the border around the biggest part of this is setting the right type so if camo is clicked on then it's going to change the type that's just a variable to brown if neon is clicked on then it's going to change the type to yellow so these buttons all they do is set the variable type so you don't know what type of axolotl to create the axolotl actually gets created in the egg code right here whenever it's clicked create a clone of whatever type is selected and inside the axolotls when he starts as a clone it has all the code to move back and forth to get smaller to get darker so the main sprite is hidden whenever the green flag is clicked but every time it starts as a clone it's going to pick a random color and a random speed between 6 and 10 it sets the size tells him to go in front of all these other axolotls but then go backward so you're not in front of the egg or in front of the buttons point in a random direction and you're going to be moving left and right not spinning all around and forever you just keep moving back and forth as long as they're pretty big it's going to make it smaller and make it go slower because when things are further away it looks like they're going slower also when things are further away especially if they're in the water then they're not going to look so bright so we change the brightness as they go back we also go to next costume i didn't show you that we're going through 40 different costumes to make him swim around so the motion just going through next costume next costume makes it look like he's swimming and the code for all these axolotls is the same when they start as a clone they do the same thing and this random color effect even though i picked neon it's going to be a random neon kind of color they're not all the same because of this random color effect if you were to remix this project what would you want to add what could we change to make it even better leave a comment below about what should be added to make this even better and after you've made changes yourself add your project to my axolotl studio if you're not a novice and you're more hardcore then you may want to start with this i'm also going to share this project axolotl resources i've given you the background and the costumes for the sprites but not the code you'll have to write your own code let's just write something real quick so for this yellow axolotl we need when green flag clicked and we need him to show he's too small he's at 20 right there let's set him to 40. go to a random position we don't want him spinning around so we'll set the rotation style to left and right and forever we want him to move and then bounce when he gets to the edge we want him to do this when he starts as a clone so we can have more than one axolotl so that's down here in the control blocks when i start as a clone so create a clone of myself and there he goes now all these are yellow we can put this code in the all axolotl colors create a clone of myself oh and i need to make him show but they're still not changing color i forgot to make him change costumes costumes is going to be in the looks we just need the next costume block we also want the code for this one to change costumes yeah that makes them look like they're swimming when they start we want the original one to be hidden though we want the clones to show but we want the original one to hide i want to add this set color effect too so we can get some variation in the colors and this one needs to hide when the green flag is clicked and you can change the speed and the size and the color and everything and just do as much as you want with this starting with my project axolotl resources but if you're a code ninja then you can do everything all on your own just do a new project and choose a backdrop that would be a good one for some axolotls to swim around in or you can upload a backdrop the backdrop from my other project i just did a screenshot when i was playing minecraft just click upload backdrop and then select the file that you got off the internet or you saved while you were playing i'll just select this jpeg that i made background.jpg and after it imports we have another background drag it to cover the whole screen and just resize it position it however you want next we need some sprites i uploaded a sprite for the egg again i got that off minecraft i just copied that and edited it out and made the background transparent to make a png file and then just resized and positioned that and that looks just like my other game for the axolotls we have to upload a sprite and i found a gif file on the internet that had a lot of different costumes let me show you get one gif file that moves and once it's imported in look at the costumes for that that has all the different colors there's 40 white ones 40 yellow ones 40 brown ones i'm gonna just right click on this axolotl and duplicate it rename it yellow and delete all the costumes that aren't yellow and now it's just the yellow one let's add a little code for this guy forever go to the next costume so forever he goes to the next costume and just like in the other projects we can make clones of him and make him move around and change colors and and do whatever we want so whether you're a novice hardcore or a code ninja add your projects to my axolotl studio if you enjoyed the video and you like my projects hit the like button and subscribe below i'll see you next time bye bye
