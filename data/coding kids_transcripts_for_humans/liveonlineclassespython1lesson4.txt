With timestamps:

00:00 - okay and we're gonna stop sharing my
00:02 - screen now so let me know and you can
00:05 - see it can you see my screen David I
00:19 - know not yet oh yes yep so you can see
00:26 - like a little turtle and stuff yep yep
00:29 - okay cool so this is the project we'll
00:32 - be making this lesson today so we'll
00:35 - make it on our own computers this is on
00:37 - trinket but what it is is it's an
00:40 - interest
00:40 - it's called interactive turtle so we can
00:43 - control where we draw the line so for
00:47 - example down here it's asking us how far
00:50 - will Bob walk so we can put in a number
00:52 - like a hundred maybe and then it drew a
00:57 - line and now we can tell it how many
01:00 - degrees two tens I might say 90 and then
01:04 - you can keep going and then you can make
01:06 - whatever shapes you want yeah okay and
01:11 - yeah so that's just me typing it's I can
01:13 - even like turn a random amount of
01:17 - degrees like 48 and then like walk 30 so
01:23 - if you don't have to make neat chase but
01:25 - it's just an interactive turtle where it
01:27 - takes what you typed in and draws it
01:30 - yeah and how do you and how do you do it
01:34 - yes so that's what we're gonna do this
01:36 - lesson oh yeah yeah I'll go through it
01:39 - step-by-step so make sure to get Idol
01:43 - open
01:49 - [Music]
01:59 - so let me know when you have Idol open
02:01 - yeah our I'm Reggie I'm having a vehicle
02:05 - and then what we want to do is we want
02:07 - to make a new file so do you mind yeah I
02:11 - did try yep okay cool
02:12 - file new file so I'll quickly do that
02:15 - now before we start I'll just close that
02:19 - if we go back to our project what
02:23 - so will you need to break it down so
02:24 - that it's easy for us to code so what
02:27 - are the different steps that happen so
02:30 - just like when you're talking like what
02:33 - do you see what odds like different
02:35 - things that's happening with this
02:36 - program so what's one thing that's
02:41 - happening so as soon as you press like
02:48 - play what's the first thing it asks you
02:52 - how far road
02:55 - yet wait I didn't get a turn at all he
03:00 - gets
03:01 - I know we haven't started anything yet
03:04 - so I'm just fixing we're just but we're
03:07 - looking at the project and we're just
03:08 - trying to break it down so that it's
03:10 - easy for us to start coding it oh yeah
03:13 - okay sure how far will yeah yeah so then
03:19 - that's one step and then we can put in a
03:21 - number so just 30 and then what's
03:23 - another step that's happening how many
03:28 - degrees should Bob turn yep and then
03:31 - again we put in another number and then
03:34 - it turns and then what happens again
03:38 - like does it just finish or is it
03:40 - continuing its continued yep exactly so
03:48 - you can just keep continuing typing
03:51 - stuff so it keeps going how far will it
03:53 - work and how many degrees so some of the
03:56 - basic steps are when we start we like
04:00 - set up our turtle then it asks us for
04:03 - some input so how far will Bob work and
04:05 - then it works that far and then it asks
04:08 - us for the degrees
04:10 - how many degrees sit down and then it
04:12 - turns and then it keeps repeating that
04:15 - so I'll get my file open again so do you
04:21 - remember the first thing you need to
04:22 - type when you're making a turtle project
04:25 - or when you need to use turtle yeah
04:29 - import turtle yep
04:33 - good job so remember import turtle with
04:37 - the lowercase T and then we need to set
04:41 - up our actual turtle like the thing
04:43 - that's moving around
04:45 - do you remember how to do that as well
04:47 - okay not really
04:51 - that's okay so it's a bit like a
04:54 - variable because we want to give our
04:56 - turtle a name so I might call mine Bob
04:59 - you can call us whatever you want I'm
05:02 - gonna say Bob and because it's a
05:05 - variable we can say equals and we want
05:09 - to make Bob into a turtle but to do that
05:12 - you say yeah hmm what can i type
05:15 - someone's name yeah you can type another
05:17 - name that's fine okay Chester can you
05:23 - hear me okay so David you go turtle dot
05:32 - and then you type your turtle with a
05:34 - capital T and you have your two brackets
05:40 - so do you remember why we do that okay
05:47 - so the first thing importing turtle is
05:51 - because turtle is a library from
05:53 - somewhere else so that's like some code
05:55 - that someone else has written and we're
05:57 - using it so to be able to use it we have
06:00 - to actually import it and now to
06:02 - actually like create a turtle object we
06:07 - give it a name and we say equals a
06:09 - turtle so we go lower case turtle dot
06:13 - because that's saying it's from this
06:16 - turtle library you're saying okay turtle
06:18 - dot and then turtle with a capital T
06:21 - that that function means it's
06:24 - taking the total yeah okay yeah because
06:28 - that makes them kinda yeah yeah okay so
06:33 - what you can do now is you can do you
06:36 - remember how we change the shape of the
06:37 - turtle last week know everything from
06:43 - the last lesson is kind of unclear to me
06:46 - Oh unclear okay this yeah okay well this
06:50 - is this will be a good revision then for
06:52 - you so we want to change the shape of
06:54 - the turtle to be like a little turtle
06:57 - shape like you see in the project I
06:59 - showed you so to do that we gave our
07:03 - turtle the name so my ones called Bob so
07:05 - I'm going to go Bob dot shape and then
07:11 - brecht it inside the record of quotation
07:15 - mark and I want it to be the shape of a
07:17 - turtle so T you are
07:19 - TLE and then close the quotation mark
07:23 - and close the bracket yep so what I'm
07:27 - doing right now okay cool
07:31 - so what that does is we have to go Bob
07:34 - dot something so that it knows we're
07:36 - changing the shape of our turtles that
07:38 - we need and then we put the word turtle
07:42 - in quotation marks because it's a string
07:45 - so string is like a word yeah I'm done
07:51 - yep you're done okay
07:52 - so I'll get you to run it first now and
07:56 - just yeah okay and choose remember we
07:59 - would save it first yeah so when you
08:02 - press run it will ask you to save it
08:04 - sorry ash is choose where to save
08:07 - [Music]
08:09 - Chester can you hear me
08:18 - justic so remember how you made that
08:24 - folder last week uh just uh can you hear
08:33 - me hi so there is this is a turtle so
08:39 - this is called interactive turtle yeah
08:42 - so I just surge or just close a tough
08:45 - Todd looked at it yep so did it draw the
08:48 - little turtle yeah yep okay cool yeah
08:52 - now you just close it so chest up we're
08:55 - making a project called interactive
08:57 - turtle so it's like the one that I
09:01 - showed you in and oh yeah I can hear you
09:04 - can you hear me yep okay yeah so we're
09:09 - making a project we just started a
09:11 - project called interactive turtle and
09:13 - it's like what we start on what I showed
09:16 - you in the first week so if you can you
09:18 - see my screen yep
09:22 - so it's this thing so it asks how far
09:25 - will Bob walk and you can say a number
09:29 - and I didn't press play you can say a
09:33 - number and then it asks how far will Bob
09:36 - turn and you can say another number and
09:38 - then you can keep going so you can draw
09:41 - your own shapes hang them so we just
09:46 - started if you can see my screen and
09:49 - just quickly try and in those first
09:51 - three lines so we just created our
09:53 - turtle those are the first three steps
10:00 - oh yeah yes so in a new file mm-hmm yep
10:09 - and David while you're waiting what we
10:11 - can do is we can change the color of our
10:13 - pen if we want how do you do John yep so
10:18 - it's just the same as like how we change
10:21 - the shape so we have to go bob dot bob
10:24 - dot but instead we can type in color the
10:29 - oh so you have to spell it the American
10:34 - Way because that's just how Python does
10:36 - it and then you can put in a color so I
10:40 - might want to change mine to green so
10:44 - you need the brackets and then the
10:46 - quotation marks again and inside that
10:48 - you type the word green or whatever
10:50 - color you want to change it to so python
10:54 - just like with the shape python like
10:57 - turtle has a few set shapes and set
11:00 - colors that you can use so sometimes it
11:03 - might not have every single color or
11:05 - every single shape like if you wanted a
11:07 - shape of a stapler or something it might
11:10 - not have that shape so you have to if
11:12 - you want to see what shapes or colors
11:14 - they have you can just google they can
11:18 - type in python turtle and then if we
11:24 - want to see what colors are we can type
11:26 - in color colors yeah I want to see no
11:32 - Konishi the shape the shape kind of
11:35 - change it to I'm so you could triangle
11:38 - yeah so you can try that but I'll let
11:40 - you also go on like on to Google and so
11:44 - I'll shut up just so you can see it for
11:47 - yourself
11:55 - okay now run it that one okay it says I
12:14 - can change it to that shape so there's
12:17 - no rectangle
12:18 - there's no rectangle yeah what is what
12:22 - did it say that it said like mm unable
12:29 - to get sad shape okay so yeah I'll let
12:35 - you go onto Google quickly and try look
12:39 - for it so type in something like -
12:41 - turtle shape
12:43 - and it should be that first result so
12:51 - Chester how are you going with you oh
12:53 - yes it didn't it didn't I have a yeah I
12:56 - have a purple triangle okay cool nice
13:03 - did what use yep like those three lines
13:11 - and then I was just showing David how to
13:13 - change the shape and color of the turtle
13:15 - while we're waiting but I'll move on to
13:18 - the next step now does everything so far
13:22 - make sense to you guys
13:24 - yeah interactive so we're that's what
13:31 - we're making right now
13:32 - so we have to I I was explaining to
13:37 - David so we have to break it up into
13:39 - steps
13:39 - so the first step like we created our
13:42 - turtle now David do you remember the
13:45 - next step no no yeah I didn't remember
13:51 - anything from the last lesson so I'm
13:53 - gonna just it's not from last lesson
13:55 - what I was saying at the beginning but
13:57 - that's okay so if I open up the project
14:00 - we've created our turtle and now what it
14:03 - does is it asks us how far will bubble
14:06 - so that's what we need to do now we need
14:10 - to get it to ask us how far will bubble
14:12 - okay so how do we do jack yeah so that's
14:17 - what mix they know so before doing that
14:20 - so do you remember how in this project
14:23 - you can just keep typing stuff it's just
14:25 - continuous so it keeps going on forever
14:31 - it's doing that
14:33 - because we in something called a loop so
14:36 - if you remember we did something called
14:39 - some using for loops last lesson if you
14:43 - don't that's okay but do you remember
14:46 - the term Luke's David or Cheston
14:51 - now I remember I was trying to practice
14:56 - it you forgot had a carrot okay that's
15:01 - okay we're doing a different kind of
15:03 - look today but the loop we're doing
15:06 - today is called a while loop so what a
15:09 - while loop does is you can continue
15:11 - doing something until a certain
15:14 - condition is met so when we did a full
15:17 - lips last week we could just repeat
15:20 - something a certain number of times so
15:23 - last week we need for loops and like for
15:25 - example when we're drawing our square we
15:28 - wanted to repeat it four times so we use
15:31 - that thing called range but this week we
15:34 - want to repeat something to keep going
15:37 - forever so what we need to type is the
15:41 - word while so type in the word while
15:47 - because we're using a while loop yep and
15:50 - then the word true with a capital T so T
15:54 - Yui did it give it okay cool so Chester
16:04 - did you do that as well
16:05 - did you type in the word while and true
16:11 - thank you so type okay so the reason why
16:16 - we say the word true is because yeah you
16:20 - got it okay cool so the reason the word
16:24 - true here with a capital T is something
16:27 - called a boolean so it pretty much means
16:29 - something is true and because we're
16:32 - using a while loop that kind of takes
16:34 - some sort of condition to keep repeating
16:38 - something the condition we said here was
16:41 - true so like true is always going to be
16:44 - true so that means a like it's just
16:46 - gonna keep happening forever because
16:48 - that kind of makes it yeah okay okay so
16:53 - now if you remember from last week when
16:55 - we did loops we have to use indentation
16:58 - and we also have to use the semicolon so
17:01 - we type in while true and then the
17:03 - semicolon
17:05 - or the : sorry and then if you press
17:08 - ENTER it should be the next line you
17:12 - write should be a bit engine turning
17:14 - yeah yep
17:15 - so that's good we want it to be indented
17:18 - so that our code knows anything that's
17:21 - indented is part of that loop such as
17:26 - don't cut that is up yeah yep okay so
17:29 - now what we want to do so we have our
17:31 - loop set up now we actually want to ask
17:34 - the user question so do you remember you
17:38 - might not if you're doing but do you
17:40 - remember how you get an input like you
17:43 - asked the person a question like do you
17:48 - remember how you get a value from on
17:51 - Python by asking the user question so I
17:56 - think we did it in the first lesson
17:58 - where we asked what is your name
18:01 - the first or second lesson does anyone
18:05 - remember no that's okay so we use
18:09 - something called input so if you type in
18:12 - the word inpu T so input is a bit like
18:15 - print but crane just writes down like a
18:18 - sentence or whatever word you say on the
18:20 - screen this writes down a sentence and
18:23 - then waits like it there's a space so
18:27 - that someone can type something
18:28 - afterwards so we want to say input how
18:34 - will Bob travel oh whatever you called
18:43 - you turtle
18:55 - so that's the first question our program
18:57 - asks us because if you remember in the
18:59 - example and it said how far will Bob
19:01 - travel so remember to type in input and
19:07 - then have brackets and then inside the
19:10 - brackets quotations quotation marks that
19:13 - say with the work with the phrase saying
19:16 - how far will Bob travel and then close
19:20 - them does everyone have that I'm just
19:29 - I'm just typing ok that's me also you
19:32 - don't have to use this exact phrase you
19:35 - can say something else just as long as
19:38 - it makes sense that you're asking how
19:40 - far will your turtle trouble so David do
19:49 - you have that line of call mmm yep just
19:52 - finished it
19:53 - yep ok cool you finish it - okay so now
19:57 - I'll just get everyone to run what they
19:59 - have so far just to test what happens
20:01 - and if it works like way we expect it to
20:05 - so we want it to ask us how far will Bob
20:09 - or whatever name you gave your turtle
20:11 - trouble so it will ask the question in
20:19 - the Python shell and then you should
20:28 - still be able to just see the turtle
20:30 - there but it shouldn't do anything yet
20:33 - and then if you type something after the
20:38 - how file will bub trouble if you just
20:40 - type in anything it will just keep
20:42 - asking you the question because we put
20:45 - in a loop it will keep asking it from us
20:48 - forever to everyone test it and see if
20:54 - that works for you guys - yep mmm
20:58 - there's ting it and finally we'll try
21:01 - one
21:03 - sails and no one Oh what she doesn't
21:06 - enter so Bob shouldn't move yet
21:10 - Oh your turtle won't move yet because we
21:12 - have encoded it to do that but if you
21:15 - just go into shell and where the
21:17 - question is you can keep answering a
21:21 - question yeah and yeah does it move I
21:25 - don't see moving because we have an ad
21:28 - of the code to make it move yet so oh
21:30 - yeah yeah I just registered and dowon's
21:34 - a thousand yeah so if you press enter it
21:39 - should ask you again so just press ENTER
21:41 - and see if it asked you again
21:44 - how did you just type me yes so you can
21:49 - type in letters as well because it
21:51 - doesn't know what like it doesn't know
21:54 - what it's expecting us to type in yeah
21:57 - yeah as long as it just keeps asking you
22:01 - the question as you press Enter you know
22:04 - that it's working you know that our
22:06 - while loop is working so that means it
22:10 - will do it forever so does everyone have
22:12 - that working yeah yep and does it so
22:17 - what did you say Jess all right yeah it
22:22 - works too if you just press ENTER yep so
22:26 - does that make sense how the while loop
22:28 - and the question is roughing the input
22:31 - thing yep David does that make sense you
22:36 - as well yeah yep okay so we'll go back
22:43 - so we'll close the show and then we'll
22:47 - go back to our program so what we want
22:52 - to do is we ask the person how far we
22:56 - want Bob to travel so Chester do you say
22:58 - something did you have a question
23:06 - nope okay so yeah what we did is we
23:11 - asked our user whoever's running our
23:14 - program how far we want Bob to travel
23:16 - but we actually want to be use whatever
23:20 - value they gave us to make our Bob or
23:24 - one of our turtle is move so we need to
23:27 - save this answer somewhere because if we
23:30 - just ask them we've asked them but we're
23:33 - not saving the value anywhere
23:35 - so our program won't remember what
23:37 - number we typed in so who remembers a
23:40 - way of how we can save values in
23:44 - something so anyone know if you remember
23:52 - how I explained something is like a
23:54 - little box that remembers a value what
23:58 - is that it's cold do you guys remember
24:03 - what variables are yeah so what's a
24:07 - variable so variable is something where
24:39 - you can go at something equals something
24:40 - but what we use variables for is to
24:43 - remember stuff or like to store values
24:46 - in something so for example in a game
24:50 - you might have a variable called score
24:52 - and you say score is equal to zero and
24:55 - then later on in that game you can
24:56 - change the school so in our case we want
25:00 - to save Paden
25:06 - are you learned that last year yes okay
25:12 - that's cool yes so what we want to do is
25:16 - we want to make a variable that
25:18 - remembers
25:20 - the distance that somebody typed in
25:22 - because in this program it asks how far
25:25 - will Bob walk so we need to remember
25:28 - that value so that we can use it later
25:30 - to actually make Bob walk - so to do
25:34 - that we can type in the word distance so
25:37 - D is da equals so type that in before
25:43 - input so what that is doing is distance
25:48 - is the name of our variable and we're
25:52 - saying distance equals whatever our
25:54 - person typed in after this question so
26:00 - David does that make sense to you yep
26:04 - yep okay so you can use any word it
26:08 - doesn't have to be distance but you need
26:11 - to use something meaningful so something
26:13 - you know what I usually just yeah
26:18 - usually makes sense because we want to
26:20 - use it to say how far our total will
26:23 - look but you could use like steps or
26:24 - something like that as well but I'm just
26:28 - gonna stick with distance for now so
26:31 - does everyone have that yep yep just
26:35 - like it doing it okay cool and just
26:46 - remember with this input thing whatever
26:49 - the user types in afterwards will be
26:51 - saved as a string so what we're doing is
26:55 - we're saving whatever they typed after
26:57 - this question into a variable called
26:59 - distance as a string so once you've
27:04 - typed that just press ENTER so you're on
27:06 - the like next line but make sure you're
27:09 - still indented in because now we
27:13 - actually want to use that number or that
27:15 - value distance to make our turtle move
27:19 - so we just want to make it go forward
27:22 - however many times like whatever number
27:25 - the user typed in times so how might we
27:29 - do that does anyone have an idea
27:34 - I know I think yeah
27:37 - how far will Bob
27:42 - how long will Bob move or or something
27:46 - like that so before Bob does me before
27:50 - asking a question we actually want to
27:52 - make Bob move forward like however many
27:56 - times the person said it so if you look
27:58 - on my screen in the example program
28:00 - again it asks how far will Bob walk so
28:05 - that's the first step that we did that's
28:07 - the input thing and then once you type
28:10 - in a number so if I type in 50 it
28:14 - actually moves so that's the next step
28:17 - we're trying to do now so we ask the
28:19 - user how far will Bob walk and now we've
28:23 - saved whatever they type in in something
28:25 - called a variable which is called
28:28 - distance and now we want to actually
28:31 - make our turtle move so how do we make
28:35 - something move in Turtles if we just
28:37 - want to go forward what do we type in
28:42 - yep exactly
28:44 - so we'll go Bob duck forward just so
28:48 - that we know a moving Bob forward but
28:51 - inside the brackets we have to put in a
28:53 - number or we have to put in a value so
28:56 - what value do we put in does anyone know
29:03 - I think annually any value so the value
29:08 - we want is whatever the person typed in
29:11 - or oh yeah sure hard in abuja so do you
29:15 - have an idea so we saved whatever the
29:17 - person typed in there something called
29:19 - distance so what do you think we'll put
29:21 - inside the brackets
29:27 - sorry just I didn't hear you what do you
29:30 - think yep exactly
29:36 - so we put in the word distance inside
29:39 - the brackets so what that's saying is we
29:42 - want Bob to move forward this much time
29:46 - so
29:46 - distance time and distance is whatever
29:49 - we typed in so I'll get you guys to run
29:54 - it and see what happens but you might
29:58 - get an error and I'll explain it to you
30:00 - after but I just want you to run it
30:02 - first to see what happens yep run and
30:12 - then when it asks you how far will Bob
30:14 - travel just put in a number I'm just
30:18 - okay so I got an error and you guys
30:27 - should get an error too and if you will
30:34 - not if you don't get an error then it
30:40 - might be surprising oh yeah I have
30:42 - another yes so it's meant to give you an
30:45 - error because we explained it to you
30:47 - after we forgot to do something
30:52 - suppress the did you run yours and see
30:54 - as well yeah yep do you get an error as
30:58 - well whoa oh it just gave you an arrow
31:09 - straight away okay um you might have
31:13 - something in your code before that that
31:15 - causes an error but I'll first explain
31:18 - this error and then when I go back to my
31:21 - code you can see if yours looks like
31:23 - mine there might just be something wait
31:25 - it might be something when you did like
31:27 - distance equals that but the error we're
31:30 - getting here if you look on my screen is
31:33 - it's saying well it's a big error but
31:37 - it's pretty much saying can't multiply
31:39 - sequence by non int of type float that's
31:43 - a bit confusing but what in this case
31:47 - what it's saying is because it's telling
31:50 - us the error is in Lion ten where it
31:53 - says Bob dot for a distance if we go
31:56 - back into our code you remember how I
31:59 - said
32:00 - just a few minutes of the input saves
32:02 - whatever the user typed in as a string
32:06 - yep yep
32:08 - but in this function here where we say
32:10 - Bob dot for a distance we want it's
32:14 - expecting a number because it's
32:16 - expecting us to put in a number like 10
32:18 - or 20 or something like that so even
32:22 - though we in our program even though we
32:24 - typed in a number in the background like
32:27 - it saved it as a string so instead of
32:30 - saving it as the number 80 when I type
32:33 - in 80 it's saved as 80 in quotation
32:36 - marks so what we need to do is we need
32:40 - to actually convert this so we need to
32:43 - convert the variable distance into an
32:47 - integer so an integer is a number an
32:50 - integer so do an integer is just another
32:54 - word for a number in programming
32:56 - languages so to convert it you just type
32:59 - in the word I and in front of the word
33:03 - distance in your Bob go forward thing
33:07 - yep and then you put brackets around the
33:11 - word distance so just check that yours
33:16 - looks like my code so the words are the
33:24 - letters int is short for integer yeah so
33:29 - it pretty much is just saying to convert
33:32 - distance that's a string into an integer
33:34 - and then did it work for you Chester
33:39 - yeah yeah okay
33:41 - so yeah David run yours as well run what
33:48 - did you say Chester sorry Connie
33:50 - yep so type in a number now and see what
33:53 - happens now your turtle should move
33:59 - hopefully hey yes it did it did cool
34:04 - Chester did yours move no no did you get
34:08 - an error
34:11 - what does your arrow say so did it look
34:15 - like the one I had before yeah yeah I
34:21 - got are not slow so in your code do you
34:25 - have this bit where you convert it to an
34:28 - insert int distance and balance so I
34:34 - didn't hear gesture did you okay so just
34:37 - add that in now so the int and then in
34:43 - brackets distance is just converting
34:46 - that variable which right now is a
34:48 - string into a number so like if you type
34:52 - in a number in the background it will
34:54 - just change it to an actual number value
34:58 - in our code so that this Bob dot forward
35:02 - function can actually work yep I think
35:13 - so once you save it like in the first
35:16 - the first time it saves it automatically
35:19 - and because we have it in our while loop
35:22 - so David as well because you have yours
35:24 - in a while loop you can keep doing lines
35:27 - so like every time it asks you you can
35:30 - just type in like one and then it can
35:34 - move like ten and you keep drawing lines
35:43 - so as everyone's working it yep okay
35:48 - that's pretty cool right and then you
35:50 - can just say how much how far we'll go
35:55 - so now we'll do the next step which is
36:00 - actually making it turn so what's the
36:05 - first thing we need to make it turn so
36:08 - it's almost like what we did up here but
36:12 - instead if you look at the example
36:14 - project it says something else it says
36:17 - how many degree should Bob done so how
36:21 - do we type that bit of coding
36:23 - can someone tell me so before I know
36:41 - right before yeah nothing so yes but
36:51 - instead we want to make a new variable
36:52 - so distance is what we use like for the
36:56 - question how far will Bob travel but we
36:59 - want to make a new variable so that we
37:01 - know how like Bob will turn so what we
37:06 - could call it is something like angle
37:09 - equals so we're making a new variable
37:15 - now that remembers the angle that
37:19 - somebody typed in so what do I need to
37:25 - type in next angle yep exactly
37:29 - input and then sorry what do you say
37:49 - yeah or turn but yep so you can type in
37:52 - something like what angle lil bub so
37:59 - David did you get all that as well
38:02 - I'm trying right now you're trying right
38:04 - now okay so what it's doing is it's
38:08 - pretty much the same thing as what we
38:10 - typed before but it's just asking
38:13 - different question and saving it in a
38:16 - different variable name you got that so
38:28 - I got it you got it
38:31 - okay so now we actually want to use this
38:33 - variable to make our turtle turn
38:36 - to make Bob turn so what does anyone
38:40 - know what line of code we might use well
38:42 - the beginning of the line so yep yep so
38:52 - we go Bob dot and then we can type in
38:57 - left so that we're turning to the left
39:02 - so many degrees and then what do we need
39:06 - to type inside the brackets yep exactly
39:17 - so we need to do the same thing we did
39:19 - with forward by first changing it to an
39:22 - integer so int and then we need brackets
39:26 - again and inside the second set of
39:29 - brackets we want to type in the word
39:31 - angle so what we're telling our program
39:36 - is for bub to turn so many degrees based
39:40 - on whatever we typed in first and we
39:44 - write the word int to convert what we
39:47 - typed in to a number yep yep does that
39:52 - make sense yes yep yes if you have a
39:59 - question you know or if it doesn't make
40:01 - complete sense let me know but if it's
40:06 - all okay we can run yep run module and
40:11 - then see what happens
40:18 - so you should be able to now
40:21 - continuously say how far to walk and
40:24 - what angle to turn okay half I will book
40:30 - traveled 10 what angle what angle
40:39 - [Music]
40:43 - I have an error you have an error what's
40:48 - the error they trace back my street and
40:54 - call last file see you should fly up
40:58 - data located module
41:05 - Bob left angle mm-hmm yes all exact does
41:11 - it say like invalid literal or something
41:14 - for base it says invalid yep
41:20 - so I think what you might have done is
41:22 - what was the last thing you typed in was
41:24 - it a number was it a letter oh it was a
41:35 - letter it was a letter yes so that's
41:37 - what the error is because it's trying to
41:40 - convert whatever we typed in so it's
41:42 - trying to convert like the letter you
41:44 - type in into a number but the program
41:49 - can't convert like the letter A into a
41:51 - number like it can convert a in
41:53 - quotation marks into a number like
41:56 - before when you type it like if you
41:58 - typed in 50 it can convert 50 from
42:01 - quotation marks into a number but
42:03 - because it's a letter it can't do that
42:05 - because yeah so we can actually add
42:09 - something in our program to check if
42:12 - what the person typed in was a literal
42:16 - number do you guys want to do that
42:17 - because we have 10 minutes left so we
42:20 - can check like it's whatever somebody
42:22 - typed in was actually a number so do you
42:28 - guys want to do that oh yeah yes okay
42:34 - what did you say chess si looks like a
42:43 - golf club that's funny
42:51 - okay so what we want to do is we want to
42:55 - check whatever the person typed in is a
42:58 - number so in Python there is a way to do
43:02 - that let me try find it or we can put a
43:06 - limit on actually no let me try find it
43:09 - so check give me a second okay so do you
43:23 - remember how I was talking about if I
43:26 - think we used it some things called if
43:29 - statements we use it a couple of lessons
43:32 - ago so we can use if statements to check
43:37 - if something is true or false and if it
43:40 - is then we can do something inside that
43:42 - if statement so what we want to do is we
43:45 - want to check if whatever they typed in
43:48 - is a number if it is will make Bob go
43:52 - forward and if it's not we'll give them
43:55 - an error message so let me just get the
44:00 - code up okay so this is a bit different
44:10 - so there's something called let me
44:16 - should I find an easier way to do it
44:18 - without confusing you guys what we can
44:27 - say is there's something called pass in
44:31 - I'm pretty sure so let me just let me
44:37 - get it up so that I know exactly what to
44:43 - show you cuz in Python you have to check
44:47 - if it is a number and if it isn't you
44:50 - want to do something else so let me get
44:53 - it
44:58 - otherwise what you can do is I'll do it
45:03 - this way okay I'll show you guys so
45:05 - there's something called if statements
45:07 - where you can check if something is true
45:10 - we want to do something else but in
45:12 - Python there's also something called
45:14 - try-catch statements
45:17 - so what try-catch statements do is
45:20 - they're a bit like if statements so you
45:22 - tell it to try a bit of code and the
45:25 - catch thing is if there's an error you
45:27 - want to do something else or you want to
45:30 - say something else so I'll type it in
45:33 - for you so we got to type in the word
45:36 - try and then do the colon and press
45:40 - Enter so you want to say try and we want
45:46 - to try make Bob Bob go forward so I'm
45:50 - just gonna cut like take this out of
45:53 - here and put it in the try thing so I
45:55 - just press ctrl X on my keyboard to cut
45:58 - it and I pasted it in here to let me
46:05 - know when you have done that step yeah
46:08 - yep you've done that cool so that step
46:12 - is first saying okay after we've asked
46:14 - them for the input and saved it we want
46:16 - to try and make Bob go forward that's
46:20 - that step and then the next thing we
46:22 - want to say is so instead of cat we're
46:25 - gonna say except instead the except type
46:31 - in the word except and we want to say
46:35 - value error
46:41 - actually before that I'm just gonna
46:45 - quickly find out so what we're saying
46:48 - here what we need to find out is what
46:51 - type of error our code will get if we
46:54 - don't type in a word
46:55 - so just look on my screen for the minute
46:59 - I'm just come home minding sound stuff
47:02 - out just to test something I just want
47:09 - to see what type of error it will tell
47:11 - me so if I press thanks okay yep
47:15 - so it says do you see how if everyone's
47:18 - looking my screen it asks me how far
47:21 - will Bob travel and I just typed in
47:23 - space and press enter and then I got
47:25 - something called a value error because
47:29 - it's expecting something that's a number
47:32 - but it's actually something else does
47:35 - that make sense of her yep yeah
47:40 - okay so I'll show you why did that so
47:42 - what I want to do is we want to try make
47:48 - Bob 4 go forward but if it doesn't work
47:53 - so if it doesn't work we want to say try
47:56 - do that but the except thing means
47:58 - except if we get a value error so the
48:05 - value error
48:06 - did you see how when I tested my program
48:08 - before we got something called the value
48:10 - error so what we're telling our code
48:13 - here is we want to make Bob go forward
48:15 - but if we get a value error we want to
48:19 - do something else so make sure to put
48:22 - that Kohl in there and press ENTER and
48:24 - now in this line we can tell it what
48:27 - else to do instead of making Bob go
48:29 - forward so what I might do is I might
48:32 - say print and I might say sorry that is
48:39 - not a valid number okay so it's kind of
48:47 - like saying an error message so I'll
48:50 - quickly explain it again so once we lost
48:53 - the user for the
48:54 - put like we've saved whatever they typed
48:56 - in we want to try make Bob go forward so
49:01 - if they type in a number and it's fine
49:03 - then we'll Bob will go forward and
49:05 - there's no issues but if like say you
49:08 - accidentally typed this space and try to
49:11 - make Bob go forward it wouldn't work
49:14 - because it can't convert a space into a
49:17 - number so that's why we're saying if it
49:21 - gets that error so that type of error is
49:23 - called the value error we want to tell
49:26 - the person sorry that's not a valid
49:28 - number and then we want to make them we
49:37 - want to ask them again how far will Bob
49:39 - travel and then you can make make Bob go
49:49 - forward again if you want so before
49:54 - doing that we'll just do this sorry
49:56 - that's not a valid number thing and see
49:58 - what happens okay so if you press and
50:02 - run and run module we'll try test it and
50:07 - see what happens so first just test it
50:13 - normally by typing in a number like 10
50:16 - and see if it moved and then make sure
50:22 - to do the angle and now if you type in
50:26 - like a letter it gives you the error
50:31 - message
50:41 - - did that work for everyone else yep
50:45 - yep does that kind of make sense so it
50:47 - was a bit confusing cuz it's like a new
50:49 - concept but didn't make sense how it
50:52 - looked
50:55 - yes so no all kind of so David did it
51:02 - make sense to you
51:03 - yep yep okay just that did it make sense
51:06 - to you what we did with that try and
51:09 - accept thing yeah yeah okay cool so what
51:18 - we can do is you can add it for the
51:20 - angle as well you can do the same code
51:26 - so what you can do is you can just copy
51:31 - this line of that bunch of coats the
51:35 - try/except and underneath angle you can
51:38 - paste it make sure that it's still all
51:41 - indented nicely and then instead of in
51:46 - the second in the bit you copied instead
51:48 - of doing the bobbed up forward you can
51:51 - so I'm just pressing ctrl C to copy and
51:54 - ctrl V to paste and then ctrl X to cut
51:58 - and then ctrl V to paste so I'll just
52:05 - add some spaces so you can see what's
52:07 - happening so what we're doing is just
52:12 - doing the same thing but for the angle
52:14 - this time so we're gonna we ask the
52:17 - person what angle do they want Bob to
52:19 - turn if it's a number then it will turn
52:22 - that angle and if it's not then it'll
52:25 - say sorry that's not a valid number so
52:29 - it's like a little error message so you
52:31 - know how when we did it we got an error
52:33 - message but it was like that error
52:35 - message in red so it's a bit confusing
52:38 - this is us actually typing in our own
52:41 - error messages in the program so
52:46 - what it does is it allows you to still
52:47 - run the program but it just tells the
52:50 - person of the error message so did
52:55 - everyone type and paste it did it work
52:58 - for you Chester I just know what
53:05 - happened that's good so now make sure
53:11 - yep so make sure if you haven't tested
53:13 - it already to test it and see that both
53:15 - were the angle under distance angle turn
53:27 - Hey
53:29 - sorry that's none of that work on there
53:37 - yep so my one works does everyone else
53:41 - as well yep yep cool it doesn't work
53:47 - what is you're saying okay do you want
53:53 - to maybe get you to share your screen
53:56 - just so I can see what it is
53:57 - I'll stop sharing mine also it's 5:30
54:02 - now so I'll quickly help just the fixes
54:04 - but David did you as well okay and
54:07 - everything yes yeah did you have any
54:10 - questions all right no it was all clear
54:15 - it was all clear okay that's good so if
54:18 - you want you can leave or you can just
54:21 - quickly see what they show is with
54:22 - Chester's as well if you wanted to just
54:24 - see what it was before leaving so I'll
54:27 - just quickly see so Justin if you just
54:31 - run your program
54:36 - give me that
54:41 - ah okay so I see what the error is so do
54:49 - you see how it says something called
54:50 - name error the name distance is not
54:54 - defined you just forgot the letter e I'm
54:58 - pretty sure yep
55:00 - so you just misspelled distance so just
55:04 - add in the e yep so a name error means
55:08 - there's something wrong with that like a
55:10 - name of your variable generally it
55:13 - usually means it can't find the variable
55:15 - and also Chester okay let you run it
55:21 - first
55:25 - yay yay cool and one more thing suggest
55:30 - if you go back to your code you actually
55:37 - I think you asked yes so you make Bob
55:40 - move forward twice because do you see
55:42 - how you have it straight off for the
55:43 - first thing and then you have it in that
55:46 - try except function so get rid of it
55:50 - underneath the distance equals thing not
55:55 - that not that line the line underneath
55:58 - so just yeah just that line because
56:01 - otherwise you're just repeating it twice
56:03 - and then it's moving double so you can
56:08 - just press backspace but yeah other than
56:13 - that did anyone have any other questions
56:15 - no no okay
56:18 - so then that's the end of the lesson
56:19 - I'll see you guys next week then okay
56:23 - good bye bye

Cleaned transcript:

okay and we're gonna stop sharing my screen now so let me know and you can see it can you see my screen David I know not yet oh yes yep so you can see like a little turtle and stuff yep yep okay cool so this is the project we'll be making this lesson today so we'll make it on our own computers this is on trinket but what it is is it's an interest it's called interactive turtle so we can control where we draw the line so for example down here it's asking us how far will Bob walk so we can put in a number like a hundred maybe and then it drew a line and now we can tell it how many degrees two tens I might say 90 and then you can keep going and then you can make whatever shapes you want yeah okay and yeah so that's just me typing it's I can even like turn a random amount of degrees like 48 and then like walk 30 so if you don't have to make neat chase but it's just an interactive turtle where it takes what you typed in and draws it yeah and how do you and how do you do it yes so that's what we're gonna do this lesson oh yeah yeah I'll go through it stepbystep so make sure to get Idol open so let me know when you have Idol open yeah our I'm Reggie I'm having a vehicle and then what we want to do is we want to make a new file so do you mind yeah I did try yep okay cool file new file so I'll quickly do that now before we start I'll just close that if we go back to our project what so will you need to break it down so that it's easy for us to code so what are the different steps that happen so just like when you're talking like what do you see what odds like different things that's happening with this program so what's one thing that's happening so as soon as you press like play what's the first thing it asks you how far road yet wait I didn't get a turn at all he gets I know we haven't started anything yet so I'm just fixing we're just but we're looking at the project and we're just trying to break it down so that it's easy for us to start coding it oh yeah okay sure how far will yeah yeah so then that's one step and then we can put in a number so just 30 and then what's another step that's happening how many degrees should Bob turn yep and then again we put in another number and then it turns and then what happens again like does it just finish or is it continuing its continued yep exactly so you can just keep continuing typing stuff so it keeps going how far will it work and how many degrees so some of the basic steps are when we start we like set up our turtle then it asks us for some input so how far will Bob work and then it works that far and then it asks us for the degrees how many degrees sit down and then it turns and then it keeps repeating that so I'll get my file open again so do you remember the first thing you need to type when you're making a turtle project or when you need to use turtle yeah import turtle yep good job so remember import turtle with the lowercase T and then we need to set up our actual turtle like the thing that's moving around do you remember how to do that as well okay not really that's okay so it's a bit like a variable because we want to give our turtle a name so I might call mine Bob you can call us whatever you want I'm gonna say Bob and because it's a variable we can say equals and we want to make Bob into a turtle but to do that you say yeah hmm what can i type someone's name yeah you can type another name that's fine okay Chester can you hear me okay so David you go turtle dot and then you type your turtle with a capital T and you have your two brackets so do you remember why we do that okay so the first thing importing turtle is because turtle is a library from somewhere else so that's like some code that someone else has written and we're using it so to be able to use it we have to actually import it and now to actually like create a turtle object we give it a name and we say equals a turtle so we go lower case turtle dot because that's saying it's from this turtle library you're saying okay turtle dot and then turtle with a capital T that that function means it's taking the total yeah okay yeah because that makes them kinda yeah yeah okay so what you can do now is you can do you remember how we change the shape of the turtle last week know everything from the last lesson is kind of unclear to me Oh unclear okay this yeah okay well this is this will be a good revision then for you so we want to change the shape of the turtle to be like a little turtle shape like you see in the project I showed you so to do that we gave our turtle the name so my ones called Bob so I'm going to go Bob dot shape and then brecht it inside the record of quotation mark and I want it to be the shape of a turtle so T you are TLE and then close the quotation mark and close the bracket yep so what I'm doing right now okay cool so what that does is we have to go Bob dot something so that it knows we're changing the shape of our turtles that we need and then we put the word turtle in quotation marks because it's a string so string is like a word yeah I'm done yep you're done okay so I'll get you to run it first now and just yeah okay and choose remember we would save it first yeah so when you press run it will ask you to save it sorry ash is choose where to save Chester can you hear me justic so remember how you made that folder last week uh just uh can you hear me hi so there is this is a turtle so this is called interactive turtle yeah so I just surge or just close a tough Todd looked at it yep so did it draw the little turtle yeah yep okay cool yeah now you just close it so chest up we're making a project called interactive turtle so it's like the one that I showed you in and oh yeah I can hear you can you hear me yep okay yeah so we're making a project we just started a project called interactive turtle and it's like what we start on what I showed you in the first week so if you can you see my screen yep so it's this thing so it asks how far will Bob walk and you can say a number and I didn't press play you can say a number and then it asks how far will Bob turn and you can say another number and then you can keep going so you can draw your own shapes hang them so we just started if you can see my screen and just quickly try and in those first three lines so we just created our turtle those are the first three steps oh yeah yes so in a new file mmhmm yep and David while you're waiting what we can do is we can change the color of our pen if we want how do you do John yep so it's just the same as like how we change the shape so we have to go bob dot bob dot but instead we can type in color the oh so you have to spell it the American Way because that's just how Python does it and then you can put in a color so I might want to change mine to green so you need the brackets and then the quotation marks again and inside that you type the word green or whatever color you want to change it to so python just like with the shape python like turtle has a few set shapes and set colors that you can use so sometimes it might not have every single color or every single shape like if you wanted a shape of a stapler or something it might not have that shape so you have to if you want to see what shapes or colors they have you can just google they can type in python turtle and then if we want to see what colors are we can type in color colors yeah I want to see no Konishi the shape the shape kind of change it to I'm so you could triangle yeah so you can try that but I'll let you also go on like on to Google and so I'll shut up just so you can see it for yourself okay now run it that one okay it says I can change it to that shape so there's no rectangle there's no rectangle yeah what is what did it say that it said like mm unable to get sad shape okay so yeah I'll let you go onto Google quickly and try look for it so type in something like turtle shape and it should be that first result so Chester how are you going with you oh yes it didn't it didn't I have a yeah I have a purple triangle okay cool nice did what use yep like those three lines and then I was just showing David how to change the shape and color of the turtle while we're waiting but I'll move on to the next step now does everything so far make sense to you guys yeah interactive so we're that's what we're making right now so we have to I I was explaining to David so we have to break it up into steps so the first step like we created our turtle now David do you remember the next step no no yeah I didn't remember anything from the last lesson so I'm gonna just it's not from last lesson what I was saying at the beginning but that's okay so if I open up the project we've created our turtle and now what it does is it asks us how far will bubble so that's what we need to do now we need to get it to ask us how far will bubble okay so how do we do jack yeah so that's what mix they know so before doing that so do you remember how in this project you can just keep typing stuff it's just continuous so it keeps going on forever it's doing that because we in something called a loop so if you remember we did something called some using for loops last lesson if you don't that's okay but do you remember the term Luke's David or Cheston now I remember I was trying to practice it you forgot had a carrot okay that's okay we're doing a different kind of look today but the loop we're doing today is called a while loop so what a while loop does is you can continue doing something until a certain condition is met so when we did a full lips last week we could just repeat something a certain number of times so last week we need for loops and like for example when we're drawing our square we wanted to repeat it four times so we use that thing called range but this week we want to repeat something to keep going forever so what we need to type is the word while so type in the word while because we're using a while loop yep and then the word true with a capital T so T Yui did it give it okay cool so Chester did you do that as well did you type in the word while and true thank you so type okay so the reason why we say the word true is because yeah you got it okay cool so the reason the word true here with a capital T is something called a boolean so it pretty much means something is true and because we're using a while loop that kind of takes some sort of condition to keep repeating something the condition we said here was true so like true is always going to be true so that means a like it's just gonna keep happening forever because that kind of makes it yeah okay okay so now if you remember from last week when we did loops we have to use indentation and we also have to use the semicolon so we type in while true and then the semicolon or the sorry and then if you press ENTER it should be the next line you write should be a bit engine turning yeah yep so that's good we want it to be indented so that our code knows anything that's indented is part of that loop such as don't cut that is up yeah yep okay so now what we want to do so we have our loop set up now we actually want to ask the user question so do you remember you might not if you're doing but do you remember how you get an input like you asked the person a question like do you remember how you get a value from on Python by asking the user question so I think we did it in the first lesson where we asked what is your name the first or second lesson does anyone remember no that's okay so we use something called input so if you type in the word inpu T so input is a bit like print but crane just writes down like a sentence or whatever word you say on the screen this writes down a sentence and then waits like it there's a space so that someone can type something afterwards so we want to say input how will Bob travel oh whatever you called you turtle so that's the first question our program asks us because if you remember in the example and it said how far will Bob travel so remember to type in input and then have brackets and then inside the brackets quotations quotation marks that say with the work with the phrase saying how far will Bob travel and then close them does everyone have that I'm just I'm just typing ok that's me also you don't have to use this exact phrase you can say something else just as long as it makes sense that you're asking how far will your turtle trouble so David do you have that line of call mmm yep just finished it yep ok cool you finish it okay so now I'll just get everyone to run what they have so far just to test what happens and if it works like way we expect it to so we want it to ask us how far will Bob or whatever name you gave your turtle trouble so it will ask the question in the Python shell and then you should still be able to just see the turtle there but it shouldn't do anything yet and then if you type something after the how file will bub trouble if you just type in anything it will just keep asking you the question because we put in a loop it will keep asking it from us forever to everyone test it and see if that works for you guys yep mmm there's ting it and finally we'll try one sails and no one Oh what she doesn't enter so Bob shouldn't move yet Oh your turtle won't move yet because we have encoded it to do that but if you just go into shell and where the question is you can keep answering a question yeah and yeah does it move I don't see moving because we have an ad of the code to make it move yet so oh yeah yeah I just registered and dowon's a thousand yeah so if you press enter it should ask you again so just press ENTER and see if it asked you again how did you just type me yes so you can type in letters as well because it doesn't know what like it doesn't know what it's expecting us to type in yeah yeah as long as it just keeps asking you the question as you press Enter you know that it's working you know that our while loop is working so that means it will do it forever so does everyone have that working yeah yep and does it so what did you say Jess all right yeah it works too if you just press ENTER yep so does that make sense how the while loop and the question is roughing the input thing yep David does that make sense you as well yeah yep okay so we'll go back so we'll close the show and then we'll go back to our program so what we want to do is we ask the person how far we want Bob to travel so Chester do you say something did you have a question nope okay so yeah what we did is we asked our user whoever's running our program how far we want Bob to travel but we actually want to be use whatever value they gave us to make our Bob or one of our turtle is move so we need to save this answer somewhere because if we just ask them we've asked them but we're not saving the value anywhere so our program won't remember what number we typed in so who remembers a way of how we can save values in something so anyone know if you remember how I explained something is like a little box that remembers a value what is that it's cold do you guys remember what variables are yeah so what's a variable so variable is something where you can go at something equals something but what we use variables for is to remember stuff or like to store values in something so for example in a game you might have a variable called score and you say score is equal to zero and then later on in that game you can change the school so in our case we want to save Paden are you learned that last year yes okay that's cool yes so what we want to do is we want to make a variable that remembers the distance that somebody typed in because in this program it asks how far will Bob walk so we need to remember that value so that we can use it later to actually make Bob walk so to do that we can type in the word distance so D is da equals so type that in before input so what that is doing is distance is the name of our variable and we're saying distance equals whatever our person typed in after this question so David does that make sense to you yep yep okay so you can use any word it doesn't have to be distance but you need to use something meaningful so something you know what I usually just yeah usually makes sense because we want to use it to say how far our total will look but you could use like steps or something like that as well but I'm just gonna stick with distance for now so does everyone have that yep yep just like it doing it okay cool and just remember with this input thing whatever the user types in afterwards will be saved as a string so what we're doing is we're saving whatever they typed after this question into a variable called distance as a string so once you've typed that just press ENTER so you're on the like next line but make sure you're still indented in because now we actually want to use that number or that value distance to make our turtle move so we just want to make it go forward however many times like whatever number the user typed in times so how might we do that does anyone have an idea I know I think yeah how far will Bob how long will Bob move or or something like that so before Bob does me before asking a question we actually want to make Bob move forward like however many times the person said it so if you look on my screen in the example program again it asks how far will Bob walk so that's the first step that we did that's the input thing and then once you type in a number so if I type in 50 it actually moves so that's the next step we're trying to do now so we ask the user how far will Bob walk and now we've saved whatever they type in in something called a variable which is called distance and now we want to actually make our turtle move so how do we make something move in Turtles if we just want to go forward what do we type in yep exactly so we'll go Bob duck forward just so that we know a moving Bob forward but inside the brackets we have to put in a number or we have to put in a value so what value do we put in does anyone know I think annually any value so the value we want is whatever the person typed in or oh yeah sure hard in abuja so do you have an idea so we saved whatever the person typed in there something called distance so what do you think we'll put inside the brackets sorry just I didn't hear you what do you think yep exactly so we put in the word distance inside the brackets so what that's saying is we want Bob to move forward this much time so distance time and distance is whatever we typed in so I'll get you guys to run it and see what happens but you might get an error and I'll explain it to you after but I just want you to run it first to see what happens yep run and then when it asks you how far will Bob travel just put in a number I'm just okay so I got an error and you guys should get an error too and if you will not if you don't get an error then it might be surprising oh yeah I have another yes so it's meant to give you an error because we explained it to you after we forgot to do something suppress the did you run yours and see as well yeah yep do you get an error as well whoa oh it just gave you an arrow straight away okay um you might have something in your code before that that causes an error but I'll first explain this error and then when I go back to my code you can see if yours looks like mine there might just be something wait it might be something when you did like distance equals that but the error we're getting here if you look on my screen is it's saying well it's a big error but it's pretty much saying can't multiply sequence by non int of type float that's a bit confusing but what in this case what it's saying is because it's telling us the error is in Lion ten where it says Bob dot for a distance if we go back into our code you remember how I said just a few minutes of the input saves whatever the user typed in as a string yep yep but in this function here where we say Bob dot for a distance we want it's expecting a number because it's expecting us to put in a number like 10 or 20 or something like that so even though we in our program even though we typed in a number in the background like it saved it as a string so instead of saving it as the number 80 when I type in 80 it's saved as 80 in quotation marks so what we need to do is we need to actually convert this so we need to convert the variable distance into an integer so an integer is a number an integer so do an integer is just another word for a number in programming languages so to convert it you just type in the word I and in front of the word distance in your Bob go forward thing yep and then you put brackets around the word distance so just check that yours looks like my code so the words are the letters int is short for integer yeah so it pretty much is just saying to convert distance that's a string into an integer and then did it work for you Chester yeah yeah okay so yeah David run yours as well run what did you say Chester sorry Connie yep so type in a number now and see what happens now your turtle should move hopefully hey yes it did it did cool Chester did yours move no no did you get an error what does your arrow say so did it look like the one I had before yeah yeah I got are not slow so in your code do you have this bit where you convert it to an insert int distance and balance so I didn't hear gesture did you okay so just add that in now so the int and then in brackets distance is just converting that variable which right now is a string into a number so like if you type in a number in the background it will just change it to an actual number value in our code so that this Bob dot forward function can actually work yep I think so once you save it like in the first the first time it saves it automatically and because we have it in our while loop so David as well because you have yours in a while loop you can keep doing lines so like every time it asks you you can just type in like one and then it can move like ten and you keep drawing lines so as everyone's working it yep okay that's pretty cool right and then you can just say how much how far we'll go so now we'll do the next step which is actually making it turn so what's the first thing we need to make it turn so it's almost like what we did up here but instead if you look at the example project it says something else it says how many degree should Bob done so how do we type that bit of coding can someone tell me so before I know right before yeah nothing so yes but instead we want to make a new variable so distance is what we use like for the question how far will Bob travel but we want to make a new variable so that we know how like Bob will turn so what we could call it is something like angle equals so we're making a new variable now that remembers the angle that somebody typed in so what do I need to type in next angle yep exactly input and then sorry what do you say yeah or turn but yep so you can type in something like what angle lil bub so David did you get all that as well I'm trying right now you're trying right now okay so what it's doing is it's pretty much the same thing as what we typed before but it's just asking different question and saving it in a different variable name you got that so I got it you got it okay so now we actually want to use this variable to make our turtle turn to make Bob turn so what does anyone know what line of code we might use well the beginning of the line so yep yep so we go Bob dot and then we can type in left so that we're turning to the left so many degrees and then what do we need to type inside the brackets yep exactly so we need to do the same thing we did with forward by first changing it to an integer so int and then we need brackets again and inside the second set of brackets we want to type in the word angle so what we're telling our program is for bub to turn so many degrees based on whatever we typed in first and we write the word int to convert what we typed in to a number yep yep does that make sense yes yep yes if you have a question you know or if it doesn't make complete sense let me know but if it's all okay we can run yep run module and then see what happens so you should be able to now continuously say how far to walk and what angle to turn okay half I will book traveled 10 what angle what angle I have an error you have an error what's the error they trace back my street and call last file see you should fly up data located module Bob left angle mmhmm yes all exact does it say like invalid literal or something for base it says invalid yep so I think what you might have done is what was the last thing you typed in was it a number was it a letter oh it was a letter it was a letter yes so that's what the error is because it's trying to convert whatever we typed in so it's trying to convert like the letter you type in into a number but the program can't convert like the letter A into a number like it can convert a in quotation marks into a number like before when you type it like if you typed in 50 it can convert 50 from quotation marks into a number but because it's a letter it can't do that because yeah so we can actually add something in our program to check if what the person typed in was a literal number do you guys want to do that because we have 10 minutes left so we can check like it's whatever somebody typed in was actually a number so do you guys want to do that oh yeah yes okay what did you say chess si looks like a golf club that's funny okay so what we want to do is we want to check whatever the person typed in is a number so in Python there is a way to do that let me try find it or we can put a limit on actually no let me try find it so check give me a second okay so do you remember how I was talking about if I think we used it some things called if statements we use it a couple of lessons ago so we can use if statements to check if something is true or false and if it is then we can do something inside that if statement so what we want to do is we want to check if whatever they typed in is a number if it is will make Bob go forward and if it's not we'll give them an error message so let me just get the code up okay so this is a bit different so there's something called let me should I find an easier way to do it without confusing you guys what we can say is there's something called pass in I'm pretty sure so let me just let me get it up so that I know exactly what to show you cuz in Python you have to check if it is a number and if it isn't you want to do something else so let me get it otherwise what you can do is I'll do it this way okay I'll show you guys so there's something called if statements where you can check if something is true we want to do something else but in Python there's also something called trycatch statements so what trycatch statements do is they're a bit like if statements so you tell it to try a bit of code and the catch thing is if there's an error you want to do something else or you want to say something else so I'll type it in for you so we got to type in the word try and then do the colon and press Enter so you want to say try and we want to try make Bob Bob go forward so I'm just gonna cut like take this out of here and put it in the try thing so I just press ctrl X on my keyboard to cut it and I pasted it in here to let me know when you have done that step yeah yep you've done that cool so that step is first saying okay after we've asked them for the input and saved it we want to try and make Bob go forward that's that step and then the next thing we want to say is so instead of cat we're gonna say except instead the except type in the word except and we want to say value error actually before that I'm just gonna quickly find out so what we're saying here what we need to find out is what type of error our code will get if we don't type in a word so just look on my screen for the minute I'm just come home minding sound stuff out just to test something I just want to see what type of error it will tell me so if I press thanks okay yep so it says do you see how if everyone's looking my screen it asks me how far will Bob travel and I just typed in space and press enter and then I got something called a value error because it's expecting something that's a number but it's actually something else does that make sense of her yep yeah okay so I'll show you why did that so what I want to do is we want to try make Bob 4 go forward but if it doesn't work so if it doesn't work we want to say try do that but the except thing means except if we get a value error so the value error did you see how when I tested my program before we got something called the value error so what we're telling our code here is we want to make Bob go forward but if we get a value error we want to do something else so make sure to put that Kohl in there and press ENTER and now in this line we can tell it what else to do instead of making Bob go forward so what I might do is I might say print and I might say sorry that is not a valid number okay so it's kind of like saying an error message so I'll quickly explain it again so once we lost the user for the put like we've saved whatever they typed in we want to try make Bob go forward so if they type in a number and it's fine then we'll Bob will go forward and there's no issues but if like say you accidentally typed this space and try to make Bob go forward it wouldn't work because it can't convert a space into a number so that's why we're saying if it gets that error so that type of error is called the value error we want to tell the person sorry that's not a valid number and then we want to make them we want to ask them again how far will Bob travel and then you can make make Bob go forward again if you want so before doing that we'll just do this sorry that's not a valid number thing and see what happens okay so if you press and run and run module we'll try test it and see what happens so first just test it normally by typing in a number like 10 and see if it moved and then make sure to do the angle and now if you type in like a letter it gives you the error message did that work for everyone else yep yep does that kind of make sense so it was a bit confusing cuz it's like a new concept but didn't make sense how it looked yes so no all kind of so David did it make sense to you yep yep okay just that did it make sense to you what we did with that try and accept thing yeah yeah okay cool so what we can do is you can add it for the angle as well you can do the same code so what you can do is you can just copy this line of that bunch of coats the try/except and underneath angle you can paste it make sure that it's still all indented nicely and then instead of in the second in the bit you copied instead of doing the bobbed up forward you can so I'm just pressing ctrl C to copy and ctrl V to paste and then ctrl X to cut and then ctrl V to paste so I'll just add some spaces so you can see what's happening so what we're doing is just doing the same thing but for the angle this time so we're gonna we ask the person what angle do they want Bob to turn if it's a number then it will turn that angle and if it's not then it'll say sorry that's not a valid number so it's like a little error message so you know how when we did it we got an error message but it was like that error message in red so it's a bit confusing this is us actually typing in our own error messages in the program so what it does is it allows you to still run the program but it just tells the person of the error message so did everyone type and paste it did it work for you Chester I just know what happened that's good so now make sure yep so make sure if you haven't tested it already to test it and see that both were the angle under distance angle turn Hey sorry that's none of that work on there yep so my one works does everyone else as well yep yep cool it doesn't work what is you're saying okay do you want to maybe get you to share your screen just so I can see what it is I'll stop sharing mine also it's 530 now so I'll quickly help just the fixes but David did you as well okay and everything yes yeah did you have any questions all right no it was all clear it was all clear okay that's good so if you want you can leave or you can just quickly see what they show is with Chester's as well if you wanted to just see what it was before leaving so I'll just quickly see so Justin if you just run your program give me that ah okay so I see what the error is so do you see how it says something called name error the name distance is not defined you just forgot the letter e I'm pretty sure yep so you just misspelled distance so just add in the e yep so a name error means there's something wrong with that like a name of your variable generally it usually means it can't find the variable and also Chester okay let you run it first yay yay cool and one more thing suggest if you go back to your code you actually I think you asked yes so you make Bob move forward twice because do you see how you have it straight off for the first thing and then you have it in that try except function so get rid of it underneath the distance equals thing not that not that line the line underneath so just yeah just that line because otherwise you're just repeating it twice and then it's moving double so you can just press backspace but yeah other than that did anyone have any other questions no no okay so then that's the end of the lesson I'll see you guys next week then okay good bye bye
