With timestamps:

00:01 - I'll share my swing first just to show
00:04 - you a couple of things and then right
00:07 - you can share your spin off if you want
00:09 - if yeah but first i'll share my screen
00:13 - and just to show you what i'm doing i'm
00:15 - just gonna quickly explain so lastly it
00:19 - was kind of a bit unstructured because i
00:21 - was just trying to figure out what level
00:22 - yeah and then so what I think we'll do
00:26 - is so a lesson plans we do have more
00:30 - complex games like graphic games later
00:32 - on they don't use you want to use TK
00:36 - inter but they use stuff called PI game
00:38 - and turtle but to be able to do those
00:41 - games you have to be able to know like
00:44 - about the stuff before them so you have
00:46 - to be comfortable with the lessons
00:47 - before that so we'll be going through
00:50 - those concepts it's that's okay and then
00:52 - some of the stuff I think you might have
00:54 - done so we'll we can go over those
00:56 - quicker and like skip to the next ones
00:58 - wouldn't mind if we redid the clock that
01:02 - you showed me last yeah yeah yeah so
01:03 - we'll start with the clock first yeah
01:05 - and then so just like overall for this
01:08 - term so this is like called Python
01:10 - number two because you already know some
01:13 - of this stuff we could probably like
01:15 - speed up and then like do a bit of
01:18 - Python number three as well probably do
01:21 - both so we'll see how it goes
01:23 - but yeah yeah so we'll start with the
01:26 - clock do you want to share your screen
01:29 - maybe would that be easier
01:30 - so I'll get oh wait sorry before we
01:32 - start I'll show you some of the projects
01:34 - will be doing this semester this term
01:36 - anyway just so you have an idea of what
01:39 - we're doing and then we'll start the
01:41 - clock can you see my screen um okay yeah
01:53 - I can see it now
01:54 - okay so yeah this level 2 and then this
01:57 - level 3 cuz you already know some stuff
02:00 - like we went over them pretty fast so we
02:02 - could probably do both so things we can
02:04 - do I like the clock like you so and then
02:08 - this stuff like yeah this which uses
02:13 - um dictionaries and advance lists like
02:17 - lists you might have done them before so
02:20 - we'll see how we go but I'll show you
02:22 - the type of projects you can make with
02:23 - them so once it loads
02:29 - this is nope try not to show you the
02:35 - good book so like you can it use this
02:39 - list M loops and stuff to encrypt blood
02:41 - so like hello and then it encrypts the
02:46 - word so have you heard of encrypting
02:48 - before yeah yep so it's like kind of a
02:51 - program that does that and then you can
02:53 - decrypt it I think if you type in what
02:57 - that is it decrypts the message back to
02:59 - what it was so that's like some of the
03:01 - stuff we could be doing this time and
03:04 - then like this to-do lists which we can
03:10 - also add more to make them more complex
03:13 - so these use this one uses things like
03:16 - functions lists etc and we could add
03:21 - like variables and like add schools and
03:24 - stuff so it just makes you like it
03:28 - allows us to know like the fundamentals
03:30 - of the fights and things so we can build
03:33 - on it so I can add something by going
03:38 - you're gonna say what step you want to
03:40 - do so one I want to add something and
03:42 - just say a police been added so if I
03:45 - want to display the list at number three
03:47 - I can see my list and you can remove
03:49 - stuff and things like that we'll go
03:51 - through a little later on like some of
03:53 - the things we could be doing this time
03:55 - just what you so what I'll do is what do
03:58 - you want me to share my screen and you
04:00 - want kind of solo on it okay yeah
04:06 - smaller okay so I think it's a full
04:10 - screen so if you press escape on your
04:11 - keyboard okay yeah I got my just see if
04:17 - I can make it a bit bigger just to be
04:20 - able to see little bit more there
04:25 - I'm just sharing my whole screen just
04:27 - because whenever we run it otherwise
04:29 - they'll have to stop sharing and then
04:31 - share the next window but you can only
04:33 - like you can crop your screen so that
04:36 - you can only see my bit when it when I
04:39 - get it open so yeah like you don't need
04:42 - to see the stuff on the side so you can
04:45 - like make you browse it it's more so can
05:06 - you see my screen and your screen okay
05:08 - yep good and then you just open up a new
05:15 - python file
05:17 - yeah I just use the same on my you'll
05:20 - each hit everything from last time
05:24 - so what leasing is it does the clock do
05:27 - you remember how the clock looks like do
05:30 - you want me to show you okay so we used
05:33 - to draw the lines it's an old turtle I
05:35 - think any hurdle you have yeah so using
05:38 - turtle and the time libraries so because
05:42 - the external libraries we have to import
05:45 - them actually I'll quickly get the clock
05:49 - up just so that we can break down what
05:52 - we need to do I'm gonna show you really
06:00 - quickly once it loads
06:07 - try not to look at the code to the first
06:14 - thing if you saw it when it loaded it
06:16 - drew the circle yeah and then the line
06:19 - and then it started ticking so I'll
06:22 - close that so this is the sort of timer
06:26 - you are talking about yes timer so like
06:30 - this is just kind of like a visual
06:32 - representation oh this is like with that
06:35 - using the sleep method still but yeah
06:38 - it's like yeah it's a pretty like easy
06:41 - way to do the timer that still works so
06:44 - yeah because time is a external library
06:47 - we have to import it yep import time and
06:51 - turtle yep and Turtles import by the way
06:59 - um yep you know to use the from from
07:06 - yeah yeah you can use it if you want so
07:10 - do you know how to use it
07:12 - yep yeah okay cool so yeah the other way
07:21 - of doing it is just like importing
07:22 - turtle and I'm making your own kind of
07:25 - thing like in the next step but the way
07:28 - you said it just does it in like one
07:30 - step pretty much so if you want to test
07:35 - that it works the from turtle input
07:41 - whatever your thing is you can run it so
07:45 - you might call you know what I'd use
07:47 - actually is I just put the star sign
07:50 - that allows me to import everything
07:52 - alright
07:53 - you mean up here umm no like just what
07:59 - you did from total total import stuff
08:01 - all right
08:02 - yep yeah that way I don't have to right
08:04 - right right right yeah I get you yeah
08:08 - that's fine too I thought you meant the
08:10 - next step yes so the next thing we need
08:11 - to do is we need to make our turtle so
08:14 - you can use like turtle dot something
08:16 - but we'll just make it with a new
08:19 - variable just so that we know
08:20 - that's the one with controlling so it's
08:23 - kind of like I own one so we can go like
08:26 - well I can call it whatever you want
08:29 - maybe I'll call it like tick but yeah
08:36 - sorry
08:37 - well you're gonna say ok tick equals to
08:39 - you okay yeah okay I get it yeah so tick
08:42 - equals and what we're going to do is
08:44 - turtle dot but you've already imported
08:47 - everything turtle yeah so we've imported
08:50 - everything so now what we're doing is
08:52 - you just have to go making like a turtle
08:55 - cold tick so we've imported everything
08:59 - so now we can use everything it wouldn't
09:01 - wouldn't you just have to write the
09:03 - truth with a capital T yeah so you
09:08 - probably could do that we'll check if it
09:13 - works I'm just used to doing turtle dot
09:15 - so generally it's good to go like
09:17 - something dot just let you know which
09:19 - libraries from but yeah good work we'll
09:22 - see if it works I'm just gonna quickly
09:31 - [Music]
09:41 - [Music]
09:53 - yeah so it's the same thing so that's
09:58 - fine also another way if you wanted to
10:01 - like shorten this into one line you
10:04 - could just go like import turtle as tick
10:08 - so that kind of does it all in one one
10:11 - if that makes sense yeah I think I get
10:13 - it yeah but either way yeah we just want
10:15 - to make one so that we can control it it
10:17 - doesn't really matter too much if you
10:19 - want to just go turtle dot forward and
10:21 - stuff but yeah anyway the next thing we
10:24 - want to do is we first wanna
10:28 - we wanna draw the circle but before
10:32 - doing that do you see how do you
10:33 - remember how in the example project it
10:36 - kind of did the circle but you couldn't
10:38 - really see the cursor and it did it
10:40 - pretty fast yeah
10:42 - yep so to do that we just want to change
10:44 - the speed of the turtle so that's just
10:48 - by going um like that's me but you don't
10:52 - need to write tick so you need to do
10:55 - tick so that it actually knows you're
10:57 - talking about the speed for the tip okay
11:00 - if that makes sense
11:01 - cuz in Python like you could also have
11:04 - your own method called speed like
11:08 - somewhere else so you just want to make
11:10 - sure that you're assigning the speed to
11:12 - that turtle element could you could you
11:17 - not what speed fifty speeds or a hundred
11:22 - even fifty one hundred something that's
11:25 - pretty far I got a great number okay
11:30 - that's good and then we just want to
11:31 - hide the cursor as well so to do that
11:35 - there's a function called high tidal yep
11:38 - - almost hide turtle yeah where is it
11:41 - isn't it tick tock oh is it tick tock hi
11:44 - turtle yeah I'm pretty sure take the
11:46 - high tunnel we can check it and see what
11:51 - happens
11:53 - yes so the reason why we're doing the
11:55 - tick dot is because we're controlling
11:58 - like our little turtle though yeah um
12:03 - what do you what what you could do vote
12:08 - clean you just um not have the tick
12:11 - equal turtle yes so then instead of that
12:16 - you would just go like turtle dot speed
12:18 - and turtle dot hi turtle no pigs we've
12:20 - already imported turtle yep
12:22 - so the thing tick is like our own
12:25 - variable of a turtle like we've kind of
12:28 - made an object called tick is how we
12:31 - control it that's what you mean I start
12:33 - that we don't do we really need to I get
12:36 - sick because couldn't we just mean do
12:39 - you just want to go like speed and
12:42 - heíd turtle like that no yet we could do
12:46 - that couldn't move so generally because
12:50 - it's from it'll not the library I think
12:52 - you have to do the dot we can try it
12:55 - I'll just try it and see what happens
13:00 - because importing it just means like we
13:03 - can use all those libraries it knows
13:04 - what we're referring to but let's test
13:08 - it okay so I just tested it oh yeah okay
13:20 - that's my bad yeah so generally I just
13:23 - do the tick I like you know the turtle
13:26 - dot something just so that I know that
13:28 - I'm referring to the turtle but it works
13:32 - this way too so yeah so what we want to
13:41 - do is we want to we want to do our
13:46 - circle but we kind of need to map out
13:48 - where we'll start our circle from
13:50 - because at the end we want it like you
13:53 - know it draws a circle and then it draws
13:55 - the line you said to draw a circle you
13:57 - need the radius yep yep that first but
14:03 - also I mean like the position of where
14:06 - the turtle will be on the screen cuz
14:08 - right now if you run it I think the
14:11 - turtle starts off in the middle of the
14:13 - screen so if you draw the circle it
14:16 - might do it kind of off to the edge yeah
14:20 - if that makes it so we might need to
14:22 - move our turtle somewhere like to the
14:25 - side and then draw the circle you just
14:27 - go move turtle not exactly but before
14:32 - that we first need to think about so how
14:35 - big we want to make our circle just so
14:38 - that we know how much to move it off to
14:40 - the side so how big do you think we do
14:43 - maybe we could do a radius of 100 150
14:51 - yep so let's just say 150 so what we can
14:55 - do is
14:55 - can move the turtle to the right 150 so
15:01 - I think I've Turtles automatically
15:03 - facing the right so we can just go
15:05 - forward 150 okay so but if we do this
15:17 - forward 150 it would draw the line on
15:20 - the screen so before making it go for
15:24 - pinup yeah so in this it's just called
15:28 - up oh wait how do you
15:32 - how come it's only up because it's just
15:35 - part of I think it's just generally
15:37 - because usually if you go like turtle up
15:39 - it's like total the up or total duck
15:41 - down pretty sure it's just off isn't it
15:45 - also polar I haven't tried pinup it
15:49 - could be both because pinup I'm always
15:52 - up we can check it and see could be both
16:03 - oh wait and I might be coming up million
16:07 - so I think you can do both
16:10 - plus I might be it might be confusing
16:13 - with scratch yeah so scratch it is pinup
16:16 - and pin down but sometimes there's also
16:18 - different versions of turtle so let me
16:22 - quickly find up so okay so there's like
16:31 - three different ways of doing it so you
16:33 - can go pen up PU flip n up or up so that
16:39 - all like they do the same thing but it's
16:42 - just a different way of different
16:45 - functions going it all right and it's
16:48 - the same foot down so yeah you can do
16:50 - either one
16:56 - so we do up then we do and then we want
17:00 - to move off to the side 150 okay then we
17:04 - do down yep down so now and I forgot how
17:10 - to draw the safe the circle yeah yep so
17:14 - it's just circle I'm pretty sure the
17:16 - function sorry so circle because there's
17:21 - an inbuilt function and then the radius
17:27 - 150 yep so what that will do is it will
17:32 - mean the circle is actually in the
17:35 - middle of the screen now it should be
17:37 - we'll test it and see what it looks like
17:55 - yes sir I have the same thing circle is
17:59 - not defined I think mine the circles a
18:04 - bit off wait did you did I spell it
18:08 - incorrectly or it could be that so how
18:11 - just double check the spelling Cir CLE
18:15 - see oh I forgot the RT yeah yeah the
18:29 - same thing it's a tiny bit oh yeah so I
18:32 - think the reason for that is we moved
18:35 - off to the side but then we were still
18:37 - facing that way so then it drew the
18:40 - circle from there
18:42 - whereas we should have started facing
18:44 - like to the top then it would have drawn
18:46 - the circle directly does that mean it
18:48 - now really if it is true so what it is
18:54 - is you know how the cursor like of the
18:57 - turtle faces this way usually to the
19:00 - right so we moved to the side 150 and
19:04 - then we drew the circle still facing the
19:07 - right so it did
19:09 - the circle like here yeah but what we
19:12 - wanted to do is we wanted to stop during
19:14 - the circle when we were facing the top
19:16 - so it drills a circle that way instead
19:20 - of me that way didn't have the same
19:22 - effect it I thought it would have I'm
19:27 - just trying to picture it well there's
19:30 - one way to find out
19:32 - we'll test it cuz I thought yeah it
19:38 - could just be that it's drawing it
19:39 - slightly off wait for right can't you
19:42 - just go RT right yeah I know I usually
19:48 - use right but it's probably both the
19:52 - same thing also sorry I accidentally
19:54 - closed my file but is it true why is it
19:57 - turn right over so I just use right and
20:00 - then you put in the degrees inside 19
20:04 - wait it wouldn't be right it would be
20:07 - less no it's right it is right you're
20:09 - facing this way it would be let me it
20:13 - will be left yet sorry my accidentally
20:20 - closed my program we'll see if it works
20:24 - I have it I'm about to check it yeah and
20:31 - we have the thing in right in the middle
20:33 - right in the middle so the circles run
20:35 - in the middle okay yeah that's good yeah
20:38 - so I think the reason for that is
20:40 - because it was kind of already facing
20:43 - that direction it drew the circle
20:45 - towards our right instead of starting up
20:48 - from the beginning and drawing it more
20:50 - towards the left
20:51 - I might it might be easy if you draw it
20:55 - on a piece of paper so it's just the way
20:59 - it was facing because yeah it depends
21:04 - like where you draw the circle right so
21:08 - okay let me quickly add the right so
21:12 - what else must we do now okay so the
21:15 - next thing we want to do is do you
21:16 - remember how in the time of thing it
21:18 - drew the tick like from the middle yep
21:21 - so
21:22 - wanna go to the middle of our screen so
21:25 - we want to make sure curses in the
21:26 - middle of the screen said do you know
21:28 - what we would use middle row middle not
21:32 - exactly so use something with
21:34 - coordinates so we just want to make our
21:37 - cursor jump to a point on the screen so
21:40 - we can use set position so set position
21:45 - okay yep we drew a circle and then and
21:55 - then so the very middle of the screen is
21:58 - zero zero x coordinate and the y
22:01 - coordinate is zero well it doesn't start
22:06 - with the X yep starts with the X and
22:10 - then why it's a second Valley all right
22:12 - then then what must we do then what we
22:16 - must do is now we actually start like we
22:21 - need to start a loop and then we can
22:23 - drill okay
22:24 - yeah we need to start a loop and then we
22:27 - can start like drawing our line every
22:29 - second so it's you know it did a for
22:33 - loop or a so we want we want to make it
22:37 - happen forever
22:38 - so we'll do a while loop but just before
22:41 - that we'll just quickly check that our
22:44 - pen is in the right spot but so after
22:47 - your set position we'll just draw a
22:49 - straight line saying forward 150 just to
22:53 - check like before we start the loop that
22:56 - will it will draw where it's a coaster
22:59 - so because now we know the radius of the
23:02 - circle 150 should be like half that
23:07 - circle so we know that size so it's a
23:09 - good size
23:10 - keep drawing a line so it should draw
23:14 - the circle and then go to the middle and
23:16 - then drill 15 I'm going to check it as
23:25 - well mm-hmm okay so might have done two
23:32 - lines did you
23:35 - do that too I don't think that's it yeah
23:40 - so yep I didn't still set position right
23:43 - okay okay this one's in rhythm I forgot
23:50 - the second so when you do it you might
23:53 - see two lines it's just because we
23:55 - forgot one yeah I have two lines that's
23:58 - weird
23:59 - yeah so the reason for that is the set
24:01 - position it drew it okay and then we
24:05 - didn't want to draw the line we just
24:07 - wanted to move it so they have to go
24:09 - pick up yep pin up and pin down but but
24:14 - what we wouldn't need to do that we
24:16 - always just a test right
24:18 - so it still need to do it for the set
24:21 - position we don't need the forward thing
24:23 - yet but because if we got rid of the
24:25 - forward it would still draw one line
24:27 - okay I should we don't want it to draw a
24:29 - line we just want to make sure it's
24:30 - that's in the middle so yeah we would go
24:32 - up and then down so now the cursor
24:42 - should be in the middle let's we hit the
24:47 - thing
25:01 - yep I have the line yeah you have the
25:05 - line to keep end of the line of you
25:10 - adding like weather angle and you can
25:17 - get the angle spot I look because you
25:20 - want to be constantly ticks we can use a
25:22 - while loop and we can just say while
25:25 - true so that means it will just happen
25:28 - Florida true and then now what you want
25:35 - to do is now you do the forward okay
25:48 - then we yes
25:53 - but exactly one degree because we're
25:57 - doing it according to time so think it's
26:01 - a different degree because if we do it
26:05 - if we turn one degree each time it will
26:07 - be like turning 360 lines
26:10 - um 360 divided by 60 so we can okay six
26:15 - yet it my thing kind of Rosa this
26:19 - explaining to you but yeah you can turn
26:23 - that then then just a timer right sleep
26:27 - yep sleep sleep and then one second but
26:34 - one thing is before you do the probably
26:40 - shouldn't matter too much but before you
26:42 - do the changing the degree we need to do
26:45 - something called Bob undo which would
26:47 - undo the line we just did it probably
26:50 - doesn't matter too much of the order um
26:55 - yeah I think undo just on just like
26:59 - Alaska man so you probably need to put
27:00 - under it under the last Helicon because
27:03 - the total thing so changing that degrees
27:06 - I found you if that makes I did just try
27:08 - yeah um there was a one problem
27:14 - what's the problem do you wanna share
27:17 - its we go it's not going back to the set
27:20 - position it's not going back to the set
27:23 - position okay like if I couldn't I think
27:26 - we have to put a set position in the
27:27 - while loop yeah we can try that
27:30 - so what was yours doing so far mine
27:35 - Judah line the middle yep turn six
27:38 - degrees but then it went out of the
27:40 - circle okay
27:41 - yes so the reason for that is did you
27:43 - have your undrew under no but wouldn't
27:49 - we still read so we could use that
27:52 - position but what we want to do is we
27:55 - want to drill a line and then undo it
27:57 - and then go on up the line and undo it
27:59 - but because I'm doing it is like an
28:01 - eraser okay exactly okay under function
28:04 - just like under gloss but maybe 150 so
28:07 - you wanted it it would go back to the
28:08 - same position was so yeah just undo yep
28:13 - so yeah that's it it stopped
28:29 - undo yeah you and you yeah okay yeah so
28:34 - what order did you type oh I go forward
28:40 - 150 the first line yeah 60 right sing
28:45 - sorry would you write write say by 6 yep
28:49 - so sleep one time dogs and then okay so
28:54 - what the undo thing does is it unders
28:58 - the last turtle function so because you
29:02 - did forward and then right it's undoing
29:05 - your turn six so it keeps just drawing
29:08 - the straight line so what you want to do
29:11 - is you want to go forward I think you're
29:14 - gonna sleep and then you want to undo
29:17 - that forward and then you want to turn
29:20 - right so turn like six degrees is the
29:24 - last thing you want to do or you could
29:26 - also just
29:27 - also just um you could do it now you
29:34 - could do it in a way the other way
29:37 - around
29:37 - just the other way around all right I
29:40 - lost it by turning right first and then
29:43 - let me like you could go 150 mm-hmm
29:47 - undue and densely yep yeah that could
29:55 - work
29:55 - the only thing we can test it and see
29:57 - but if you do sleep after the undo you
30:02 - might not see your line for long enough
30:05 - if you want to make sure the line stays
30:08 - on for one second and then moves you can
30:11 - test it and see what happens close ok
30:14 - 100 it could still work because it's all
30:18 - in a loop anyway sorry my computer's a
30:22 - bit Rosen yep yep is it ice yep I see
30:38 - the problem
30:40 - so what's happening on yours the same
30:43 - thing you predicted okay yeah so
30:46 - sometimes it's like to test it and see
30:50 - what happens anyway because like they
30:53 - seemed like it wouldn't make a
30:54 - difference but surprisingly hate this my
31:03 - title Python kind of got frozen too
31:07 - ah what would you oh wait I should have
31:15 - the four times of sleep and then undo so
31:21 - yeah thank you yeah so that way it
31:24 - drills stays for a second and then under
31:27 - sit turns and then throws with him I'm
31:30 - not really sure but before what it did
31:32 - was it drew the line and then it kept on
31:35 - going again again
31:36 - I just straight okay now
31:40 - no it did that two times before yeah it
31:44 - is working now yeah
31:47 - okay that's good yes so the first reason
31:50 - it was doing that it kept going straight
31:53 - was because you were undoing the angle
31:56 - thing because I think you did forward
31:58 - and then you did right six degrees and
32:01 - then you did undo so undo instead of
32:04 - undoing forward like you thought it
32:06 - would it was undoing turn six degrees so
32:09 - I just kept going forward
32:10 - wait a second forward wait a second wait
32:13 - a second does that make sense
32:17 - so okay now I get it oh it only under
32:21 - the last okay yeah sorry for not
32:24 - making that clear yes undo it's just
32:26 - part of total just as the last thing so
32:28 - that's why the order does matter
32:30 - um a way you could do this more
32:32 - complicated mm-hmm
32:34 - would you be able to just like you would
32:41 - be able to ask them how much time they
32:45 - would like divide it and made an angle
32:48 - that much yeah
32:50 - you could do that like a time a kind of
32:52 - thing yeah yeah that would that could
32:55 - work and so thank you did you want to
32:59 - start on the next thing yeah so did that
33:02 - make sense to you yep yep okay cool so
33:05 - that's just like one way how you can use
33:07 - the time let me get the next thing open
33:10 - do wait do we need a timer or no so now
33:16 - we're gonna learn like something else so
33:17 - you can close that file I'm going to
33:19 - open a new file if you want okay so have
33:25 - you done much on lists
33:31 - yes yes have you done a lot of it oh
33:35 - just like really I have done some any
33:40 - okay well we'll go through it and then
33:42 - if you have done it we can just go
33:44 - through it you want sorry I do remember
33:46 - now
33:47 - ya want me to show you which one is it
33:52 - I actually am having a bit of problems
33:55 - like it's the same also if you want that
33:59 - sharing this thing thank you what were
34:04 - you saying sorry
34:06 - okay here we go yep here can you see
34:11 - that
34:12 - it's just loading yep I can see okay
34:18 - have a look at this mm-hmm that's we run
34:22 - it okay so this is actually dictionary
34:25 - that's like the mixed-up optimist under
34:28 - an english word or phrase so I can just
34:30 - go like in peace it that is how you
34:41 - spell peace right yep like pieces in
34:44 - like peace yep yeah yep
34:47 - oh let's see okay oh that's weird
34:51 - and in yeah that's like that's my
34:56 - problem too in isn't going good yeah
34:59 - that's a hot year um and let me have a
35:03 - look at you'll see have a dictionary
35:08 - where key phrase equals please enter an
35:12 - English word look great
35:15 - again I copy this one from the book okay
35:19 - um I added my own thing for one a part
35:23 - of it
35:23 - oh yeah do you mind if I just try to run
35:26 - it again yeah that's fine it seems like
35:28 - you should look because it shouldn't be
35:31 - picking up the innards like code okay
35:34 - I'm running it I might just let me have
35:37 - a look if I can do this one just hello
35:40 - right and it's a I just want to learn
35:42 - how to say hello enter
35:45 - it's not taking my enter I think I'm
35:48 - saying is it could be stuck on something
35:53 - on this input
35:55 - please enter an English word keyword
35:57 - equals III uh-huh window so then the
36:02 - next step you do is you open like a TK
36:04 - into window that open somewhere else
36:07 - when you ran that I don't think so
36:13 - because then after that the only place
36:17 - where you print something is like that
36:20 - line towards the bottom yeah yeah I
36:25 - don't think so I wanna say things if I
36:27 - guess right hello the problem is it's
36:30 - not at a nose pops up it's just say you
36:33 - know if I could keep on pressing enter
36:35 - okay cuz okay
36:38 - one reason if we go back into your code
36:42 - it's like after you have the input thing
36:46 - the only thing you do with that like you
36:50 - try to open the TK into window and then
36:54 - the only other place where you print
36:56 - something is in an on click event do you
37:00 - see how you have the print in robot say
37:02 - and then you have that work line there
37:06 - oh I see the problem
37:08 - yeah so if you try to print something
37:11 - straight off the input what do you need
37:14 - to just go on click like that so yeah so
37:22 - I think what this is doing is the
37:23 - onclick is trying to detect it from TK
37:26 - inter yeah TK inter but your TK inter
37:31 - thing is an opening properly I know my
37:35 - problem is that I only defined a TK
37:37 - enter I never used
37:40 - yeah look at this I said it's it's in my
37:44 - program is still running that's a weird
37:47 - thing a must trying to do something the
37:49 - background here it says define on click
37:52 - event all right okay so and you made
37:56 - your own event right
37:58 - on click event what if I did this would
38:01 - it work so what do you use event is said
38:04 - remember we're talking about parameters
38:07 - yes yes so inside the bracket on click
38:11 - event it's kind of like a parameter but
38:15 - I guess it's like an on-click perimeter
38:22 - okay there we go okay so now if you
38:26 - press the button it should yeah okay
38:29 - yeah yeah so you were right about you
38:32 - just want calling the function okay yeah
38:36 - okay cool okay yeah so yeah that's
38:43 - dictionaries but we can go through lists
38:47 - really quickly couple of minutes left
38:50 - but since you've done lists it should be
38:53 - pretty easy for you there's like that
38:56 - you know that to do that to do little
38:59 - program I showed you before yeah if you
39:02 - if like you don't find a list too easy
39:05 - we can do with that like the first
39:07 - lesson next week we'll see how it goes
39:10 - so I'll just share my screen again so
39:23 - can you see my screen and your screen as
39:27 - well
39:30 - no my second thing okay yep I should
39:36 - have it yep
39:38 - so just for now we'll stay on show on
39:41 - Python shell oh just a couple of stuff
39:43 - and then we can move on okay see the
39:46 - time cuz there's only a couple minutes
39:47 - few minutes left but yeah so do you know
39:51 - what a list is like if you had to
39:52 - explain one yes oh this is like that
39:57 - it's like a variable that contains more
40:00 - than one item yeah pretty much
40:02 - yeah so it's kind of like a variable
40:03 - that has multiple items so for example
40:06 - you could have something like a shopping
40:08 - list yep
40:10 - so you give it the name and then do you
40:12 - know how you would make a list yeah I do
40:15 - believe so look like shopping mm-hmm I
40:19 - know you can see my screen but yeah the
40:22 - equal sign and then you know square
40:25 - brackets yep exactly
40:27 - so good job and then you would just put
40:29 - your items in so how would you put your
40:31 - items in okay you would you could you
40:35 - could you use some text the speech
40:39 - bubble yeah yeah so in this case I'm
40:42 - just making in a text list so just add a
40:45 - couple of add a couple of items thing
40:52 - eggs good just as an example and now
41:00 - we've made our list shopping so list
41:05 - they can have strings in it but they can
41:07 - also have numbers and stuff as well by
41:11 - the way do you know how to stay on the
41:14 - cell yeah be able to write a more than
41:17 - one line code um I'm not a hundred
41:22 - percent sure let me try it could be if
41:25 - you liked type control until all just
41:30 - I'm not a hundred percent sure about
41:32 - that sorry let me quickly check up and
41:34 - see while I'm looking that up have you
41:51 - heard of index and stuff with lists yes
41:56 - a ablation yep so if you wanted to get
41:58 - like X if you wanted to print eggs what
42:04 - would you need to type in print eggs you
42:08 - would have to like from bonus for me
42:12 - eggs is first okay yep so for your
42:16 - listen you would have to add in print
42:21 - show me
42:23 - then the to the square the square
42:25 - brackets with the index one for me and
42:29 - zero for you almost the other way around
42:34 - okay but yeah here for me and one for
42:38 - you yep it's a good job
42:40 - and then it prints it out yep and then
42:43 - have you heard of a pen oh how you do it
42:45 - it stays there yeah so if you just press
42:49 - yeah so you can do multiple lines by
42:53 - just pressing enter so like I made
42:55 - shopping and then if I press ENTER it's
42:57 - still no shopping is there okay as long
43:00 - as you don't close show is that what you
43:03 - were asking
43:04 - yeah all right sorry I thought you just
43:07 - wanted to write like a lot of code at
43:08 - once no that no that was what I was
43:11 - asking oh okay but azan does this answer
43:15 - your question yeah that a different way
43:19 - a different solution yeah I was thinking
43:22 - I was thinking yes it yeah it's a
43:25 - different solution to what I was
43:26 - expecting but it still works okay yeah
43:29 - so you were thinking only did one line
43:31 - at a time and that's all it remembers
43:33 - kind of oh wait I don't know why this is
43:36 - pretty weird I you know I just clicked
43:41 - enter and I'm not having a neat yeah
43:45 - this sort of an area does it say
43:48 - anything goes it just no it's treating
43:51 - shell as a file oh okay um do you want
43:56 - to quickly share your screen so I can
43:59 - see what it looks like
44:11 - [Music]
44:13 - so have you pressed until wait I forgot
44:17 - it here we go racket no okay yes yes
44:24 - also it's the end of the lesson now I'll
44:28 - quickly ask you heavy head of the
44:30 - pending before with lists yes appen yep
44:33 - so what does that do you know what it
44:35 - does adds a word to the list and then do
44:38 - you know how where where does it add it
44:40 - on the list the end yep yeah cool and
44:44 - then if you wanted to remove something
44:46 - do you know what you would use delete
44:51 - shopping index kinda but you can use
44:57 - something called doctrine like there's
45:00 - something called remove so you can just
45:02 - go like shopping doctor move and then if
45:04 - you want to remove eggs you type in eggs
45:07 - so you can quickly try it now remove
45:14 - this you can either do it like by the
45:18 - word eggs
45:21 - oh wait whoopsie you're not too good but
45:36 - what's the one thing I can see is check
45:39 - your bracket so the square brackets I'll
45:43 - just use like for making lists and
45:45 - forgetting like the index all the lists
45:48 - okay but because like append functions
45:58 - [Music]
46:07 - and then if you just want to see your
46:09 - result you just type in shopping yeah
46:15 - you have to go print out shopping in
46:17 - Python show you don't need to do it okay
46:20 - so if you just type in shopping and
46:22 - enter it'll do it as a list so it'll
46:24 - come up with like the square brackets
46:27 - and everything if you did print and then
46:30 - shopping it would it wouldn't have those
46:33 - square brackets remove mm-hmm and now
47:03 - you can just see the result Oh shopping
47:07 - yep
47:10 - cool yeah and so I'll just leave it as
47:12 - that you pretty much know about lists
47:16 - that I think next week we can move on to
47:18 - the next topic but did you have any
47:22 - questions about anything we did today I
47:24 - don't think so no that's good mmm what's
47:31 - the like layout of the class okay for
47:33 - you do you find that you did you find
47:36 - that you still learn new stuff today yes
47:40 - the time ends up okay that's good on you
47:44 - okay that's the main thing okay well
47:47 - anyway I shall see you next week
47:50 - see you bye

Cleaned transcript:

I'll share my swing first just to show you a couple of things and then right you can share your spin off if you want if yeah but first i'll share my screen and just to show you what i'm doing i'm just gonna quickly explain so lastly it was kind of a bit unstructured because i was just trying to figure out what level yeah and then so what I think we'll do is so a lesson plans we do have more complex games like graphic games later on they don't use you want to use TK inter but they use stuff called PI game and turtle but to be able to do those games you have to be able to know like about the stuff before them so you have to be comfortable with the lessons before that so we'll be going through those concepts it's that's okay and then some of the stuff I think you might have done so we'll we can go over those quicker and like skip to the next ones wouldn't mind if we redid the clock that you showed me last yeah yeah yeah so we'll start with the clock first yeah and then so just like overall for this term so this is like called Python number two because you already know some of this stuff we could probably like speed up and then like do a bit of Python number three as well probably do both so we'll see how it goes but yeah yeah so we'll start with the clock do you want to share your screen maybe would that be easier so I'll get oh wait sorry before we start I'll show you some of the projects will be doing this semester this term anyway just so you have an idea of what we're doing and then we'll start the clock can you see my screen um okay yeah I can see it now okay so yeah this level 2 and then this level 3 cuz you already know some stuff like we went over them pretty fast so we could probably do both so things we can do I like the clock like you so and then this stuff like yeah this which uses um dictionaries and advance lists like lists you might have done them before so we'll see how we go but I'll show you the type of projects you can make with them so once it loads this is nope try not to show you the good book so like you can it use this list M loops and stuff to encrypt blood so like hello and then it encrypts the word so have you heard of encrypting before yeah yep so it's like kind of a program that does that and then you can decrypt it I think if you type in what that is it decrypts the message back to what it was so that's like some of the stuff we could be doing this time and then like this todo lists which we can also add more to make them more complex so these use this one uses things like functions lists etc and we could add like variables and like add schools and stuff so it just makes you like it allows us to know like the fundamentals of the fights and things so we can build on it so I can add something by going you're gonna say what step you want to do so one I want to add something and just say a police been added so if I want to display the list at number three I can see my list and you can remove stuff and things like that we'll go through a little later on like some of the things we could be doing this time just what you so what I'll do is what do you want me to share my screen and you want kind of solo on it okay yeah smaller okay so I think it's a full screen so if you press escape on your keyboard okay yeah I got my just see if I can make it a bit bigger just to be able to see little bit more there I'm just sharing my whole screen just because whenever we run it otherwise they'll have to stop sharing and then share the next window but you can only like you can crop your screen so that you can only see my bit when it when I get it open so yeah like you don't need to see the stuff on the side so you can like make you browse it it's more so can you see my screen and your screen okay yep good and then you just open up a new python file yeah I just use the same on my you'll each hit everything from last time so what leasing is it does the clock do you remember how the clock looks like do you want me to show you okay so we used to draw the lines it's an old turtle I think any hurdle you have yeah so using turtle and the time libraries so because the external libraries we have to import them actually I'll quickly get the clock up just so that we can break down what we need to do I'm gonna show you really quickly once it loads try not to look at the code to the first thing if you saw it when it loaded it drew the circle yeah and then the line and then it started ticking so I'll close that so this is the sort of timer you are talking about yes timer so like this is just kind of like a visual representation oh this is like with that using the sleep method still but yeah it's like yeah it's a pretty like easy way to do the timer that still works so yeah because time is a external library we have to import it yep import time and turtle yep and Turtles import by the way um yep you know to use the from from yeah yeah you can use it if you want so do you know how to use it yep yeah okay cool so yeah the other way of doing it is just like importing turtle and I'm making your own kind of thing like in the next step but the way you said it just does it in like one step pretty much so if you want to test that it works the from turtle input whatever your thing is you can run it so you might call you know what I'd use actually is I just put the star sign that allows me to import everything alright you mean up here umm no like just what you did from total total import stuff all right yep yeah that way I don't have to right right right right yeah I get you yeah that's fine too I thought you meant the next step yes so the next thing we need to do is we need to make our turtle so you can use like turtle dot something but we'll just make it with a new variable just so that we know that's the one with controlling so it's kind of like I own one so we can go like well I can call it whatever you want maybe I'll call it like tick but yeah sorry well you're gonna say ok tick equals to you okay yeah okay I get it yeah so tick equals and what we're going to do is turtle dot but you've already imported everything turtle yeah so we've imported everything so now what we're doing is you just have to go making like a turtle cold tick so we've imported everything so now we can use everything it wouldn't wouldn't you just have to write the truth with a capital T yeah so you probably could do that we'll check if it works I'm just used to doing turtle dot so generally it's good to go like something dot just let you know which libraries from but yeah good work we'll see if it works I'm just gonna quickly yeah so it's the same thing so that's fine also another way if you wanted to like shorten this into one line you could just go like import turtle as tick so that kind of does it all in one one if that makes sense yeah I think I get it yeah but either way yeah we just want to make one so that we can control it it doesn't really matter too much if you want to just go turtle dot forward and stuff but yeah anyway the next thing we want to do is we first wanna we wanna draw the circle but before doing that do you see how do you remember how in the example project it kind of did the circle but you couldn't really see the cursor and it did it pretty fast yeah yep so to do that we just want to change the speed of the turtle so that's just by going um like that's me but you don't need to write tick so you need to do tick so that it actually knows you're talking about the speed for the tip okay if that makes sense cuz in Python like you could also have your own method called speed like somewhere else so you just want to make sure that you're assigning the speed to that turtle element could you could you not what speed fifty speeds or a hundred even fifty one hundred something that's pretty far I got a great number okay that's good and then we just want to hide the cursor as well so to do that there's a function called high tidal yep almost hide turtle yeah where is it isn't it tick tock oh is it tick tock hi turtle yeah I'm pretty sure take the high tunnel we can check it and see what happens yes so the reason why we're doing the tick dot is because we're controlling like our little turtle though yeah um what do you what what you could do vote clean you just um not have the tick equal turtle yes so then instead of that you would just go like turtle dot speed and turtle dot hi turtle no pigs we've already imported turtle yep so the thing tick is like our own variable of a turtle like we've kind of made an object called tick is how we control it that's what you mean I start that we don't do we really need to I get sick because couldn't we just mean do you just want to go like speed and heíd turtle like that no yet we could do that couldn't move so generally because it's from it'll not the library I think you have to do the dot we can try it I'll just try it and see what happens because importing it just means like we can use all those libraries it knows what we're referring to but let's test it okay so I just tested it oh yeah okay that's my bad yeah so generally I just do the tick I like you know the turtle dot something just so that I know that I'm referring to the turtle but it works this way too so yeah so what we want to do is we want to we want to do our circle but we kind of need to map out where we'll start our circle from because at the end we want it like you know it draws a circle and then it draws the line you said to draw a circle you need the radius yep yep that first but also I mean like the position of where the turtle will be on the screen cuz right now if you run it I think the turtle starts off in the middle of the screen so if you draw the circle it might do it kind of off to the edge yeah if that makes it so we might need to move our turtle somewhere like to the side and then draw the circle you just go move turtle not exactly but before that we first need to think about so how big we want to make our circle just so that we know how much to move it off to the side so how big do you think we do maybe we could do a radius of 100 150 yep so let's just say 150 so what we can do is can move the turtle to the right 150 so I think I've Turtles automatically facing the right so we can just go forward 150 okay so but if we do this forward 150 it would draw the line on the screen so before making it go for pinup yeah so in this it's just called up oh wait how do you how come it's only up because it's just part of I think it's just generally because usually if you go like turtle up it's like total the up or total duck down pretty sure it's just off isn't it also polar I haven't tried pinup it could be both because pinup I'm always up we can check it and see could be both oh wait and I might be coming up million so I think you can do both plus I might be it might be confusing with scratch yeah so scratch it is pinup and pin down but sometimes there's also different versions of turtle so let me quickly find up so okay so there's like three different ways of doing it so you can go pen up PU flip n up or up so that all like they do the same thing but it's just a different way of different functions going it all right and it's the same foot down so yeah you can do either one so we do up then we do and then we want to move off to the side 150 okay then we do down yep down so now and I forgot how to draw the safe the circle yeah yep so it's just circle I'm pretty sure the function sorry so circle because there's an inbuilt function and then the radius 150 yep so what that will do is it will mean the circle is actually in the middle of the screen now it should be we'll test it and see what it looks like yes sir I have the same thing circle is not defined I think mine the circles a bit off wait did you did I spell it incorrectly or it could be that so how just double check the spelling Cir CLE see oh I forgot the RT yeah yeah the same thing it's a tiny bit oh yeah so I think the reason for that is we moved off to the side but then we were still facing that way so then it drew the circle from there whereas we should have started facing like to the top then it would have drawn the circle directly does that mean it now really if it is true so what it is is you know how the cursor like of the turtle faces this way usually to the right so we moved to the side 150 and then we drew the circle still facing the right so it did the circle like here yeah but what we wanted to do is we wanted to stop during the circle when we were facing the top so it drills a circle that way instead of me that way didn't have the same effect it I thought it would have I'm just trying to picture it well there's one way to find out we'll test it cuz I thought yeah it could just be that it's drawing it slightly off wait for right can't you just go RT right yeah I know I usually use right but it's probably both the same thing also sorry I accidentally closed my file but is it true why is it turn right over so I just use right and then you put in the degrees inside 19 wait it wouldn't be right it would be less no it's right it is right you're facing this way it would be let me it will be left yet sorry my accidentally closed my program we'll see if it works I have it I'm about to check it yeah and we have the thing in right in the middle right in the middle so the circles run in the middle okay yeah that's good yeah so I think the reason for that is because it was kind of already facing that direction it drew the circle towards our right instead of starting up from the beginning and drawing it more towards the left I might it might be easy if you draw it on a piece of paper so it's just the way it was facing because yeah it depends like where you draw the circle right so okay let me quickly add the right so what else must we do now okay so the next thing we want to do is do you remember how in the time of thing it drew the tick like from the middle yep so wanna go to the middle of our screen so we want to make sure curses in the middle of the screen said do you know what we would use middle row middle not exactly so use something with coordinates so we just want to make our cursor jump to a point on the screen so we can use set position so set position okay yep we drew a circle and then and then so the very middle of the screen is zero zero x coordinate and the y coordinate is zero well it doesn't start with the X yep starts with the X and then why it's a second Valley all right then then what must we do then what we must do is now we actually start like we need to start a loop and then we can drill okay yeah we need to start a loop and then we can start like drawing our line every second so it's you know it did a for loop or a so we want we want to make it happen forever so we'll do a while loop but just before that we'll just quickly check that our pen is in the right spot but so after your set position we'll just draw a straight line saying forward 150 just to check like before we start the loop that will it will draw where it's a coaster so because now we know the radius of the circle 150 should be like half that circle so we know that size so it's a good size keep drawing a line so it should draw the circle and then go to the middle and then drill 15 I'm going to check it as well mmhmm okay so might have done two lines did you do that too I don't think that's it yeah so yep I didn't still set position right okay okay this one's in rhythm I forgot the second so when you do it you might see two lines it's just because we forgot one yeah I have two lines that's weird yeah so the reason for that is the set position it drew it okay and then we didn't want to draw the line we just wanted to move it so they have to go pick up yep pin up and pin down but but what we wouldn't need to do that we always just a test right so it still need to do it for the set position we don't need the forward thing yet but because if we got rid of the forward it would still draw one line okay I should we don't want it to draw a line we just want to make sure it's that's in the middle so yeah we would go up and then down so now the cursor should be in the middle let's we hit the thing yep I have the line yeah you have the line to keep end of the line of you adding like weather angle and you can get the angle spot I look because you want to be constantly ticks we can use a while loop and we can just say while true so that means it will just happen Florida true and then now what you want to do is now you do the forward okay then we yes but exactly one degree because we're doing it according to time so think it's a different degree because if we do it if we turn one degree each time it will be like turning 360 lines um 360 divided by 60 so we can okay six yet it my thing kind of Rosa this explaining to you but yeah you can turn that then then just a timer right sleep yep sleep sleep and then one second but one thing is before you do the probably shouldn't matter too much but before you do the changing the degree we need to do something called Bob undo which would undo the line we just did it probably doesn't matter too much of the order um yeah I think undo just on just like Alaska man so you probably need to put under it under the last Helicon because the total thing so changing that degrees I found you if that makes I did just try yeah um there was a one problem what's the problem do you wanna share its we go it's not going back to the set position it's not going back to the set position okay like if I couldn't I think we have to put a set position in the while loop yeah we can try that so what was yours doing so far mine Judah line the middle yep turn six degrees but then it went out of the circle okay yes so the reason for that is did you have your undrew under no but wouldn't we still read so we could use that position but what we want to do is we want to drill a line and then undo it and then go on up the line and undo it but because I'm doing it is like an eraser okay exactly okay under function just like under gloss but maybe 150 so you wanted it it would go back to the same position was so yeah just undo yep so yeah that's it it stopped undo yeah you and you yeah okay yeah so what order did you type oh I go forward 150 the first line yeah 60 right sing sorry would you write write say by 6 yep so sleep one time dogs and then okay so what the undo thing does is it unders the last turtle function so because you did forward and then right it's undoing your turn six so it keeps just drawing the straight line so what you want to do is you want to go forward I think you're gonna sleep and then you want to undo that forward and then you want to turn right so turn like six degrees is the last thing you want to do or you could also just also just um you could do it now you could do it in a way the other way around just the other way around all right I lost it by turning right first and then let me like you could go 150 mmhmm undue and densely yep yeah that could work the only thing we can test it and see but if you do sleep after the undo you might not see your line for long enough if you want to make sure the line stays on for one second and then moves you can test it and see what happens close ok 100 it could still work because it's all in a loop anyway sorry my computer's a bit Rosen yep yep is it ice yep I see the problem so what's happening on yours the same thing you predicted okay yeah so sometimes it's like to test it and see what happens anyway because like they seemed like it wouldn't make a difference but surprisingly hate this my title Python kind of got frozen too ah what would you oh wait I should have the four times of sleep and then undo so yeah thank you yeah so that way it drills stays for a second and then under sit turns and then throws with him I'm not really sure but before what it did was it drew the line and then it kept on going again again I just straight okay now no it did that two times before yeah it is working now yeah okay that's good yes so the first reason it was doing that it kept going straight was because you were undoing the angle thing because I think you did forward and then you did right six degrees and then you did undo so undo instead of undoing forward like you thought it would it was undoing turn six degrees so I just kept going forward wait a second forward wait a second wait a second does that make sense so okay now I get it oh it only under the last okay yeah sorry for not making that clear yes undo it's just part of total just as the last thing so that's why the order does matter um a way you could do this more complicated mmhmm would you be able to just like you would be able to ask them how much time they would like divide it and made an angle that much yeah you could do that like a time a kind of thing yeah yeah that would that could work and so thank you did you want to start on the next thing yeah so did that make sense to you yep yep okay cool so that's just like one way how you can use the time let me get the next thing open do wait do we need a timer or no so now we're gonna learn like something else so you can close that file I'm going to open a new file if you want okay so have you done much on lists yes yes have you done a lot of it oh just like really I have done some any okay well we'll go through it and then if you have done it we can just go through it you want sorry I do remember now ya want me to show you which one is it I actually am having a bit of problems like it's the same also if you want that sharing this thing thank you what were you saying sorry okay here we go yep here can you see that it's just loading yep I can see okay have a look at this mmhmm that's we run it okay so this is actually dictionary that's like the mixedup optimist under an english word or phrase so I can just go like in peace it that is how you spell peace right yep like pieces in like peace yep yeah yep oh let's see okay oh that's weird and in yeah that's like that's my problem too in isn't going good yeah that's a hot year um and let me have a look at you'll see have a dictionary where key phrase equals please enter an English word look great again I copy this one from the book okay um I added my own thing for one a part of it oh yeah do you mind if I just try to run it again yeah that's fine it seems like you should look because it shouldn't be picking up the innards like code okay I'm running it I might just let me have a look if I can do this one just hello right and it's a I just want to learn how to say hello enter it's not taking my enter I think I'm saying is it could be stuck on something on this input please enter an English word keyword equals III uhhuh window so then the next step you do is you open like a TK into window that open somewhere else when you ran that I don't think so because then after that the only place where you print something is like that line towards the bottom yeah yeah I don't think so I wanna say things if I guess right hello the problem is it's not at a nose pops up it's just say you know if I could keep on pressing enter okay cuz okay one reason if we go back into your code it's like after you have the input thing the only thing you do with that like you try to open the TK into window and then the only other place where you print something is in an on click event do you see how you have the print in robot say and then you have that work line there oh I see the problem yeah so if you try to print something straight off the input what do you need to just go on click like that so yeah so I think what this is doing is the onclick is trying to detect it from TK inter yeah TK inter but your TK inter thing is an opening properly I know my problem is that I only defined a TK enter I never used yeah look at this I said it's it's in my program is still running that's a weird thing a must trying to do something the background here it says define on click event all right okay so and you made your own event right on click event what if I did this would it work so what do you use event is said remember we're talking about parameters yes yes so inside the bracket on click event it's kind of like a parameter but I guess it's like an onclick perimeter okay there we go okay so now if you press the button it should yeah okay yeah yeah so you were right about you just want calling the function okay yeah okay cool okay yeah so yeah that's dictionaries but we can go through lists really quickly couple of minutes left but since you've done lists it should be pretty easy for you there's like that you know that to do that to do little program I showed you before yeah if you if like you don't find a list too easy we can do with that like the first lesson next week we'll see how it goes so I'll just share my screen again so can you see my screen and your screen as well no my second thing okay yep I should have it yep so just for now we'll stay on show on Python shell oh just a couple of stuff and then we can move on okay see the time cuz there's only a couple minutes few minutes left but yeah so do you know what a list is like if you had to explain one yes oh this is like that it's like a variable that contains more than one item yeah pretty much yeah so it's kind of like a variable that has multiple items so for example you could have something like a shopping list yep so you give it the name and then do you know how you would make a list yeah I do believe so look like shopping mmhmm I know you can see my screen but yeah the equal sign and then you know square brackets yep exactly so good job and then you would just put your items in so how would you put your items in okay you would you could you could you use some text the speech bubble yeah yeah so in this case I'm just making in a text list so just add a couple of add a couple of items thing eggs good just as an example and now we've made our list shopping so list they can have strings in it but they can also have numbers and stuff as well by the way do you know how to stay on the cell yeah be able to write a more than one line code um I'm not a hundred percent sure let me try it could be if you liked type control until all just I'm not a hundred percent sure about that sorry let me quickly check up and see while I'm looking that up have you heard of index and stuff with lists yes a ablation yep so if you wanted to get like X if you wanted to print eggs what would you need to type in print eggs you would have to like from bonus for me eggs is first okay yep so for your listen you would have to add in print show me then the to the square the square brackets with the index one for me and zero for you almost the other way around okay but yeah here for me and one for you yep it's a good job and then it prints it out yep and then have you heard of a pen oh how you do it it stays there yeah so if you just press yeah so you can do multiple lines by just pressing enter so like I made shopping and then if I press ENTER it's still no shopping is there okay as long as you don't close show is that what you were asking yeah all right sorry I thought you just wanted to write like a lot of code at once no that no that was what I was asking oh okay but azan does this answer your question yeah that a different way a different solution yeah I was thinking I was thinking yes it yeah it's a different solution to what I was expecting but it still works okay yeah so you were thinking only did one line at a time and that's all it remembers kind of oh wait I don't know why this is pretty weird I you know I just clicked enter and I'm not having a neat yeah this sort of an area does it say anything goes it just no it's treating shell as a file oh okay um do you want to quickly share your screen so I can see what it looks like so have you pressed until wait I forgot it here we go racket no okay yes yes also it's the end of the lesson now I'll quickly ask you heavy head of the pending before with lists yes appen yep so what does that do you know what it does adds a word to the list and then do you know how where where does it add it on the list the end yep yeah cool and then if you wanted to remove something do you know what you would use delete shopping index kinda but you can use something called doctrine like there's something called remove so you can just go like shopping doctor move and then if you want to remove eggs you type in eggs so you can quickly try it now remove this you can either do it like by the word eggs oh wait whoopsie you're not too good but what's the one thing I can see is check your bracket so the square brackets I'll just use like for making lists and forgetting like the index all the lists okay but because like append functions and then if you just want to see your result you just type in shopping yeah you have to go print out shopping in Python show you don't need to do it okay so if you just type in shopping and enter it'll do it as a list so it'll come up with like the square brackets and everything if you did print and then shopping it would it wouldn't have those square brackets remove mmhmm and now you can just see the result Oh shopping yep cool yeah and so I'll just leave it as that you pretty much know about lists that I think next week we can move on to the next topic but did you have any questions about anything we did today I don't think so no that's good mmm what's the like layout of the class okay for you do you find that you did you find that you still learn new stuff today yes the time ends up okay that's good on you okay that's the main thing okay well anyway I shall see you next week see you bye
