02:33 - how to make at least I'm going to say
02:37 - you just make it the same things that we
02:40 - don't for variables and then instead of
02:44 - just saying something I need to put a
02:46 - square bracket here and inside the

13:05 - good job you already know some different
13:09 - methods excellent keep back
13:17 - okay thank you looking for see that if
14:41 - it's something that they can work on
14:44 - eyes or we already finished everything
14:47 - but we can have some games so let's see
14:53 - I think
16:24 - what which actually takes that venture
16:27 - last one we had say because I work with
16:34 - you Josh and I going to I don't want to
16:38 - repeat it again for you why other guys
16:41 - doesn't know that I can post the code or
16:45 - something would you like to share a
17:17 - vehicles have a look here we have a game
17:19 - it's so we say what is your name and
17:23 - then say greeting let's go on an
17:27 - adventure only enter the options
17:30 - available or the game will end you're on
17:34 - the edge of the forest
17:36 - can you get true would you like to go
17:39 - into the forest
17:40 - enter yes or no say yes you go into the
17:46 - forest in front of you is a stone with
17:50 - two weapons which one do you want inter
17:54 - sword opal so you say you choose the bow
18:01 - the path splits in front of you to the
18:05 - left is appear the bear to the right
18:09 - it's pitch black in turn right or left
18:16 - say left you see the the brandish Europe
18:24 - and fight you have no arrows
18:28 - you're eaten game over okay would you
18:33 - like to share the code as well how was
18:35 - it look like so the guys
18:38 - I can cope in see the cords including a
18:50 - function so I'm going to say at the
19:03 - picking link so we have greeting prints
19:07 - and say let's go and on adventure and
19:16 - then some blah blah things and then say
19:20 - make your function I just added this in
19:23 - myself oh yeah easier to ask stuff yeah
19:28 - that's that's a good idea
19:30 - that's perfect and and he said he make
19:35 - it function it's called question print
19:41 - printer so when you say what's just a a
19:47 - one it's the question a one and or a to
19:52 - cool you put it in a different function
19:56 - neck do you know about function how do
19:59 - we define a function not really it's you
20:08 - say so go with the beginning so the
20:14 - question from the beginning that it's
20:17 - put in comments like yeah question would
20:20 - you like to go into the forest and if
20:24 - the response equal yes that when we say
20:30 - that when we use two equal signs that
20:34 - means we want to compare two posts so we
20:38 - say responses inside the response
20:42 - variable is yes or no but when we put
20:45 - just one equal this is different things
20:48 - that means we put their value
20:52 - you inside the variables so with the
20:55 - difference between comparing and
20:58 - defining and variable it's like that so
21:01 - here when in if we use two equal signs
21:06 - that means we comparing to both sides to
21:10 - each other but the difference so for
21:13 - example when we say here phrase the
21:16 - variable U you see yeah like the weapons
21:21 - so weapons equal response that's one its
21:25 - variables could you tell me another
21:28 - variable stats yeah that's it what
21:39 - condition that videos whenever we say
21:43 - more than for example here wouldn't say
21:47 - if back to the beginnings part so when
21:51 - we say if response double equal yes it's
21:57 - going to print us you go into the forest
22:00 - else if we say la otherwise so if the
22:06 - response wasn't yes is going to say
22:09 - check is going to say L if response
22:14 - equal no so sometimes the customer put
22:19 - yes sometimes no and then if it's no
22:24 - prints then you are not really goodbye
22:27 - with the name that we asked at the
22:30 - beginning and then quit times you say
22:35 - quit to the function finish here and is
22:40 - not going to the else line is going to
22:45 - be created is going to be go to choose a
22:49 - weapon time part but if something is you
22:53 - know user doesn't put yes or no so put
22:57 - the nonsense things so that at that time
23:01 - we say we use else if it's not
23:05 - none of those neither yes nor no is
23:11 - going to else say print kills if didn't
23:16 - understand you I didn't understand you
23:19 - game over it's a good example of how we
23:25 - use if-elsif and is and we can say quit
23:33 - in else as well but it's there's a
23:37 - mother here
23:38 - the next part choose a weapon say
23:42 - question after we actually ask the user
23:47 - that do you want to go to the first or
23:49 - not and then you say grab a weapon so in
23:54 - front of you is torn with two weapons
23:58 - that this and then weapon is say equal
24:03 - response what's response here their
24:07 - responses something that we ask yeah we
24:12 - ask it you can put in put in after
24:18 - weapon locks a weapon equal input the
24:26 - question so how the question coming
24:32 - could you adequately writes in front of
24:35 - things that coming like say with an
24:39 - equal response for now to just guys
24:44 - understand apart so say repent equal
24:48 - input
24:59 - and they could you do it could I after
25:01 - why would you say a weapon equal input
25:05 - so I want to show the guys that how we
25:10 - use input the inputs and was inside the
25:14 - use yep use the question that yeah like
25:26 - that okay I've just tell it like this
25:29 - because I have a function yes because
25:32 - any use function so you can you can put
25:36 - it back
25:37 - Thanks and then instead of saying that
25:39 - you just say with less cord he used less
25:45 - code with saying just response but he
25:48 - defined it at the beginning at the top
25:51 - in function question function and then
25:57 - it's say if say if she's answer if
26:13 - response here so response now is
26:16 - different things that we have in
26:19 - beginning in beginning part so response
26:24 - gets a different value it's before it
26:28 - was yes or no now it's soared over so
26:33 - you say if response equal W Coast sword
26:39 - or response to echo if one of those they
26:44 - say just you choose this particular
26:49 - choosen rip weapon else so we don't use
26:54 - else--if here because we don't need it
26:58 - because we already
27:00 - he actually put in the same time with or
27:07 - and at hand said do you guys like to
27:13 - write it down now or yeah quickly do ya
27:21 - please
27:25 - maybe you couldn't send it at all
27:29 - together let's try if you're not just
27:32 - put it you can copy for example ten
28:42 - lines not just one line but one line or
28:47 - more even try see if you can copy all
28:51 - and then paste it here
30:04 - [Music]
31:16 - [Music]
32:02 - okay thank you
32:04 - thing is it all yeah guys copy and paste
32:11 - it and then work it up at home that
32:15 - worked it later because we're going to
32:18 - do in other games because Eddie already
32:21 - or more than one is the forward so we
32:29 - shouldn't respect edited always went in
32:32 - on time and always being present
33:24 - just remember to put in who import part
33:28 - as well at the beginning so you need to
33:32 - just reverse or snake and care and you
33:36 - need to just realize that before you
33:42 - need to revise that before right so just
33:45 - remember to put import and the other
33:49 - things as well
35:02 - oh good
35:52 - did you finish copy and paste and save
35:56 - your file and can you don't need to do
36:41 - anything else you just copy and paste it
36:43 - in your file and save it and then I'm
36:47 - going to start a new game
36:49 - oh good
36:56 - yeah okay let's do the other one
37:04 - I'm going to say use the very wise
37:20 - Christians so tell me the question
37:24 - before I'm going to get into kind of
37:30 - part of at least question what is the
37:34 - tares planet from the Sun who knows I'm
38:20 - using a different list bar or sink like
38:29 - that let's see I'll show you how to use
38:32 - it
38:41 - what is the name of something orbiting a
38:45 - planet what is
39:02 - [Music]
39:08 - [Music]
39:39 - or satellite so what
39:47 - once we have that was the planet that's
39:52 - not a planet these things that we have
39:55 - around Aires that's going around us we
39:59 - can see it
40:00 - at the night time I put the answer here
40:17 - like that so if you mention it I will
40:20 - explain it what planet has rings neck it
40:39 - goes to the I think that kid does as
40:47 - well uh yeah that's true I just say
40:53 - those and I'm going to you score as a
41:06 - rebel and put the initial value as 0
41:16 - introduction
41:17 - so I'm going to say the introduction for
41:20 - my game say the name it's just getting
41:26 - the name again Nate how we use how we
41:47 - break in line and put the cursor at the
41:51 - second line here if I say yeah I put the
42:36 - space that's nice you can name your game
43:01 - as a space create system we can look
43:16 - here by saying
43:24 - question the question is time
43:30 - list and it's that I show you here and I
43:35 - use then the land of question so that
43:42 - means three points random dot choose
44:48 - three years and convert the dictionary
44:56 - case this type of question this type of
45:02 - variable it's it's called dictionary
45:08 - King you might be stating the next can
45:19 - but for now it's good to know how you
45:22 - use it good questions
45:46 - [Music]
45:54 - the answer that question equal
46:07 - Christians question now I changed the
46:15 - question that was dictionary key to a
46:20 - list now I can use as a list him if you
46:28 - couldn't understand yet I arranged back
46:31 - and explained every part don't worry
46:33 - about that keep going and say once we
46:39 - have player takes so the gist variable
46:50 - its equal input the question that we
46:55 - have just into the next chick yes yes
47:39 - [Music]
47:50 - [Music]
47:56 - [Music]
48:00 - bless you so it's going up the question
48:16 - the guess wasn't the same as answer so
48:20 - screams it's a invalid syntax really
48:27 - rich punch for you know where you're
48:35 - defining your dictionary it's saying no
48:37 - syntax on the color okay let me see just
48:45 - lets me finish this part and I back
48:48 - Ferris and I run it see what's lets me
49:06 - run it okay so mine it's work yours is
49:18 - saying I'm gonna check it later with you
49:21 - as well so when you finish writing till
49:29 - now I'm going back to explain here what
49:31 - does it mean this point I think would
49:37 - you like to send it by chance your error
49:40 - when Theresa or your coat
50:02 - it it's having the airhead this part
50:08 - tell you an error yeah did you put comma
50:14 - after each part each line so it's
50:18 - separating so you'd like just the last
50:53 - one doesn't come my first bit is working
51:51 - with mine but the second bit doesn't
51:54 - work that's why before we going to see
52:02 - your course I'm going to explain so what
52:04 - does
52:05 - mean it's kind of dictionary key
52:09 - variables so this kind of type we define
52:14 - it like this so for example so the same
52:19 - question so each question has value has
52:25 - a key and value so the first show you
52:29 - how so we define it like the same
52:32 - variable we have fire to be using the
52:37 - kind of this bracket what we call it you
52:39 - know guys how we call this quotation
52:42 - what is called this one I don't know but
52:46 - it's the difference that we use this
52:50 - symbol and then we say key so the key
52:58 - it's something that we use and every key
53:02 - has a value and we separate you separate
53:11 - each part each item by comma so each
53:16 - king he could be number could be a
53:22 - string and this one value could be I put
53:27 - it in a different way
53:28 - so the key I just want to show you how
53:33 - we define a dictionary so every part
53:37 - every item that we have it has a key and
53:42 - value and it separated each item with
53:46 - comma that's look looks the same that we
53:49 - have in this and then again he column
53:55 - ready and again he turned enclose the
54:09 - part so the dictionary case each item
54:14 - has one key and one value the value
54:18 - it's belonging to the king for example
54:21 - here that this question has an answer by
54:26 - saying airs so the airs answer is
54:31 - belonging to this question not the other
54:33 - question just this question and so like
54:37 - that just remember I put it as it come
54:46 - as just explanation here just remember
54:51 - that each dictionary key we use one key
54:56 - and one reading so how we use it as you
55:01 - see after we define the dictionary key
55:08 - we use it like saying question should be
55:29 - questions if should be questioned the
55:34 - same as we use it here so if you had a
55:38 - mistake type of mistake like meaning
55:40 - just corrected the questions questions
55:46 - so how many is that I say questions dot
55:50 - key for example lot of dads and put it
56:07 - in for example as a variable so the
56:12 - answer that is the value its questions
56:17 - start key
56:25 - and the things that is similar you know
56:29 - that all things and then I'm use here
56:33 - I'm used to Lynn off question what does
56:38 - it mean how many time or how many items
56:42 - there is in question
56:45 - trace all yet is going to three times so
56:49 - why then that said lands love questions
56:54 - three times it's counting how many items
56:59 - there is here and who did them and the
57:04 - same that we have the use random choose
57:07 - that we're using spaceship to pick on
57:10 - one of the cheese and I'm using list
57:15 - here because I'm going to change
57:18 - question keys that is a the kind of
57:23 - dictionary key to a list so it's convert
57:28 - my addiction your key to a mist see how
57:32 - after that I used question a square
57:38 - bracket and Christian so the same that
57:41 - we have we had before to use them list
57:48 - to use when I rarely use list we use
57:51 - like that because I convert it and then
57:55 - put it in the answer another bits not
57:58 - working for me
58:01 - or it says question equals random dot
58:06 - choice it's not working you won't set as
58:12 - we had where it says answer equals
58:14 - questions question it says says like D
58:20 - ICT object is not callable okay could
58:27 - you send it to me and remember and don't
58:32 - forget to change the question we have to
58:35 - they
58:36 - friends variable so we have questions
58:38 - with this and here we have question
58:41 - there just don't mix it up so question
58:45 - here and then Christians could you send
58:48 - it to me as well Nick do you want to say
59:11 - which line has a problem for you as well
59:14 - you can send it to me as well or share
59:18 - your screen which one is more country
59:22 - for you it says questions is not defined
59:31 - okay remember I have a look I said
59:34 - questions we have yes and then here just
59:41 - question our YouTube so you have to
60:04 - change your first questions and we s
60:08 - just put questions the first variable
60:12 - you use the dictionary key it's
60:15 - Christians and when we convert it we say
60:19 - question and what is okay so when we
60:33 - when you convert or - at least you put
60:36 - it in the variable called question that
60:39 - you stick it in a queue
60:42 - okay we want to
60:46 - just saying just say instead of the
60:52 - first line after wine say Christian be
60:58 - cool random like this
61:04 - yep but I'm 10 an answer should be in a
61:12 - square bracket so say answer equal
61:16 - questions bracket square bracket and
61:20 - then put their question not to you so
61:40 - whenever you just here just replace any
61:42 - question does it work for unique for me
62:38 - it doesn't stop after 3 yes Bernie
62:44 - Sanders I'm going to send it to all your
62:46 - groans because we already run out of
62:49 - time are we going to continue next
62:53 - session I send it by chats the cookie
63:00 - and give it and you will see before
63:03 - pasted have a look what's different
63:06 - between your code and Michael maker
63:12 - centered on chat so just copy and put in
64:19 - a different copy and have it because I'm
64:22 - going to close that and you're gonna
64:25 - miss it so just copy and paste it in a
64:27 - new file and have a precise look it
64:36 - doesn't stop because it's in the right
64:39 - yeah it's okay as long as you don't have
64:45 - any error that's fine because we're

Cleaned transcript:

okay I'm going to say Wartortle as usual that's we use always and then say Massey be cool dance naked turtle with the T character and I'm going to import random as well because I'm going to use random choice I would tell you how if you don't know oh it's the new things for you so let's see what I have really you hate oh you like up so we have neg I do so both of you choose Apple your sister okay I said I should say apart from human human animals no animals could be yeah animals could be there so we accepted things stuff okay camera cool to get into a fish tank is a good see that fish could be survived over there be those in the air we don't need air at the moon for fish because isn't water so maybe it's a good idea okay hmm so I'm going to put make a list so if you remember how we make at least the same that me I'm going to just make variable it's called pastry and we're going to say equal the square bracket so when I'm going for the guys that don't know about how to make at least I'm going to say you just make it the same things that we don't for variables and then instead of just saying something I need to put a square bracket here and inside the bracket I'm going to put your stuff the quotation so the first things also you guys IBM makes cheese apples on say that's a to Apple ya parts and sorry no your sister we couldn't take care and okay banana ice house camera do you have any specific brand of camera that's it do you want to put first you're not was simple professional what else we have each other you need to give me two give me two actual items that I can put it here so because I I have one items that is to Apple so you need to give me in other items naked aunty already give me the other one so clear and give already gave me two so I'd be one of you guys give me another one Nate you need to give me are some items because I didn't accept your sister ok fishtank my spaceship just before dad I'm going to use random to ask computer randomly choose a which item is accepted to put it in spaceship and put it in the moon actually so because already we have one two three four five I need another one items I need six item each of you to give me the other one if two of us said apples yeah it's okay but give me another one because I need six items everybody one of you guys okay that's too many okay Arjun come on at the car it can expand it yeah I can't expand them that's it I mean PI since it so that it's across the whole screen and I'm going to say print shoes so here I'm going to ask the computer computer to just randomly give me one of those let's say you're gonna win my spaceship I'm quitting in the moon sir exam okay let me run it so who wind force the car so the car is win Karen okay Karen win your car in the moon your cards now that's a big house how many quick carry the cards they put it in a spaceship and put it in the moon cool let's see who's the next winner one two three stone who was Stone snake okay cool Nick is the second winner let's see who's the first winner one two three again okay that's any question guys you have or do you want to write it down and see what you're gonna give you change you can't put your done you know I know okay cool what items you have yeah what's about unique wants to share with us to come see who's for spinner would like to share my okay but do you like to share it with us share your screen I mean that's nice like it banana who was choose banana good job yes sir cargo okay.what so you put it in a white circle good job you already know some different methods excellent keep back okay thank you looking for see that if it's something that they can work on eyes or we already finished everything but we can have some games so let's see I think what which actually takes that venture last one we had say because I work with you Josh and I going to I don't want to repeat it again for you why other guys doesn't know that I can post the code or something would you like to share a vehicles have a look here we have a game it's so we say what is your name and then say greeting let's go on an adventure only enter the options available or the game will end you're on the edge of the forest can you get true would you like to go into the forest enter yes or no say yes you go into the forest in front of you is a stone with two weapons which one do you want inter sword opal so you say you choose the bow the path splits in front of you to the left is appear the bear to the right it's pitch black in turn right or left say left you see the the brandish Europe and fight you have no arrows you're eaten game over okay would you like to share the code as well how was it look like so the guys I can cope in see the cords including a function so I'm going to say at the picking link so we have greeting prints and say let's go and on adventure and then some blah blah things and then say make your function I just added this in myself oh yeah easier to ask stuff yeah that's that's a good idea that's perfect and and he said he make it function it's called question print printer so when you say what's just a a one it's the question a one and or a to cool you put it in a different function neck do you know about function how do we define a function not really it's you say so go with the beginning so the question from the beginning that it's put in comments like yeah question would you like to go into the forest and if the response equal yes that when we say that when we use two equal signs that means we want to compare two posts so we say responses inside the response variable is yes or no but when we put just one equal this is different things that means we put their value you inside the variables so with the difference between comparing and defining and variable it's like that so here when in if we use two equal signs that means we comparing to both sides to each other but the difference so for example when we say here phrase the variable U you see yeah like the weapons so weapons equal response that's one its variables could you tell me another variable stats yeah that's it what condition that videos whenever we say more than for example here wouldn't say if back to the beginnings part so when we say if response double equal yes it's going to print us you go into the forest else if we say la otherwise so if the response wasn't yes is going to say check is going to say L if response equal no so sometimes the customer put yes sometimes no and then if it's no prints then you are not really goodbye with the name that we asked at the beginning and then quit times you say quit to the function finish here and is not going to the else line is going to be created is going to be go to choose a weapon time part but if something is you know user doesn't put yes or no so put the nonsense things so that at that time we say we use else if it's not none of those neither yes nor no is going to else say print kills if didn't understand you I didn't understand you game over it's a good example of how we use ifelsif and is and we can say quit in else as well but it's there's a mother here the next part choose a weapon say question after we actually ask the user that do you want to go to the first or not and then you say grab a weapon so in front of you is torn with two weapons that this and then weapon is say equal response what's response here their responses something that we ask yeah we ask it you can put in put in after weapon locks a weapon equal input the question so how the question coming could you adequately writes in front of things that coming like say with an equal response for now to just guys understand apart so say repent equal input and they could you do it could I after why would you say a weapon equal input so I want to show the guys that how we use input the inputs and was inside the use yep use the question that yeah like that okay I've just tell it like this because I have a function yes because any use function so you can you can put it back Thanks and then instead of saying that you just say with less cord he used less code with saying just response but he defined it at the beginning at the top in function question function and then it's say if say if she's answer if response here so response now is different things that we have in beginning in beginning part so response gets a different value it's before it was yes or no now it's soared over so you say if response equal W Coast sword or response to echo if one of those they say just you choose this particular choosen rip weapon else so we don't use elseif here because we don't need it because we already he actually put in the same time with or and at hand said do you guys like to write it down now or yeah quickly do ya please maybe you couldn't send it at all together let's try if you're not just put it you can copy for example ten lines not just one line but one line or more even try see if you can copy all and then paste it here okay thank you thing is it all yeah guys copy and paste it and then work it up at home that worked it later because we're going to do in other games because Eddie already or more than one is the forward so we shouldn't respect edited always went in on time and always being present just remember to put in who import part as well at the beginning so you need to just reverse or snake and care and you need to just realize that before you need to revise that before right so just remember to put import and the other things as well oh good did you finish copy and paste and save your file and can you don't need to do anything else you just copy and paste it in your file and save it and then I'm going to start a new game oh good yeah okay let's do the other one I'm going to say use the very wise Christians so tell me the question before I'm going to get into kind of part of at least question what is the tares planet from the Sun who knows I'm using a different list bar or sink like that let's see I'll show you how to use it what is the name of something orbiting a planet what is or satellite so what once we have that was the planet that's not a planet these things that we have around Aires that's going around us we can see it at the night time I put the answer here like that so if you mention it I will explain it what planet has rings neck it goes to the I think that kid does as well uh yeah that's true I just say those and I'm going to you score as a rebel and put the initial value as 0 introduction so I'm going to say the introduction for my game say the name it's just getting the name again Nate how we use how we break in line and put the cursor at the second line here if I say yeah I put the space that's nice you can name your game as a space create system we can look here by saying question the question is time list and it's that I show you here and I use then the land of question so that means three points random dot choose three years and convert the dictionary case this type of question this type of variable it's it's called dictionary King you might be stating the next can but for now it's good to know how you use it good questions the answer that question equal Christians question now I changed the question that was dictionary key to a list now I can use as a list him if you couldn't understand yet I arranged back and explained every part don't worry about that keep going and say once we have player takes so the gist variable its equal input the question that we have just into the next chick yes yes bless you so it's going up the question the guess wasn't the same as answer so screams it's a invalid syntax really rich punch for you know where you're defining your dictionary it's saying no syntax on the color okay let me see just lets me finish this part and I back Ferris and I run it see what's lets me run it okay so mine it's work yours is saying I'm gonna check it later with you as well so when you finish writing till now I'm going back to explain here what does it mean this point I think would you like to send it by chance your error when Theresa or your coat it it's having the airhead this part tell you an error yeah did you put comma after each part each line so it's separating so you'd like just the last one doesn't come my first bit is working with mine but the second bit doesn't work that's why before we going to see your course I'm going to explain so what does mean it's kind of dictionary key variables so this kind of type we define it like this so for example so the same question so each question has value has a key and value so the first show you how so we define it like the same variable we have fire to be using the kind of this bracket what we call it you know guys how we call this quotation what is called this one I don't know but it's the difference that we use this symbol and then we say key so the key it's something that we use and every key has a value and we separate you separate each part each item by comma so each king he could be number could be a string and this one value could be I put it in a different way so the key I just want to show you how we define a dictionary so every part every item that we have it has a key and value and it separated each item with comma that's look looks the same that we have in this and then again he column ready and again he turned enclose the part so the dictionary case each item has one key and one value the value it's belonging to the king for example here that this question has an answer by saying airs so the airs answer is belonging to this question not the other question just this question and so like that just remember I put it as it come as just explanation here just remember that each dictionary key we use one key and one reading so how we use it as you see after we define the dictionary key we use it like saying question should be questions if should be questioned the same as we use it here so if you had a mistake type of mistake like meaning just corrected the questions questions so how many is that I say questions dot key for example lot of dads and put it in for example as a variable so the answer that is the value its questions start key and the things that is similar you know that all things and then I'm use here I'm used to Lynn off question what does it mean how many time or how many items there is in question trace all yet is going to three times so why then that said lands love questions three times it's counting how many items there is here and who did them and the same that we have the use random choose that we're using spaceship to pick on one of the cheese and I'm using list here because I'm going to change question keys that is a the kind of dictionary key to a list so it's convert my addiction your key to a mist see how after that I used question a square bracket and Christian so the same that we have we had before to use them list to use when I rarely use list we use like that because I convert it and then put it in the answer another bits not working for me or it says question equals random dot choice it's not working you won't set as we had where it says answer equals questions question it says says like D ICT object is not callable okay could you send it to me and remember and don't forget to change the question we have to they friends variable so we have questions with this and here we have question there just don't mix it up so question here and then Christians could you send it to me as well Nick do you want to say which line has a problem for you as well you can send it to me as well or share your screen which one is more country for you it says questions is not defined okay remember I have a look I said questions we have yes and then here just question our YouTube so you have to change your first questions and we s just put questions the first variable you use the dictionary key it's Christians and when we convert it we say question and what is okay so when we when you convert or at least you put it in the variable called question that you stick it in a queue okay we want to just saying just say instead of the first line after wine say Christian be cool random like this yep but I'm 10 an answer should be in a square bracket so say answer equal questions bracket square bracket and then put their question not to you so whenever you just here just replace any question does it work for unique for me it doesn't stop after 3 yes Bernie Sanders I'm going to send it to all your groans because we already run out of time are we going to continue next session I send it by chats the cookie and give it and you will see before pasted have a look what's different between your code and Michael maker centered on chat so just copy and put in a different copy and have it because I'm going to close that and you're gonna miss it so just copy and paste it in a new file and have a precise look it doesn't stop because it's in the right yeah it's okay as long as you don't have any error that's fine because we're gonna continue it next session okay cool great everything's fake house going on it's great for you did you get that okay cool I do you good I'm still hoping your time you can work on the last the previous court like you save it I suspect I'll just go forest so have a look run the game and see what you like and have a look at the cord carrying an H alright yeah everybody do you have any questions Karen goodnight already thanks see you next session have fun and enjoy your stuff y'all you can enjoy bye
