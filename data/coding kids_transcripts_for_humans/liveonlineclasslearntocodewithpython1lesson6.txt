00:00 - and start sharing my school so do you
00:09 - remember that project we need last week
00:18 - just yeah yeah okay so I think the
00:23 - connections a bit slow so I'll just
00:25 - speak slowly
00:26 - and then then I'll wait for your reply
00:40 - sorry I didn't hear you I think it was
00:42 - cutting out yeah okay so we're just
00:50 - going to open that project we started
00:52 - last week and let me just get it up
01:00 - there is this I'll show you what it's
01:04 - meant to look like again to refresh your
01:08 - memory
01:16 - let me just one second okay can you
01:31 - still see my screen okay yes yep okay so
01:35 - if you remember this is what we made all
01:38 - started making last week so it asked us
01:41 - how many sides will the shape have and
01:43 - we would just put in a number and then
01:48 - it will draw one of that shape and then
01:51 - keep drawing that shape to make like a
01:52 - cool pattern yep so that's what we need
02:02 - to make so what we have so far is it's
02:05 - just making one shape so if you open up
02:08 - what you had from last week and run it
02:10 - we can just see what it does
02:15 - [Music]
02:24 - if you run if you run your project does
02:29 - it open and ask you how many shapes will
02:31 - do how many sides nor the shape huh yeah
02:36 - yep
02:37 - and then if you put in a number for like
02:39 - five again you can see that it drills a
02:45 - pentagon or shape whatever however many
02:48 - sides you told it to go this feels good
02:52 - right
02:52 - well yeah but once I do it mm-hm
02:57 - it's like it's not closes it closes okay
03:03 - from my own it just closes yeah so if
03:09 - you double-click and open it then it
03:11 - just does it and then closes because
03:13 - it's finished with the program and it
03:15 - closes so yeah you might need to open it
03:18 - like edit with idle and then run it from
03:21 - there
03:54 - so once you've run it let me know well
03:59 - so it just it should just drill one in
04:02 - shape for now it doesn't make the cool
04:04 - person yet because that's what we need
04:06 - to do with it I didn't have the arm
04:13 - message doesn't have my thing that's in
04:19 - it without oh all right so I think yours
04:22 - are the one that didn't have that so
04:24 - what you might need to do is you know
04:26 - how you normally open up Idol like when
04:30 - you look at the program and you type in
04:31 - Idol you might need to do that and then
04:39 - once you've opened it you should be able
04:43 - to go file and then open five
05:05 - to file and open and then you can choose
05:09 - what you rogram will saved once you've
05:36 - done that let me know fit what did you
06:08 - manage to get it open yet ah not yet so
06:12 - do you have Idol of them like a new Idol
06:16 - thing yep
06:17 - yeah from there on the top you should be
06:22 - able to click on file and then open and
06:34 - then you just need to remember where you
06:35 - saved it last night in what fold
06:38 - anything so you just click on file open
06:41 - and then you have to choose file it is
06:44 - you got it I got what I have Adam
06:47 - awesome ok yeah on the thing yay that's
06:51 - good
06:51 - so it draws one shape doing a quickly
06:57 - test it as if it were so by running it
07:02 - yeah yep yes okay cool
07:09 - nice so what we want to do is if we look
07:14 - back at the example program it doesn't
07:17 - just drill one shape it drills like
07:19 - however many times so say you said five
07:23 - it drills that one shape on each side of
07:26 - the shape so it looks like a really cool
07:28 - pattern you so chose the power-on shape
07:31 - sometimes yep pretty much
07:34 - so what we need to do is make our shape
07:36 - draw five times we go back to our code
07:43 - currently do you remember what I
07:45 - followed this almost so it makes
07:58 - whatever's inside that loop repeat
08:00 - however my like however many times you
08:03 - tell it to go in our case so sometimes
08:06 - it could be four times but could be five
08:08 - times in difference because we use this
08:11 - variable called size and the variable
08:16 - sides is the input that the person put
08:19 - in so if the person put in three then
08:22 - the fold will make it go three times if
08:26 - we put in five then the fold will make
08:28 - it repeat five times does that make
08:31 - sense
08:42 - so I think the connection is dropping
08:45 - out a bit I'll just wait a minute yeah I
08:54 - think I might exit go back in like to
08:59 - see people have better connection okay
09:01 - yeah sure you can try that see if it
09:04 - works I'll stop sharing my screen for
09:11 - the minute ISM just to see if that helps
09:28 - okay hi again
09:32 - how's the connection so far
09:37 - yep okay cool I'm just going to share my
09:40 - screen again see what happens if it's
09:44 - still a bit slow we can try just turn
09:47 - off our webcams as well because that
09:48 - might take a bit of thing but for now it
09:52 - seems okay so we'll just continue and
09:54 - see how it goes
09:56 - okay so yeah we have our for loop that
09:59 - repeats what we want to do however many
10:03 - times so in this case the amount of
10:05 - times is however many sides a person
10:08 - types in but what we want to do is like
10:11 - what you said if we draw a shape with
10:13 - five sides we want to draw that shape
10:16 - five times as well yep yep so do you
10:21 - remember how at the end of last week we
10:23 - were going through something called a
10:25 - nested for loop so it's like when we had
10:29 - a full loop inside another full loop oh
10:32 - yeah I'm I'm okay so do you kind of
10:35 - remember how they were not sure not sure
10:39 - so I'll quickly show you again she might
10:43 - remember remember that's okay I was like
10:47 - it would repeat it four times
10:50 - and then like it would repeat on top
10:58 - yeah okay
11:19 - okay I think the connection might have
11:22 - dropped out a bit again can you hear me
11:34 - again Chester yeah sure
11:42 - yeah dropped out again okay I turned off
11:46 - my video just to see if that would help
11:48 - so if you want you can do that too on
11:50 - the top I think near where the share
11:53 - screen button and stuff is there should
11:56 - be a thing called turn off video or like
11:59 - stop video
12:29 - can you hear me again Justin yes yes
12:38 - okay again yeah again okay we'll see
12:44 - this look so we both turned off that
12:46 - webcam gonna share my screen if that
12:50 - doesn't work I might try like look out
12:53 - and come back in but hopefully this one
12:56 - so we were can you see my screen yeah
13:01 - yep okay cool so we were talking about
13:03 - how you have like a full coat something
13:06 - called a nested pool so you're trying to
13:10 - remember what it was you do you have an
13:12 - idea of what it is yes so basically
13:18 - repeat eight times yep yeah the GPD
13:28 - yeah yeah pretty much
13:31 - so it might not always be eight but it
13:33 - depends so like if we have our full loop
13:37 - just commenting this out for second so
13:43 - if we have a normal full loop so like
13:45 - for I in range and the range is full
13:49 - then like if we wanted to move forward
13:52 - for example so like this would happen
13:58 - this is just a normal full so this would
14:00 - happen ten times I mean full forty times
14:03 - like sorry it would happen four times
14:07 - because it's moving 10 each time can you
14:17 - hear me still Chester
14:27 - [Music]
14:30 - I think it dropped out again yeah yeah
14:36 - okay I'm right okay we'll just continue
14:42 - see how it goes and hopefully doesn't
14:46 - drop out too much maybe if you can just
14:48 - keep that check being open as well
14:51 - because we're not using our webcams just
14:54 - so that if you need to ask a question
14:56 - and sometimes I can't hear you or you
14:58 - can't hear me you can't say something in
15:00 - there yep okay so like you said if you
15:06 - have a nested folder it might do
15:08 - something eight times
15:09 - because it's doing that inside full and
15:12 - that outside folder so yeah I was just
15:16 - showing you like an example of how that
15:19 - might work so this is a normal four loop
15:22 - that does something four times so it
15:25 - moves Bob Bob forward ten steps each
15:29 - time so overall how many times would
15:32 - that be out like how far would Bob move
15:34 - forward 40 steps yep exactly
15:38 - and then if we added another for loop so
15:42 - for I in range and then put this first
15:50 - full loop inside the other folder how
15:52 - far do you think Bob will move 80 steps
15:57 - yep cool good job and then if I change
16:00 - that outside loop to maybe be two
16:06 - instead that's 60 yes it would be hang
16:16 - on we might have got that a bit wrong so
16:21 - hang on let me double-check this so if
16:24 - it moves 10 40 times 40 times - okay no
16:28 - sorry so you're almost right but what it
16:31 - is is what we have right now Bob would
16:36 - move 80 steps with this bit of
16:38 - code because this inside full loop means
16:43 - 40 steps and we want to do this 40 step
16:46 - thing two times so it's like 40 steps
16:50 - plus 40 steps does that kind of make
16:55 - sense yeah
16:59 - so overall it's 80 steps yep so then if
17:02 - this was changed to full then we'd be
17:06 - doing this bit of code which is 40 steps
17:08 - four times so 40 steps plus all this X
17:12 - plus 40 steps plus 40 steps so that
17:19 - would be like 166 does that make sense
17:27 - as well Cheska I still there just up
17:52 - [Music]
18:14 - so can you hear me Chester yes yes okay
18:19 - sorry I think you dropped out for a
18:20 - second because I try to message you but
18:23 - didn't look also this is week six oh
18:28 - yeah okay I'm gonna just share my screen
18:30 - again so it's not over yet
18:33 - yep you still have a few weeks left yeah
18:37 - yeah okay cool so I think you understand
18:42 - the nested for loop so I'm just gonna
18:44 - get rid of that example and get our
18:48 - normal code back so right now we just
18:52 - roll one shape so for example if it's a
18:55 - square it will just draw one square but
18:57 - if we want to draw the step square this
19:00 - where four times what do we need to do
19:08 - [Music]
19:11 - yep
19:12 - yeah so we want to put it in another
19:14 - folder so for I in range and then do you
19:20 - know how many times we want to loop this
19:22 - thing so do you know what we'll put
19:24 - inside the brackets of this range
19:48 - sir Chester how many times do you think
19:52 - we will will have to repeat this loop
19:55 - what do we need to put inside the
19:58 - records sides yep cool sides it's
20:05 - exactly right and then do you know why
20:07 - we put sides in sing like our times yeah
20:22 - exactly whatever
20:24 - yeah shape five times uh-huh exactly
20:28 - right yes yeah so if it was a square it
20:34 - would know we put in full so we'll do it
20:37 - four times if it wasn't pentagon it
20:39 - would no we put in the number five so
20:42 - we'll do five times and things like that
20:44 - so is there anything else we need to do
20:47 - with this bit of code before we can run
20:49 - it mm-hmm not sure not sure okay so what
21:00 - do we usually do when we put in a loop
21:02 - like do we need any special type of
21:06 - spacing or but can't remember you can't
21:11 - remember so that's okay
21:12 - so if you look at this second full loop
21:15 - what do you see here
21:18 - like before bobbed up forward what do we
21:21 - have so we have some spacing yeah so we
21:32 - want to make sure that this fold happens
21:35 - inside this first top four loop so we
21:39 - can just highlight the second for loop
21:42 - and press tab oh sorry well is that what
21:48 - you're gonna say no
21:52 - copy copy not exactly so you don't need
21:58 - we don't need to copy anything we just
22:00 - want to make sure that this full loop
22:02 - goes inside this folder we want to make
22:06 - sure the program knows that it's part of
22:08 - that for loop so what we can do is we
22:11 - just press tab and then we get some
22:14 - space inside so now yeah so now the
22:19 - program knows this full loop is like the
22:24 - main one and then this full of like
22:27 - happens inside the other for loop okay
22:32 - now once you've done that you can try
22:36 - save it and run it and let's see what
22:38 - happens okay so it did you run it and
23:04 - see what happened yeah okay yeah yep and
23:15 - what happened so continues go around
23:19 - machine yeah so it does repeat it five
23:23 - times but it's not doing it like how we
23:27 - want to isn't it yes yes so I'll just go
23:31 - back to that example want to show you
23:33 - again so it asks us how many sides will
23:36 - the shape have and if I say five it does
23:40 - one and then can you see what it's doing
23:45 - after drawing the shape yeah what do you
23:49 - think it's doing so it's join the shape
23:53 - mix and shape next to it yep so it's
23:57 - drawing it next to it so if we want to
23:59 - because right now in our program it's
24:01 - drawing it on top of it so if we want to
24:04 - draw it next to it like
24:05 - you want to move a bit and draw it next
24:07 - to it what do we have to do do you have
24:09 - an idea no no so that's okay what we
24:15 - need to do is we need to move left left
24:20 - sides yes almost the up left
24:27 - turns it so I do want to turn it but we
24:31 - want to turn it we want to go Bob left
24:33 - angle so that's one thing we want to do
24:41 - angle but another thing we want to do is
24:48 - we want to actually go forward a bit
24:52 - more like we want to make you know how
24:56 - each side of the shape currently each
24:58 - side of the shape is a hundred we want
25:02 - to make this side of the shape go bit
25:04 - more so that like it makes a bigger
25:07 - shape if that makes it what we can do so
25:12 - if you look at this really slowly sighs
25:20 - so it drew a long line first and then it
25:24 - drew off shape did you see that so I'll
25:30 - start it again yeah so if you're looking
25:33 - at the screen I press five and as soon
25:35 - as I start it drills a long line and
25:38 - then just the shape but the shape isn't
25:41 - fit that whole line yet do you see what
25:44 - I mean
25:45 - at the bottom here so what we want to do
25:51 - is we want to drill a line that's double
25:54 - the size about other shape so in here
25:59 - now outside for look what we can do is
26:02 - we can go Bob go forward and then I
26:08 - might make this outside 100 and make the
26:13 - inside one half that size so 50 can you
26:18 - still hear me just
26:47 - okay can you hear me again yes yes okay
26:53 - drop down for a second so if we go back
26:57 - to my screen did you see how I was
27:00 - showing you how it draws that line first
27:02 - like the longer line do you see that far
27:04 - yep yep okay so we need to do that
27:08 - in our code here so in our first full
27:11 - loop we want to draw the shape but we
27:13 - want the shape to be double the size of
27:15 - the shape inside of our normal shape
27:19 - like of the shape we were drawing before
27:22 - so what we can do is we can go above
27:25 - look forward so before the Bob built
27:28 - left in that first of all looking a bob
27:31 - dot forward and then I might make this
27:35 - because I think if we make it 200 our
27:38 - shape might be huge so I might make this
27:41 - one 100 and then you know loop how
27:48 - nested loops so the one inside I'm going
27:50 - to make the other shape half that size
27:54 - so I want to make it 50 so what we're
28:02 - doing is we're drawing the shape and
28:04 - we're repeating it but in the inside
28:07 - loop we're drawing a smaller shape and
28:09 - then in the outside loop we're drawing
28:11 - one big shape
28:32 - so let me know when you've typed that
28:34 - bit of carbon so yeah
28:39 - yep okay so what this is doing is you
28:43 - know how when we had this normal flow
28:45 - loop it was just drawing our shape so if
28:48 - we had five sides it did like the small
28:50 - five-sided shape yeah what this is doing
28:54 - is it's doing the same thing but it's
28:56 - just growing a bigger five-sided shape
28:58 - but then after it draws like each line
29:01 - of that shape it draws a mini shape
29:05 - inside there and then it goes back and
29:08 - rolls the next line of the feed shape
29:10 - and then draws the mini shape and it
29:13 - keeps doing it until it finishes so what
29:17 - you can do is you can run it run run
29:20 - module and see what happens you can see
29:23 - what it looks like now and now it should
29:52 - draw that cool-looking shape well Jules
30:02 - it bike do you wanna share your screen
30:08 - there was like no not like what it's
30:13 - meant to on you're not like what's on my
30:18 - screen okay how about you share your
30:23 - screen then we can have a look at what's
30:26 - happening so this button should be on
30:30 - the top bottom that's their share
30:36 - [Music]
30:52 - okay just loading oh okay
30:56 - and so it is a cool looking shape but
30:59 - it's not the cool shape that are
31:01 - thinking okay so I see what it is so do
31:06 - you see how your numbers are 65 and 55
31:17 - can you still hear me
32:01 - all right
32:03 - can you making okay so Chester can you
32:14 - hear me yeah yep okay so if you look at
32:21 - your numbers so in your first fold in
32:23 - the outside fold you move forward 65
32:27 - times so you're drawing a shape that has
32:30 - like each side is 65 pixels long but
32:36 - then in your other smaller for loop
32:38 - you're going forward 55 times they're
32:42 - drawing a shape that's you know 55 foot
32:45 - long each side but what you want is you
32:48 - want the smaller shape to be half the
32:51 - size of the outside shape so the numbers
32:55 - I used was like 150 because that way
33:00 - when it draws each side so like if you
33:04 - picture it drawing one huge shape with
33:07 - each side as a hundred pixels you want
33:11 - it to draw like the little shape with
33:13 - each side as fifty pixels so that all
33:16 - the little shapes can fit inside it
33:18 - nicely okay so like if you picture
33:21 - square you know how we have a square if
33:25 - you want to like jaws kind of like a
33:28 - window shape with a square so you want
33:30 - you have one big square and you want it
33:32 - to be divided up into full how would you
33:35 - divide it up like if you pretend you're
33:38 - just drawing on a piece of paper like
33:40 - you drew a square but you wanted to make
33:44 - it into four smaller squares where would
33:47 - you draw like the lines to make it into
33:50 - four middle yep exactly so you draw the
34:02 - lines through the middle yep so that
34:06 - means like each little square inside
34:08 - that big square has like half the length
34:12 - of the big square so if one side of the
34:15 - big square is a hundred you'd want to
34:18 - draw the little line like at 50 so that
34:22 - you'd have each square fitting nicely
34:25 - but anyway you can run your program and
34:28 - see what it looks like now and see if it
34:32 - works and then try it out with a couple
34:38 - of different shapes as though you just
34:39 - want to double check to try it with five
34:51 - sides and maybe less and more Jerry
34:57 - looks it was quote it my journey repeats
35:01 - at once yuck it say is how many sides
35:05 - foolish I'll sure it had once oh yeah so
35:09 - do you want to kind of make it so that
35:11 - it keeps asking you
35:18 - so it only asked you once because we in
35:21 - our code
35:22 - we just ask that question once but if
35:26 - you want it to keep asking you do you
35:28 - know what you might do
35:39 - so can you still name Majesta
36:16 - okay chefs can you hear me okay can you
36:23 - hear me again chest up chest I used to
36:37 - live
37:22 - I just can you hear me Ken yep okay cool
37:43 - so let me share my screen again so what
37:46 - you are saying was it only asks you that
37:49 - question how many sides will the shape
37:51 - have once right yeah yeah and then like
37:54 - if you want to keep drawing different
37:57 - shapes or like trying out different
37:58 - shapes you like always have to close it
38:01 - and then run it again so what we can do
38:05 - is what's something that we can add to
38:09 - make like a program repeat itself so if
38:16 - you want a bit of code to be repeated
38:23 - what should we add if we want to keep
38:39 - doing something and like keep repeating
38:42 - it so one way we did it is with this for
38:47 - loop so we have like we repeat this
38:50 - however many times so for example we
38:52 - could repeat something four times I'll
38:55 - repeat something ten times like it
38:58 - depends however many times we tell it to
39:00 - repeat it but if we want to repeat
39:03 - something forever keep repeating it do
39:07 - you have an idea on what we might do not
39:13 - sure that's okay so do you remember when
39:16 - we did something with something called a
39:18 - while loop think we might have used it
39:24 - couple of them kind of that's okay so I
39:27 - think we might have used it a couple of
39:29 - lessons ago possibly but what a while
39:33 - loop does is it means you can
39:36 - it's kind of like a full loop you can
39:39 - repeat itself but we can tell it when to
39:42 - repeat so for example we can be like
39:45 - while like something while something is
39:50 - true we want to continue repeating this
39:53 - whole program or something like that so
39:56 - what we can do in this case is at the
40:00 - very top so after importing turtle we
40:03 - can type in the word while and type in
40:08 - the word truth with a capital T so true
40:15 - with the capital T is a boolean we kind
40:19 - of went through a boolean in the first
40:21 - week but another type of data so boolean
40:25 - is like if something is true or if it's
40:27 - false so we're telling it like true
40:32 - means it is true so in this while loop
40:36 - we're saying while something is true and
40:39 - there's something which we're telling it
40:42 - to be true is actually true so this is
40:46 - another way of saying continue something
40:49 - forever so I don't know if you've done
40:53 - scratch but it's like a forever book
41:23 - okay yeah back can you hear me again
41:31 - just just gonna hear me yes yes yep cool
41:50 - so if we want to make something repeat
41:54 - forever we can type in this bit of code
41:58 - here that's cool that says while true so
42:03 - it's like another type of loop so it's a
42:05 - bit like a for loop but instead of
42:07 - repeating it like however many times
42:09 - we've tell it to so like for example
42:12 - this repeats it four or five or whatever
42:14 - number we put in this wild true thing
42:17 - we'll keep repeating something forever
42:19 - because this word here true means like
42:23 - something is true so it's going while
42:26 - something is true and this is for
42:28 - something so it's saying like while true
42:30 - is true we want to do some code so it
42:35 - might be a bit confusing but just
42:36 - remember it as like a forever loop kind
42:39 - of thing so if you just want something
42:41 - to keep doing it forever
42:43 - you just need this while true block so
42:48 - once you type that have you typed it
42:51 - into your code into your program
43:01 - you
44:38 - oh hello can you hear me
45:03 - hi cool um so Chester was here but I
45:07 - think he's think it was his internet it
45:10 - was dropping out so he might pop in a
45:12 - bit later so we were just working on the
45:16 - project that we started last week so
45:20 - I'll just share my screen again I was
45:22 - just waiting for Chester to reconnect
45:26 - but um if you have a look at my screen
45:30 - to try follow on what you want to do is
45:36 - you want to get your project from last
45:37 - week open as well yeah yep so do you
45:43 - have it open like you know how we were
45:45 - drawing that shape yeah so just get that
45:49 - up yes yeah yep okay so is it open yeah
45:58 - okay cool
45:59 - so what you have so far is when you run
46:02 - it address it just draws one shape but
46:06 - what we want it to do is if you look at
46:09 - my example one you want it to make like
46:13 - a cool pattern to shape so it draws like
46:16 - lots of little shapes within one big
46:19 - shape to ask how many sides will the
46:23 - shape have and I said five so it's
46:27 - drawing five little shapes in one big
46:31 - shape that has five sides that's cool
46:34 - yes so that's pretty cool so we have
46:37 - some of it working oh so we completed it
46:41 - in I completed it with Chester just now
46:43 - but I can quickly show you before he
46:47 - comes back so what we need to do is do
46:50 - you kind of remember how last week I was
46:52 - talking about something called nested
46:54 - loops like a full loop inside another
46:57 - pool oh yeah yep so I'll quickly explain
47:02 - it to you again
47:04 - so just ignore the code on top for a
47:07 - second if I have so don't write this
47:10 - down yet I'm just showing you if I have
47:12 - something like this whoops sorry
47:21 - the book so this is one full look so
47:25 - just the thing that I've highlighted
47:27 - here so I say for I in range for I want
47:32 - to move forward ten steps so how far
47:35 - will Bob move over all taking the seven
47:47 - guess I think is 40 yep that's exactly
47:52 - right
47:53 - so why do you think it's 40 because it's
47:58 - for Thompson
47:59 - yep yeah Panama yeah cuz what this whole
48:03 - loop is doing is it's saying repeat
48:06 - what's inside of here four times so we
48:09 - want to move forward like ten steps four
48:12 - times which is 40 steps now if I added
48:16 - yeah so it's math so now if I added
48:20 - another full so for I in range and then
48:26 - I might say two and then what I want to
48:30 - do is the current folder that we have
48:33 - I'm just putting it inside that this
48:36 - other full now how many times do you
48:39 - think four bogos like how far will Bob
48:42 - go forward okay I think it's four
48:51 - hundred not exactly
48:55 - so we already said before like this
48:59 - first full loop it will go 40 steps cuz
49:03 - it's like four times then that's moving
49:06 - ten steps four times yeah so now if you
49:11 - put that whole loop inside another loop
49:14 - so this other loop is telling us to
49:17 - repeat it too
49:18 - times so right now this loop like the
49:22 - inside loop is pretty much saying move
49:25 - forward 40 steps so if one if we want to
49:29 - do that thing two times so move forward
49:34 - 40 steps two times how many steps will
49:37 - it move forward yep yeah exactly so it's
49:52 - moving forward 80 steps so that's what a
49:56 - nested for loop is doing so it kind of
49:58 - does like it does this inside one but
50:04 - then it runs through every time you do
50:07 - this outside boot so like it goes it
50:11 - starts here starts at this step and then
50:14 - it goes okay I need to go to 40 steps
50:16 - now it goes back again to the loop and
50:19 - this is the second time it's going a
50:21 - loop it's like okay I need to do another
50:23 - 40 steps does that kind of make sense
50:28 - yeah yeah okay so this is what you call
50:32 - a nested loop so it's like a loop inside
50:35 - another loop so what you want to do is
50:38 - so right now your code ignore the stuck
50:42 - in read your code probably looks like
50:46 - this you have one loop that says move
50:51 - forward a certain amount and then turn
50:53 - left
50:56 - yeah yep so what that does is it just
51:00 - draws one shape doesn't it so if you
51:06 - just run it
51:07 - yeah sure run it and see what happens so
51:11 - if you type in like for example the
51:12 - number 5 you can see what happens yeah
51:22 - yeah okay sure so do you see how it just
51:28 - drew one shape sofa yeah yep but then
51:32 - you know in that example project I did
51:34 - if I type in the number five how many
51:38 - shows hardship
51:40 - yeah those five shapes yeah exactly so
51:43 - it is just four times so we need to make
51:48 - this program repeat five times yeah
51:51 - exactly
51:52 - so to do to make this thing repeat five
51:55 - times its we just use a nested for loop
51:59 - there we go so on top of your other fold
52:02 - you go for I in range and inside the
52:10 - brackets instead of doing it five times
52:13 - because it we might want to do like a
52:15 - square sometimes or like a hexagon so we
52:19 - don't want to say only repeat it five
52:21 - times
52:21 - so what number or word will be put
52:25 - inside the brackets will rule five I
52:39 - think or if we do it five times then
52:47 - even you know at the beginning of the
52:49 - program it awesome how many sides will
52:52 - the shape up and then we type in a
52:54 - number you want it to be like whatever
52:58 - number we type in okay yeah sure you
53:04 - have to type in I forgot I forgot
53:16 - somewhere in this put this bit of the
53:18 - curb so where where we asked the person
53:21 - how many sides will the shape have we
53:24 - save it in a variable so can you see
53:28 - what the variable is called yeah yep
53:32 - what a cool it's
53:39 - so do you see in your code like the
53:42 - question how many sides will the shape
53:43 - up or something like that oh yeah yep so
53:48 - there's like in that line of code
53:50 - there's an equal sign so that means it's
53:54 - being saved into a variable
53:57 - yeah sure you have to put iron chooser
54:00 - so almost like what's the thing before
54:03 - the equal sign or before the int sorry
54:06 - and before the equal sign what's the
54:09 - other charge yep exactly
54:11 - so inside the brackets with since range
54:14 - we want to put in the word sides yeah
54:18 - and then whenever we have a loop we need
54:21 - that colon semicolon thing yep yep but
54:28 - now if you look at our code is there
54:30 - another thing we need to do with loops
54:33 - so to make sure that our program knows
54:37 - that this bit is meant to be inside this
54:40 - outside for loop do we need to move this
54:44 - anyway
54:44 - add something to it oh yeah we have to
54:48 - add something to it yep
54:50 - do you know what we have that int not
54:54 - exactly so int changes something to a
54:56 - number are you sure so if you have a
54:59 - look at this folder like the second one
55:02 - we have our semicolon and then where's
55:06 - the next bit of code is it straight
55:08 - after or is there some space okay so
55:14 - what is it so yes sir is it straight
55:17 - after is there some space there's some
55:21 - space yep so that tells the program
55:24 - these lines of code are part of this
55:28 - full loop so we need to tell our program
55:31 - that this whole for loop is part of this
55:36 - outside for loop so to do that you
55:41 - highlight that for loop the second for
55:44 - loop so these three lines of code and
55:47 - you just press tab
55:50 - that will add some space inside it yeah
55:53 - okay so do that and save it and see what
55:59 - happens
56:03 - yeah okay
56:05 - so door on it yep so run it and let's
56:08 - have a look at what happened okay sure
56:17 - so it's just how many Sarge will assure
56:21 - you pal yep so how'd you drive do i
56:25 - typing so you can put in whatever number
56:27 - you want like three four five okay I'll
56:30 - do five because it was injured original
56:33 - example yeah yeah so now if you look at
56:37 - yours it drawers is a shape five times
56:42 - yeah so it's so it is repeating it five
56:45 - times but it's not doing exactly what we
56:48 - want it to do right yeah so if let's
56:51 - look back at the example one again so if
56:53 - I press play and I'll stick with the
56:55 - same number five again and press Enter
56:57 - do you see how it draws a big line and
57:00 - then it draws a smaller shape inside of
57:03 - it yeah so it's like drawing five
57:07 - smaller shapes but then it's drawing one
57:09 - big shape as well so it's doing like
57:14 - five smaller five-sided shape shapes
57:17 - inside one big five sided shape so I'll
57:20 - show you again but like with the square
57:22 - it might be easier to picture so if this
57:25 - shape will have four sides and I press
57:27 - Enter
57:30 - so if you one small square one another
57:34 - cause we're not a small square and
57:37 - another small square but it also drew a
57:39 - big square so do you see like as soon as
57:42 - I start the program it draws a line and
57:46 - then halfway through like that small
57:49 - square is drawn so like there's like an
57:52 - extra line sticking out but then I'm in
57:54 - the end it finishes yeah yeah so what
57:58 - it's doing is it's showing like this big
58:00 - outer square but after it draws
58:03 - each side of that big outside shape it
58:06 - rose the little shape so like there's
58:08 - that bottom line then there's a little
58:10 - shape there's that line on the right
58:13 - there's a little shape there's the line
58:16 - on top little shape and the line on
58:17 - bottom and a little shape so if we go
58:21 - back into our code what we want to do is
58:25 - after that that top four loop we want to
58:30 - copy the copy this code so Bob forward
58:34 - and Bob top left so you can copy it and
58:39 - we want to put it to make sure that in
58:42 - line we want to put it straight after
58:45 - that first full loop yep yep so what
58:51 - that is doing is it's saying okay we
58:53 - want to draw one shape that has like
58:56 - each side is a hundred pixels in width
59:00 - and then it's saying when we're drawing
59:04 - each side we also want to draw a little
59:06 - mini shape inside that so what we need
59:10 - to do is in that second full loop
59:13 - instead of it being going like instead
59:16 - of Bob going forward a hundred steps we
59:19 - want to make it go forward half that
59:21 - size so what number would we type
59:24 - instead for one hundred per 100 or 250
59:35 - Cherie yep so we type in 50 is what
59:39 - we're doing is this first full loop or
59:41 - like the outside for loop is drawing a
59:44 - big shape so for example a square it's
59:47 - drawing a big shape where each side is a
59:49 - hundred but then after drills each side
59:53 - it goes into this little folder where it
59:56 - draws a small square inside that so it
59:59 - draws one line then a small square one
60:02 - line a small square one line a small
60:04 - square and like this that yeah okay so
60:08 - what you can do is you can run it and
60:10 - see what happens
60:12 - yeah sure
60:16 - so I run it and then yes yeah I put five
60:23 - sides yep
60:25 - yeah now it should be making a cool
60:29 - shape yeah yeah okay cool
60:33 - forget my head yeah so that's we did
60:37 - that using something called a nested
60:39 - loop so what it means by nested is it
60:43 - just means like one loop is inside
60:45 - another loop so that's what that kind of
60:50 - means but yeah it's also 530 now so
60:54 - that's the end of the class um so do you
60:58 - have any questions before we finished no
61:02 - no no okay so that's okay then make sure
61:06 - to save your project and I'll see you
61:08 - next week
61:09 - oh well that was a pretty quickly she
61:13 - yes I think so
61:16 - make sure next time you're here at 4:30
61:18 - because the class starts at 4:30 oh yeah
61:22 - I forgot about Jen I'm sorry yeah no
61:25 - that's okay here it's just cuz otherwise
61:26 - you miss out on the oh yeah okay so next
61:31 - time I'll be right on time yep that's
61:33 - good yeah okay and then the class will
61:37 - be wonderful yeah okay yep okay cool
61:41 - I'll see you next week then yeah you too
61:45 - bye
61:46 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

and start sharing my school so do you remember that project we need last week just yeah yeah okay so I think the connections a bit slow so I'll just speak slowly and then then I'll wait for your reply sorry I didn't hear you I think it was cutting out yeah okay so we're just going to open that project we started last week and let me just get it up there is this I'll show you what it's meant to look like again to refresh your memory let me just one second okay can you still see my screen okay yes yep okay so if you remember this is what we made all started making last week so it asked us how many sides will the shape have and we would just put in a number and then it will draw one of that shape and then keep drawing that shape to make like a cool pattern yep so that's what we need to make so what we have so far is it's just making one shape so if you open up what you had from last week and run it we can just see what it does if you run if you run your project does it open and ask you how many shapes will do how many sides nor the shape huh yeah yep and then if you put in a number for like five again you can see that it drills a pentagon or shape whatever however many sides you told it to go this feels good right well yeah but once I do it mmhm it's like it's not closes it closes okay from my own it just closes yeah so if you doubleclick and open it then it just does it and then closes because it's finished with the program and it closes so yeah you might need to open it like edit with idle and then run it from there so once you've run it let me know well so it just it should just drill one in shape for now it doesn't make the cool person yet because that's what we need to do with it I didn't have the arm message doesn't have my thing that's in it without oh all right so I think yours are the one that didn't have that so what you might need to do is you know how you normally open up Idol like when you look at the program and you type in Idol you might need to do that and then once you've opened it you should be able to go file and then open five to file and open and then you can choose what you rogram will saved once you've done that let me know fit what did you manage to get it open yet ah not yet so do you have Idol of them like a new Idol thing yep yeah from there on the top you should be able to click on file and then open and then you just need to remember where you saved it last night in what fold anything so you just click on file open and then you have to choose file it is you got it I got what I have Adam awesome ok yeah on the thing yay that's good so it draws one shape doing a quickly test it as if it were so by running it yeah yep yes okay cool nice so what we want to do is if we look back at the example program it doesn't just drill one shape it drills like however many times so say you said five it drills that one shape on each side of the shape so it looks like a really cool pattern you so chose the poweron shape sometimes yep pretty much so what we need to do is make our shape draw five times we go back to our code currently do you remember what I followed this almost so it makes whatever's inside that loop repeat however my like however many times you tell it to go in our case so sometimes it could be four times but could be five times in difference because we use this variable called size and the variable sides is the input that the person put in so if the person put in three then the fold will make it go three times if we put in five then the fold will make it repeat five times does that make sense so I think the connection is dropping out a bit I'll just wait a minute yeah I think I might exit go back in like to see people have better connection okay yeah sure you can try that see if it works I'll stop sharing my screen for the minute ISM just to see if that helps okay hi again how's the connection so far yep okay cool I'm just going to share my screen again see what happens if it's still a bit slow we can try just turn off our webcams as well because that might take a bit of thing but for now it seems okay so we'll just continue and see how it goes okay so yeah we have our for loop that repeats what we want to do however many times so in this case the amount of times is however many sides a person types in but what we want to do is like what you said if we draw a shape with five sides we want to draw that shape five times as well yep yep so do you remember how at the end of last week we were going through something called a nested for loop so it's like when we had a full loop inside another full loop oh yeah I'm I'm okay so do you kind of remember how they were not sure not sure so I'll quickly show you again she might remember remember that's okay I was like it would repeat it four times and then like it would repeat on top yeah okay okay I think the connection might have dropped out a bit again can you hear me again Chester yeah sure yeah dropped out again okay I turned off my video just to see if that would help so if you want you can do that too on the top I think near where the share screen button and stuff is there should be a thing called turn off video or like stop video can you hear me again Justin yes yes okay again yeah again okay we'll see this look so we both turned off that webcam gonna share my screen if that doesn't work I might try like look out and come back in but hopefully this one so we were can you see my screen yeah yep okay cool so we were talking about how you have like a full coat something called a nested pool so you're trying to remember what it was you do you have an idea of what it is yes so basically repeat eight times yep yeah the GPD yeah yeah pretty much so it might not always be eight but it depends so like if we have our full loop just commenting this out for second so if we have a normal full loop so like for I in range and the range is full then like if we wanted to move forward for example so like this would happen this is just a normal full so this would happen ten times I mean full forty times like sorry it would happen four times because it's moving 10 each time can you hear me still Chester I think it dropped out again yeah yeah okay I'm right okay we'll just continue see how it goes and hopefully doesn't drop out too much maybe if you can just keep that check being open as well because we're not using our webcams just so that if you need to ask a question and sometimes I can't hear you or you can't hear me you can't say something in there yep okay so like you said if you have a nested folder it might do something eight times because it's doing that inside full and that outside folder so yeah I was just showing you like an example of how that might work so this is a normal four loop that does something four times so it moves Bob Bob forward ten steps each time so overall how many times would that be out like how far would Bob move forward 40 steps yep exactly and then if we added another for loop so for I in range and then put this first full loop inside the other folder how far do you think Bob will move 80 steps yep cool good job and then if I change that outside loop to maybe be two instead that's 60 yes it would be hang on we might have got that a bit wrong so hang on let me doublecheck this so if it moves 10 40 times 40 times okay no sorry so you're almost right but what it is is what we have right now Bob would move 80 steps with this bit of code because this inside full loop means 40 steps and we want to do this 40 step thing two times so it's like 40 steps plus 40 steps does that kind of make sense yeah so overall it's 80 steps yep so then if this was changed to full then we'd be doing this bit of code which is 40 steps four times so 40 steps plus all this X plus 40 steps plus 40 steps so that would be like 166 does that make sense as well Cheska I still there just up so can you hear me Chester yes yes okay sorry I think you dropped out for a second because I try to message you but didn't look also this is week six oh yeah okay I'm gonna just share my screen again so it's not over yet yep you still have a few weeks left yeah yeah okay cool so I think you understand the nested for loop so I'm just gonna get rid of that example and get our normal code back so right now we just roll one shape so for example if it's a square it will just draw one square but if we want to draw the step square this where four times what do we need to do yep yeah so we want to put it in another folder so for I in range and then do you know how many times we want to loop this thing so do you know what we'll put inside the brackets of this range sir Chester how many times do you think we will will have to repeat this loop what do we need to put inside the records sides yep cool sides it's exactly right and then do you know why we put sides in sing like our times yeah exactly whatever yeah shape five times uhhuh exactly right yes yeah so if it was a square it would know we put in full so we'll do it four times if it wasn't pentagon it would no we put in the number five so we'll do five times and things like that so is there anything else we need to do with this bit of code before we can run it mmhmm not sure not sure okay so what do we usually do when we put in a loop like do we need any special type of spacing or but can't remember you can't remember so that's okay so if you look at this second full loop what do you see here like before bobbed up forward what do we have so we have some spacing yeah so we want to make sure that this fold happens inside this first top four loop so we can just highlight the second for loop and press tab oh sorry well is that what you're gonna say no copy copy not exactly so you don't need we don't need to copy anything we just want to make sure that this full loop goes inside this folder we want to make sure the program knows that it's part of that for loop so what we can do is we just press tab and then we get some space inside so now yeah so now the program knows this full loop is like the main one and then this full of like happens inside the other for loop okay now once you've done that you can try save it and run it and let's see what happens okay so it did you run it and see what happened yeah okay yeah yep and what happened so continues go around machine yeah so it does repeat it five times but it's not doing it like how we want to isn't it yes yes so I'll just go back to that example want to show you again so it asks us how many sides will the shape have and if I say five it does one and then can you see what it's doing after drawing the shape yeah what do you think it's doing so it's join the shape mix and shape next to it yep so it's drawing it next to it so if we want to because right now in our program it's drawing it on top of it so if we want to draw it next to it like you want to move a bit and draw it next to it what do we have to do do you have an idea no no so that's okay what we need to do is we need to move left left sides yes almost the up left turns it so I do want to turn it but we want to turn it we want to go Bob left angle so that's one thing we want to do angle but another thing we want to do is we want to actually go forward a bit more like we want to make you know how each side of the shape currently each side of the shape is a hundred we want to make this side of the shape go bit more so that like it makes a bigger shape if that makes it what we can do so if you look at this really slowly sighs so it drew a long line first and then it drew off shape did you see that so I'll start it again yeah so if you're looking at the screen I press five and as soon as I start it drills a long line and then just the shape but the shape isn't fit that whole line yet do you see what I mean at the bottom here so what we want to do is we want to drill a line that's double the size about other shape so in here now outside for look what we can do is we can go Bob go forward and then I might make this outside 100 and make the inside one half that size so 50 can you still hear me just okay can you hear me again yes yes okay drop down for a second so if we go back to my screen did you see how I was showing you how it draws that line first like the longer line do you see that far yep yep okay so we need to do that in our code here so in our first full loop we want to draw the shape but we want the shape to be double the size of the shape inside of our normal shape like of the shape we were drawing before so what we can do is we can go above look forward so before the Bob built left in that first of all looking a bob dot forward and then I might make this because I think if we make it 200 our shape might be huge so I might make this one 100 and then you know loop how nested loops so the one inside I'm going to make the other shape half that size so I want to make it 50 so what we're doing is we're drawing the shape and we're repeating it but in the inside loop we're drawing a smaller shape and then in the outside loop we're drawing one big shape so let me know when you've typed that bit of carbon so yeah yep okay so what this is doing is you know how when we had this normal flow loop it was just drawing our shape so if we had five sides it did like the small fivesided shape yeah what this is doing is it's doing the same thing but it's just growing a bigger fivesided shape but then after it draws like each line of that shape it draws a mini shape inside there and then it goes back and rolls the next line of the feed shape and then draws the mini shape and it keeps doing it until it finishes so what you can do is you can run it run run module and see what happens you can see what it looks like now and now it should draw that coollooking shape well Jules it bike do you wanna share your screen there was like no not like what it's meant to on you're not like what's on my screen okay how about you share your screen then we can have a look at what's happening so this button should be on the top bottom that's their share okay just loading oh okay and so it is a cool looking shape but it's not the cool shape that are thinking okay so I see what it is so do you see how your numbers are 65 and 55 can you still hear me all right can you making okay so Chester can you hear me yeah yep okay so if you look at your numbers so in your first fold in the outside fold you move forward 65 times so you're drawing a shape that has like each side is 65 pixels long but then in your other smaller for loop you're going forward 55 times they're drawing a shape that's you know 55 foot long each side but what you want is you want the smaller shape to be half the size of the outside shape so the numbers I used was like 150 because that way when it draws each side so like if you picture it drawing one huge shape with each side as a hundred pixels you want it to draw like the little shape with each side as fifty pixels so that all the little shapes can fit inside it nicely okay so like if you picture square you know how we have a square if you want to like jaws kind of like a window shape with a square so you want you have one big square and you want it to be divided up into full how would you divide it up like if you pretend you're just drawing on a piece of paper like you drew a square but you wanted to make it into four smaller squares where would you draw like the lines to make it into four middle yep exactly so you draw the lines through the middle yep so that means like each little square inside that big square has like half the length of the big square so if one side of the big square is a hundred you'd want to draw the little line like at 50 so that you'd have each square fitting nicely but anyway you can run your program and see what it looks like now and see if it works and then try it out with a couple of different shapes as though you just want to double check to try it with five sides and maybe less and more Jerry looks it was quote it my journey repeats at once yuck it say is how many sides foolish I'll sure it had once oh yeah so do you want to kind of make it so that it keeps asking you so it only asked you once because we in our code we just ask that question once but if you want it to keep asking you do you know what you might do so can you still name Majesta okay chefs can you hear me okay can you hear me again chest up chest I used to live I just can you hear me Ken yep okay cool so let me share my screen again so what you are saying was it only asks you that question how many sides will the shape have once right yeah yeah and then like if you want to keep drawing different shapes or like trying out different shapes you like always have to close it and then run it again so what we can do is what's something that we can add to make like a program repeat itself so if you want a bit of code to be repeated what should we add if we want to keep doing something and like keep repeating it so one way we did it is with this for loop so we have like we repeat this however many times so for example we could repeat something four times I'll repeat something ten times like it depends however many times we tell it to repeat it but if we want to repeat something forever keep repeating it do you have an idea on what we might do not sure that's okay so do you remember when we did something with something called a while loop think we might have used it couple of them kind of that's okay so I think we might have used it a couple of lessons ago possibly but what a while loop does is it means you can it's kind of like a full loop you can repeat itself but we can tell it when to repeat so for example we can be like while like something while something is true we want to continue repeating this whole program or something like that so what we can do in this case is at the very top so after importing turtle we can type in the word while and type in the word truth with a capital T so true with the capital T is a boolean we kind of went through a boolean in the first week but another type of data so boolean is like if something is true or if it's false so we're telling it like true means it is true so in this while loop we're saying while something is true and there's something which we're telling it to be true is actually true so this is another way of saying continue something forever so I don't know if you've done scratch but it's like a forever book okay yeah back can you hear me again just just gonna hear me yes yes yep cool so if we want to make something repeat forever we can type in this bit of code here that's cool that says while true so it's like another type of loop so it's a bit like a for loop but instead of repeating it like however many times we've tell it to so like for example this repeats it four or five or whatever number we put in this wild true thing we'll keep repeating something forever because this word here true means like something is true so it's going while something is true and this is for something so it's saying like while true is true we want to do some code so it might be a bit confusing but just remember it as like a forever loop kind of thing so if you just want something to keep doing it forever you just need this while true block so once you type that have you typed it into your code into your program you oh hello can you hear me hi cool um so Chester was here but I think he's think it was his internet it was dropping out so he might pop in a bit later so we were just working on the project that we started last week so I'll just share my screen again I was just waiting for Chester to reconnect but um if you have a look at my screen to try follow on what you want to do is you want to get your project from last week open as well yeah yep so do you have it open like you know how we were drawing that shape yeah so just get that up yes yeah yep okay so is it open yeah okay cool so what you have so far is when you run it address it just draws one shape but what we want it to do is if you look at my example one you want it to make like a cool pattern to shape so it draws like lots of little shapes within one big shape to ask how many sides will the shape have and I said five so it's drawing five little shapes in one big shape that has five sides that's cool yes so that's pretty cool so we have some of it working oh so we completed it in I completed it with Chester just now but I can quickly show you before he comes back so what we need to do is do you kind of remember how last week I was talking about something called nested loops like a full loop inside another pool oh yeah yep so I'll quickly explain it to you again so just ignore the code on top for a second if I have so don't write this down yet I'm just showing you if I have something like this whoops sorry the book so this is one full look so just the thing that I've highlighted here so I say for I in range for I want to move forward ten steps so how far will Bob move over all taking the seven guess I think is 40 yep that's exactly right so why do you think it's 40 because it's for Thompson yep yeah Panama yeah cuz what this whole loop is doing is it's saying repeat what's inside of here four times so we want to move forward like ten steps four times which is 40 steps now if I added yeah so it's math so now if I added another full so for I in range and then I might say two and then what I want to do is the current folder that we have I'm just putting it inside that this other full now how many times do you think four bogos like how far will Bob go forward okay I think it's four hundred not exactly so we already said before like this first full loop it will go 40 steps cuz it's like four times then that's moving ten steps four times yeah so now if you put that whole loop inside another loop so this other loop is telling us to repeat it too times so right now this loop like the inside loop is pretty much saying move forward 40 steps so if one if we want to do that thing two times so move forward 40 steps two times how many steps will it move forward yep yeah exactly so it's moving forward 80 steps so that's what a nested for loop is doing so it kind of does like it does this inside one but then it runs through every time you do this outside boot so like it goes it starts here starts at this step and then it goes okay I need to go to 40 steps now it goes back again to the loop and this is the second time it's going a loop it's like okay I need to do another 40 steps does that kind of make sense yeah yeah okay so this is what you call a nested loop so it's like a loop inside another loop so what you want to do is so right now your code ignore the stuck in read your code probably looks like this you have one loop that says move forward a certain amount and then turn left yeah yep so what that does is it just draws one shape doesn't it so if you just run it yeah sure run it and see what happens so if you type in like for example the number 5 you can see what happens yeah yeah okay sure so do you see how it just drew one shape sofa yeah yep but then you know in that example project I did if I type in the number five how many shows hardship yeah those five shapes yeah exactly so it is just four times so we need to make this program repeat five times yeah exactly so to do to make this thing repeat five times its we just use a nested for loop there we go so on top of your other fold you go for I in range and inside the brackets instead of doing it five times because it we might want to do like a square sometimes or like a hexagon so we don't want to say only repeat it five times so what number or word will be put inside the brackets will rule five I think or if we do it five times then even you know at the beginning of the program it awesome how many sides will the shape up and then we type in a number you want it to be like whatever number we type in okay yeah sure you have to type in I forgot I forgot somewhere in this put this bit of the curb so where where we asked the person how many sides will the shape have we save it in a variable so can you see what the variable is called yeah yep what a cool it's so do you see in your code like the question how many sides will the shape up or something like that oh yeah yep so there's like in that line of code there's an equal sign so that means it's being saved into a variable yeah sure you have to put iron chooser so almost like what's the thing before the equal sign or before the int sorry and before the equal sign what's the other charge yep exactly so inside the brackets with since range we want to put in the word sides yeah and then whenever we have a loop we need that colon semicolon thing yep yep but now if you look at our code is there another thing we need to do with loops so to make sure that our program knows that this bit is meant to be inside this outside for loop do we need to move this anyway add something to it oh yeah we have to add something to it yep do you know what we have that int not exactly so int changes something to a number are you sure so if you have a look at this folder like the second one we have our semicolon and then where's the next bit of code is it straight after or is there some space okay so what is it so yes sir is it straight after is there some space there's some space yep so that tells the program these lines of code are part of this full loop so we need to tell our program that this whole for loop is part of this outside for loop so to do that you highlight that for loop the second for loop so these three lines of code and you just press tab that will add some space inside it yeah okay so do that and save it and see what happens yeah okay so door on it yep so run it and let's have a look at what happened okay sure so it's just how many Sarge will assure you pal yep so how'd you drive do i typing so you can put in whatever number you want like three four five okay I'll do five because it was injured original example yeah yeah so now if you look at yours it drawers is a shape five times yeah so it's so it is repeating it five times but it's not doing exactly what we want it to do right yeah so if let's look back at the example one again so if I press play and I'll stick with the same number five again and press Enter do you see how it draws a big line and then it draws a smaller shape inside of it yeah so it's like drawing five smaller shapes but then it's drawing one big shape as well so it's doing like five smaller fivesided shape shapes inside one big five sided shape so I'll show you again but like with the square it might be easier to picture so if this shape will have four sides and I press Enter so if you one small square one another cause we're not a small square and another small square but it also drew a big square so do you see like as soon as I start the program it draws a line and then halfway through like that small square is drawn so like there's like an extra line sticking out but then I'm in the end it finishes yeah yeah so what it's doing is it's showing like this big outer square but after it draws each side of that big outside shape it rose the little shape so like there's that bottom line then there's a little shape there's that line on the right there's a little shape there's the line on top little shape and the line on bottom and a little shape so if we go back into our code what we want to do is after that that top four loop we want to copy the copy this code so Bob forward and Bob top left so you can copy it and we want to put it to make sure that in line we want to put it straight after that first full loop yep yep so what that is doing is it's saying okay we want to draw one shape that has like each side is a hundred pixels in width and then it's saying when we're drawing each side we also want to draw a little mini shape inside that so what we need to do is in that second full loop instead of it being going like instead of Bob going forward a hundred steps we want to make it go forward half that size so what number would we type instead for one hundred per 100 or 250 Cherie yep so we type in 50 is what we're doing is this first full loop or like the outside for loop is drawing a big shape so for example a square it's drawing a big shape where each side is a hundred but then after drills each side it goes into this little folder where it draws a small square inside that so it draws one line then a small square one line a small square one line a small square and like this that yeah okay so what you can do is you can run it and see what happens yeah sure so I run it and then yes yeah I put five sides yep yeah now it should be making a cool shape yeah yeah okay cool forget my head yeah so that's we did that using something called a nested loop so what it means by nested is it just means like one loop is inside another loop so that's what that kind of means but yeah it's also 530 now so that's the end of the class um so do you have any questions before we finished no no no okay so that's okay then make sure to save your project and I'll see you next week oh well that was a pretty quickly she yes I think so make sure next time you're here at 430 because the class starts at 430 oh yeah I forgot about Jen I'm sorry yeah no that's okay here it's just cuz otherwise you miss out on the oh yeah okay so next time I'll be right on time yep that's good yeah okay and then the class will be wonderful yeah okay yep okay cool I'll see you next week then yeah you too bye
