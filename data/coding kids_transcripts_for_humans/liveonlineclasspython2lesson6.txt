With timestamps:

00:00 - so again if you don't want your face
00:04 - recorded you can turn off your webcam
00:08 - part so excited line up okay I don't
00:13 - mind
00:13 - cool so let me share my screen again so
00:16 - yeah we're just gonna review like the
00:19 - files thing again cuz we did that a
00:21 - couple of weeks ago and because we're
00:23 - gonna make a project with that you can
00:27 - just open up I don't know if you save
00:30 - that project from a couple of weeks I
00:39 - think it was just like a few line boy he
00:48 - was no I think it's okay we found that I
00:51 - like you know I'm still okay okay no I
00:56 - don't have it I can I think I have to
00:59 - restart it's okay no that's enough I got
01:02 - I got it actually okay you found it
01:05 - it's okay cuz it's only like lines
01:07 - anyway yeah yes I was just gonna quickly
01:11 - explain it you know sorry that's your
01:13 - screen I develop on my tree right okay
01:16 - that's okay you can just open a new file
01:19 - close we're just gonna be emulating mine
01:23 - anyway cuz we're just gonna like go
01:24 - through it again okay so let me know
01:43 - when you have that open yep sorry I have
01:46 - it open
01:46 - okay open so with file so the reason we
01:50 - can like we use like files like saving
01:54 - and writing and reading file in Python
01:56 - projects is so like the main reason this
02:02 - usually when you make a program like so
02:04 - far all the programs are made like as
02:06 - soon as you close it you just like
02:08 - nothing is safe
02:10 - run it again it's just like starting
02:12 - from you so that's why we save the pole
02:16 - do you remember this line that says like
02:19 - yeah open o file don't open them yep so
02:24 - file equals open okay yes open yep and
02:29 - then you have the brackets opening and
02:31 - closing brackets use the normal round
02:34 - brackets and then inside that we can
02:37 - tell what type of file it is so I'll
02:40 - just quickly say so to like bring in a
02:43 - file into a Python project and save it
02:46 - as a variable we use this bit of code so
02:50 - like the open the open file doesn't
02:52 - actually like open a file in the like it
02:55 - doesn't open up like that txt file
02:57 - it's just saying within this program we
03:02 - kind of want to open it in a certain way
03:04 - so do you remember the three different
03:05 - modes so yes yep read mm-hmm action
03:12 - right yes good job so do you remember
03:16 - the difference between them yes
03:19 - yep right you could you could add things
03:24 - on to it but then whenever you restarted
03:27 - it every set mm-hmm
03:31 - read I believe you can add to it and it
03:35 - will stay like that as well oh no wait
03:41 - exactly kind of so you are right with
03:46 - the right one um do you know what append
03:48 - this know exactly sorry yeah that's like
03:53 - no that's fine that's completely fine so
03:56 - we'll just quickly go with right again
03:58 - just to like test our memory so when we
04:02 - go file equals open
04:04 - it's just saving it in a variable in our
04:07 - program called file so like that's the
04:09 - variable name so this can be anything so
04:12 - this could be like you know variable
04:16 - name things just to get this straight
04:18 - mm-hm
04:19 - the name of the actual file is in
04:22 - file yes so that's not the name of the
04:25 - actual file so this is the name of the
04:29 - variable so later on in our program if
04:32 - you want to do something with the file
04:34 - instead of calling it like the file name
04:37 - we can call it by this variable name the
04:41 - your current so where we put the actual
04:43 - file name is inside the brackets so if
04:47 - we want to call it something like test
04:50 - file again and we want to save it as a
04:54 - text file so we can go up txt we do that
05:06 - so this is the actual name of the file
05:10 - this is just like a variable which we
05:13 - kind of saved the file in in our probe
05:15 - in our program so we can use it later on
05:18 - so what we're saying is we're having
05:22 - this file name like it's a text file
05:25 - called test file and so we'll start with
05:28 - right so we want to open it in the right
05:31 - mode so you do a comma and then you type
05:35 - in a W okay so if you want just quickly
05:42 - save that and then run it if you want so
05:46 - I have this one last time I'm just gonna
05:48 - delete it so what it will do is when you
05:52 - open it like this in write mode if it
05:55 - can't find any file name with this name
05:58 - so if I can't find it in this computer
06:00 - where your Python project is saved it
06:03 - will make a new file so when you run
06:06 - your program now you should be able to
06:08 - see that yep so I just have to save it
06:15 - somewhere so yeah that's fine
06:19 - [Music]
06:24 - okay how's it run does it run okay give
06:31 - it a bit okay
06:32 - it's and now oh okay
06:40 - you might have got a I got an error you
06:45 - got it oh yes I got it
06:48 - nope you got it I got it cool I think
06:50 - okay I just typed something wrong let me
06:58 - run it again okay but did you get a file
07:05 - like just a blank text file that opened
07:07 - up so whatever whichever folder on your
07:13 - computer like wherever you saved this
07:16 - Python project there might be a file
07:19 - called test file something new yeah I it
07:22 - is there I see it because I I'm on it
07:25 - okay you're on it so right now it's just
07:27 - empty cuz it just made an empty file
07:29 - yeah yep was it not assigned to operate
07:33 - it okay I'm just gonna call this file
07:40 - okay so with this thing with the line of
07:46 - code you know how I said we could be
07:48 - like a call it variable name or
07:50 - something like that
07:50 - it I'm pretty sure you have to call it
07:53 - file so because it's like a set thing
07:55 - about opening and closing files you have
07:57 - to use a variable name file okay that
08:00 - way to me sorry what do you mean by that
08:02 - so you know how right now in your code
08:05 - you have file is equal to open or
08:08 - something yeah you know how I said this
08:10 - word file is just a variable name it's
08:13 - not the actual name of our file yeah so
08:16 - then I I told you like you could change
08:18 - it to something else like variable I
08:23 - look something like that so I think
08:26 - because like opening and closing files
08:29 - uses this function like open and it's
08:31 - like a set function you can only save it
08:34 - to a variable
08:35 - old file like that's the name cuz if I
08:38 - try it like this with a different
08:40 - variable name and try run it I get an
08:43 - error I should I don't know
08:47 - hey never mind sorry for confusing you
08:51 - you just can't have hat um dashes in
08:54 - your verbal name so it's quite thin you
08:57 - can't have that so that's why I did it
09:00 - with if you have something that has two
09:02 - words so I have a variable file for
09:05 - example you just like do it in something
09:08 - called camel case have you heard of
09:10 - camel case before No
09:13 - so camel case is like do you see how
09:15 - this is two different words yeah camel
09:18 - case means it's all lowercase except for
09:20 - like the next word that you're joining
09:22 - across did you see how like in is name
09:26 - yep that's what camel case is so it's
09:30 - like you start every word with a capital
09:32 - letter when it's like smushed together
09:33 - except the first one so if like this
09:36 - name had another one you can be like
09:38 - hello like if that was one variable name
09:41 - that's camel case that's a different
09:44 - topic
09:44 - anyway what so when you run this file
09:48 - open it doesn't actually open any files
09:51 - in the background it just makes it so
09:54 - you should see that and again you can
09:58 - change this to whatever type of file you
10:00 - want so for example if you are somehow
10:03 - later on like making a HTML file and if
10:07 - you wanted to add like a HTML page with
10:10 - Python code you can just save it as dot
10:12 - HTML so that would save it as a HTML
10:16 - file so try change that on yours and
10:19 - then run it then if you go back into
10:29 - where your files are saved you should
10:32 - see like something called test file a
10:34 - testing file don't HTML this time yep I
10:45 - actually have two test files now you
10:47 - have two test file so
10:49 - yep so one was like the one you made
10:51 - last time that's like with that's a
10:54 - normal text file it's just text and this
10:57 - one is now a HTML file so if we actually
10:59 - had HTML code later in it if you like
11:02 - clicked on it it would open up like the
11:05 - website but right now it would just be
11:08 - empty cuz it's nothing so yeah you can
11:14 - just save things so it doesn't just have
11:16 - to be like plain text
11:17 - it depends what type of file you want to
11:20 - save it as okay anyway back to the point
11:23 - we just go back to text or yeah so maybe
11:28 - we go back to text txt so with the right
11:33 - mode like you said you can write things
11:35 - in it and so do you remember how we
11:37 - write things in it is it possibly I want
11:48 - to say after a friend so that's one way
11:51 - we can write in it so append is like you
11:54 - add something on to what's in the file
11:56 - so you can do that with this actually
11:59 - but what you need to do is you need to
12:01 - change the mode so right now we're in
12:04 - like right mode if you want to append to
12:06 - the file you need to change it to a so
12:09 - what a pen does is it remembers what we
12:12 - already have in our file and then add
12:13 - something on to the end if we do it in
12:16 - right it would just replace everything
12:19 - with what we write again so like let me
12:24 - show you so what we need to do is we
12:26 - need to get our variable name we need to
12:27 - go file dot write and then we can write
12:33 - some come write some text so we just
12:36 - have brackets and if this were HTML how
12:40 - would we do it okay so I can quickly
12:43 - show you so do you know some basic HTML
12:47 - tiny bit kind of it all right that's
12:49 - okay so why don't we quickly change our
12:52 - file back to an HTML file so we can test
12:55 - it out so file dot write what we could
12:58 - do is we could make a HTML like you know
13:01 - HTML tags
13:02 - yeah yeah so generally we need to put it
13:07 - in like a haitch tml like a big tag like
13:10 - that and then I'm just pressing into a
13:14 - few times just so it's easy to see and
13:18 - then what you might need to do is type
13:19 - in like buddy
13:22 - okay wait maybe it won't present yeah so
13:29 - a pop like oh sorry what was your
13:31 - question is there nothing before the
13:35 - last line no that's just a five
13:38 - innovative nope sorry okay say Papa in
13:48 - no short way so you take up imports in
13:54 - one of the shorts one of the shorts in
13:57 - the nationality you can't it's gonna be
13:59 - hard to find it it's in one of the
14:02 - shorts of the laundry sure sorry about
14:06 - that
14:06 - that's all good okay so these are just
14:12 - some basic HTML tags but what do you do
14:16 - app how do you actually coat something
14:19 - in like yeah so with HTML well I'll just
14:24 - finish writing this first to show you so
14:27 - you know how much HTML you have like
14:29 - your different tags so you have like
14:31 - HTML tags body tag and then like you
14:35 - might want to add like a header so a
14:38 - header could be like h1 and then we can
14:42 - type in some text like this is a header
14:47 - and then we close the h1 so if you have
14:57 - a look like wait whoopsie oh wait I
15:00 - think it we're missing something do we
15:02 - need a smash after the HTML yes so
15:06 - that's on this side here so with oh yeah
15:11 - so which HTML tags you have one that's
15:14 - like normal and then when you want to
15:16 - close it at the end you add a slash to
15:19 - the end one like if I just press ENTER
15:27 - to show you I just press the Enter just
15:40 - to show you what I'm talking about I
15:45 - think there's a way to do a multi-line
15:48 - thing and - yeah so I just didn't enter
15:55 - just so that you can see like the rough
15:56 - structure of it I'm just ignoring the
15:59 - quotation one spinel but like this is a
16:04 - basic idea of what like a basic page
16:07 - might look like so we just have like
16:18 - HTML tag and then a body tags and then
16:21 - it's the heading it's a pretty basic
16:24 - like you know just some simple tags and
16:28 - then we're just writing it into the file
16:32 - I'm just putting it back on one line for
16:35 - that it's just neat me so let me know
16:53 - when you've typed in yes so you know I
16:56 - was let me just check yes yeah I was
17:01 - typing oh wait how do you I put in
17:05 - something actually different it's coming
17:07 - from the book him doing a hyperlink -
17:11 - yep that's fine - do you know how it
17:13 - doesn't seem to be working
17:15 - I did HTML then I did a curve equals
17:20 - HTTP then ww google.com mm-hmm and then
17:26 - I called a Google I did a
17:29 - in the slash and then HTML but it seems
17:33 - to be giving me an error
17:34 - ofc I see there it's an embarrassing
17:37 - error and so good I forgot to put the
17:40 - brackets all right yeah so with this so
17:44 - python like when you put it as a string
17:47 - like python doesn't know that it's HTML
17:49 - code or anything like that so you won't
17:51 - get any code relating I mean any errors
17:54 - relating to like the HTML stuff the
17:57 - errors will be like something in the
17:59 - Python file like if you think so it's
18:01 - not finished but how if it's not showing
18:05 - anything what do we do so doesn't seem
18:09 - to be showing anything okay so whereas
18:14 - in when you run it yep yep so have you
18:19 - refreshed the page as well yes a unique
18:22 - turning it right okay wait hands and
18:25 - I'll run - also run module and then you
18:28 - need to open the one that's the HTML
18:30 - file yeah hmm yep okay yet so it might
19:07 - just because there's like a there might
19:10 - be a different way - okay yeah so this
19:15 - is with Python so we're writing out text
19:17 - but you know how I don't know if you
19:20 - remember from last week every time you
19:21 - like use this open function when you're
19:24 - done with you need to do something else
19:26 - do you know yet close yep so we'll try
19:29 - fail mm-hm
19:32 - don't close your file equal file dot
19:35 - close and then brackets so that just
19:39 - tells our program okay we're done
19:41 - writing the file you can
19:43 - finish it off or whatever like it
19:46 - doesn't keep waiting for you to type
19:48 - more so okay so now make sure to run it
19:53 - first and then check it out so that well
19:57 - okay I'm okay
20:01 - it has to text but it's not showing the
20:04 - hyperlink okay so that might be like
20:08 - issue with like the way you did HTML
20:12 - code so let me have a look
20:15 - so the hyperlinks make sure when you
20:17 - have like a hey trip so like wwhen ma
20:23 - know yeah I put it says to put them in
20:27 - one quotation marks and yep I did do two
20:32 - HTTP and make sure at the end you also
20:37 - have like the a slash a slash HTML you
20:50 - want to quickly share your screen so I
20:53 - can have it look okay sure but also
20:57 - after this will go back to the Python
20:59 - stuff yes I know that's fun I was just
21:01 - it's good so that you can just get an
21:03 - idea on how to write the files like
21:06 - that's what I have if you want I can
21:13 - make it okay I see what it is so you
21:15 - know you have the slashes like you have
21:17 - a like the slashes should be before the
21:21 - a and before the HTML so you you know
21:25 - you have it after the word oh yeah I see
21:28 - it
21:29 - yeah yes I another thing with like HTML
21:33 - and stuff is even if you have an error
21:35 - it won't like it's not like Python it
21:38 - won't say there's an error in this line
21:39 - so it won't work it just tries to like
21:41 - show the text normally because it's more
21:45 - for like display okay
21:51 - [Music]
22:11 - wait maybe if I go okay fish also when
22:18 - you ran it so when you did file run it
22:20 - should say like the file name so you
22:22 - might have closed it a bit early not
22:26 - sure well maybe just try and run it
22:30 - again oh I see it
22:43 - AC ah there we go so do you mind if I
23:16 - stop sharing yep
23:17 - yeah I'll share my screen now so it will
23:19 - stop yours so yeah so that's just an
23:23 - example on life it doesn't just have to
23:25 - be text files that you're writing into
23:27 - it could be HTML files like and you can
23:31 - edit different sort of stuff so I'll
23:36 - just quickly go go so that was right so
23:40 - if you like try edit your text so go
23:44 - back to your Python program so right now
23:46 - your says Google or something should I
23:49 - change that text just like something
23:51 - else like this is Google or something
23:53 - like so right now like your file was
23:59 - like the only thing was like that Google
24:02 - link but now you change it to this is
24:04 - Google so because this is in right
24:07 - what do you think will happen wait what
24:10 - do you mean by - sorry so ok sorry so
24:13 - right now like if you look at my one so
24:17 - my text like I have a heading and it's
24:19 - cold this is a header yeah and now like
24:23 - I ran that and I open it and that's what
24:25 - it says but now I'm editing my Python
24:27 - program and I changed it to say this is
24:30 - another header so if when I save this
24:33 - file and then run it and then open up
24:37 - microfiche this HTML page I think it's
24:40 - will say I think it'll say this is
24:44 - another just simply not just simply
24:47 - about nothing else
24:48 - yeah yep okay yes you're correct so if
24:51 - you wanted it to write it underneath it
24:54 - so if you wanted to keep I had already
24:57 - written before and write the new line
25:00 - underneath it do you know what we might
25:01 - need to do yes the slash not exactly so
25:07 - I'll show you what I mean so when I run
25:10 - this you said it will just say this is
25:12 - another header like another header and
25:14 - it will like delete what's already there
25:16 - right yeah yep so if we don't want to
25:20 - delete it we would need option yeah
25:28 - exactly so we would need a pin so to do
25:31 - that you just change the W to an A so
25:36 - that way it still remembers what you had
25:38 - last time and it just adds on to it so
25:40 - like if you're playing a game like over
25:43 - a few days instead of like refreshing
25:45 - the skull every time you might want to
25:47 - keep it and save it so you can test it
25:53 - if you want but no okay what exactly is
25:59 - a project you want you to do yep so I'll
26:02 - show you that after so just like I'm
26:04 - just quickly going over this stuff just
26:06 - so we have an idea and what to do I'll
26:08 - show you the project now actually so
26:11 - it's just like a it's like a shopping
26:15 - list program but if I just
26:20 - so what it does is I think I might have
26:23 - showed you this shopping this program
26:25 - before but this time it actually saves
26:27 - what you have yeah give me a second is
26:31 - just loading being a little sir okay so
26:56 - can you see my screen sir
26:57 - yep yep okay so just saying welcome to
27:00 - your shelf English and then I think I
27:02 - showed you like how you can add stuff to
27:04 - your shopping list I can put one and I
27:07 - might want to add an apple to my list
27:09 - all right let me run it again I think I
27:16 - typed in L instead of one but basically
27:19 - with this program you can either add
27:22 - stuff to a shopping list like view your
27:24 - shopping list delete your shopping list
27:26 - or just quit the game so that's like the
27:29 - options one to the info so should I just
27:36 - should I just delete it or what we have
27:38 - right now yeah so just delete what you
27:40 - have right now I'll just try and get
27:43 - this up again to show you one second
27:49 - [Music]
27:51 - okay yep
27:53 - so it's saying how can I help you like
27:55 - press one to add something for us too to
27:58 - do this etc etc so if I press 1 press
28:01 - ENTER they - okay there seems to be some
28:10 - issue with this code I tried it like a
28:13 - second ago okay let me try sorry about
28:19 - that I tested it just the whole and it
28:22 - did work I'm not sure what's happening
28:25 - now let me try get it up here instead
28:40 - okay so can you still see my screen yes
28:44 - yep so I'm just running it to here and
28:46 - said so what I'm doing is I just pressed
28:48 - one to add something to the list and
28:50 - I'll just add an apple and then I might
28:53 - want to add something else and I'll add
28:54 - a pair and now if I want to see what's
28:57 - in my shopping list I press 2 and it
29:00 - gives me my list right so now I just
29:03 - want to quit the game so right now I
29:05 - just have apple and pear in my list
29:07 - if I press full and enter it will click
29:10 - the game now if I go back to my files
29:13 - where they're saved
29:15 - do you see how it added something called
29:17 - shopping list dot to you if I click on
29:20 - that it has my shopping list so it has
29:23 - apple and pear so now because I've
29:27 - closed the program so now if I run the
29:29 - program again if I straight away sorry
29:35 - will it restart it and it doesn't
29:38 - restart it cuz the file is there now if
29:40 - I press number 2 which displays the
29:43 - shopping list it tells me I have apple
29:46 - and pear and the first time you try it
29:48 - does it have nothing in it
29:49 - yep so I'll delete this file and show
29:52 - you because the first time I try it the
29:55 - file does not exist so if I try to
29:59 - display it it has nothing in it so so
30:02 - what should be should I just start with
30:04 - file a lot right yes so what we need to
30:08 - do is we need to like yes oh okay let's
30:15 - just open up idle we want to start with
30:18 - yeah filed up right actually filed a pen
30:23 - because if it's there already we want to
30:25 - add to that little file we don't want to
30:27 - replace everything so file now shopping
30:33 - list equals right umm yeah so you can
30:36 - call it shopping list or you can still
30:38 - call it file so that in the program you
30:40 - know that's the file
30:47 - polls open what am i doing roughly open
31:01 - low and open and then right and open it
31:05 - and then shopping list yep shopping list
31:09 - dot txt because we want to save it as a
31:11 - text file King yes G and if I were to
31:25 - Chum others can I ask something else
31:30 - yeah chuckles if you order like write
31:38 - something from the file not from Pythian
31:40 - on App hand would it stay there
31:43 - well let's test it out so you mean like
31:46 - if I go in if I actually open that it's
31:50 - not anymore if I open the shopping list
31:52 - and add like another thing like another
31:54 - me know if you yeah if you open the
31:57 - shopping list and add something yeah
32:00 - okay that's me here we'll be there next
32:03 - time yes it should be so let me just
32:07 - create the shopping list again because I
32:09 - deleted it so I'm just gonna add Apple
32:11 - and pretend that was already there so
32:14 - now what you're asking is if I actually
32:17 - open the not the Python file the
32:19 - shopping list file and added something
32:21 - else
32:21 - yep so let me add in my milk maybe and
32:25 - save it you want to see if it would be
32:28 - there yes please yep well the answer is
32:32 - we'll find out so we want to display our
32:39 - shopping list so we have apple and milk
32:42 - so yes it does appear in our shopping
32:46 - list alright so how it does that is with
32:49 - the other function the read function
32:51 - because it reads everything in the file
32:53 - and then it shows us all right so what
32:57 - do we do then
32:58 - shopping shopping list equals open
33:00 - shopping list of takes P happen mm-hmm
33:04 - so we might need to just keep that line
33:07 - of code there for now but we might need
33:09 - to actually do some other stuff for us
33:11 - because we actually need to make a
33:12 - shopping list program so you know how
33:16 - when I run it we actually need to do the
33:18 - other steps as well so what's the first
33:21 - thing it asks us when we run the program
33:23 - well what does it do it prints it prints
33:29 - like everything you can do yep
33:32 - so let's start with that first as well
33:35 - so we'll say hello welcome to your
33:37 - shopping list how can I help you doing
33:51 - print no isn't it print input no is it
33:57 - input I forgot input so if you want to
34:01 - save what the like if you want the user
34:03 - to type something after the line new
34:07 - yeah like yeah so uh no wait are you
34:11 - just doing print and then you're gonna
34:13 - put please like and open yeah because if
34:15 - you have a look in the program if I like
34:19 - because it continues on right if I press
34:21 - one and then like add in an apple it
34:25 - says please select an option again so
34:28 - that's separate from that first welcome
34:30 - message like that first welcome message
34:34 - is just a print statement and then later
34:36 - on we'll add the please select an option
34:37 - thing go free
34:55 - [Music]
34:57 - what is this and then do you remember
35:05 - how we did a new line like with tile /
35:08 - yup so if you don't want to keep like
35:11 - writing print things you can do it all
35:13 - in one with the slash and then do we
35:17 - just put the slash on the end yep so you
35:20 - just put slash on the end and then you
35:22 - can keep typing okay wait it's a back
35:25 - cord / yes I think that my gosh
35:30 - and how oh wait what's your replace
35:40 - dialog which dialog sorry I actually
35:45 - opened something alright it was replaced
35:48 - and mm-hmm
35:57 - and then you can keep doing it all like
35:59 - with the end thing but I might just do
36:01 - this in a new print statement just so
36:03 - that it's like a bit neater huh I might
36:07 - just wait do you have to do two n/a on
36:16 - the end enough no print you can but
36:22 - because the print line automatically
36:24 - does it in a new line oh so like you
36:27 - could do it by just like print this
36:29 - print this print list but it's just if
36:31 - you wanted to do it all in one you can
36:34 - use that in
36:36 - [Music]
36:57 - so it's adding displaying clearing and
37:01 - then quick and is it and do we just
37:05 - normally is it normal that we leave the
37:07 - line before the slaps then do what do
37:14 - you mean by lines I do you mean like we
37:16 - made a lot yeah we leave some space yeah
37:19 - um you don't have to leave this place I
37:22 - just leave the space just so it's easy
37:23 - for me to read it when I'm looking okay
37:26 - but it doesn't matter if you don't leave
37:28 - this place it just means like there'll
37:31 - be a space before it goes into the next
37:33 - line but you don't really see that in
37:36 - the Python program so it doesn't matter
37:38 - too much yeah I'm just gonna once you've
37:47 - done that just quickly save what was
37:53 - free sorry free water was clear your
37:56 - shopping list okay for always quit exist
38:15 - exit this program yep and then mmm okay
38:34 - so you know how you us is there
38:37 - different like if you add the space
38:39 - before the new line thing yeah they're
38:43 - the I additive space before and after so
38:46 - if you look at my program it has like a
38:48 - space before and after so it just
38:50 - depends on how you want it to look I
38:52 - forgotten like before here Oh what do
38:57 - you mean by that
38:58 - okay so do you see how can you see my
39:00 - program yeah so like every time I have a
39:03 - new line do you see how like 2 3 & 4
39:05 - have a space in front of it yeah that's
39:07 - just because I went flash
39:09 - in space and then the next thing where
39:12 - is the first one I just I didn't do a
39:14 - face I just started I like right away so
39:17 - if I ask something so how do we take off
39:22 - wait so do you take off the space after
39:25 - the end or before your slash after the
39:28 - end so if you don't want that space to
39:31 - be there you like take away the space
39:32 - otherwise Python things you want this
39:34 - week to be good so like it will be slash
39:37 - an demonstrate away to or whatever you
39:39 - and what about what about the space the
39:45 - space before the slash doesn't really
39:47 - matter because you can't actually see it
39:50 - so it's okay before the flash is like
39:52 - this thing but because it's a space and
39:55 - it's at the end of the line you don't
39:56 - notice it it's just if you make a new
39:59 - line and then have a space then it's
40:00 - more noticeable okay so yep so you have
40:05 - that done if you want you can just run
40:07 - it to see yeah
40:17 - [Music]
40:25 - sorry but then I just have to try and
40:27 - find a place to save it that some make
40:31 - sure it's somewhere you remember listen
40:44 - sorry program also just make sure if you
40:53 - had that line of code you know how
40:55 - you've said file equals open or
40:57 - something yeah you might want to just
40:59 - comment it out for now
41:01 - oh man they close it okay cool yeah
41:03 - because if you open it and then don't
41:05 - close it it might cause some issues they
41:08 - turn sideway I am just I'm just gonna
41:15 - add a slash and AH after the first one
41:21 - so that looks like you're one of it
41:23 - oh yeah yeah I might do that that's it
41:26 - lastly like a double-double fashion
41:29 - mistake here
41:30 - hi I'm a shopping list and how can I
41:36 - help you so you might need a double
41:39 - slash okay yep I see one problem there I
41:42 - can do that okay let's check it out
41:45 - right I did not I don't remember
41:50 - it's always good to like test it even if
41:52 - like what we did was just a small change
41:54 - it's always good to run it like it
41:57 - straight after that so you know how do I
42:03 - actually do stuff okay no I see you know
42:07 - can you add two slashes yep yes you can
42:11 - you can add all of them anyone so you
42:14 - just do slash in again as and if you
42:17 - want another space yeah okay okay yeah I
42:22 - have it
42:22 - wait what how you want it really I might
42:27 - do it a bit sorry take seven are you
42:30 - okay that's fine hey everybody how long
42:33 - you want you ready yeah it's like so the
42:36 - next thing we want to do is we want to
42:38 - ask them like please select an option
42:40 - and then again just remember it keeps
42:44 - like doing it so we need like if we want
42:46 - to keep asking to use or something I'll
42:48 - keep running the favor input but you
42:50 - have to put input there yep so I'd have
42:52 - to put input to ask it so like input but
42:57 - also we want to save the input so tell
43:00 - me how I do that yeah we have to do the
43:03 - variable equals input your are we gonna
43:05 - call the variable so we could call it
43:07 - something like choice because it's like
43:09 - saving us whichever choice a choice is
43:13 - equal to input and now in porch
43:17 - please select an option please
43:26 - see a shear and just remember so with
43:36 - the input thing like it puts the cursor
43:38 - right after your text so if you want
43:41 - there to be a space off the please
43:43 - select an option you have to add that
43:44 - space there like before the quotation
43:47 - mark finishes because otherwise when you
43:50 - type it'll be right next to like the
43:51 - letter n because it'll be like please
43:54 - select an option I will be right next to
43:56 - that semicolon mm-hmm if that makes
43:58 - sense
44:04 - yep and another thing we want to add is
44:10 - in our program because you want to keep
44:13 - like be able to keep adding or removing
44:15 - or like just keep doing different
44:17 - options so what's something we need to
44:19 - add to make this thing repeat we need
44:26 - forever
44:27 - yep forever do you know do you remember
44:29 - how to type it with Python yes wait give
44:34 - me second sorry that's fine finish what
44:37 - yes I believe it is while true yep
44:41 - exactly
44:42 - so while true and then make sure to tab
44:47 - that choice thing inside so that it
44:50 - knows that's part of the while loop okay
45:03 - so you can run it if you want just to
45:06 - check it but by the way and then oh wait
45:10 - oh okay
45:12 - it does wait till your so it has to be
45:18 - in the while loop the choice yep so the
45:21 - choice on anything I see what you mean
45:23 - again
45:24 - yeah yes so like that welcome message
45:26 - just as like happens once which is why
45:29 - we just did print and then the choice
45:31 - was just a while
45:33 - wait this nope famous again this is this
45:40 - it's a bit fiddly cuz anthalie okay the
45:44 - problem is just because you have so much
45:46 - in one print yeah it does that you have
45:49 - to go to the end yeah
45:51 - so you can do them in individual print
45:54 - as well it just it's just a different
45:58 - way of doing it you can also format your
46:02 - page
46:04 - whoopsie okay I made a number see if
46:08 - it's just so hard be like okay you want
46:11 - I think I might have to just large it so
46:14 - I think you can also edit the look of
46:17 - your page by okay there we go fish
46:22 - really enter okay I got it
46:24 - sorry about that oh yeah so this is why
46:31 - we separated like the print and the
46:33 - input statements because so I I got it
46:37 - out to Walter you selected option mm-hmm
46:39 - okay what's those invented do you know a
46:46 - way because I mean I know this might be
46:49 - a bit new to ask but if you come format
46:52 - it asks you if you can change the in bit
46:55 - region or Pullman out Regent uncommon is
47:00 - there something that you can do to make
47:01 - it short term as I'm like yeah because
47:05 - they always have to type for and
47:06 - sometimes I get confusing your like to
47:09 - type in for like spaces yeah I mean it's
47:13 - good it's still okay no that's a fine
47:15 - question one thing you can do is you can
47:17 - press tab instead of space but we're so
47:21 - like on your keyboard I think it so I
47:24 - see it on like before caps look if you
47:27 - just press tab it automatically puts it
47:29 - in that thing okay thank you yeah and
47:32 - another thing is if your text is like if
47:35 - you press ENTER straight after your
47:37 - while loop it automatically indents it
47:40 - as well so again my cursor here but yeah
47:43 - okay so then even choice hmm
47:51 - it's the exclamation mark before equals
47:54 - it is isn't it uh we want to check if
47:57 - choice is equal to one first
48:00 - are you trying to check if it's not
48:01 - equal to something oh okay I guess yeah
48:05 - that's what I okay that's what I was
48:07 - gonna go check but it makes more sense
48:08 - the way you're doing it and make it so
48:10 - you can check if it is equal to one
48:12 - equals one then wait is it normal that
48:17 - you're putting them in brackets so okay
48:21 - sorry I'm used to other programming
48:23 - languages yeah
48:24 - but thank you for pointing that out yeah
48:27 - choice equals equals one and so just
48:31 - remember when you with like an input
48:34 - with the input function what does it
48:36 - save like your value as do you know what
48:38 - type of data it saves it I was like I
48:40 - believe it which it generally say - a
48:43 - string yeah so what we can do is we can
48:46 - say if choice is equal to one as a
48:48 - string yeah but it's already straight
48:51 - isn't it so yeah no sorry I'm saying in
48:54 - this if statement if we go if choice is
48:57 - equal to one just like the normal number
49:00 - one then it's they're not equal to each
49:02 - other because one is a string and one is
49:05 - a number so we have to check if choice
49:07 - is equal to look like one as a string
49:11 - yeah if that makes them yep hey okay so
49:16 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna do
49:18 - this a bit differently so we're gonna
49:19 - have
49:20 - do you remember functions sorry yep yep
49:25 - so we're going to make each little thing
49:27 - a definition so like inserting into a
49:30 - file as a definition removing etc etc so
49:34 - if choice is equal to one we want to add
49:37 - something to the shopping list yeah we
49:39 - can
49:42 - at the top shop then we can just go shop
49:46 - I show up this ad hold it and then
49:54 - mm-hmm now don't need any variables
49:57 - right I mean any of your amethyst noumea
50:00 - no no we don't cuz it's just like the
50:02 - one thing so make sure when you're
50:04 - defining your function you do it before
50:07 - that while loop okay we want to go death
50:10 - I might call it insert some now this is
50:35 - where we yeah
50:35 - oh sorry what do you think we would
50:38 - probably do like choice 1 equals input
50:40 - and then it's drag if choice 1 equals
50:45 - what so yeah we'll just go in shocking
50:48 - right ad choice 1 equals employee
50:52 - important choice yes so what we want to
50:55 - do is we can also like open our shopping
50:59 - list
50:59 - so this time this is where we're doing
51:01 - like the append thing with the file
51:03 - shouldn't we open the shopping this
51:05 - before or so we'll do it each in the
51:09 - functions because inserting the function
51:11 - we just want to add to the shopping list
51:13 - open I think yeah
51:17 - no isn't it file open yes you call
51:20 - shopping list sure thing and it's an
51:24 - equal sign just equals and now whatever
51:30 - you want to call the file so G shopping
51:35 - let's stop txt I might call it that
51:38 - dope King
51:48 - if it's okay I'd like to get up and then
51:53 - okay yep so I continue okay so comma and
51:57 - then do you want to which one do you
52:00 - want to use do you want to use like
52:01 - write a pen I think we're using up the
52:04 - hand aren't we yep what I use I make
52:10 - sure the a is also in so now what we
52:18 - want to do is we want to sorry
52:20 - question yes if it for example in one of
52:23 - them it says app end can you then change
52:28 - it to write do you mean up here can you
52:32 - change it to write so no I mean like if
52:35 - if for example insert its and then if it
52:41 - was choice - would it be all right like
52:46 - do you mean like in a different function
52:48 - no I mean like if you're just using yeah
52:50 - can you change throughout the code yes
52:52 - you can
52:53 - so what you can do is like in this
52:55 - little function here what we're going to
52:57 - do is we're going to open it in append
52:59 - mode do our stuff
53:00 - and then close it so we're done with
53:02 - that section so later in the code we can
53:05 - open it in a different mode okay so
53:07 - shopping list equals open mm-hmm
53:11 - and then what would we do then we would
53:13 - go how right yep so before writing it we
53:17 - always need to ask the user what they
53:20 - want to add right yep yep so what we
53:24 - could say is like two choice tonight Tim
53:28 - oh yeah choice two so yeah item maybe
53:31 - like it's like the thing to add what if
53:35 - it runs again when again would item not
53:41 - be saved so item is just a variable we
53:45 - make here so every time it runs again it
53:48 - like reset reset yeah so it saves on top
53:52 - of it kind of so like item equals Apple
53:54 - then later on item might equal milk yes
53:57 - I turn equals in which
54:02 - and I we could say something like you
54:08 - like and hey and we're almost running
54:16 - out of time so we'll quickly finish this
54:18 - inset one and then we can finish the
54:20 - rest of it next week okay yep so we have
54:30 - item yep now we actually need to write
54:33 - item into our file into that shopping
54:37 - list file so this is where you go like a
54:41 - shopping list stop right yep so we want
54:48 - to add something right are we wonder
54:59 - she's referring to shopping list are you
55:00 - referring to the file or to the parable
55:03 - so up the variable so I might rename it
55:08 - to like file just so that we don't get
55:11 - confused and then you would write down
55:13 - in spite of it
55:14 - yep file so file is the variable name
55:16 - and then yes so we use this actual like
55:20 - the actual text file name we never use
55:22 - that apart from at that beginning part
55:24 - so then we just do shopping list don't
55:27 - write him right I me up
55:29 - I tried yep and because it's actually a
55:32 - variable we don't need to put it in
55:33 - quotation marks and then what we might
55:36 - need to do is just add a new line after
55:38 - that like we didn't have to put weight
55:41 - we'd only have to put in quotation marks
55:43 - we don't because it's a variable so like
55:46 - you know how when you print stuff you
55:48 - just go print the variable name you
55:51 - still put it in about you still put in
55:53 - brackets yet you put in brackets you
55:55 - just don't put like oh okay things that
55:57 - make it green I get yeah yeah because
56:00 - otherwise it will write the actual word
56:02 - item yes okay yep okay school and what
56:05 - we want to do is we just want to write
56:07 - item and then just add a new line so
56:10 - that next time we want to add something
56:12 - it's already on the new line so to do
56:15 - that
56:16 - you know how in print when you want to
56:18 - like add a variable plus some text you'd
56:21 - go plus okay and then so flashing okay
56:32 - now we can go back into our while loop
56:35 - and then with that if statement we can
56:36 - say if it's choice one we just want to
56:40 - do that insert all function whatever you
56:44 - thing was gold yep and then run it and
56:59 - see what happens
57:08 - add an extra space so just test it with
57:13 - one from now if you want to add a bunch
57:20 - of stuff you can keep nope it
57:23 - I must have built something incorrectly
57:26 - it's not very happy okay arrows it says
57:30 - something okay I see the ball you say
57:32 - bubble yep I was missing up being one of
57:35 - them I was missing a pain one of them oh
57:39 - yeah so sometimes it's easier to have
57:41 - that variable name of the file as a
57:43 - smaller name like file or something okay
57:47 - here we go
57:48 - one enter what we'd like to add to me
57:56 - it's like an option one one three ones
58:07 - yeah so now like once you've added a few
58:10 - things you can go into your new text
58:13 - file one eggs one
58:24 - so I'm adding some yes coffee I know I
58:37 - just coffee okay and then close it close
58:44 - it and then you should see like shopping
58:47 - list txt or something are you see a
58:50 - shopping list it doesn't say don't cheat
58:51 - Arthur okay euros might display it
58:54 - differently but not like you know I got
58:57 - everything okay cool um so we might just
59:00 - leave it at that
59:01 - and I'm finish it off next week because
59:03 - the lesson is over but do you have any
59:06 - other questions
59:07 - nope did it make sense so far yep did it
59:11 - make a bit more sense now that we
59:13 - actually like started making a program
59:15 - okay cool that's good anyway I'll see
59:17 - you next week then see you have a good
59:20 - week

Cleaned transcript:

so again if you don't want your face recorded you can turn off your webcam part so excited line up okay I don't mind cool so let me share my screen again so yeah we're just gonna review like the files thing again cuz we did that a couple of weeks ago and because we're gonna make a project with that you can just open up I don't know if you save that project from a couple of weeks I think it was just like a few line boy he was no I think it's okay we found that I like you know I'm still okay okay no I don't have it I can I think I have to restart it's okay no that's enough I got I got it actually okay you found it it's okay cuz it's only like lines anyway yeah yes I was just gonna quickly explain it you know sorry that's your screen I develop on my tree right okay that's okay you can just open a new file close we're just gonna be emulating mine anyway cuz we're just gonna like go through it again okay so let me know when you have that open yep sorry I have it open okay open so with file so the reason we can like we use like files like saving and writing and reading file in Python projects is so like the main reason this usually when you make a program like so far all the programs are made like as soon as you close it you just like nothing is safe run it again it's just like starting from you so that's why we save the pole do you remember this line that says like yeah open o file don't open them yep so file equals open okay yes open yep and then you have the brackets opening and closing brackets use the normal round brackets and then inside that we can tell what type of file it is so I'll just quickly say so to like bring in a file into a Python project and save it as a variable we use this bit of code so like the open the open file doesn't actually like open a file in the like it doesn't open up like that txt file it's just saying within this program we kind of want to open it in a certain way so do you remember the three different modes so yes yep read mmhmm action right yes good job so do you remember the difference between them yes yep right you could you could add things on to it but then whenever you restarted it every set mmhmm read I believe you can add to it and it will stay like that as well oh no wait exactly kind of so you are right with the right one um do you know what append this know exactly sorry yeah that's like no that's fine that's completely fine so we'll just quickly go with right again just to like test our memory so when we go file equals open it's just saving it in a variable in our program called file so like that's the variable name so this can be anything so this could be like you know variable name things just to get this straight mmhm the name of the actual file is in file yes so that's not the name of the actual file so this is the name of the variable so later on in our program if you want to do something with the file instead of calling it like the file name we can call it by this variable name the your current so where we put the actual file name is inside the brackets so if we want to call it something like test file again and we want to save it as a text file so we can go up txt we do that so this is the actual name of the file this is just like a variable which we kind of saved the file in in our probe in our program so we can use it later on so what we're saying is we're having this file name like it's a text file called test file and so we'll start with right so we want to open it in the right mode so you do a comma and then you type in a W okay so if you want just quickly save that and then run it if you want so I have this one last time I'm just gonna delete it so what it will do is when you open it like this in write mode if it can't find any file name with this name so if I can't find it in this computer where your Python project is saved it will make a new file so when you run your program now you should be able to see that yep so I just have to save it somewhere so yeah that's fine okay how's it run does it run okay give it a bit okay it's and now oh okay you might have got a I got an error you got it oh yes I got it nope you got it I got it cool I think okay I just typed something wrong let me run it again okay but did you get a file like just a blank text file that opened up so whatever whichever folder on your computer like wherever you saved this Python project there might be a file called test file something new yeah I it is there I see it because I I'm on it okay you're on it so right now it's just empty cuz it just made an empty file yeah yep was it not assigned to operate it okay I'm just gonna call this file okay so with this thing with the line of code you know how I said we could be like a call it variable name or something like that it I'm pretty sure you have to call it file so because it's like a set thing about opening and closing files you have to use a variable name file okay that way to me sorry what do you mean by that so you know how right now in your code you have file is equal to open or something yeah you know how I said this word file is just a variable name it's not the actual name of our file yeah so then I I told you like you could change it to something else like variable I look something like that so I think because like opening and closing files uses this function like open and it's like a set function you can only save it to a variable old file like that's the name cuz if I try it like this with a different variable name and try run it I get an error I should I don't know hey never mind sorry for confusing you you just can't have hat um dashes in your verbal name so it's quite thin you can't have that so that's why I did it with if you have something that has two words so I have a variable file for example you just like do it in something called camel case have you heard of camel case before No so camel case is like do you see how this is two different words yeah camel case means it's all lowercase except for like the next word that you're joining across did you see how like in is name yep that's what camel case is so it's like you start every word with a capital letter when it's like smushed together except the first one so if like this name had another one you can be like hello like if that was one variable name that's camel case that's a different topic anyway what so when you run this file open it doesn't actually open any files in the background it just makes it so you should see that and again you can change this to whatever type of file you want so for example if you are somehow later on like making a HTML file and if you wanted to add like a HTML page with Python code you can just save it as dot HTML so that would save it as a HTML file so try change that on yours and then run it then if you go back into where your files are saved you should see like something called test file a testing file don't HTML this time yep I actually have two test files now you have two test file so yep so one was like the one you made last time that's like with that's a normal text file it's just text and this one is now a HTML file so if we actually had HTML code later in it if you like clicked on it it would open up like the website but right now it would just be empty cuz it's nothing so yeah you can just save things so it doesn't just have to be like plain text it depends what type of file you want to save it as okay anyway back to the point we just go back to text or yeah so maybe we go back to text txt so with the right mode like you said you can write things in it and so do you remember how we write things in it is it possibly I want to say after a friend so that's one way we can write in it so append is like you add something on to what's in the file so you can do that with this actually but what you need to do is you need to change the mode so right now we're in like right mode if you want to append to the file you need to change it to a so what a pen does is it remembers what we already have in our file and then add something on to the end if we do it in right it would just replace everything with what we write again so like let me show you so what we need to do is we need to get our variable name we need to go file dot write and then we can write some come write some text so we just have brackets and if this were HTML how would we do it okay so I can quickly show you so do you know some basic HTML tiny bit kind of it all right that's okay so why don't we quickly change our file back to an HTML file so we can test it out so file dot write what we could do is we could make a HTML like you know HTML tags yeah yeah so generally we need to put it in like a haitch tml like a big tag like that and then I'm just pressing into a few times just so it's easy to see and then what you might need to do is type in like buddy okay wait maybe it won't present yeah so a pop like oh sorry what was your question is there nothing before the last line no that's just a five innovative nope sorry okay say Papa in no short way so you take up imports in one of the shorts one of the shorts in the nationality you can't it's gonna be hard to find it it's in one of the shorts of the laundry sure sorry about that that's all good okay so these are just some basic HTML tags but what do you do app how do you actually coat something in like yeah so with HTML well I'll just finish writing this first to show you so you know how much HTML you have like your different tags so you have like HTML tags body tag and then like you might want to add like a header so a header could be like h1 and then we can type in some text like this is a header and then we close the h1 so if you have a look like wait whoopsie oh wait I think it we're missing something do we need a smash after the HTML yes so that's on this side here so with oh yeah so which HTML tags you have one that's like normal and then when you want to close it at the end you add a slash to the end one like if I just press ENTER to show you I just press the Enter just to show you what I'm talking about I think there's a way to do a multiline thing and yeah so I just didn't enter just so that you can see like the rough structure of it I'm just ignoring the quotation one spinel but like this is a basic idea of what like a basic page might look like so we just have like HTML tag and then a body tags and then it's the heading it's a pretty basic like you know just some simple tags and then we're just writing it into the file I'm just putting it back on one line for that it's just neat me so let me know when you've typed in yes so you know I was let me just check yes yeah I was typing oh wait how do you I put in something actually different it's coming from the book him doing a hyperlink yep that's fine do you know how it doesn't seem to be working I did HTML then I did a curve equals HTTP then ww google.com mmhmm and then I called a Google I did a in the slash and then HTML but it seems to be giving me an error ofc I see there it's an embarrassing error and so good I forgot to put the brackets all right yeah so with this so python like when you put it as a string like python doesn't know that it's HTML code or anything like that so you won't get any code relating I mean any errors relating to like the HTML stuff the errors will be like something in the Python file like if you think so it's not finished but how if it's not showing anything what do we do so doesn't seem to be showing anything okay so whereas in when you run it yep yep so have you refreshed the page as well yes a unique turning it right okay wait hands and I'll run also run module and then you need to open the one that's the HTML file yeah hmm yep okay yet so it might just because there's like a there might be a different way okay yeah so this is with Python so we're writing out text but you know how I don't know if you remember from last week every time you like use this open function when you're done with you need to do something else do you know yet close yep so we'll try fail mmhm don't close your file equal file dot close and then brackets so that just tells our program okay we're done writing the file you can finish it off or whatever like it doesn't keep waiting for you to type more so okay so now make sure to run it first and then check it out so that well okay I'm okay it has to text but it's not showing the hyperlink okay so that might be like issue with like the way you did HTML code so let me have a look so the hyperlinks make sure when you have like a hey trip so like wwhen ma know yeah I put it says to put them in one quotation marks and yep I did do two HTTP and make sure at the end you also have like the a slash a slash HTML you want to quickly share your screen so I can have it look okay sure but also after this will go back to the Python stuff yes I know that's fun I was just it's good so that you can just get an idea on how to write the files like that's what I have if you want I can make it okay I see what it is so you know you have the slashes like you have a like the slashes should be before the a and before the HTML so you you know you have it after the word oh yeah I see it yeah yes I another thing with like HTML and stuff is even if you have an error it won't like it's not like Python it won't say there's an error in this line so it won't work it just tries to like show the text normally because it's more for like display okay wait maybe if I go okay fish also when you ran it so when you did file run it should say like the file name so you might have closed it a bit early not sure well maybe just try and run it again oh I see it AC ah there we go so do you mind if I stop sharing yep yeah I'll share my screen now so it will stop yours so yeah so that's just an example on life it doesn't just have to be text files that you're writing into it could be HTML files like and you can edit different sort of stuff so I'll just quickly go go so that was right so if you like try edit your text so go back to your Python program so right now your says Google or something should I change that text just like something else like this is Google or something like so right now like your file was like the only thing was like that Google link but now you change it to this is Google so because this is in right what do you think will happen wait what do you mean by sorry so ok sorry so right now like if you look at my one so my text like I have a heading and it's cold this is a header yeah and now like I ran that and I open it and that's what it says but now I'm editing my Python program and I changed it to say this is another header so if when I save this file and then run it and then open up microfiche this HTML page I think it's will say I think it'll say this is another just simply not just simply about nothing else yeah yep okay yes you're correct so if you wanted it to write it underneath it so if you wanted to keep I had already written before and write the new line underneath it do you know what we might need to do yes the slash not exactly so I'll show you what I mean so when I run this you said it will just say this is another header like another header and it will like delete what's already there right yeah yep so if we don't want to delete it we would need option yeah exactly so we would need a pin so to do that you just change the W to an A so that way it still remembers what you had last time and it just adds on to it so like if you're playing a game like over a few days instead of like refreshing the skull every time you might want to keep it and save it so you can test it if you want but no okay what exactly is a project you want you to do yep so I'll show you that after so just like I'm just quickly going over this stuff just so we have an idea and what to do I'll show you the project now actually so it's just like a it's like a shopping list program but if I just so what it does is I think I might have showed you this shopping this program before but this time it actually saves what you have yeah give me a second is just loading being a little sir okay so can you see my screen sir yep yep okay so just saying welcome to your shelf English and then I think I showed you like how you can add stuff to your shopping list I can put one and I might want to add an apple to my list all right let me run it again I think I typed in L instead of one but basically with this program you can either add stuff to a shopping list like view your shopping list delete your shopping list or just quit the game so that's like the options one to the info so should I just should I just delete it or what we have right now yeah so just delete what you have right now I'll just try and get this up again to show you one second okay yep so it's saying how can I help you like press one to add something for us too to do this etc etc so if I press 1 press ENTER they okay there seems to be some issue with this code I tried it like a second ago okay let me try sorry about that I tested it just the whole and it did work I'm not sure what's happening now let me try get it up here instead okay so can you still see my screen yes yep so I'm just running it to here and said so what I'm doing is I just pressed one to add something to the list and I'll just add an apple and then I might want to add something else and I'll add a pair and now if I want to see what's in my shopping list I press 2 and it gives me my list right so now I just want to quit the game so right now I just have apple and pear in my list if I press full and enter it will click the game now if I go back to my files where they're saved do you see how it added something called shopping list dot to you if I click on that it has my shopping list so it has apple and pear so now because I've closed the program so now if I run the program again if I straight away sorry will it restart it and it doesn't restart it cuz the file is there now if I press number 2 which displays the shopping list it tells me I have apple and pear and the first time you try it does it have nothing in it yep so I'll delete this file and show you because the first time I try it the file does not exist so if I try to display it it has nothing in it so so what should be should I just start with file a lot right yes so what we need to do is we need to like yes oh okay let's just open up idle we want to start with yeah filed up right actually filed a pen because if it's there already we want to add to that little file we don't want to replace everything so file now shopping list equals right umm yeah so you can call it shopping list or you can still call it file so that in the program you know that's the file polls open what am i doing roughly open low and open and then right and open it and then shopping list yep shopping list dot txt because we want to save it as a text file King yes G and if I were to Chum others can I ask something else yeah chuckles if you order like write something from the file not from Pythian on App hand would it stay there well let's test it out so you mean like if I go in if I actually open that it's not anymore if I open the shopping list and add like another thing like another me know if you yeah if you open the shopping list and add something yeah okay that's me here we'll be there next time yes it should be so let me just create the shopping list again because I deleted it so I'm just gonna add Apple and pretend that was already there so now what you're asking is if I actually open the not the Python file the shopping list file and added something else yep so let me add in my milk maybe and save it you want to see if it would be there yes please yep well the answer is we'll find out so we want to display our shopping list so we have apple and milk so yes it does appear in our shopping list alright so how it does that is with the other function the read function because it reads everything in the file and then it shows us all right so what do we do then shopping shopping list equals open shopping list of takes P happen mmhmm so we might need to just keep that line of code there for now but we might need to actually do some other stuff for us because we actually need to make a shopping list program so you know how when I run it we actually need to do the other steps as well so what's the first thing it asks us when we run the program well what does it do it prints it prints like everything you can do yep so let's start with that first as well so we'll say hello welcome to your shopping list how can I help you doing print no isn't it print input no is it input I forgot input so if you want to save what the like if you want the user to type something after the line new yeah like yeah so uh no wait are you just doing print and then you're gonna put please like and open yeah because if you have a look in the program if I like because it continues on right if I press one and then like add in an apple it says please select an option again so that's separate from that first welcome message like that first welcome message is just a print statement and then later on we'll add the please select an option thing go free what is this and then do you remember how we did a new line like with tile / yup so if you don't want to keep like writing print things you can do it all in one with the slash and then do we just put the slash on the end yep so you just put slash on the end and then you can keep typing okay wait it's a back cord / yes I think that my gosh and how oh wait what's your replace dialog which dialog sorry I actually opened something alright it was replaced and mmhmm and then you can keep doing it all like with the end thing but I might just do this in a new print statement just so that it's like a bit neater huh I might just wait do you have to do two n/a on the end enough no print you can but because the print line automatically does it in a new line oh so like you could do it by just like print this print this print list but it's just if you wanted to do it all in one you can use that in so it's adding displaying clearing and then quick and is it and do we just normally is it normal that we leave the line before the slaps then do what do you mean by lines I do you mean like we made a lot yeah we leave some space yeah um you don't have to leave this place I just leave the space just so it's easy for me to read it when I'm looking okay but it doesn't matter if you don't leave this place it just means like there'll be a space before it goes into the next line but you don't really see that in the Python program so it doesn't matter too much yeah I'm just gonna once you've done that just quickly save what was free sorry free water was clear your shopping list okay for always quit exist exit this program yep and then mmm okay so you know how you us is there different like if you add the space before the new line thing yeah they're the I additive space before and after so if you look at my program it has like a space before and after so it just depends on how you want it to look I forgotten like before here Oh what do you mean by that okay so do you see how can you see my program yeah so like every time I have a new line do you see how like 2 3 & 4 have a space in front of it yeah that's just because I went flash in space and then the next thing where is the first one I just I didn't do a face I just started I like right away so if I ask something so how do we take off wait so do you take off the space after the end or before your slash after the end so if you don't want that space to be there you like take away the space otherwise Python things you want this week to be good so like it will be slash an demonstrate away to or whatever you and what about what about the space the space before the slash doesn't really matter because you can't actually see it so it's okay before the flash is like this thing but because it's a space and it's at the end of the line you don't notice it it's just if you make a new line and then have a space then it's more noticeable okay so yep so you have that done if you want you can just run it to see yeah sorry but then I just have to try and find a place to save it that some make sure it's somewhere you remember listen sorry program also just make sure if you had that line of code you know how you've said file equals open or something yeah you might want to just comment it out for now oh man they close it okay cool yeah because if you open it and then don't close it it might cause some issues they turn sideway I am just I'm just gonna add a slash and AH after the first one so that looks like you're one of it oh yeah yeah I might do that that's it lastly like a doubledouble fashion mistake here hi I'm a shopping list and how can I help you so you might need a double slash okay yep I see one problem there I can do that okay let's check it out right I did not I don't remember it's always good to like test it even if like what we did was just a small change it's always good to run it like it straight after that so you know how do I actually do stuff okay no I see you know can you add two slashes yep yes you can you can add all of them anyone so you just do slash in again as and if you want another space yeah okay okay yeah I have it wait what how you want it really I might do it a bit sorry take seven are you okay that's fine hey everybody how long you want you ready yeah it's like so the next thing we want to do is we want to ask them like please select an option and then again just remember it keeps like doing it so we need like if we want to keep asking to use or something I'll keep running the favor input but you have to put input there yep so I'd have to put input to ask it so like input but also we want to save the input so tell me how I do that yeah we have to do the variable equals input your are we gonna call the variable so we could call it something like choice because it's like saving us whichever choice a choice is equal to input and now in porch please select an option please see a shear and just remember so with the input thing like it puts the cursor right after your text so if you want there to be a space off the please select an option you have to add that space there like before the quotation mark finishes because otherwise when you type it'll be right next to like the letter n because it'll be like please select an option I will be right next to that semicolon mmhmm if that makes sense yep and another thing we want to add is in our program because you want to keep like be able to keep adding or removing or like just keep doing different options so what's something we need to add to make this thing repeat we need forever yep forever do you know do you remember how to type it with Python yes wait give me second sorry that's fine finish what yes I believe it is while true yep exactly so while true and then make sure to tab that choice thing inside so that it knows that's part of the while loop okay so you can run it if you want just to check it but by the way and then oh wait oh okay it does wait till your so it has to be in the while loop the choice yep so the choice on anything I see what you mean again yeah yes so like that welcome message just as like happens once which is why we just did print and then the choice was just a while wait this nope famous again this is this it's a bit fiddly cuz anthalie okay the problem is just because you have so much in one print yeah it does that you have to go to the end yeah so you can do them in individual print as well it just it's just a different way of doing it you can also format your page whoopsie okay I made a number see if it's just so hard be like okay you want I think I might have to just large it so I think you can also edit the look of your page by okay there we go fish really enter okay I got it sorry about that oh yeah so this is why we separated like the print and the input statements because so I I got it out to Walter you selected option mmhmm okay what's those invented do you know a way because I mean I know this might be a bit new to ask but if you come format it asks you if you can change the in bit region or Pullman out Regent uncommon is there something that you can do to make it short term as I'm like yeah because they always have to type for and sometimes I get confusing your like to type in for like spaces yeah I mean it's good it's still okay no that's a fine question one thing you can do is you can press tab instead of space but we're so like on your keyboard I think it so I see it on like before caps look if you just press tab it automatically puts it in that thing okay thank you yeah and another thing is if your text is like if you press ENTER straight after your while loop it automatically indents it as well so again my cursor here but yeah okay so then even choice hmm it's the exclamation mark before equals it is isn't it uh we want to check if choice is equal to one first are you trying to check if it's not equal to something oh okay I guess yeah that's what I okay that's what I was gonna go check but it makes more sense the way you're doing it and make it so you can check if it is equal to one equals one then wait is it normal that you're putting them in brackets so okay sorry I'm used to other programming languages yeah but thank you for pointing that out yeah choice equals equals one and so just remember when you with like an input with the input function what does it save like your value as do you know what type of data it saves it I was like I believe it which it generally say a string yeah so what we can do is we can say if choice is equal to one as a string yeah but it's already straight isn't it so yeah no sorry I'm saying in this if statement if we go if choice is equal to one just like the normal number one then it's they're not equal to each other because one is a string and one is a number so we have to check if choice is equal to look like one as a string yeah if that makes them yep hey okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna do this a bit differently so we're gonna have do you remember functions sorry yep yep so we're going to make each little thing a definition so like inserting into a file as a definition removing etc etc so if choice is equal to one we want to add something to the shopping list yeah we can at the top shop then we can just go shop I show up this ad hold it and then mmhmm now don't need any variables right I mean any of your amethyst noumea no no we don't cuz it's just like the one thing so make sure when you're defining your function you do it before that while loop okay we want to go death I might call it insert some now this is where we yeah oh sorry what do you think we would probably do like choice 1 equals input and then it's drag if choice 1 equals what so yeah we'll just go in shocking right ad choice 1 equals employee important choice yes so what we want to do is we can also like open our shopping list so this time this is where we're doing like the append thing with the file shouldn't we open the shopping this before or so we'll do it each in the functions because inserting the function we just want to add to the shopping list open I think yeah no isn't it file open yes you call shopping list sure thing and it's an equal sign just equals and now whatever you want to call the file so G shopping let's stop txt I might call it that dope King if it's okay I'd like to get up and then okay yep so I continue okay so comma and then do you want to which one do you want to use do you want to use like write a pen I think we're using up the hand aren't we yep what I use I make sure the a is also in so now what we want to do is we want to sorry question yes if it for example in one of them it says app end can you then change it to write do you mean up here can you change it to write so no I mean like if if for example insert its and then if it was choice would it be all right like do you mean like in a different function no I mean like if you're just using yeah can you change throughout the code yes you can so what you can do is like in this little function here what we're going to do is we're going to open it in append mode do our stuff and then close it so we're done with that section so later in the code we can open it in a different mode okay so shopping list equals open mmhmm and then what would we do then we would go how right yep so before writing it we always need to ask the user what they want to add right yep yep so what we could say is like two choice tonight Tim oh yeah choice two so yeah item maybe like it's like the thing to add what if it runs again when again would item not be saved so item is just a variable we make here so every time it runs again it like reset reset yeah so it saves on top of it kind of so like item equals Apple then later on item might equal milk yes I turn equals in which and I we could say something like you like and hey and we're almost running out of time so we'll quickly finish this inset one and then we can finish the rest of it next week okay yep so we have item yep now we actually need to write item into our file into that shopping list file so this is where you go like a shopping list stop right yep so we want to add something right are we wonder she's referring to shopping list are you referring to the file or to the parable so up the variable so I might rename it to like file just so that we don't get confused and then you would write down in spite of it yep file so file is the variable name and then yes so we use this actual like the actual text file name we never use that apart from at that beginning part so then we just do shopping list don't write him right I me up I tried yep and because it's actually a variable we don't need to put it in quotation marks and then what we might need to do is just add a new line after that like we didn't have to put weight we'd only have to put in quotation marks we don't because it's a variable so like you know how when you print stuff you just go print the variable name you still put it in about you still put in brackets yet you put in brackets you just don't put like oh okay things that make it green I get yeah yeah because otherwise it will write the actual word item yes okay yep okay school and what we want to do is we just want to write item and then just add a new line so that next time we want to add something it's already on the new line so to do that you know how in print when you want to like add a variable plus some text you'd go plus okay and then so flashing okay now we can go back into our while loop and then with that if statement we can say if it's choice one we just want to do that insert all function whatever you thing was gold yep and then run it and see what happens add an extra space so just test it with one from now if you want to add a bunch of stuff you can keep nope it I must have built something incorrectly it's not very happy okay arrows it says something okay I see the ball you say bubble yep I was missing up being one of them I was missing a pain one of them oh yeah so sometimes it's easier to have that variable name of the file as a smaller name like file or something okay here we go one enter what we'd like to add to me it's like an option one one three ones yeah so now like once you've added a few things you can go into your new text file one eggs one so I'm adding some yes coffee I know I just coffee okay and then close it close it and then you should see like shopping list txt or something are you see a shopping list it doesn't say don't cheat Arthur okay euros might display it differently but not like you know I got everything okay cool um so we might just leave it at that and I'm finish it off next week because the lesson is over but do you have any other questions nope did it make sense so far yep did it make a bit more sense now that we actually like started making a program okay cool that's good anyway I'll see you next week then see you have a good week
