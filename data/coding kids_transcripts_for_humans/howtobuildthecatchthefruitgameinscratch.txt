00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - welcome to coding kids today I will show
00:09 - you how to create the game catch the
00:11 - fruit first let's have a look at what
00:13 - happens in this game when we play it the
00:16 - player controls the bowl by pressing the
00:18 - left and right arrow keys different
00:21 - pieces of fruit glide down the screen
00:23 - automatically meaning they are not
00:25 - controlled by the player the player can
00:28 - move the bowl to catch the fruit if the
00:30 - ball catches a piece of fruit our fruit
00:33 - score increases by one if we drop a
00:36 - piece of fruit the game ends and the
00:38 - backdrop changes to game over if we
00:42 - catch all the fruit the game ends and
00:44 - the backdrop changes - you win now let's
00:48 - build this game there are five parts to
00:50 - this game one the bowl - the fruit three
00:55 - variables for you win five game over now
01:00 - let's start building one step at a time
01:03 - first let's start with a brand new
01:05 - project by clicking the create button on
01:08 - the home page you will see a new project
01:11 - open with the cat as the default sprite
01:13 - a sprite is a character or object we use
01:17 - in making computer programs for step one
01:20 - we want to add a bowl sprite right click
01:23 - on the cat sprite and press Delete to
01:25 - import a new sprite we can click on the
01:28 - miniature sprite icon and select a
01:30 - sprite from the sprite library I have
01:32 - selected the bowl sprite now we want to
01:35 - add code to our bowl sprite to begin our
01:38 - code we need an events block go to
01:40 - events and select the when green flag
01:43 - clicked block this means we will start
01:45 - our game when the green flag is clicked
01:48 - now place the sprite at the bottom left
01:50 - hand corner of your screen we want to
01:53 - make our bowl move left and right to
01:56 - move our bowl left and right we will use
01:58 - the left and right arrow keys we have
02:00 - already selected the when green flag
02:02 - clicked block for when the movement
02:05 - should start so we shouldn't use the
02:07 - when space key pressed block for the
02:09 - arrow keys instead we you see if there
02:12 - Blagh go to the control tab and drag -
02:15 - if dem blocks into the workspace now to
02:18 - make our bowl move left and right go to
02:21 - the sensing tab and select key space
02:24 - pressed add one of these into the top of
02:26 - each if then block to move with the left
02:29 - and right arrow keys we change space to
02:32 - left arrow and right arrow since we're
02:35 - moving left and right this means we are
02:38 - moving along the x-axis so we need the
02:41 - change X by 10 block get 2 of these into
02:46 - the workspace and add to your East M
02:48 - blocks remember to change 10 to negative
02:51 - 10 for left finally we need to add a
02:54 - forever loop find this in the control
02:56 - tab this means the computer will
02:58 - continue checking this condition now
03:01 - let's try it it works so step 2 we want
03:10 - to add fruit sprites to our game click
03:12 - on the minitor sprite icon again to
03:14 - import some new sprites I'm going to
03:17 - choose 4 fruits I have chosen an apple a
03:20 - banana an orange and a watermelon sprite
03:23 - but you can choose any type of sprite
03:25 - you like now let's add code to our
03:28 - sprites I will begin with the Apple
03:30 - sprite first we need an events block so
03:33 - go to events and select the when green
03:36 - flag clicked block for this game we want
03:39 - to make our apple sprite begin in the
03:41 - same position at the start of each game
03:43 - we can do this with the go to block in
03:46 - the motion category move your sprite to
03:49 - the position you wish it to start at at
03:51 - the top of the screen the go to block
03:53 - records this position now you can drag
03:56 - the go to block into your workspace and
03:59 - add it to your code when we start the
04:01 - game we want our Apple to be hidden
04:03 - before showing this gives the player
04:05 - time to prepare we can do this using the
04:08 - hide and show blocks you can find these
04:11 - in the looks tab drag them into your
04:14 - workspace placing the hide block first
04:17 - to make the Apple stay hidden before
04:19 - showing use the weight once x-block find
04:23 - this in the looks category and added to
04:25 - your hide
04:27 - now we want to add motion to our Apple
04:30 - so it falls found the screen however we
04:33 - don't just want our Apple to move
04:34 - downwards we want it to zigzag as it
04:37 - falls to zigzag on the way down we need
04:41 - to move to one side move down move to
04:44 - the other side and move down again we
04:47 - can do this using the change way by
04:49 - 10:00 and change X by 10 blocks in the
04:53 - motion category drag two of each of
04:56 - these blocks into your workspace we want
04:59 - to place them X Y X Y for the Y blocks
05:03 - change it to 10 to minus 10 so it will
05:06 - move downwards
05:07 - I want my Apple to move more slowly so I
05:10 - will change the minus 10 to minus 5 to
05:13 - make the Apple move lesson right change
05:16 - the 10 in the X blocks to 5 and minus 5
05:19 - for movement right and left to make
05:22 - these motions slower we can use the
05:25 - weight once X block find this block in
05:28 - the control category and a bit too each
05:30 - change Y block we don't want it to be
05:33 - too slow so change once X to 0.16
05:37 - finally we need a forever loop so these
05:40 - conditions are constantly checked find
05:43 - this in the control tab and place it
05:45 - around your change X by and change Y by
05:49 - blocks
05:50 - let's try it now
05:59 - it works we need to code the other
06:03 - sprites now we can do this quickly by
06:06 - dragging this block of code onto each of
06:08 - the fruit sprites we just need to change
06:18 - the position and timing of the fruits
06:20 - select another fruit sprite the first
06:23 - thing we want to do is to choose a
06:25 - position drag the fruit to the position
06:27 - you want it to start at if you look to
06:30 - the top right hand corner of your
06:31 - workspace you will be able to see a
06:33 - value for X and a value for y these are
06:37 - the x and y coordinates of the Speight
06:40 - now type these values into your go-to
06:43 - block for the new position
06:45 - [Music]
07:07 - we also need to change the weight once
07:10 - x-block for this game we want each fruit
07:13 - to fall at different times this makes it
07:15 - easier for the player to win we can do
07:18 - this by changing one sex I will change
07:21 - it to for sex for this fruit but you can
07:24 - change it to any time you like
07:26 - repeat these steps for the last two
07:28 - fruit sprites we need all the positions
07:30 - and wait times to be unique let's try it
07:34 - again
07:35 - [Music]
07:49 - yay all our fruit sprites are falling at
07:52 - different times so steps 4 & 5 we want
07:56 - to introduce the idea of winning and
07:58 - losing so for step 3 we need to add a
08:02 - variable which tells the computer when
08:04 - we win or lose first we will add code to
08:07 - our apple sprite to begin a new block of
08:10 - code we need an events blog drag when
08:13 - green flag clicked into your workspace
08:16 - if the bowl catches all the fruit you
08:18 - win the game so we need to count how
08:22 - much fruit has been caught to do this we
08:24 - can use a variable go to the data tab
08:27 - and make a new variable let's call this
08:30 - variable fruit because it will tell us
08:32 - the amount of fruit that has been caught
08:34 - so if the bowl catches one fruit sprite
08:37 - then this fruit variable should change
08:40 - by one that is if the fruit is touching
08:43 - the bowl the variable increases by one
08:46 - so we need an if/then block from the
08:49 - control tab drag this into your
08:51 - workspace now go to the sensing category
08:54 - and select touching mouse pointer place
08:57 - this in the top of your if phem block
09:00 - change mouse pointer to bowl once the
09:03 - ball catches the fruit we want the fruit
09:06 - to hide so drag the hide block from the
09:09 - looks category
09:10 - into your if vem blog now if the Apple
09:13 - is touching the bowl the Apple hides we
09:16 - also want to count how much fruit has
09:19 - been caught we can do this with the
09:21 - change fruit by one block which is in
09:24 - the data category so when the Apple is
09:27 - caught by the bowl our fruit variable
09:30 - changes by one finally we need a forever
09:33 - loop so this condition is checked
09:35 - continuously drag the forever block from
09:38 - the control category into the workspace
09:40 - and place it around your if vem blog now
09:44 - let's check our code it works notice how
10:04 - if the bowl misses the fruit when the
10:06 - fruit continues to fall along the screen
10:08 - we want the fruit to disappear when it
10:10 - reaches the bottom edge of the screen at
10:12 - the bottom of the screen the
10:14 - y-coordinate is minus 180 we can make a
10:18 - condition that checks if the
10:20 - y-coordinate is equal to minus 180
10:24 - if so the fruit will hide so again we
10:27 - need them if then block drag this into
10:30 - your workspace and place it below your
10:32 - other s-stem blog inside the forever
10:35 - loop to check the y-coordinate we can
10:38 - use the less than sign from the operator
10:41 - category drag the less than sign block
10:43 - into the top of your new is stem block
10:46 - now we need the wide position from the
10:49 - motion category place this on the left
10:52 - side of your less than sign we want to
10:54 - check if y is less than minus 180 the
10:59 - coordinate at the bottom of the screen
11:01 - so type minus 180 into the right side of
11:06 - your less than block now if the y
11:09 - coordinate of the fruit is less than
11:11 - minus 180 the fruit hides drag the hide
11:15 - block from the looks category into your
11:17 - s then blog now let's try it out
11:20 - [Music]
11:29 - it works we need to repeat these steps
11:32 - for the rest of the fruit sprites again
11:35 - we can do this quickly by dragging and
11:37 - dropping our code onto each of the other
11:39 - fruit sprites however each time the game
11:42 - begins we want the fruit variable to
11:45 - reset to zero on the bowl sprite we can
11:49 - use the set fruit to zero block from the
11:52 - data category place this underneath see
11:54 - when green flag clicked block but
11:57 - outside of the forever loop a quick test
12:00 - shows that our score resets for steps
12:04 - four and five we want to add you win and
12:06 - game over to our game so first we need a
12:10 - new backdrop select the miniature
12:12 - paintbrush icon at the bottom left hand
12:14 - corner of your screen use the text tool
12:17 - to type the phrase
12:18 - you win onto your new white backdrop and
12:22 - title this backdrop you win you can
12:25 - choose any font color or text size you
12:28 - like for this
12:29 - [Music]
12:44 - we can do the same for game over now use
12:48 - the text tool to type game over onto
12:51 - your backdrop and title the backdrop
12:53 - game over so step four we want to add
13:04 - code to our you win backdrop in the
13:07 - backdrops tab make sure you have the you
13:09 - win backdrop selected then click on the
13:12 - scripts tab we will begin our code with
13:15 - the when green flag clicked block from
13:17 - the events tab when we start the
13:20 - backdrop needs to reset to the plain
13:22 - white backdrop so we can use the switch
13:25 - backdrop to you win blog from the looks
13:28 - category change you win to backdrop one
13:31 - and add it under when green flag clicked
13:35 - now we need to add the condition for the
13:38 - you win backdrop if we catch all of the
13:41 - four pieces of fruit then we win the
13:43 - game so we need an ace stem blog drag
13:47 - this blog into your workspace now we can
13:50 - use a variable fruit if a variable fruit
13:53 - equals full then we win so drag the
13:56 - equal sign from the operators category
13:59 - into the top of your if then vlog now
14:02 - select the variable fruit and place it
14:05 - on the left side of the equal sign type
14:08 - for on the other side for step size we
14:14 - need to add code to our first piece of
14:16 - fruit the Apple sprite select the Apple
14:19 - and make sure the scripts tab is open we
14:22 - lose the game when we catch less than
14:24 - four pieces of fruit so we need to make
14:27 - a condition which checks this let's use
14:30 - the timer if I start the game and watch
14:33 - all the fruit fall the game ends after
14:35 - about 18 seconds so if the timer is
14:39 - greater than 18 seconds and the fruit
14:42 - variable is less than 4 we lose now
14:46 - let's add this code so
14:48 - we need an s vem block from the control
14:50 - tab drag this into your workspace we
14:53 - have two conditions for this code so we
14:56 - need the and block from the operators
14:58 - tab now we need a less than sign and a
15:02 - greater than sign drag one of each into
15:06 - either side of your and block you can
15:08 - find the timer block in the sensing
15:10 - category place this on the left side of
15:13 - your greater than block and type 18 on
15:16 - the other side for the other side we
15:18 - need the fruit variable from the data
15:20 - category place this on the left of your
15:23 - left and block and type full in the
15:26 - other side now if this occurs we want
15:29 - our backdrop to change to game over so
15:32 - select the switch backdrop block from
15:35 - the looks category and add it to your
15:37 - code make sure the game over backdrop is
15:40 - selected we also need the stop or block
15:43 - because if we lose we want the game to
15:46 - stop you can find this in the control
15:48 - section add this to the bottom of your
15:51 - code finally drag this block of code
15:53 - into the forever loop that changes the
15:56 - variable fruit now let's try it
16:00 - [Music]
16:27 - it works enjoy playing your catch the
16:31 - fruit game
16:32 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome to coding kids today I will show you how to create the game catch the fruit first let's have a look at what happens in this game when we play it the player controls the bowl by pressing the left and right arrow keys different pieces of fruit glide down the screen automatically meaning they are not controlled by the player the player can move the bowl to catch the fruit if the ball catches a piece of fruit our fruit score increases by one if we drop a piece of fruit the game ends and the backdrop changes to game over if we catch all the fruit the game ends and the backdrop changes you win now let's build this game there are five parts to this game one the bowl the fruit three variables for you win five game over now let's start building one step at a time first let's start with a brand new project by clicking the create button on the home page you will see a new project open with the cat as the default sprite a sprite is a character or object we use in making computer programs for step one we want to add a bowl sprite right click on the cat sprite and press Delete to import a new sprite we can click on the miniature sprite icon and select a sprite from the sprite library I have selected the bowl sprite now we want to add code to our bowl sprite to begin our code we need an events block go to events and select the when green flag clicked block this means we will start our game when the green flag is clicked now place the sprite at the bottom left hand corner of your screen we want to make our bowl move left and right to move our bowl left and right we will use the left and right arrow keys we have already selected the when green flag clicked block for when the movement should start so we shouldn't use the when space key pressed block for the arrow keys instead we you see if there Blagh go to the control tab and drag if dem blocks into the workspace now to make our bowl move left and right go to the sensing tab and select key space pressed add one of these into the top of each if then block to move with the left and right arrow keys we change space to left arrow and right arrow since we're moving left and right this means we are moving along the xaxis so we need the change X by 10 block get 2 of these into the workspace and add to your East M blocks remember to change 10 to negative 10 for left finally we need to add a forever loop find this in the control tab this means the computer will continue checking this condition now let's try it it works so step 2 we want to add fruit sprites to our game click on the minitor sprite icon again to import some new sprites I'm going to choose 4 fruits I have chosen an apple a banana an orange and a watermelon sprite but you can choose any type of sprite you like now let's add code to our sprites I will begin with the Apple sprite first we need an events block so go to events and select the when green flag clicked block for this game we want to make our apple sprite begin in the same position at the start of each game we can do this with the go to block in the motion category move your sprite to the position you wish it to start at at the top of the screen the go to block records this position now you can drag the go to block into your workspace and add it to your code when we start the game we want our Apple to be hidden before showing this gives the player time to prepare we can do this using the hide and show blocks you can find these in the looks tab drag them into your workspace placing the hide block first to make the Apple stay hidden before showing use the weight once xblock find this in the looks category and added to your hide now we want to add motion to our Apple so it falls found the screen however we don't just want our Apple to move downwards we want it to zigzag as it falls to zigzag on the way down we need to move to one side move down move to the other side and move down again we can do this using the change way by 1000 and change X by 10 blocks in the motion category drag two of each of these blocks into your workspace we want to place them X Y X Y for the Y blocks change it to 10 to minus 10 so it will move downwards I want my Apple to move more slowly so I will change the minus 10 to minus 5 to make the Apple move lesson right change the 10 in the X blocks to 5 and minus 5 for movement right and left to make these motions slower we can use the weight once X block find this block in the control category and a bit too each change Y block we don't want it to be too slow so change once X to 0.16 finally we need a forever loop so these conditions are constantly checked find this in the control tab and place it around your change X by and change Y by blocks let's try it now it works we need to code the other sprites now we can do this quickly by dragging this block of code onto each of the fruit sprites we just need to change the position and timing of the fruits select another fruit sprite the first thing we want to do is to choose a position drag the fruit to the position you want it to start at if you look to the top right hand corner of your workspace you will be able to see a value for X and a value for y these are the x and y coordinates of the Speight now type these values into your goto block for the new position we also need to change the weight once xblock for this game we want each fruit to fall at different times this makes it easier for the player to win we can do this by changing one sex I will change it to for sex for this fruit but you can change it to any time you like repeat these steps for the last two fruit sprites we need all the positions and wait times to be unique let's try it again yay all our fruit sprites are falling at different times so steps 4 & 5 we want to introduce the idea of winning and losing so for step 3 we need to add a variable which tells the computer when we win or lose first we will add code to our apple sprite to begin a new block of code we need an events blog drag when green flag clicked into your workspace if the bowl catches all the fruit you win the game so we need to count how much fruit has been caught to do this we can use a variable go to the data tab and make a new variable let's call this variable fruit because it will tell us the amount of fruit that has been caught so if the bowl catches one fruit sprite then this fruit variable should change by one that is if the fruit is touching the bowl the variable increases by one so we need an if/then block from the control tab drag this into your workspace now go to the sensing category and select touching mouse pointer place this in the top of your if phem block change mouse pointer to bowl once the ball catches the fruit we want the fruit to hide so drag the hide block from the looks category into your if vem blog now if the Apple is touching the bowl the Apple hides we also want to count how much fruit has been caught we can do this with the change fruit by one block which is in the data category so when the Apple is caught by the bowl our fruit variable changes by one finally we need a forever loop so this condition is checked continuously drag the forever block from the control category into the workspace and place it around your if vem blog now let's check our code it works notice how if the bowl misses the fruit when the fruit continues to fall along the screen we want the fruit to disappear when it reaches the bottom edge of the screen at the bottom of the screen the ycoordinate is minus 180 we can make a condition that checks if the ycoordinate is equal to minus 180 if so the fruit will hide so again we need them if then block drag this into your workspace and place it below your other sstem blog inside the forever loop to check the ycoordinate we can use the less than sign from the operator category drag the less than sign block into the top of your new is stem block now we need the wide position from the motion category place this on the left side of your less than sign we want to check if y is less than minus 180 the coordinate at the bottom of the screen so type minus 180 into the right side of your less than block now if the y coordinate of the fruit is less than minus 180 the fruit hides drag the hide block from the looks category into your s then blog now let's try it out it works we need to repeat these steps for the rest of the fruit sprites again we can do this quickly by dragging and dropping our code onto each of the other fruit sprites however each time the game begins we want the fruit variable to reset to zero on the bowl sprite we can use the set fruit to zero block from the data category place this underneath see when green flag clicked block but outside of the forever loop a quick test shows that our score resets for steps four and five we want to add you win and game over to our game so first we need a new backdrop select the miniature paintbrush icon at the bottom left hand corner of your screen use the text tool to type the phrase you win onto your new white backdrop and title this backdrop you win you can choose any font color or text size you like for this we can do the same for game over now use the text tool to type game over onto your backdrop and title the backdrop game over so step four we want to add code to our you win backdrop in the backdrops tab make sure you have the you win backdrop selected then click on the scripts tab we will begin our code with the when green flag clicked block from the events tab when we start the backdrop needs to reset to the plain white backdrop so we can use the switch backdrop to you win blog from the looks category change you win to backdrop one and add it under when green flag clicked now we need to add the condition for the you win backdrop if we catch all of the four pieces of fruit then we win the game so we need an ace stem blog drag this blog into your workspace now we can use a variable fruit if a variable fruit equals full then we win so drag the equal sign from the operators category into the top of your if then vlog now select the variable fruit and place it on the left side of the equal sign type for on the other side for step size we need to add code to our first piece of fruit the Apple sprite select the Apple and make sure the scripts tab is open we lose the game when we catch less than four pieces of fruit so we need to make a condition which checks this let's use the timer if I start the game and watch all the fruit fall the game ends after about 18 seconds so if the timer is greater than 18 seconds and the fruit variable is less than 4 we lose now let's add this code so we need an s vem block from the control tab drag this into your workspace we have two conditions for this code so we need the and block from the operators tab now we need a less than sign and a greater than sign drag one of each into either side of your and block you can find the timer block in the sensing category place this on the left side of your greater than block and type 18 on the other side for the other side we need the fruit variable from the data category place this on the left of your left and block and type full in the other side now if this occurs we want our backdrop to change to game over so select the switch backdrop block from the looks category and add it to your code make sure the game over backdrop is selected we also need the stop or block because if we lose we want the game to stop you can find this in the control section add this to the bottom of your code finally drag this block of code into the forever loop that changes the variable fruit now let's try it it works enjoy playing your catch the fruit game
