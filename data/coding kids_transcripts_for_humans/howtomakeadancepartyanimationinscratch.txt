00:08 - to make a dance party animation using
00:10 - scratch first let's look at the
00:13 - different parts there are three parts to
00:15 - the game making the sprites dance the
00:18 - backdrop claim the sound we will build
00:21 - this animation one step at a time first

00:26 - clicking on the create button on the
00:29 - home page every new project starts with
00:32 - the cat sprite of default a sprite is a
00:35 - character or object that we use in
00:37 - making the computer program now let's
00:40 - get rid of the cat and find a new sprite
00:42 - make sure your sprite has multiple
00:45 - costumes I will select the Cathy sprite
00:48 - which has four costumes costumes are an
00:50 - important aspect of animating sprites
00:53 - the first step in every project is
00:56 - always the when the green flag clicked
00:58 - block which can be found under the event
01:01 - category this block will start our code
01:04 - now we can start animating our sprite to
01:07 - change costumes in scratch we need the
01:10 - next costume block found under the looks
01:12 - category this blocks makes your sprite
01:15 - look like it's dancing you can make your
01:18 - dance go on forever and ever by adding a
01:20 - forever block which you can find under
01:23 - the event category hover the forever

01:32 - should click together now the animation
01:35 - is complete let's click on the green
01:37 - flag and pests the code it works have a
01:41 - look at your sprite how is the speed of
01:43 - your animation if your sprite is moving
01:46 - too fast you can add a weight block
01:48 - found in the control category by
01:50 - changing the number in the weight block
01:52 - we can increase and decrease the amount
01:54 - of time between each costume change

02:41 - backdrop as many times as you want then
02:43 - go to the second backdrop costume and
02:46 - change the color of each object to
02:48 - different colors to your first backdrop

03:01 - we need a block that stays next backdrop
03:03 - under the looks category and the when
03:06 - green flag clicked blocks this will make
03:08 - the lights and dance floor appear to
03:11 - flash different colors to make our
03:13 - animation repeat forever we hover a
03:16 - forever loop over the next backdrop
03:18 - block to slow it down we put a wait
03:21 - block after next backdrop we can change
03:24 - the speed by changing the number to 0.2
03:32 - so step three we want to add sound to
03:35 - our dance party first we need to get our
03:37 - event block when green flag clicked next
