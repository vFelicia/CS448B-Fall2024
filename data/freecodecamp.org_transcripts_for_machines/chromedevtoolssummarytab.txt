all right for this last video there are three things that i really want to stress the first of which is these tools are so useful and so awesome and when i first learned about them i was really intimidated and didn't see how they could apply to me and that was a mistake i should have just gotten in there and played around more because i think i would be more comfortable now the second thing is in case you haven't heard me say it enough read the documentation it's awesome while you're playing around with it read some documentation try it out see what you can do i've even been in the chat room asking i've been looking for buggy pages so i could debug them and people are really helpful they'll give you a page that they think really could use some help um third of all a lot of these tabs that these videos have gone over do similar things a lot of them have to do with how long executing a certain thing takes and that can be intimidating if you know there's a problem but you're not sure where to start that's okay something that works best for you might not be the same thing that works best for somebody else once you figure it out it will get easier and a little bonus there is this um device mode that i showed you a little bit at the beginning but i want to play around with it now so it's this little it looks like a little phone next to the search button so i this is what it looks like without it this is my regular code my regular code pen i'm going to click this little button and here this is an apple ipad this is what it would look like and it functions too i click the more button and it just does it it even i can change the network so if somebody's on wifi in case my page is big enough where that's going to make a difference this is an amy polar quote because she's fantastic um so there's your own devices you can also just make it your own so like well how would it look on something you know this size and you can try it and see how it goes it's an awesome tool i hope you guys enjoyed these videos have fun playing around with the devtools
