hello everyone and welcome to the second episode of connecting the dots and today with me i've got cassidy williams cassidy thank you so much for hanging out with us today thank you for having me i'm excited i am just tickled pink you uh you chose to come and join us on here i think this is gonna be an absolute blast um so i mean i i feel like you're one of the people who needs no introduction but maybe we should do just for the the sake of anyone who's been living under a rock or doesn't go on twitter or isn't familiar with tick tock um you want to give a little bit of an introduction for yourself hello everyone i exist um uh i'm a i'm a dev experienced engineer with jason at netlify i make beams on the internet and that's really the high level thing i could i could go into more detail but i figure we will throughout this whole thing yeah i think that's that's our whole goal today so um for everyone in the chat thank you so much for hanging out with us today the the goal of what we want to talk about today is um like the premise for the show is that i think a lot of people are looking for work right now it's been a hard year uh tech is getting busier and busier there are more and more people who are are moving into the field through boot camps through traditional means through nontraditional means just studying on their own um and that means that there are a lot of folks who are trying to get that first role and so what we want to do on the show is talk to people like yourself who have a like a stellar career you know you've done a lot of amazing things that we'll talk about and you've got an amazing network that we'll also talk about but kind of rewind that a little bit and talk about how you got those first steps and how you started that journey and also the part that i find most interesting is when we're talking about a tech career what is it that we're able to bring to it that's not tech training so not being a developer not being computer science major but what do we bring from the rest of ourselves that gives us an advantage that gives us that opportunity to go further and do more with our tech career um so i guess to to jump right into this how did you like what was your journey from like not in tech to first tech job how did you how did you get started um so i have a very traditional background i actually have a cs degree um and studied computer science i started coding when i was a teenager and and played around with things started building stuff i took ap computer science in high school and then got uh got my computer science degree um but in college i kind of did have a shift that introduced me to the tech industry um that i think was significant where i started doing internships and stuff and and uh i would say probably my junior year was when i really started getting connected and that's when i started actually networking with people which i think was the biggest shift of all because um once i started going to hackathons and conferences and meetups and just any any events that i could go to and granted i went to iowa state university excellent school loved it there um but iowa is kind of in the middle of nowhere and so a lot of people think oh dang i have to be in san francisco to go to the meetups and stuff you don't you can be in the middle of iowa and and still go to these things and so um i i started getting connected by just emailing with people going to office hours and saying hey i heard you're connected with this person can i get an introduction just starting to kind of put out feelers getting involved with online communities and doing that just really opened so many doors for me where uh my junior year of college i was invited to speak at the white house and my sister and i both ended up speaking at the white house to talk about inclusion and technology and stuff with with a bunch of other uh women our age which was an amazing opportunity and people who i met there i ended up following up emailing them and then one of them ended up becoming a mentor to me um and then that next summer i interned out in silicon valley and i called it my summer of networking because i truly just i went to either a hackathon or a meetup at least twice a week the entire summer i was just concerned where's most people most people are having their summer of love you had your summer of linkedin requests but actually that's exactly how i described it i was just like i want to get 300 connections on linkedin this summer alone like i i set that as a goal but it's true i know i know it's i know it's like the nerdy thing to do at a summer internship but i it it changed the trajectory of my career really because absolutely i was able to get connected to so many cool people where one of the people who i met that summer ended up she's a mentor to me to this day and she's amazing and she was just someone where i got her business card at a hackathon and emailed hey it was nice to meet you and now she was invited to my wedding she's someone who i talk with regularly like it just happened to be that way and so i think i think the networking aspect is something that really just uh helped take off my career because even though like networking doesn't get you everywhere you still need to know how to code you still need to know how to do things being able to make those connections with people is so vital for just getting your foot in the door sometimes and and i've been able to have so many cool experiences because i've been willing to go through all of the emails of people who are at an event send a nice to meet you and just get to know some of those people absolutely and so i want to dig into something a little bit because you have this almost otherworldly ability to end up in the room you just said you know your junior year college you spoke at the white house you are part of a um like a react core team community call where you kind of talk to the react team about what should and shouldn't happen in the community and and you've got like you seem to be involved in all of the things and that we could just say oh well that's just cassidy she's special but i don't think that's true i think you work really hard at that and so i'm i would love to hear what what is it that you're doing how are you making these connections and and you know what what did you do to get that invite to the white house what are you doing to to get invited to these calls with with different community leaders and and you know to do the mc work and all of this you know the phrase that my mom always says is squeaky wheel gets the grease a lot of times it's just asking and being loud about it and stuff and so like not not just like getting invited to the white house and and getting invited to speak at the u.n getting invited to to go to all these cool places that was stuff where truly there was for example one of the things that i did that junior summer that again changed trajectory of my career it was a hackathon on a plane and it was a flight from san francisco to london and it was all of these tech leaders on the plane i was the only undergrad student on this plane and the other people were so much cooler than me like craig of craigslist was on the plane megan smith who's cto of the united states was on the plane uh just uh kimberly bryant from black girls code was on the plane all these really cool people i found out the plane was happening i emailed the organizers and i said hey i'm really interested in this do you have space for someone like me and then i like sent them my resume and they said actually some people just dropped out sure we can fill your spot wow that's a cooler spot like it was truly me just asking and if you don't ask you don't get really and so i a lot of it is just asking and and for example uh getting to know the react team and getting involved with with all these technical groups a lot of times it was just me sliding into the dms and saying hey i'm really interested in this work that you're doing i don't know if you can ever use me but i think it would be great to be involved in something like this because i'm really interested in the technology that you're using it it's small but that's something that is significant i remember when i was first in my first tech job in brooklyn and i would always go to the brooklyn js meetup and and just getting to know people there and uh i saw that at one of the events john resig was going to be there for those who don't know he made jquery i dm'd him beforehand and i just said hey john i saw you're going to be at this meetup i hope i meet you there see ya left it at that and then at the meetup he approached me and i remember i was with all my coworkers and he was just like hey you're the one who dm'd me it's so nice to meet you cassidy and like that was truly the interaction the street cred i got when john resig approached me but well it it was significant because because he approached me i got to have a conversation with him and then people who wouldn't normally talk to me started talking to me because they saw that i had this connection with someone who's big in the industry yeah and it's it's something that i think is undervalued in tech to just be willing to kind of put your ego at the door and just ask and just reach out and and talk to people you know you you brought up two things that i think are really interesting the the first one is it would be really easy to chalk a lot of this up to luck you you emailed that hackathon on a plane and it just so happened that somebody had dropped out and they had space right so oh lucky but this is i think a really good example of creating your own luck um because you know if if we look back on this how many of these emails have you sent that got ghosted that went nowhere where you gotta know so many constantly like there are sometimes people on twitter i'm just like i remember i dm'd them and they never dm'd me back and it's just like just oh i forgot they existed they probably never knew i did that's just that happens all the time but you never know if someone will reply i i take the same approach with raffles i apply to every raffle i enter people think i win a lot of raffles i've won quite a few things that's how i got my kindle that's how i got just like various lego sets and stuff that i have you never know if you could win your percentage is low but you could get lucky and and i kind of take the same approach with with that kind of i take the same approach with job uh interviews too when i was in college i think i applied to over a hundred maybe 200 jobs and people were just like dang you got a lot of job offers i'm like yeah but do you know how many interviews i had to go to yeah dozens and dozens and thousands of interviews and sure i had like a decent picking to choose from in the end but it was because i did so many job interviews yeah oh i think i mean that that is such an important part that i think it's it gets skipped a lot when we talk about these because you know the the happenstance or the chance encounters or the the lucky break a lot of times that happens because you do you know hundreds of job applications or send hundreds of of dms that go ignored and you know i i think that it can be really easy to to send off one job request and you don't hear anything back and you go oh i must not be any good at this and the fact of the matter is that like you're only half of the equation you're also waiting for someone to be at the right place at the right time with the right needs and so you have to create as many of those opportunities as you can to to you know be the right person at the right time to let people know that you're available so when they have that need they go oh i just talked to cassidy she's looking for this kind of work we should talk to her like that's you know though i i i always and maybe you'll you'll echo this but i feel like i hear a lot of people who say nothing's happening this doesn't work i'm never gonna make it in this industry and i always tell them i'm like look it's this is gonna feel like nothing's happening and then it's all gonna happen at once you just gotta keep showing up yeah a friend of mine actually uh was looking for a job for a solid year and a half and nothing was happening and he kept putting up feelers kept applying and stuff and he finally started his brand new job this week and he was so excited because he was finally in this startup and literally three days after he started three of those startups or three or four of those startups that he had applied to suddenly were just like hey we really liked talking to you back in the day but we're just now having openings and he's just like well that timing is nuts because it you know just like you said you never know when that timing will work out and so just it's a numbers game absolutely all kinds of opportunities and conversations and things a lot of times it's truly just putting it out there and seeing what might come back yeah um and and that actually i think is a nice kind of segue into into something i'd love to talk to you about in particular because i think that you have a really unique presence on on uh everywhere that you show up which is that you are like legitimately funny and um and i think that like it's it it was when i first met you and and i'm not saying that like oh i met you and i thought you were funny and now i don't but but when i when i first met you i think i would have assumed that you are just like a naturally funny person and that you know you you're just everything that you see you're like i've got a funny joke for that and you just you just whip off zingers all the time and what i've realized through through you actually you taught our team how to be funny which was i i love that um but you you have this approach to everything where you repeatedly try the same thing a little bit different and where you're you're tweaking approaches and and kind of assessing that can you talk a little bit through maybe not necessarily in humor but just in like your approach in general um how does that factor in to your career do you think yeah so to that between between jokes between project ideas between pretty much everything i just write everything down and and i have i have both physical notebooks i have drawings i have digital ones i have managers of all kinds of things i write absolutely everything down because you never know if something might be useful right and sometimes it's a code snippet sometimes it's just a statement sometimes it's look into this website because this might be interesting someday there there are so many things where i i'm even still on pinterest where i purely just put like projects that i might want to do someday just to see if something might land and a lot of times it's me kind of prepping for some day in the future that may never come but for for every joke for every tweet for every task i take on sometimes even jobs i might want to apply to someday i write them down because it's it's kind of i guess it's kind of like that second brain concept in a way because there are times where you might think of a good idea and just forget it and i will forget things if i don't write it down and and so just getting it down on paper helps remember it and then tagging things properly organizing yourself properly you never know when an idea you might have one day might actually be the perfect idea years later yeah um and and so as part of this too you know you're you're writing everything down you're keeping track of these ideas uh but you're also i would i would guess you know i know for for me at least when i'm trying to make jokes i spend a lot of time making jokes that are only marginally funny or not funny at all and i learn like when i try it this way it gets a little bit of a laugh if i tweak it like this it gets a lot of a laugh and i found similar things in my in my career if i build a thing like this people get it if i present it like this people kind of recoil and back away um how would you say that that sort of approach because i know that you're you're similar and that you you try things and tweak and try things and tweak how does that affect your confidence you only get more confident over time i think i think for example a good example of this is i used to teach workshops fulltime for for react and stuff and when i was first teaching i was like man i know this material but i am nervous for teaching people about it we'll see how it goes and it went decently at first and i was just like okay you know what they asked those questions so i'm going to try to make sure this information is particularly clear so the next workshop it's tweaked ever so slightly and the more i did it the more the the more refined it got it's kind of like uh standup comedians how they want their type 10. they they rework a joke until it's funny enough that that they consistently get a laugh um there's this phrase that i like to use repetition is recognition try different approaches whether it's a coding approach a humor approach a talk approach a blog approach um you you perfect it and and practice does make perfect for pretty much everything yeah yeah i i think so a couple people in the chat are asking about um how to build confidence for tech interviews and would you say that's you know that's how you would recommend it or are there other tips that you would recommend 100 recommend it again when i said it was a numbers game like every single interview is a practice interview and like the i have done a lot of interviews i i have interviewed at a lot of places sometimes i interview even when i'm not looking for a job just because it's good practice and learning how to present yourself in an interview figuring out what kind of approaches do and don't work experiencing different interviewers where you can kind of get a vibe is this person someone who would kind of smirk if you make a selfdeprecating joke or is this the kind of person who would just like be stoic you kind of figure out your approaches as you interact with all of these different interviewers and that really helps over time and and i truly think that i'm decent at interviewing not because i'm perfect at getting merge sort and the proper space and time complexity but because i've done it so many times and because i've interacted with interviewers so many times that i know how to it feels like gaming the system but really it's just practice absolutely yeah i found the same thing like the the one of the reasons that i run learn with jason is because it forces me to practice like i i get put into situations with things i don't know and i have to just figure it out and because of that i feel like my stress tolerance is so much higher because i just do it all the time and i practice doing that live stuff um so there's a question in the chat which i think is actually pretty interesting um shidanza is asking what's an effective way of practicing coding and like what sort of intermediate goals should you keep for that practice so there's there's so many different ways to practice coding and i guess it depends on your goals and i hate answering it depends when that is kind of the answer but um so so for example if you really want to get good at like a certain type of algorithm or data structure try implementing it in different languages start implementing it in pseudocode first implement certain things in pseudocode first then do it to python then ruby then javascript then java and stuff figure out how you can kind of solidify that information where it's yes you're experimenting with different languages but you're really getting used to the structure of that data you're really getting used to how that algorithm should be meanwhile if you're trying to really just get good at javascript just constantly build things with javascript i remember uh like i there was a point where i was really keen on maintaining my github streak and i had like i think was 128 days on github of just straight coding and a lot of times my projects were just dumb they were not they were not particularly useful projects i was just like you know what i want to just get good at javascript and so i just tried to build something with it every day and sometimes it was a few lines of code sometimes i'd get past that writer's block and and write a ton of code um but really it's just build something and and there's so many ideas out there to build and you can start with something basic like a todo list a book review app something like that but then as as you practice be like a chat app a reddit clone just just keep keep kind of copying existing ideas while building it in your own unique way to to really just practice it and and for example i tried to get better at css for a long time and so i every single thursday i called it codepen thursdays i'd build something on codepen i'd get a design from dribble or something and just try to recreate it i'd give myself an hour sometimes it was not perfect but it got me practicing and and slowly but surely i got decent at css because i was practicing it enough and suddenly i was able to say okay well if i know i need to center this these are the three approaches i can take and and just go with it and so truly just code and it's hard to get started but start with something dumb and basic and just build up as you get ideas and as you get an app idea that you want to build write it down because then you can use that idea later yeah i and i think like what you're what you're mentioning too there's also another thing that you can do with that which which you talked about briefly but i want to dig into a little bit more which is you were practicing but then you created codepen thursdays and that was something you could share and so if you're trying to learn something like one of my favorite examples of this is lynne fisher she does a project called a single div and during october she does divtober and every single day she makes a css illustration or animation using just css most of the time in codepen and shares it and as a result she's built huge name recognition she's one of the like the the first people you would think of if you wanted to do beautiful css art you would go oh we need lin fisher and that's not because like that's not even her job she's like an executive at a at an agency or something and she just at least she just does this because she likes doing it and as a result she's become a leading expert on it um how do you feel that that sort of of kind of exposing your work even if it's not the best thing you've ever built how has that impacted your career do you think learning in public is huge and and i think i think that's something that a lot of people should do i know it's not for everybody so i don't want to say everyone should do this but it gets your name out there and sometimes that is that is all you need to to do something really well with your career or do some make connections that you need um an example of this honestly is my fatherinlaw he he's a 55yearold korean man and he decided he wanted to learn how to code three years ago and so we were practicing with him we were helping him learn and and as he was building stuff he was just like this is really interesting to me but he was having trouble in interviews because his english wasn't so great and he was nervous about ageism and on all kinds of stuff and we said okay how about this start posting on twitter even if it's even if it's just like i built this today and no links or anything just start posting regularly so that way so that way your your name can be out there a bit and it worked there there was a point where it was he did like a hundred days of code where he would just say like today i implemented n10 tests on this or today today i struggled with this i don't know if i'll be able to get it done but i'm working on it that gave him practice writing that gave him practice explaining what he was working on that gave him the recognition of oh yeah i did accomplish something today and then when he tweeted out that he was looking for a job people who had been noticing his tweets over time he he was able to get on calls with them and and after doing the job interview process which took a very long time he started his first job this year his first software engineering job and he's killing it and it's truly just from all the practice and putting his name out there and and it's something that he's not comfortable with i don't think he's tweeted ever since he got the job because like he's like you know i've got my job i'm good but that was enough just i'm set but uh if you want to if you get your name out there it's first of all again it tells you that you did something it reminds you that you did something even if it was something hard but then it also kind of puts it out there in the world where if someone someday is trying to say man i wonder if anybody has ever built something like this before they might find your project or they might find your status they might ask you about it and you never know what connections might come from that yeah yeah and and so i think um there was a there was a question that i thought was really interesting um which relates to this which is you were you're saying that he was learning how to like write about what he's doing to communicate what he's doing and uh elliot asks uh or he just yeah he asked i realized lately that i'm not selling myself well how have you figured out how to sell yourself and resonate with your interviewers that is a great question and i i think uh that that is that is the golden question really figuring out how to sell yourself because selling cassidy williams is different from selling jason langsdorff it's different from selling sarah drazer everyone sells themselves differently and so you have to figure out kind of i hate to use a cliche phrase but your personal brand of how you want to pitch yourself and i think figuring that out involves many things first of all what do you want to do but also what don't you want to do um i think both are equally important a lot of people are just like okay i'm willing to do anything to get a job you're not willing to do anything make sure you know what you actually do want to do what you don't want to do and and be able to figure out how to explain what you can do what are you good at what are you not that good at there are things for example i know i am not good at low level languages like c and c plus i never want to write those again there are times where really cool jobs come up or i'm just like man programming robots that would be amazing and then i have to remind myself no it won't because i'll be working with these languages that i don't want to work with yeah it just sounds cool and stuff and so knowing what you like knowing what you don't like and figuring out your like 30 second pitch this is what i can do this is what i can't do and being able to articulate that well for yourself means that you can articulate it well to other people as you practice that pitch over and over um a lot of times for that like 30 second pitch of yourself whether you're going to a career fair or you're or just talking to interviewers and stuff uh practice with your friends i remember when i was in college even my roommates and i we would just say okay this is my 30second pitch for myself what do you think and i would just introduce myself quickly explain what i like to do explain the things that i'm hoping to do go and then seeing what what they might say and then uh be ready for those kinds of followup questions and stuff and once again practice does make perfect and figuring out how to sell yourself does involve uh maybe a few flops here and there and you could be just like okay that approach was not great and so now i know not to do that one well and that's where the the repetition like creating your own look right like if you know if you're gonna become the best baker in the world you don't just find one recipe and say okay i'm probably done this is probably the best bread right you have to make a bunch of bad bread before you realize what the common elements are that make great bread can you tell i'm hungry i was just gonna say i could go for some bread but so i think something that that i would would kind of love to dig into around this is like when you are um when you're talking about this to people who aren't super confident in coming out and selling themselves right like i think when you when you talk to a lot of folks especially introverts the idea of selling gets really kind of skin crawly they're like i don't want to sell anything i don't like that idea um one one thing that i heard that i really like and that i think you're very good at is instead i i don't consider a lot of what i'm doing to be selling i consider it to be that i am looking at what somebody is trying to accomplish and i'm trying to match what i know how to do with what their goals are and then i'm i'm trying to connect those dots between where they are what i can offer and how we can get there so i'm not really selling myself i'm trying to you know paint this picture of what we could do together and how like i i guess do you fi do you follow a similar approach and and if so kind of how how i don't how do you think about that how does how does your brain wrap around that sort of conversation that's my exact approach to everything not just not even just uh professional conversations and stuff i figure out how can i relate to you in a way that will be interesting for you and that i can continue to speak to and stuff and i myself am a very introverted person like i i give tech talks and stuff i'll answer questions afterwards small talk is terrifying if you talk if you talk to high school me you should be shocked that i'm a very public persona today just because it's something that i never expected to do and and selling is terrifying but kind of like what you said really all it is is figuring out what will this person want to hear what will this person respond to and how can i show myself to them in a way that they will respond to like how do i frame all of this and i feel like every time i'm at an event every every time i'm i'm speaking to people whether it's over zoom or over an interview or anything it's it's figuring out okay as they introduce themselves getting to know them figuring out their cadence of speaking figuring out how they how they talk not necessarily just mirroring it but seeing okay this person does not seem to have a sense of humor i'm gonna cut it out and just try to you know say it's say it straight but then there are some people where you can tell like oh they smirk a little bit now and then okay i'll throw in a few dry jokes here and there and see if they like it or there's someone like you for example you laugh at jokes and i appreciate that so i know that i can just i can just throw crap to the wind and i'll get a smile out of it and it's great and we both have a good time and so i i think i i think that is a very key way of just kind of getting to know people and and you can build the relationship after the initial connection but sometimes the initial connection is figuring out how can i make this conversation work and and that really is what selling is yeah absolutely um so i have a big departure because a great question just came in muhammad asks uh i already have work as a software developer at a tech company but i'm finding it hard to do side projects and other ideas do you have any tips i get that sometimes work is exhausting and so at the end of the day you're just like i want to code but i can't and your brain is just tired and i think i think you have to figure out your schedule then and and i know some people where they are just exhausted at the end of the day they can't fathom writing more code and and doing stuff and so they start their day with it and they're just like okay you know what i'm gonna go to bed an hour earlier i'm gonna wake up an hour earlier and i'm just gonna code on my own stuff and then get to work and and and figuring out that kind of schedule for yourself i think is really really important because when you're excited about an idea uh you could you could code on that for ages but sometimes you kind of need that kick in the pants and so i i think for myself like whenever i'm getting through that slump or i'm just so tired at work but i want to work on something myself i'll start it in the morning go through my work day but if i'm excited by what i started in the morning i'll just work on it after work then because i've already got those juices flowing um and so i think figuring out a schedule for yourself is important there and experimenting with different ones until you find something that sticks yeah i think like i i've heard it described as as we have a like a reservoir of mental energy or willpower that we wake up with every day and like if we don't sleep enough that reservoir is is more empty when we start um so getting enough rest making sure that you are kind of taking care of yourself physically so that you can operate at the right level and then being aware of like what's taking those those like what's sapping that energy because there are a bunch of decisions that i don't realize drain me that drain me intensely like if i have to open up my fridge and choose what to eat like i'm like okay i have a bunch of ingredients i can cook four meals what am i gonna cook tonight that's actually like all of my side project energy trying to think of what i'm gonna cook so one of the ways that i've started hacking that is by making like a batch meal i'll make chili or curry or or something that i can make a lot of and then have ready so that i don't have to use that energy on my weeknights i can say okay i'm going to eat curry tonight because that's what's ready and then i'm going to work on my side project because i still have the gas in the tank to do that um and so you know what um let's see there are so many questions here that i want to make sure we want to get time for um but actually actually here's a question that i think is really interesting because everybody's routine is very different and everybody's got different like early bird night owl kind of routines what is your like typical day how do you split up your time among different projects and and work and all the other things that you do yeah and so i am one where i wake up and i go straight to work like so sometimes i will wake up 10 minutes before a meeting and just get straight to work go yeah yeah that's just how it is i wake up and it's time for work but then as soon as work is done i depending on how the day was depending on what i need to get done uh that's when i start planning out everything and and i do have a few projects where it's not just a side project for myself but it's something that i'm doing with others for example i write the stack overflow newsletter for that on on those days i need to make sure that i write that copy before a certain hour on a certain day of the week otherwise i will stay up all night just taking way too long to just write this dang copy and so i have to have a dedicated time for that in the afternoon um even even stuff the small things like writing tweets for work i have to have set times for that because otherwise i won't actually do it but then outside of that it if it's a project for myself or other things i'll kind of eat food and dawdle a little bit answering emails and stuff but then it kind of depends on what the project of the day is if it's me starting something new i actually almost never start a new project at my desk because with all of my monitors and stuff in front of me it's awesome because i can do so many things at once but when i want to start a brand new project i almost always go to a chair go to a couch or something and just sit with my laptop and focus because if i have this small screen in front of me with just like classical music in the background i can get all of my structure set up have my ideas written out have a notebook next to me to get it done and that's that's how i focus and then once i'm ready to like expand it a bit more that's when i go back to my desk and have the big stuff in front of me because otherwise i will play fortnite or something and and chat on discord and stuff and not actually get to work but typically that's that's that's the day if i'm starting a new project i'm away from my desk otherwise i'm playing games or working on something existing at my desk um yeah yeah i get that like if i if i even look at the tv my productivity is done for the day right i just i i always tell myself i'm like oh i'm going to watch one episode of the great british baking show before i go to bed or while i eat dinner and then i'm like a full season and a half and i'm like what have i done all those soggy bottoms yeah no yeah it's it's basically that and granted like pandemic work is different from remote work i just described a pandemic typical day outside of outside of that it totally depends because normally i see people and and i might go to an actual physical meetup and stuff there's there's a lot more uh there's a lot more things to do when there are things to do but when you're at home in a pandemic it's basically am i looking at a big screen or a medium screen or a small screen all the time i know i yeah that's i am very much looking forward to getting back to regular remote work and not pandemic work i know um so to to flip this on its head a little bit like you are you're very senior in your career you're uh you're a principal in your job now and you act as a you know you you do mentorship you've worked in hiring capacities you have led teams so i want to turn this a little bit the other way and i want to talk about like if you're looking for someone that you're going to give your time to or that you're going to give an opportunity to what have you seen that's helped somebody show that it's someone you want to invest that time into like how are people how are people making it visible that that they're somebody that you want to give that chance to first of all i it's one of my biggest pet peeves when someone dms and it's just like hey i'd like you to be my mentor i'll just that is not how this works i it's it's oh that drives me crazy because that relationship isn't real it's just you wanting something out of that person and so i think starting with a relationship first is key and and starting with that it often just involves a question and and i'll use an example of of a mentor of mine her name is kelly hoey she's awesome she wrote a book on networking um she is the person who i first met my junior year summer where i got her business card at a hackathon i emailed her hey it was nice to meet you i saw her at a few other events and stuff and slowly over time i would just email her on occasion saying kelly i really hope that you're well this is what i'm doing i'm graduating soon blah blah blah hey i'm in my first job i'm thinking about asking for a raise for the first time do you have any tips for me i kind of would just be present and stuff but i wouldn't ask anything of her except unless i had a very specific question right and over time we would actually start hanging out we would actually start meeting up and and she would say hey actually i need someone to speak at this event will you help me here and then sometimes i would say hey i actually need some advice in this regard can you help me here and it became kind of a twoway relationship it wasn't just me trying to get whatever i could out of her and a lot of times when i see mentorships fail it's because it's someone who just wants something out of a person and they're just like okay check in with me once a month to see how i'm doing and you can coach me as if it's as as if you're hiring them to do free labor and and that's that's not what mentorship is about mentorship is getting to know someone in a relationship a friendship where they just they just happen to be further ahead in in their career and there are so many people who i've mentored where we've never actually said the word mentorship before it's just it's just something where i happened to help them out a few times because they asked specific questions or they were in this chat room and they were saying hey would someone mind reviewing my resume and i would be just like yeah i got time i would do that and then we just kind of started talking more and more and that's just how it ended up being it it has to be a lot more natural than a mentorship proposal it's got to be some kind of some some kind of like actual back and forth and so when i'm when i'm looking for people to help out and everything i don't really actively seek out like who will be the next mentee of cassidy i don't i don't do anything like that will you accept this rose yeah no nothing like that uh it's it's truly just i hang out in chat rooms i'm i'm on twitter a lot and stuff and people will ask me questions on occasion and if it's if it's not like a full essay if it's because i get enough dms i can't read every essay that comes my way um i'll answer it and and sometimes we just chat a few times on occasion sometimes they'll send me their resume a couple times and stuff and then eventually we just kind of have this relationship where we're just chatting on occasion and i occasionally help them and then they'll retweet my stuff and and it becomes a little back and forth and so it i guess if you are looking for a mentor don't actively be just like who will be the one who will guide me just put have a presence in certain communities and kind of put out there that you're learning put out there that you want your resume looked at or that you're not sure what to do here occasionally post questions and as people start answering the questions the the mentors kind of come out of the fold quickly when you're in these kind of community discords for example um there are there are sometimes chats where people would just like hey does anybody know anything about this i i'm new to writing golang and i'm really curious about how this kind of stuff works as people answer your questions you can be just like okay great and then you can ask more questions again in the future eventually you'll see who keeps who continually replies you can occasionally dm them a really nice thank you saying thank you to people oh my god just say thank you it's huge it's so easy and it goes so far it goes so far there are so many times where i've just sent very simple thank you notes over email or something and people will reply back saying you know this is the first time someone's ever thanked me for this i i really appreciate it thank you like there's just it means so much to people to see that their efforts to help you didn't go unseen like you didn't just say thanks and then and then bounce yeah and so really just be be a giving person and be a be a grateful person and and be a part of your communities because the mentors will come out of the fold as you uh start helping and sometimes your mentor is the community and and it's it's just a group thing where you're helping each other you know that actually i think that hit so close to home for me because one of the things that i've realized as you know i i went from being somebody who was brand new to the industry i you know i lived in montana i didn't have any connections and i would see people who gave keynotes or who worked at the companies that i wanted to work at and i would think oh my god these must be like celebrities i remember thinking that paul irish probably like had a malibu mansion and and you know like was the and like he might but he but at the same time i don't i haven't met a single person in tech who's got a name who is walking around thinking like you know i'm pretty great everybody should well i guess i have met people like that but in general like there are there's nobody walking around going like i am a mentor and you are the mentees it's it's very much like there's a community and it it feels awkward to me when somebody says can you be my mentor because i don't feel like i am i don't feel like i'm qualified to do that i'm just a dude writing code um and like i know some things but i don't know way more things and so what i found is that when the community is built around this idea of knowledge share and like knowledge transfer and everybody is participating then it starts to become a really good like comentoring or just like cogrowth scenario as opposed to uh it doesn't it shouldn't be pedagogical like if i put together a workshop great come learn from me but if i'm just being a person i don't what i don't want to give lectures i don't want to like sit you down and try to teach you something i want to talk to you like a person like i want my online existence is about having friends not about having students and i think that that is um that's something that if if we can get out of the mindset of like there are people who are here and they're the rest of us down here it levels that playing field you can talk to somebody like a human and you have such a better chance if you just ask a question and then if you know something offer some advice and support um it's yeah i i and that that's actually something that i really like is you know you've got your your discord for like your twitch subscribers your patreon supporters and that's not like cassidy holding court it's hanging out with people right it truly is and and like there there have been some people who have when i've said oh my my patreon discord group is so great they're just like ah this is an interesting business model a thought leader letting people in on their deep secrets i'm just like no that's not what it is really it's just a great discord group where because there's a two dollar entrance fee quote unquote there's less spam that's that's truly that's truly what it is and and the group is so helpful to each other it's such a nice community and and people are are really really giving and and i think i think that is really really important to realize yeah all of these people who you think are up here they're just people they just have more dms that's that's all it really is that's such a good question yes absolutely that's exactly what it is same person worse dms um uh so i saw a couple good questions come in that i that i want to look at so because you've been involved with hiring developers what are the biggest mistakes that you've seen like what are the things that really like grind on you so you mentioned one of them like saying will you be my mentor but what what else have you seen oh i've seen i've seen so many things it just oh i've got stories out the wazoo some more extreme examples but for example an extreme example is one time someone applied to a job where i was reviewing the resumes and stuff after they had gone through a few loops i was like oh this resume looks good and i went to look at their personal website and it was my personal website like all they did was change the name and the bio but like it was my code they even kept my comments in and stuff and i was like what are you thinking and then uh there was one time where i was interviewing a person in person they were doing whiteboarding and they just started crying part way through and i felt i felt really bad and i know i know it's like high pressure and stuff but then when i tried to say here i can change the question or here's a kleenex or don't worry about it they would say no and then just put their hand up and wouldn't let me talk and we literally sat there in silence while they cried for 45 minutes whoa it was terrible so these are very extreme examples but i think they they are very very key to their they're indicative of certain things so first of all things that i don't like to see i don't like to see people who are not open for feedback if if you say no or something or someone's trying to help you out or something that's that is a red flag if someone's crying an interview in an interview i understand it is high pressure but don't take it out on the interviewer just just uh just be willing to take your time to get calm and then work on it again it's that that would have been fine but it was because of that reaction that it wasn't great um for for a personal website if you're gonna just straight up copy a personal website at least give credit don't take work and then pass it off as your own and then yes and that is that is something that oh it peeves me because i've seen that not just for myself but so many people where they they claim that they're like the world's best developer or whatever and then you see that their code is not their own it's it's frustrating and so really a lot of it is putting your ego at the door um don't be willing to get feedback be willing to admit both strengths and weaknesses um and what i really love in interviews is if i ask a question and someone like is working on and stuff and then they just admit they say honestly i'm not entirely sure how to do this normally this is something i would google i love that honesty so much i don't hold it against them at all because that's something that it's true there are times where i have to google the most basic javascript things even though i've been using javascript for like 15 years it sometimes you just need to google it and and so i love seeing that kind of honesty and and lack of ego and humbleness when you're in an interview setting yeah i i would just echo that a thousand times i think that's such a that's such an important thing is to just like you know again be a person like you're not selling the the 10 of your brain that knows programming you're selling your entire existence you're gonna be you know your your sense of humor you're gonna be your your strengths your weaknesses all of that stuff and showing that is what makes people feel like you're a human you know it's one of the things that i that i think is so um it's it's what makes someone online kind of magnetic it's why we follow certain accounts not because of you know because of their technical content like i follow a lot of people who write code that i don't understand they're java programmers or they they write you know they're doing machine learning stuff i don't do that i can't really follow their examples but oh my god do i love to watch them they're just so engaging they're so fun they're they're whole humans and that's actually kind of how i started following you was because of your uh your tick tock and so maybe this is a good question to to kind of end on but i feel like authenticity is a really loaded word right we we say that and it becomes more of a marketing term but in the sense of of you and your kind of existence as a human and online um how much do you think bringing all of yourself versus just the technical part has influenced your career i think the moment i started to bring more of myself out there is when my career really started to take off or not even my career just online presence and stuff in general like i've always been making silly videos and jokes since i was since i could operate a camcorder because i started on camcorders back in the day and and uh i i would always just like be silly with all kinds of things i was always into building cool stuff like mechanical keyboards but on my twitter on my facebook all over the place i only talked about code about a year and a half ago or whatever when i started making these funny videos and decided to tweet about them that's when suddenly my online presence just shot up that's when suddenly people were just like were actually following me and everything because it wasn't just coding content it was fun coding content it was humor it was me talking more about keyboard suddenly it was it was a bit more interesting to see and i think and i'm not trying to like toot my own horn like because i'm hilarious now i have hundreds of thousands of followers it's not that what i'm saying is by being authentic suddenly people actually cared what i had to say and i think that's really indicative of a lot when i see that people are tweeting about all kinds of things and they're not just sticking to tech i i love seeing that and it i've seen some people where like they'll tweet a picture with their kids and i've seen people reply saying uh stick to tech i follow you for tech news you don't want those kinds of followers anyway you have people who who want to get to know you and stuff and so and so ignore those people i love seeing people who talk about their interests outside of tech on the internet like granted i love seeing the technical content i will read almost every technical blog i can see and write things down and stuff so that way i can read more about it but when i see for example on your channel how you have your learn with jason stuff but you also talk about like cooking and everything i love learning about that and seeing what different interests people have i love seeing when people are interested in korean dramas because i can say oh have you seen this one yet or i love when people are interested in drawing because i would love to be a better artist but i'm just not and and just seeing how they draw and and use that side of their brain i think is so cool um when i when i follow people a lot of the people that i follow on twitter and on instagram and stuff they might be tech people but they're almost always something else they're they're rarely just someone who contributes to open source a lot and and it's because i appreciate seeing the authenticity of someone who doesn't just code all the time who's interested in other things and and it's cool to see the cool side projects and stuff don't get me wrong i love seeing when someone launches something cool coding wise but seeing people do other things and and put their whole self out there in the workplace and out of the workplace i think is very very huge uh and and i think is important because it allows you to have a worklife balance built in because you go to an employer and they know that this is who you are like i know a gal where she um she was working at yahoo and she reviewed operas on the side she's actually she she's an opera viewer like that is her side gig she she reviews operas around the world she's awesome and her every single job interview she talked about it because people know in her workplace if she says i have to be out of here by 4 pm today because i have to go to this opera they know this is her thing right and and so that is built into her schedule she has kind of a builtin worklife balance because she brought her whole self to the table online in the interview and and elsewhere and so i think it's really important to be authentic about that saying i'm a parent saying i like to build keyboards saying i like to stream or play video games and stuff being willing to put yourself there it it sets an expectation that work is not your life and and i think that's really important work is not your life is such a good ending point for this i think so i'm not even gonna try to follow that up so instead what i'm gonna say is thank you so so much for taking the time to hang out with us today and
