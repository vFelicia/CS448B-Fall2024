objects in JavaScript an object is a standalone entity with properties and type a property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object properties can be accessed using dot notation here I created an object called my car and then I assigned uh two properties car my car. make equals Ford my car model equals Mustang you can also create a property and not assign it a value so now my card color is going to be undefined now uh everything is case sensitive so you have to make sure the right things are capitalized and you can see um it's going to be car. make is Ford my. colors undefined properties in JavaScript objects can be accessed or set using bracket notation also what I just showed you was dot notation let me show you bracket notation so there's the bracket notation and also you can console. log with bracket notation and you can see it's going to pull in Mustang for the model a property name can be any string but if the name has a space or hyphen or starts with a number it must be accessed with bracket notation and it's going to use that property the property is do I like and then the value is going to log as I my carard you can use bracket notation with four in Loops to iterate over all the innumerable properties of an object just going to paste this in so here's the function the function is show props and we pass in the object and the object name uh one of the reason why you pass in the object and the object name is because JavaScript even though you're going to pass in the name of the object here it's not going to know the name of the object unless you pass it in as a string I'll show you that later ver for I in object that means for each property in the object and it's going to set the property to I so it's going to say if OB do has own property I so if it does have that property it's going to it's it's going to assign um this result which started out with as empty string is the object name and then it's going to put a dot and it's going to put the property equals and then it's going to show what the property equals because this is this is bracket notation we're going to take the the object which is going to be my car and then we're going to look for the property and we're just going to pull this property like for instance it's going to pull the property make model color and then even do I like and it's going to find out what that property equals using bracket notation well it's going to be a little make more sense if we actually run this and we're going to pass in my car that's the object and the object name is just the string my car I'm going to put that whole thing in a console.log and run okay see it's going to say my car. make equals for my car. model equals Mustang my car. year equal 1969 my car. do I like equals I hate my car I'm going to go over three ways to create an object we have object initializer Constructor function and object.create with object initializer I've already used that if you do VAR m car equals new object you're using the object initializer another way to do that is use the is using the following notation so if you put these little these little curly braces you can also Define an object so the first property color red Wheels four if you look at engine we are assigning engine another object so the the value of a property can be another object now let's look at the Constructor function another way to create an object is with the Constructor function first you define the object type with a Constructor function and then you create an instance of the object with new so here's the constructure function I'm saying function car and I'm going to pass in three um three um values make model and year and now we have to put this. make equals make this. model equals model this. year equals year the word this is saying that we need to uh apply the word this is talking about this object so the car. make is going to equal the make value that you pushed in the car. model is going to equal the model value we put in and then the car. year is going to equal the year value that we put in now we just create an object by calling my cars follows so we have my car equals new car I'm going to pass in Chevy Malibu 1993 another car is going to equal new car Mazda Miata 1990 and then if I just do console.log now you can always add a property to a previously defined object for example so even though we already created the the op object now we can even console.log and if we run that it's still going to know the color at the very bottom you can see black the final way I want to talk about creating objects is object.create objects can also be created using the object.create method this method can be very useful because it allows you to choose the Prototype object for the object you want to create without having to Define a Constructor function while showing how to use object. create I will also show how to define a method for an object a method is just a property of an object that is a function so let me just paste this in so first we're going to define the prototype for our animal is going to um have type equals invertebrates this is just a default option for for animal so if we put type invertebrates the default is going to be in vertebra so we can change it we're also going to create a property that's a function so when you create a property that's a function it's called a method so data type is going to be the function console.log this.type so it can actually do something it's not not just a value so down here VAR animal one equals object.create animal so we're gonna pass in this animal prototype into creating the object so now it assigns animal one this whole thing and then we can run animal. display type and it's going to display type invertebrates however if we create another animal animal fish equals object. create animal and then do fish. type equals fishes when we display type it's going to be using the fish and you can see at the end invertebrates fish well there's a lot more to learn about objects but those are the basics stay tuned for more about objects and future videos thanks for watching my name is Bo
