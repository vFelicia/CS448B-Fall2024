hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie and today we're going to implement implement some search feature and we've done this way back in project 1 so well almost a year ago now maybe 10 months ago we started with project ones it's been a long time so we're going to take a look back at what we did in that project and use that to help us get started on this project so just to give you a quick overview we're going to use the WordPress REST API so we're not going to use graph QL for this and the reason is with the WP graph QL plugin you can't currently search across different post types and we need to have that so we have a lot of different post types right now in our WordPress installation and I don't really want the user to have to pick a post type to search with that's what we would have to do or potentially we would have to like when a search happened fire off a ton of requests to every single post type with graph QL and then get all the data back from all those requests put it all together and then show it's the user so I think it's gonna be a lot easier to just use the REST API to make the call so there's a plugin that you can use for the rest api that allows you to search multiple post types so that's what we're going to use so we'll check that out if it doesn't make sense right now when we get into it hopefully to make a little bit more sense when you see it and actually we're gonna do this may end up being a twopart show so my work on it today and tomorrow depending on how long it takes so we are gonna have to build a little bit of UI to display the search results so I'll be happy today if we can get just something basic showing up we can always work on the UI later but I just want to make sure that we can make calls to the WordPress API and get data back and just display something even if it's just some titles of the data and we'll have to work out we're gonna have to work out where that data goes like we'll direct them to a page it's yeah it's gonna be a little bit weird and I don't have all I don't have it all figured out yet so hopefully we can come to some type of you know solution as we work through this so before we get started just want to say a few things for those of you who are new maybe just watching for the first time in this stream I'm doing my regular daytoday work as a frontend developer at a small University so there will be mistakes mistakes are actually probably the unique part about this stream so we do make mistakes but then we work through the mistakes together if you're watching and you have access to the live chat feel free to put any questions that you have in the chat or any suggestions for me I'd take a lot of feedback from you all and a lot of what you tell me ends up in the project if you want to check out the code for the project there's a link in the description and you can check it out everything's on github everything's opensource feel free to take any code from this project and use it in your own projects if you're looking to build up your portfolio and would like some opensource concert Lucian's feel free to to submit a pull request to this project there are issues on this project and on a lot of other projects that we've worked on in the past you can take an issue and submit pull requests on there don't worry if you're not exactly sure what to do just ask me and I'll help you out and that's it that's all that I normally say for this oh one more thing we split up our coding into twenty five minutes sessions so I'll set a timer if you ask a question during that 25 minutes I probably won't see it but after that 25 minutes is up I'll take a little break and then I'll answer the questions so please be patient when answering when asking questions I will get to all the questions before I on the stream unless some emergency thing comes up and I have to end it but if you can stick around to the end or you can ask a question and then if you have to go that's cool and you can always watch the recording they are available the recordings are available just a few minutes after the stream ends here on the precode camp youtube channel ok so let me switch my screen and I said we're gonna start out in the repository for one of the projects we did a while ago and it's CI reacts and we're going to check out how we implemented a similar search function here and then see if we can use a lot of that code in our project that we'll work on today see pages resources in dependencies okay we actually have this on earth you if you see this this is kind of cool that this pops up but it says there's a vulnerability in one of our dependencies so we are we've already fixed this in a branch we just haven't merged that into master yet so just once you know I'm not ignoring this so this this was actually fixed in another branch before this warning ever even came up but that will be merged into master hopefully soon all right so let me see where you chills okay so what we might want to grab this utility as well let's see how we're doing this and Maki is there we are festive searchterm debounce soars nice okay so we have a lot here and this is all I was a little bit afraid that there would have been jQuery in this because we did have a bit of jQuery in this project so it looks like there is no jQuery very happy about that so okay we have a lot of filters and things that are going on I may bring over all of this because eventually I would like to implement some filters in the search but you probably won't get to that today but I'll bring it over anyway and then we can just you'll hook those up into UI elements when we're ready for it make sure whoops I forgot to start the timer okay so I'm starting the timer now and while I'm copying and pasting this I I want to ask you Oh has anyone done anything with blockchain coding so I'm talking about like what crypto currencies are based on so I recently started doing just some really basic tutorial coding with etherium and it seems pretty cool and there's a JavaScript library that lets you work with that in any a JavaScript app so I'm interested if anybody else is into that or done any work with let me know in the in the live chat or if you're watching this later on let me know in the comments if you if you are working with it I'd like to hear what kind of things you're doing with that especially if you're using using it with JavaScript as well alright so I don't need new categories okay I think this is all I need just go over here I was working on the routing so I I said yesterday I would be working on the routing a lot and that's exactly what I'm doing so what we'll do is let's make another I haven't decided exactly how we're gonna display search results so for now I'm gonna make another page component and we'll do everything there I have some ideas where we may not have a separate page but we'll see so let's do a new file and let's call this search a s and let me let's go to here to our untitled page where we just throw things when we need to and we'll grab let's see this just to give us some boilerplate and let's get rid of that side and we'll copy this move this over give us some space okay so we won't need the query we'll get rid of that and we can keep our head header here and you know it actually let's should we keep this it alright let's keep the CSS for now let's get rid of really our Evaro all of our Apollo stuff we don't need the query we don't need with data okay let's get rid of this and oops I put those in the wrong spot and we actually won't need that at least not right now and let's we're gonna probably need to bring in some stuff as well so we'd be copying pasting a bit more let's save that and let's see yeah so we have this get get json utility so let's bring that over and we even be bounced as well so we'll need to bring in low d bounce okay and maybe we'll use yeah you know what i'm not i think we're using something different yeah we use material you are materialized CSS so i can't use these UI components over again at least not easily all right so let's find this log or this gay json so you chose and fetch okay do we have a utility photo right now I don't think we do okay well let's make that folder then folder and within this folder then we're gonna make a new file and we're gonna call this fetch and we are going to save that now this was made with some earlier versions of a lot of things so hopefully this all still works right and we shouldn't need to do anything else with that for now yes learning the law let's get rid of that okay oh and we need lodash debounce so I just want to verify in our package JSON what we brought over and I am I'm just kind of moving around really fast so please ask questions if you have any questions I'm happy to slow down and kind of review things it kind of in a little bit more depth and explaining what I'm doing and after saying that I'm gonna glanced quickly at the live chat to see if anyone's asking questions about what we're doing right now okay I don't think I see anything about this right now so I do see some responses to what I asked earlier about blockchain stuff and when we take our first break we'll get to that okay so what did we okay so low debounce cool so low has a lot of helpers and things you can use but a cool thing is that you don't need to bring in all of low so in this case we just want debounce so we're just going to bring in D bonds I think that's really awesome that we don't have to pull in you know everything if we're only going to use one thing so we're gonna do yarn add and what else we gonna do sorry I just I was thinking about something I did earlier and I realized I forgot to commit what I was doing before I started the stream it should be okay I just added a few routes in the router so it's not it's not a big deal all right okay so now we should have everything that we need here for these things to work but right now we we're not we really don't have anything going on here was this new JSON oh okay cool I didn't mean to bring this over but this is actually what we're gonna use here so I'm I'm glad that I brought this over because this needs to go up here so search term is gonna go but let me put this in up here so we can split it apart so for now this is where Vivi there we go so we're gonna put this in here and then let's do search okay and I had tested this out with a search term Catholic since this is a Catholic school I figured that would give me some results and let me fill in the rest here okay so what what's happening here is that we're using this multiple post type search so I am going to take a second here to explain what's going on so we're using fetch which if you've never used fetch but you have done some work with JavaScript this this is like it's xhr so if you're familiar that or if you've used jQuery what's a clone jQuery AJAX then there's also libraries like Axios that'll help you do these types of requests but basically you can request data without a page refresh it's really nice for you know form submissions or in this case searching so we're gonna make one of those calls and right now we're giving it the URL so this is the the base URL to access the WordPress sorry uhhuh this is the base URL to access the WordPress API and the WordPress ap got API comes standard with WordPress now so it's not a separate plugin like it used to be if you have WordPress installed you have the API as long as you have one of the newer versions of WordPress so we've installed in WordPress the multiple post type plugin which allows us to search multiple post types so right now we're doing we're searching of any posts that has a type of page any one that has the type of pages anyone that has the type of chapel pages this is just a test We certainly have way more post types and we're gonna end up with a really long URL here but for now this is enough for us to to at least test things up and see okay so now we're just gonna call get JSON all right what takes us back to that utility that we had which is simply just kind of a wrapper around fetch and it's going to give us back the results in JSON format which is nice we can work well with with JSON so you just pass in that entire URL and then we're saving it to state so now within state we'll have data and we can access data the reason I would pass this I would set this as state is that we'll get a refresh so as soon as state updates will automatically rerender that component so as soon as we get the data back it'll trigger the rerender so this allows us you know to immediately show the results it's kind of nice I I don't know if you've ever done anything like this and tried to work it out with jQuery but there's always issues with like when does the data come and you know if you want to do different things with elements on the page like making sure the timing is right and everything happens so that you don't end up trying to select an element that doesn't even exist yet so with this you know with react we don't worry about the data comes in and then now we do a rerender with this data so some of the other things that we're doing with this is we're doing a debounce search so we don't have a I didn't put in a search input yet but what will happen with search input is it'll run these searches while you're typing so we don't want it to run like constantly that would make way too many calls so what we're doing is just kind of slowing down like how many searches happen and you can check out the lodash debounce page so if you type in lo D balance you can get all the more information about exactly how that works all cool no way I didn't realize that this would tell me so anyway Visual Studio code is telling me a lot of stuff about debounce and it's telling me the parameters this is insane how did I not notice this stuff before this is so useful Wow Wow it even gives me saying check out this article for more information wow so crazy Wow did anybody else realize that okay so we're getting results results this this might make more sense once we actually put the input in but okay so on submit the first thing we're doing is preventing the default behavior all right which makes sense because we don't normally a submit of a form causes a page refresh but we don't want that to happen right so we got to prevent that and then we're gonna actually start the search so you can see down here we have this fetch search term and if we take the value of that search input which we will make and then we run this right I'm gonna skip over a lot of these filters because we're not gonna use them yet yeah so shows okay so this happens on submit' but then we also call this on while on the on change event so while we're typing this debounce search gets cold and it'll also run this fetch search term and I think I probably would have named this differently if I was doing it again but anyway there's we're not fetching the search term we have the search term we're actually running the search but anyway I'm uh gonna rename it right now all right so I'm gonna check how much time we have in this session so okay cool we have enough time so let's build out a little bit of the the UI so that we can enter in some data and do a search and then get some of that data back okay B I should yeah let me see if I can copy and paste a lot of what we have in in this repository now as I mentioned earlier we're using a totally different UI framework but for testing purposes I can probably just copy and paste some stuff over the styles won't work but it should at least let us do a search and then we can work out how to make it look pretty after we know that it works so pages resources let's check this whereas a search okay here's our form nice okay I think that's all we need cool alright let's paste this in here and let's see how this looks and let me see if I can just go to the search page if it'll let that happen nope okay so our yeah so we're gonna have to change the router a bit to let direct this page where it needs to go hmm I haven't thought about this and we're doing the router before so server da Jas file so let's see see how we need to do this I don't think this will work just like that let's sort the shot whoa what did I do oops you know what I forgot to share the anger uplink today so I'm gonna share that as well and your export you use compose maybe that's just not important maybe okay yeah it's trying to get search pages export kiss Jason was not found and he's so switch hmm all right so compose is not defined just 101 okay oops compose shoot do I need to bring in compose with Apollo I don't think I need to area okay I've forgotten that cool all right so search I wonder if I need this is the most terrible looking search thing I've ever seen all right but we do have the search okay so let's let's console.log our data so let's console.log this state data whoops what am i doing this state data so let's make sure our console is open okay so fetch failed loading okay but it did try to search for the okay so why is this not working interesting well you're not getting anything but this works all right so our our strain to search isn't working so that's what we'll do right after a five minute timer here and let me scroll up and answer as many questions as I can and let's see we have like double the viewers that we had the last time I checked so welcome everyone if you're joining me before I or after I did the the intro so we're gonna do five minutes of question answer then we'll go back into another 25minute session of coding and if you happen to missed anything don't worry you can always watch the recording and and figure out what you know what we did at the beginning Fidel's says will you use the latest features of reacts such as fragment and report or anything for the latest you know what I try to use the latest features like number one if if I hear about them and I read about them when they first come out which I don't always have time to do but I try and then if there's an opportunity to use them in the project I try to so today probably won't be using any of those but you know we have done that in in previous streams sometimes we've we usually update to newer new versions of things immediately and try out you know whatever new stuff makes sense to try out in our projects we have Renato says good afternoon from Brazil and noble savage commented before the stream even started beard with lots of exclamation points and the the bot the bot banned them for five seconds for it but yes my beard is getting a little bit bushier and I knew yesterday who was it Michael mention that in the last video that I did on my channel you can see all the gray hair in my beard a lot so is that you did anybody watch that video is it really bad with the gray hair let me know I mean I I'm okay I'm not worried about my gray hair I worry more about the lack of hair up here than the gray hair down here my kids told me yesterday that I have a lot of hair except on my head so I immediately told my Amazon echo I said Alexa buy Rogaine and let that's like a medicine that's supposed to help you grow hey I didn't really buy it but I was tempted to let's see Nicki says this bracket syntax for react fragments work and create react app yet or do you have to write react off fragment YouTube chat won't let me post the actual syntax I don't know I don't know that we did we try it and create react app yet I don't think we tried it and create react app Nicki says asks about so I was talking about a theory I'm coding and so it's like blockchain and the saying are you using a special language just even gritter has a course on udemy for blockchain aetherium coding so yeah the language let me scroll over and see what language it was I don't even remember no shoot all right so the the tutorial that I was doing is called crypto zombies so it's crypto zombies io which it just seemed kind of fun like it's kind of like a game and you learn as you build out these characters in the game so that's what I'm using so if anybody's interested in doing that with me check out crypto zombies dot IO and so so far I'm only done with like the first like course so I've created one zombie but it was kind of cool it's pretty easy to learn it's definitely a little bit more rigid than JavaScript like you have to define a lot more like beforehand but it's not too hard if you already know about JavaScript you'd be able to fly through you know the first lesson I did the first lesson this like this morning and I don't like less than a half an hour ABI shakes his basic blockchain here as well using javascript not something that I really worked on we'd love to contribute though cool David asked what tutorial was going through so I guess I just answered that solidity that's it Nicki's Nikki has it the name of the language is solidity so that's what I've been been learning all right so the timer's let me write down where I got to in the chat which may be about halfway through the chat so didn't do that low and getting through but we'll get to the rest of it after the next Pomodoro session okay so what are we doing okay this doesn't work let's figure out why this doesn't work so I am going to go over to the plugins that I have in WordPress and make sure that that plugin is there and it's activated it is don't you eat you folks if you alright so let's take this down multiple post type all right I am going to copy and paste the example and let me verify that that is the right IPA just 104 two three six four one five nine okay that is the right IP slug about me let's take this just say about let's try the example was the exemplar Catholic and we're not gonna do page let's do type yeah we should be able to do tape the shy major let me bring up do I have the post type so I don't think I have them up I have that custom plugin and that tells me what all my types are so on my other screen I'm going to bring up that custom plugin so I can just view what types we have make sure I get the the correct names so we so you shall arrest directories so we do the directories for rest and what's the next thing news okay so those are types that we do have alright this is not good this did work alright I actually have let me pull this over just to show you so I tested this out earlier and it did work so oh that's what's different it's saying slug here but we did search so let me change this there we go ok so if we do search it works alright let's go back to our code and see where I messed this up so search alright so in here it actually it does work let's verify let me refresh that ok so this should work and this was the same let me make sure I didn't mess anything up actually I could check the this this will show us what we actually used HTTP colon slash slash question mark search and type equals pose okay all right so it looks like we have the right the right thing being searched for maybe actually I think I have an idea I mean I'm gonna check the live chat see what y'all think well yeah a whole conversation is going on in other languages all right Michael Creole says check search is 32 so it's line 32 so it's this D bounced search cancel hmm okay all right so Michael said checking the error log let me get rid of this then we try this before copying it in there we didn't get anything okay so maybe there is something wrong with this all right let me check them right next to each other multiple posts that question works it was that's crazy they're the same all right let me do this I'm gonna copy and paste this right here so it is going to search this let me save it just to see what we can get here so when we hit search okay all right what am I oh there is something different right yeah there's something different between the two of these what is it alright I'm checking the live chat now you have an extra s Chappell page it may mayor that you're right I do have the extra s but it looks like it looks like it works either way of those so I I mean at least in the browser it could work with or without the S yeah it works with or without the S okay so all right here's what I should be able to do I should be able to figure out at what point it stops being the same with like this there we go there it is admissions page instead of admissions pages let's see which one is admissions page all right so let's see come on ok so now we at least know that our our string here for the URL it does work in the browser so it's just not working here all right okay so yeah just to verify oops let's remove this yep and they are the same now okay so let's take this up and take this out well actually let me let me just go back there we are and admissions pages and chapel I'm an admissions page and Chapel page okay let's see all right cool hey Harsha what's up we're just get chase on defined let's see so get JSON we're bringing it in up here in utils folder so let's bring it up area get JSON you import isomorphic fetch is the Ito's fetch import correct yeah I don't all right let's let me look at this Aragon okay so we are attempting to make a get request right the import fetch from isomorphic fetch Narsingh expand get function are let me let me give you the the end rot link to in case you wanna check that out hey we got it to work okay cool alright let's put some of this data in here title rendered alright let's try to get a title rendered for each of these nikki says so what was the Tet the fix I alts have for a second I don't even know I don't know what I I think the problem was I kept searching for just some nonsense and so I was getting back an empty array and then when I search for a term that I knew would give a result then I got a result so I could let me yeah that was fetch failed fetch failed yeah actually it keeps telling me it failed no matter what but if you look at the network I get status 200 okay success true I don't I don't know what's happening here III don't understand all right well let's just display a little bit of this quickly so I don't have much time in this session so let me just go to go here and say oops um I don't need that I'm in the layout so let's see all right so I'm not talking cuz I'm just trying to get this done before the timer comes up so key items how to render okay okay cool there we go all right it works all right so I can't believe I got that in before the time ran out all right so here's here's what I did I just said if this state data exists then I want you to map over all the items so remember this state data is an array of objects so I want you to map over everything and then we just use an arrow function so it's going to be inside this map so for each item that's gonna represent a different object so I just did a div I put a key on there or else react complains that there's no key so I just use the ID and then since I'm used to using the WordPress API I knew exactly where this was which which helped so item title rendered gave us the data we needed so now when we search we get the titles so let's try it out with a different search term Chappell awesome so Chappell and students great so we're getting different search items based on that why are we only always getting ten all right I'll have to work on that but basically it worked we have a search function now we can't do that much with it but we have it and it works so awesome so now let me go back to where I was in the live chat where I left off that last time and I'm gonna go through I'm gonna go through all the rest of the questions mr. Tommy yeah I'm gonna go through all the rest if you have a question or comment please put in the live chat now and I will I'll get to everything in the live chat so the coding portion of this is pretty much over we depending on what questions are we may go back to the code and do a thing or two but for the most we're not gonna do a whole other point or a session of coding maybe tomorrow we'll go back to this and build out the UI and build out some of those filtering options because I want you to be able to be fill to filter this stuff like you're at amazon.com right I want users to be able to just narrowly filter everything to get exactly what they want so actually not I think about it that might be more than one more stream to make all that happen but about will probably work on it frog for the rest of the week and that's something else more important comes up Alexi says hello Jesse are you leveling up as a programmer I think I am I think I'm learning more every day so that's all we can do right just try to keep learning and and keep going what we can so yeah I guess I'm leveling up slowly but surely I don't know but you all let me know does it seem like I'm a better programmer now then a few months ago or or have I gone downhill in my past my prime yet Alexi says you look like a wizard with that beard cool I will I take that as a compliment I like the there's something relaxing about just being able to just stroke your beard like this my wife thinks it's weird she just laughs at me but it's fine and it does protect your face a little bit from the cold and from babies who try to grab your face and give you like battle scars like this one they go to grab your face instead they get a handful of beard so it's definitely functional as well as fashionable every shake says where you copying code from sorry I haven't been that involved with this whole process in the beginning oh okay Oh Annie he answered it already it's a good answer so Nicky says he's taking the code from a previous project he's done it's C I react on github yeah that is so on if you wanted to check out the project we are copying things from at the beginning it's CI react on the github repository that we work from so it's it's a what's it called organization repository so fu fu s marcom M AR CLM is the repository so my personal github is separate from that although I'm the the owner of the repository I guess yeah but you check out there and it's also project one in our series of videos so if you want to watch any of the videos when we first implemented that search function you could go back and check that out trying to think not all of my videos are titled well but I think I did put descriptive titles for that first project Aniki asks how does isomorphic fetch differ from regular fetch so isomorphic fetch so regular fetch works in the browser I mean assuming you have a newer browser where you can polyfill it isomorphic fetch works in on the server with with node so that's why we're using isomorphic fetch as well in kind of thing hmm so we probably didn't need to use it here because this is all happening clientside not serverside but the project where I copied it from we were actually making client and serverside calls not for the search but for loading some other data so that's why it was using isomorphic fetch so we didn't really need to do that but I mean it's nice to have that utility if we do need to use it you know we can use it serverside as well since we're using next we can use it in inside that that props would it lose that function called I can't remember is it props something what is it called and we're not using it here or we using this get initial props function that comes with neck so things in here will run server side and client side Raphael says good afternoon from Venezuela welcome thanks for watching Victoria says where is the past video tutorial help ok so we have a lot of other videos so there's a playlist on the free code camp YouTube channel called live coding with Jesse that has all the videos it's a lot of videos right now so I'm not really sure how you'd want to go about watching them I would say maybe just check out the titles and watch one of the videos that seems interesting to you based on the title also people have told me that it helps to watch the video at like 2 times speed and then just to slow it down if there's something you're really interested in and I'll recommend that I tried it as well I think the videos when you're watching the recording are much better at a faster speed it makes me look better because I type really fast and I talk really fast if you've set it on a faster speed let's see John says fetch and react is so much easier than jQuery AJAX call yeah I agree I think fetch is the easiest way to make Network requests Abhishek says fetch is polyfill for browsers which don't have fetch function it adds fetch function to your browser dice amorphic to your browser period isomorphic is implementation of fetch for both no GS and browser on top of the technical alright yeah exactly so Abhishek was answering the question about the difference between regular fetch and isomorphic fetch so that's exactly right the crap Pathan says I just got here what's so amazing Visual Studio code is amazing when what it where was it with debounce so if I hover over debounce it gives me all this information about the bounce it lets me know what it does and then it also says it recommends an article for me to get more information it gives me all the parameters that I could possibly use and it describes what they do it's really cool right it's right there I mean normally I just look it up on my other screen but being right there is really awesome michael says isn't that up to the author of the extension to write I'm guessing that that is the case I mean I I don't I really don't think Visual Studio code is going out and like searching for this so I'd imagine that's the case but either way it's really cool that this pops up and if it is the the author of this extension then good job on that thank you that's awesome feature John says with that revelation of amazing code feedback in BS code it looks like I may change my editor yeah I mean that that's a really nice feature alright was so there's a lot of conversation back and forth in a different alphabet than I use so I'm not gonna try to translate all of that if anybody wants to if any of those questions were directed to me then let me know but it's just a lot to go through and translate right now so I'm not I'm not gonna do that on the stream I might go after the stream and translate everything Michael earlier I mentioned that Michael had said that you could see my gray hair and my the latest video so I I didn't think I've talked about I didn't mention with the video was so I just went on an interview I interviewed for a position as a fullstack engineer and I did a video on my own YouTube channel which is linked in the description just explaining what the interview was like and then giving some of my thoughts and advice on coding interviews so if you're interested please check that video out and Michael says it wasn't as bad as or no wasn't it Michael says it was only a hair or two Nicky says not as bad as I thought was quite disappointed about that yeah so I don't have that much gray hair you can't really tell in these videos the resolutions not as high but the other video I did was a better camera and so you I guess you could tell they said the grey hair doesn't bother me then less hair on my head bothers me a lot more okay John says that the new bracket syntax for fragments does not yet work and create react okay good to know so I do have some projects that I haven't create react apps some of them we have using next so that's just something we're going to have to keep in mind if we use that to make sure we we think about okay what what are we using with this project will it work okay curious truth asks how much time should I put into CSS early on I actually really dislike it so I'm really having to force myself to work with it and inevitably end up procrastinating I would say and I'm gonna read out some of the answers as well but that others have given but I would say this depending on what you want to do CSS might not be that important for you if you really want to be a frontend developer you are gonna didn't need to know some CSS but you can get away with using some frameworks and focus more on JavaScript and you'll be okay with that and depending on where you work you may be able to get away with that even more if you want to do more of like backend or even be like full stack with a backend focus then you're probably safe to skip over a lot of CSS stuff and just do focus more on JavaScript so it just kind of depends on how much friend do you want to do and then what would job so I guess right now if CSS is holding you back from learning more you're fine to just focus more on JavaScript but if you start to have to have a job that you really wants and you need to use it of course you're gonna have to learn that but not every developer job are you even going to need to use CSS that much if they already have a style guide or certain framework that they use you may not even have a freedom to do very much with CSS so it may not be a big deal depending on who else you have on your team so if you if you're gonna do like freelance stuff and you're going to be expected to do everything on a project then you're gonna need to know CSS so in anyway hopefully that's a decent answer let's see what what everyone else said John says it depends on your goals what kind of developer you want to be CSS as part of the whole design and function process pretty important to have a fairly good understanding okay so also good answer okay so old sauce is explained a little bit about what what they are talking about and I wonder I'm not exactly sure what language that is like I don't want to know now but basically it was just someone asking about like what I was talking about so far okay it's Russian so it looked like Russian hm see Michael Michael put like a little like laughing crying emoji saying we'll be will rebuild Amazon search tomorrow yeah I didn't I didn't realize that when I said it but you're right that does sound ridiculous that I'm gonna do it just like Amazon say I'm not it wasn't my intention Amazon search is way too advanced for what we're gonna do it but we're we're gonna try to make our search more like Amazon search let's see hard should ask if I can test messaging in JavaScript AF which is one of our side projects yeah I could test the messaging and if Michael says the day after that we'll refine Google's algorithm alright jr. says hello from Africa from Senegal I love your live coding Oh awesome thanks for saying that thanks for watching that means a lot when when you all say things like that I appreciate it oh it's so harsh it is saying that most mature packages right those like this kind of thing now if it'll so that's really cool I'm gonna have to kind of try to do this more and hover over things and just see like what would extra info I think this is really useful it may be able to get like extra functionality out of things whereas normally I would just use what I I know and wouldn't take the extra time to look it up you know but this is so convenient you know I may be able to find a parameter that may give me a something better that's cool I like that world says you're only like 30 why do you have gray hairs already I don't know I'm 32 I don't know why like I'm losing my hair on the top and I have gray hair and my beard like what is I don't know what what's wrong with that it's like anyway yeah maybe it's the kids I do have four kids and so maybe maybe they cause my grade you know what it was I used to teach high school that's what did I'm convinced that's what did it I taught high school for like almost four years that must be it does that is teaching high school students is super stressful it's so stressful so I'm gonna blame it on that I mean maybe I could blame it on semicolons but now that I use you know standard style I don't have semicolons so I'm a lot more relaxed all right well I have made it to the end of the live chat horseshit I see I was just reminding me to test the messaging I will I will do my best to test the messenger okay so I'll be back tomorrow I don't think we have not we I don't think I have any meetings going on tomorrow so should be able to stream at the normal time and we'll be working on this search again and refining it a bit in the meantime I'm just going to be adding new things to our routing functions so you get more of the site accessible from the proper URLs and I'll be working on making sure all the data is formatted correctly in WordPress or as correctly as we can get it at this point so in the meantime if you have any questions you can always reach out to me on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook or wherever else you can find me or comment in this video if you if you're interested at all in the interview process so I just went through please check out my youtube channel and watch the the latest video and so until tomorrow let's have a great day
