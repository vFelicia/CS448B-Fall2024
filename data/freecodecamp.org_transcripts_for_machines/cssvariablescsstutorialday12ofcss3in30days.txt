hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day number 12 and we are going to be playing around with something called css variables there's also you can call it custom properties uh but that's not as exciting css variables especially for uh developers and designers out there who are familiar with variables in languages like php or jquery or even using css preprocessor languages like sas and less and scss where you use variables it really extends the functionality of css or whatever programming language you're using that are using the variables so in this case we're just going to be using plain vanilla css3 but you do have access to something called custom properties or aka css variables so jump over here in our browser we're just going to be coding a couple simple boxes nothing crazy but the neat thing about this everything we're doing here from the measurements to the colors are are used and created or styled rather via custom properties or css variables so why don't we just jump in and get started so here in my code editor i'm back with atom hopefully it behaves well we have day number 12 css variables go ahead and download that folder open it up in your code editor and then let's jump right back in here in the index you're just going to see the usual that we've been using these past 12 days and just down here you're gonna see in the section just two divs one with the class of box and one with the class of box box two and of course you can go down to the final result and check out uh how that's coded up in the final css there are a lot of comments and notes in here to help you understand why we are doing certain things explaining the custom properties and everything like that but what we're going to concern ourselves with is this file sandbox.css as usual and we're going to get started let's start off by selecting the sandbox class and within there what we're going to do is declare three different variables or custom properties and the way this works with custom properties in css is the when you define that specific custom property within a selector it is its scope is that selector so if you wanted the these variables to be accessible across the entire website and all styles you would use a selector like body or something like root is another selector the root element of a tree representing the document you can use those selectors if you want these specific variables to be accessible throughout the entire document something like a color or a font size or maybe branding specifically branding colors but we're just going to use in this case sandbox so all of the variables are its scope is this selector so the variables won't work if i am trying to use those variables on elements outside of sandbox so this is how you start a selector sorry this is how you start a variable you start out with two dashes and then you name the variable so i'm going to say primary dash color and i'm going to say orange red another variable here i'm going to say secondary color dash color that is hot pink and then double dash base dash measurement 20 pixels so three variables it's not going to do anything if i save this and check it out in the browser it's not going to actually do anything because those aren't actual styles they're just variables now let's go back down here and let's access the variable like so so i'm going to select the sandbox and then box so these are both of the boxes and let's just first of all text align center and now what we're going to do is let's actually add one more variable within sandbox box so now this variable is only accessible within this particular scope within box within sandbox so you can't actually use it outside of this selector or these elements rather so i'm going to say double dash text color it's going to be f3 f3 f3 okay now here's how we access the variable so i'm going to say color and we have to open it up with var and then opening and closing parentheses and then a semicolon of course and then all you do here is just call the name of the variable that you created double dash and text color text dash color now if i save that and then go over to the browser you're going to see that you cannot see the text and that's because it is the same color as the background in this case or pretty close and it's centered so we know that that variable is working let's continue and style the background and we're going to say var open closing variable or var double dash primary dash color and let's go ahead and say margin and whoops there we go and i'm going to say var this one's going to be base dash measurement which as we know is 20 pixels so go ahead and save that check it out in the browser now it's doing something the background is that primary color which is orange red and the base measurement is of margin is 20 pixels it is working so this is nice so now one other cool thing that you can do with the measurements is you can actually do math by using the calc function so let me show you how to do that height we're going to say var and then base measurement das dash measurement but we don't want to just leave it there let's wrap this in calc and then semicolon and we're going to calculate this but then we actually have to perform a calculation so outside of this so this is the first argument here and there's one more times we're going to say times 10 so we're going to calculate the var base measurement or the base measurement times 10 and that should equal excuse me 200 pixels and then i'm going to copy that paste it i'm going to change this to width i want it to be the same because it is a box and then i want the line height to in fact be the same as well now if i save that i should have perfect boxes head over to the browser there we go all using the variables and the css here let's check it out what shows up so we've got box and then if we look at the styles it actually is showing up as var text color primary color measurement it's actually showing those variables it's not showing the final calculated number in there at least in this developer tools there and so i find that pretty interesting um now let's do let's go back to our code editor and we're gonna do one final thing here if you scroll down beyond that we're gonna say sandbox and then box two we wanna make that color of box 2 different background we've already set up a variable for it var double dash secondary dash color save that in the browser we've got our orange red box number one and our hot pink box number two the colors and the measurements are calculated and created using custom properties also known as css variables that is exciting i hope that shed some light and some insight on some cool things that you could do with css variables instead of having to go in and create uh you know install preprocessors and different uh css languages like sas and less for certain projects that might not be that necessary or too much uh work maybe just a simple landing page and you just want to get something up quickly you can use css variables make sure you check at the bottom of this page here you can see the css3 styles how compatible they are with major browsers if you click that it'll take you to a page called can i use and then you can type in something like css variables custom properties it permits the declaration and usage of cascading variables and style sheets and you can see here how compatible they are so with ie11 it's not supported uh oh well and edge it looks like it's partial support and full support here on 16 firefox fully supported chrome fully supported safari opera ios safari fully supported opera mini not so much android 56 yes uh 4.4 no and chrome for android so we're pretty darn um covered here so that's pretty neat uh you can see up here the percentage here so the global percentage is about 77.9 percent um compatible so you can rest assured that you're pretty safe using css variables also known as custom properties i hope this lesson was exciting for you and gave you some ideas and quick hot tip if you want to get access to all of these 30 lessons all at once rather than waiting day by day maybe you're ready to take on a challenge and get everything all at once all you got to do is pay five bucks you get all the 30 days plus a full 30 day membership to code college where you get access to all of my coding courses ever and just for five bucks and then after that 30 days if you want to stay then it's just 34 a month afterwards you can cancel at any time basically it's a subscriptionbased model think netflix for coding tutorials and if you don't want to keep going then all you got to do is cancel before that 30day window is up so once again all you got to do is head to brad hussey.ca css3 there should be a link up here on the screen go ahead and go there you'll get the first month membership of code college for five bucks that'll get you all the 30 days of these lessons plus every coding course i've ever made and you can have a heyday there and if you want to stick around then it's just 34 bucks a month hope to see you in there if not i'll see you tomorrow for day number 13. bye now
