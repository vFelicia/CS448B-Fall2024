in this video i'll be introducing another algebraic law of sets the distributive law the distributive law is simply saying that the set and operation will be distributed over another set in operation for instance a intersection b union c equals a intersection b union a intersection c so i thought it might be helpful to use uh venn diagrams for the conceptual idea of this and then i'll do a separate video on the actual definition so if we look at a here and we separate a and then we decide to separate b union c then when we actually go to find the union or the intersection of these two regions it's easy to see that it is this region so hopefully for the purposes of equality this region here will match this region here so let's get right to it we have a intersection b so we have the set a and the set b so that means that a intersection b is going to be this region here and we have to also find a intersection c so that's this region and if we take the union of those two regions then we're left with all this jazz so it looks like they are in fact equal but to be more rigorous we'll uh revisit the actual definition of the intersection in the unions in the next video
