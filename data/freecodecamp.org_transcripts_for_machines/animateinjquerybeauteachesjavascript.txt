in jQuery the animate method performs a custom animation of a set of CSS properties this method changes an element from one state to another with CSS Styles the CSS property value is changed gradually to create an animated effect only numeric values can be animated such as margin being 30 pixels string values cannot be animated um such as when you're setting the background color to blue or red or something like that so here's the basic syntax here so first you're going to have your element selection and then it's going to be animate and then you're going to pass in your properties your CSS properties that you want to change and then there's three optional things you can pass in the duration easing and complete that's just a callback function that it calls when the animation is complete and there's also another syntax uh this one where you pass in the properties just like before and then you pass in the options this is just a JavaScript object you pass in with V various key value pairs for different options this just allows you to have a little more control than the first method because there's a lot of different options you can pass in almost all the options have to do with calling a callback function at various points in the animation if you want more information about the options you can use for that you can check the link in the description so let's look at this example down here well first of all on our page we just have the the Run button and the hello div block and then I just have some basic CSS in here to style things our JavaScript down here we're going to select the the go button and we're going to add a click function so on click it's going to run this function here now inside the function we are going to select the block which is the the hello block and we're going to run animate the first thing we pass in is the properties we have some key value pairs that show the CSS property we're going to animate over the course of the animation it's going to put all these CSS properties to this value so it starts at opacity 100% but we're going to set it to 50% so it's going to start at 100% And gradually go to 50% here margin left now uh just so you know on CSS it would be margin Dash left but in jqu you take off the dash and then you capitalize the first letter of the second word so you can see we use a slightly different thing instead of margin left 50 it's margin left plus equals 50 so it's just going to add 50 pixels to whatever the margin already was for the opacity it's always going to go to 50% and then height it's also going to go to a specific thing 400 pixels and then the next item you pass in is the duration so I pass in 3,000 that's 3,000 milliseconds or 3 seconds then we pass an easing easing is either going to be swing or linear swing is the default so if you don't pass in anything here it'll just be swing or linear so linear just moved at a constant rate swing kind of eases in a little bit to the beginning and the ending and then the complete that's the Callback function we're going to add at the end which we are going to select this which is the div block that we're animating and after that we're going to add another HTML code we're going to add this animation complete div so let's uh see what this is going to look like hit the Run button and you can see the opacity changes the margin left changes the height changes and then the animation complete runs at the bottom now let's see what happens when I hit the Run button again so as you can see the opacity did not change the height did not change but the margin left changeed when I press the Run button again that's because we have this plus equals 50 so just adds 50 to whatever the value was but the other values are just set so it's not going to change those things and you can see it added the animation complete div at the end again so there's two of them now I'm going to take off this easing one so it's going to default to swing so let's see what that looks like it's just a little different so you can see just at the beginning and ending of the animation it's a little slower now I'm just going to actually change this animation to show you how you can chain animations so I'm just going to get rid of all this and then I'm going to do animate we're going to set the width to 90% I'm just going to copy this and then paste it a few times we're going to change the font size so now you can see I've changed these animations so we're going to change the width then the font size then the Border left left width let's see what that looks like so you can see it ran one animation after the other when you just chain them by adding animate and putting the next animation there and obviously within each animation you can animate more than one property but this is just an example with one property okay that's the basics of the animate method in jQuery again check the link in the descriptions for the other options you can use to pass in which are mainly about different callback functions you can use at various points in the animation my name is Bo KS thanks for watching don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
