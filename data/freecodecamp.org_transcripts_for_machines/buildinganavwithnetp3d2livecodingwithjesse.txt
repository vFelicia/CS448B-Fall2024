hey everybody its Jesse and in this stream you all can watch me would do my daytoday work I'm just a frontend developer to university and this is not scripted at all and so I'll make mistakes and try to work through them and hopefully we can help each other and and learn together so today we're gonna continue with what we were doing yesterday and that is trying to turn this header into something that looks like this so today I think we'll we'll just work on this header portion we'll save the side nav for another day because I don't think we'll get through it all in one stream the main site that the main goal is to make this site run more quickly so we'll load it up here not bad that was a little bit faster than usual the internet connection is good here and this site is hosted on campus so shouldn't be too much of a round trip but you can see the current site this is gonna change significantly we went over a lot of the changes in yesterday stream so if you missed that you could check that out probably and it'll be in the first half of that stream so this is a copy of that page with most of the stuff removed so I haven't done that much since yesterday let me show you what I did do so yesterday one of the last things we did was make a test version of this main nav component and we had it connected to the main nav dot cs5 whoops and I just noticed I put two dots in there so let's let's rename that now before before it messes something up sorry about that my phone's ringing I don't recognize the number so I'm just gonna let it go okay so now that has the correct name and what we've done is we've brought imported this in here as maintenance so the reason I did that is because I was looking through this a little bit and there were some areas where I thought we may want to change the mark up like for instance you know we do have some you know some HTML you know that we may want to change so I figured you know I may as well make a test page you know first if if you weren't watching yesterday an important thing to know about this project is that this file structure that you just saw a second ago here these are the live files for the site so there is no test site there's there is something that they call a test site but it shares all the same files so I'm not really sure what what about it is a test site I think maybe it has a different database but so that's why we have to make copies test copies of all these files before we make anything go alive all right so let me check out the live chat just say hello to everyone before we get started hey everybody alright so the way I divide up things in this stream is with a Pomodoro timer so I'm gonna start this and we're gonna do 25 minutes of coding and then I'll do five minutes of answering questions in the live chat and I'll check back in periodically during the coding into live chat especially if I need some help or you know if I if I get to a point where I think someone might have something to say then I'll check back over there but otherwise if you ask a question during that 25minute period just hang in there and I'll do my best to get to it during the five minutes after we do probably about two Pomodoro sessions then I'll take the end of the stream and answer any questions that are left over that I didn't get to so if you could stick around to the end your question will be answered eventually and if you can't stick around to the end go ahead and ask it anyway and then you can catch the recording later on it's also not a bad idea just ask a question whenever I am coding and there are a lot of people in the live chat that are so knowledgeable more knowledgeable than me and on a lot of things and they can help you out as well okay so let's get started I think I saw some new some new names I haven't seen before in the live chat so if you're new welcome thank you so much for for joining joining in the live chat and for watching alright let's get started well one thing that we're definitely going to have to do is change the structure of this of this navbar I mean this is the HTML was significantly different so that's what we'll work on first I'm also using materialize the materialized CSS framework to do this so we're gonna bring that in I'm so I'm hesitant to bring in another framework on a site that's already really slow but we're already loading jQuery so we're not adding anything by using a framework that's going to need jQuery as well and we can't get rid of it there's just too much on the site already that's using it so since we already have jQuery I think it'll be all right what we'll probably end up doing is after we get everything looking how we want we can go through the materialized JavaScript and CSS and remove anything that we're not using and get those file sizes down you know as small as we can but I think the benefit of being able to use a lot of the things that are built in to to materialize is is do not outweigh our you know any you know slight increase I think you know in load times you know it'll be it'll be minimal okay this is also officially project three now in the video so in the titles of the videos I'll I'll put in parentheses at the end of each title it'll be p3 for project three and then I'll put D this is day two so it's D two that way it'll be a little bit easier to keep up I'll probably make a playlist once I get a few more videos I'll make a playlist specifically for this project this project we may have to work on a little bit and then do some other stuff and then maybe come back to it you know this is a really large site it's going to be an ongoing project I'm gonna move this over to my other screen and I'm also gonna move this over because dev tools is probably going to be more useful at this point and also my my editors so at first let me grab let me get Adam also I finally figured out four on project two I figured out how to position that I that checkbox icon so if anybody's interested in how I did that just ask it in the live chat and I'll get to it during one of the question questionandanswer sessions so it actually it took me three times as long as I estimated that it would take it was quite frustrating but I finally got it to the point where it it works and it looks the way I wanted to look okay so here's the Trello board for this project a lot of stuff going on here I'm not sure if I even have one for the header right now I'm not gonna worry about this now the reason I scrolled over was to get to this so this is the the project that you just saw the the goal header right how we want it to look so I want to grab the markup for that that nav from here bring it over and then we'll go from there and trying to plug in the data from the content management system and the the CMS that we're using is called Ektron it's it's pretty old so we'll see how it works we're just gonna have to learn it as we you know how things are put together as we go along alright that's the side now we're not gonna mess with the side nav right now okay so I think this should be it if we just grab this nav element and we can double check mmm actually we're gonna need we need this div as well we need to grab the entire header let's bring over the entire header we're gonna need to do it at some point anyway so you may as well do it now like I said we're not really gonna work on the side nav for now mmhmm that's interesting I think I can safely take that out everything's working it's been commented out for a while okay I was just thinking we could potentially split this up into two different components but I I think it'll be easier to start out with just to put it all in the main nav component and then if we we feel like it's too much at some point we can always split it out at that point okay so now that we have that we shouldn't really need to come back to this except maybe to grab maybe some some of the materialized code I want to see where I'm loading this if I'm using a CDN or not okay so I am importing the JavaScript from a CDN but I want to get the latest version so we can just go on materialized and figure out where the latest versions are okay so let's go I'm gonna leave this in for now and we're just gonna have to edit this to make it work with with our search bugs all right I think hmm alright all of this is commented out I'm gonna get rid of this because we can always refer to it in the version the nontest version of this in case there's something that something in here that would be useful to us but for now I'm just gonna get rid of all of this yeah we're just gonna get rid of the nav I guess we can't I want to keep some of this down here so this this template so everything inside this repeater I do want to keep for now just to reference it but all of this can go let me know if the font size is big enough area okay so that's everything and I should be able to paste the the indentation on this is not great let's bring it back a bit so I'm using Visual Studio code for this which I don't normally use so it's that's a little bit of a different feel to it so I'm still kind of getting used to that all right let's see all right so let's paste this in now and so we do have some of the header and the nav so we can get rid of we can get rid of this nav and I guess this ul I guess Oh worry about indentation later I'm gonna take that out it's comment it out so probably don't need it and that's where it's it was closed we'll take that out as well and here's our huge side nav okay this is what I wanted so now we got down to here let's take take these two out since we deleted deleted them up there these are just closing text what will be deleted and let's grab you know what let's remove this and we'll just pull up the other version of this the live version and then we can put it over here and and just look look on refer to it on that side so let me bring this okay alright let me scroll down good so this is what we we want to bring in this repeater and then there's a template for our for our links in here so we kind of just want to break this down try to figure out what's going on and what data is being imported hopefully the names are gonna be descriptive enough that we'll be able to tell what's you know what's going on we may have to just kind of look around a bit and refer to the site and and figure it out but we should have all the data that we need you know just from these from this template basically to populate our new nav so the the social media I think I mentioned this yesterday all the social media links we're just going to keep them as is and we'll just hard code the URLs I think right now there's yeah I don't even have URLs in there right now so we will hard code those in there and I'm okay with that let's see what we really want we really need to worry about pulling in dynamically or these links the donate button can be hard coded and probably these ones these ones can be are coded this about academics admissions faith life those are not likely to change it's more these she's interior links actually these aren't likely to change it may be a lot easier than I thought to put in the new header will be the tricky part as the side now so we may actually get get to the side enough we'll see we'll see how tough it is to get this header working you know we still still haven't even tested it we do need to hook up this search input so we need to see how it's working here and try to pull in all the same values and see if it can work here as well so actually bringing in this text box search I'm checking the I'm just shade a live chat briefly okay I think this is probably we're gonna have to find this because I want to make sure that's interesting I must have I must have opened up the site in dev tools and pulled in the names from into there which was okay and would normally work but I'd rather pull it in here since we can get these values kind of more directly so let's try to find this textbox let's see let me get out of mode so I can get it to here so what was that called again it was the text text box let's see if we can find it okay this is some of the search stuff but not not the text box okay I was hoping it was in there but I don't think it is so let's see where else hmm I want to check out what gets what the output of this is if it's just simply an input then we don't really need to know anything else so and that'll be fine is we'll just put in these these values so let's look at the site in dev tools then alright so this is the inputs let me make sure whoops alright so it is this day of his header search so within that div yes all we have is just the input great alright then we don't really need to find out where this textbox is coming from let's just plug in these values that we need so probably the easiest thing will be to just copy this whole thing and paste it in there and we'll make sure we add the right class names for our styles to work so we want the placeholder I guess it can be can be searched with the dots that's fine name search type search class okay that looks good I actually don't really have any any other class name so this will be perfect okay great and that should be it the search should work now you can see there's nothing else you know being pulled in here this is just plain HTML the same way with this this icon here so all this should be fine great now while we're doing this we should probably put it in the side nav as well since I'm I have a search input in the side nav so let me double check to see if I have anything different going on I don't think so so let's put that in there as well all right now that's ready and those should work we could actually I wonder what this looks like now that we've been kind of messing around with it put it up pull with put this on another screen okay we're definitely getting some errors here let me pull this over to show you the areas that we're getting I do want to double check and make sure that none of those errors are are bleeding over into the main site okay good it still loads the site's really buggy so sometimes I'll change something that seems like it should be fine and not affect anything I mean just extremely simple things will be changed and large portions of the site will just go down and display something like this so I want to be really careful about you know doublechecking this is our main website it you know it gets a lot of traffic you know in the millions of visits there going on a yearly basis you know millions so it's by far the most visited of all the sites that that I work on here for the University so you know realistically if that if I accidentally took the site down potentially we could lose money from donors and from potential students so it's worth the caution all right so let's see an error occurred it's already used by another control oh okay maybe we are gonna have a problem since we have things with the same ID yeah it could be a problem what ID did we have before let me check this yes folks we're gonna have to think think about what we want to do then for the search actually let's let's check this out right now I think there is a like a mobile search so I'm interested to see what what happens there so let's shrink this down and click search and let's see if it's the same input or what's going on there is there an ID I'm not seeing an idea at all okay so it's mobile search box mobile search placeholder search I tell you what I'm gonna do what I think might be the simplest thing just to test this out would be just to change the ID and yeah we'll just change the ID and see what happens and see if we can get it to work we should be able to check yeah if what we could possibly do is just have to two functions here and this is in I believe csharp I don't have very much experience at all the C sharp so if I'm messing up any terminology I apologize and please let me know what with the the right way to talk about this stuff is all right so let me search clear okay I'm just checking to see if these exist somewhere else in in the same file I'm just not sure how how these link up where did this come from that's just okay so that's just hanging out at the end here interesting hmm yeah I'm not exactly sure how rights to the on click that's firing off this function its button search click the on click handler is down here on this button with the class button search but this is what's actually visible to the user so I'm just trying to figure out how these are linked up interesting let me I want to check to see if there's okay okay here this is that button and we can see it's not there's there's nothing it's um it's not visible hmm you know what I bet the answer's up here I had forgotten that there was some code up at the top some JavaScript so we'll see okay so they're grabbing the textbook search so this key press 13 I think is enter so if they're gonna hit enter then it's going to okay then it's gonna just click using jQuery it's going to click the button search alright interesting so they have a hidden submit button and they're just using jQuery to make that button get clicked that works I definitely I don't think I would do it that way but I'm not upset about it because I understand what's going on so so that's good where's actually this is interesting too they have this commented out where's this function it looks like they changed it okay my timer went off so I'm gonna do my five minutes of a question answer in just a second but I just wanted to see if you all see this it's really interesting let me switch this to JavaScript for a minute we get some highlighting here we go and that'll be a lot easier actually this is not bad let's see how that's I might just leave it as JavaScript highlighting because that looks pretty good so if you check this out so our button search click it's at one point it seems like maybe this was the way they had set it up and then they changed their minds which which makes sense like I said this is not the way I would have done it but they changed their minds and they grabbed the value and then run this function to do the search and it's actually changing the URL of the page and then just adding the search value as a query string right at the end of the URL so that's how they decided to do the search so really we can get rid of we can get rid of all this stuff that's not in use and just kind of make this smaller clean it up we can also get rid of that button and now that we know how this works it really doesn't matter much what we're going to do with that mobile search because the search essentially is just it seems like it's all taken care of here I want to double check all right when we come back from the five minute break for questions the first thing I want to do is well I want to remove this button our test file but then also in our CS file I really I want to look at this and try to figure out what's going on and if this is even being called at all because I think the answer is no I think that this is not even in use so that we could also remove this and yeah we could remove this or potentially we could get rid of a lot of this jQuery and then make use of this I'm not sure what the best one is but let me know anybody especially that knows more about you know kind of dotnet stuff than I do which is probably anybody that knows anything about death let me know what do you think the best way to do this would be it may not matter what is it better to use jQuery to change the location and we could refactor this and not use jQuery if we really wanted to but I think we're gonna we're gonna need it for other places on the site so I don't think it would be useful to get rid of it or is it better to do it like this yeah look let me know what you think so let me start boobs I'm gonna start my fiveminute timer I'm gonna do whoops sorry my camera first I just just now saw that yeah so if you remember if you're watching yesterday you know my camera kept freezing and I had to just restart it this is just the builtin camera on my iMac monitor so um I don't know what to do about it we'll see if it keeps doing this and it's a problem all I might just get another camera alright so I'm just going up to the top of the live chat I'm gonna run through and just try to find the questions and get as many as I can in Abdullah Abdullah not exactly sure how you pronounce the end of that so sorry that says what's the best laptop for coding yeah it depends on what operating system you like to use which is so smoke one says also mentions that depends on your operating system I really like a my macbook pro I think it's great to work on it starts up it's fast it has good battery life I've been less than impressed with a lot of the Windows laptops that I've had before but I don't think it's a fair comparison because I've never bought a Windows laptop that would that was as expensive as a macbook pro so if I were to buy a Windows laptop that was that expensive maybe it would be as good or better I'm not sure i've never used Linux on a laptop so I don't know but my next laptop purchase you know for my own personal use is probably going to be Linux I'd really like to try it out but I do have a MacBook I think it's like a 15inch MacBook Pro and it was the last model that still had the the HDMI connection and that's been really useful for me because so many things hook up through HDMI so I really like that I don't remember what year that is maybe 2015 or something like that so the newer models have that that touch bar thing which that's pretty cool too but I think everything's done through USB see connectors so for right now it's somewhat of a problem because you know a lot of your older things don't don't use the USB see so you need a lot of adapters then anyway that's my as my thoughts on it not really technical but those are just some of my observations no Bo says Jessie can you give us the code that you have local on localhost yeah so let's see I figure you're probably talking about was that I've lost that that here you know anyway I'm pretty sure you were talking about that example site that we were that I was showing and I do have that code available so let me find the repo for you so I remember what the name of it is okay so here's the repository so I haven't done this is just the initial I just wanted to put this on github so you all have it so here it is I am I definitely wanna update materialized because this is using an older version so I want to update that that'll probably one of the first things I do to change this and then we're also going to be developing a lot of the UI elements here because we can make use of my local development environment will develop it here and then transfer it over into the test versions the test files that we have for the actual site and plug in the values that we need you know into the templates so we'll basically convert these into templates that will work on the site but it's going to be a lot faster to get them to look how we want them to look here locally and then move them over so that'll kind of be the the workflow we'll just switch over and try to go you know one component at a time but I will put this in the live chat and actually I just saw Umberto has a bunch of comments so I'm assuming I did something wrong usually when I see a lot of comments like that it means I did did something wrong so let me see all the web forms suggestions okay so let me let me read a little bit of what Umberto said because it's definitely it it's useful and it pertains to you know a lot so if you don't know from being in the live chat Umberto he knows about csharp and he's actually doing his own YouTube videos so about that which I may be watching those I want to watch them anyway but now I may really want to be watching them so that I can can know how about having to work on this project alright so let me read out what he said so he said basically said you might really want to create a separate folder with its own web config and remove the custom errors from the main web config when you add an SP control and give it an ID that ID is available as an object in the code behind ASP uses a feature where you can make a handler by using the ID underscore handle events signature and the code behind so awesome so that definitely explains a lot of what I was trying to guess at so sorry about that I should have looked over and saw that that would have saved me a lot of time so yes that's a basically what's what's going on here then is we can let me read this I get it right to explain this you all give it a 90 days it's an object alright so yeah so we can have the ID which was okay so we have button search right click so on button search click then it's gonna it's gonna run this right so and you can get the event so that's what's going on here that's how they they were connected up oops there we go sorry that's it okay yeah now I remember so we did end up figuring that out at some point because we have this on click of button search click right but we can also get right so this was the ID I'm not gonna scroll but I'm pretty sure that was the ID so Umberto was saying that the the ID is available as an object in the code behind so that's what we can get this txb search dot text so I wasn't sure how that exactly that was available but that's evidently yet that's normal for ASP so I just paid you okay cool that makes more sense now thank you Umberto let me right down where I left off at in the live chat so I can go back to it actually we just had a I had another someone had another question about the the link for sorry I'm trying to type and talk at the same time there was one other question about the link to the very first video where I talked about this which was I actually had done months ago on my channel so I'm gonna put that link in the live chat right now and I'll have to remember to put that into the description of the video or something but that link that I just posted in a live chat that will take you to the video on on my own channel where I introduce this website and I talked I kind of go through it in a lot more detail than I did yesterday and explaining what's wrong with it and what needs to be done alright so now let's get started with our other session so this will be our last session of coding and I'm bare so I'm I'm not gonna make the umberto recommended making a separate folder with its own web config I'm not going to do that right now because I think that'll be involved and I'll make a lot of mistakes and I don't so I don't have time for that so it will either be maybe for tomorrow stream or I'll try to do it before the before tomorrow stream okay so what we're gonna do so I I think we can so I think we can get rid of this oh okay we were going to we were going to see if we wanted to use this and I what I think now let me see if anyone else had any opinions on that okay so I don't think anyone had any opinions one way or the other but I'm thinking I'm Way more familiar with JavaScript and jQuery than I am with csharp so I'm gonna take this out and I'm gonna continue to use the the jQuery I'm just gonna I'm double checking here just to make sure yeah I don't think this is let me know especially Umberto I don't think that this is doing anything here other than basically it was doing the same thing that this jQuery was doing it was just changing the URL so I'll remove that we we have the the other copy of it so if I end up removing something and it really messes things up it will be fine just trying to see if we had that I should have done this now I already checked beforehand whether any you know the name of that anything in there was was elsewhere so I think we're good and now that I already removed this now I can remove this as well great I love when I get to remove lots of code I guess that wasn't a lot of code but still it feels good all right now what we need to do is give this a different ID so Seiden have so we're just gonna add side and have onto the end of that and then up here we're gonna make sure that we actually we're already looking at the text boxers time suits all right I think this will work right so we were getting an error because we had two text box components with the same ID so we changed the ID but the jQuery was actually trying to get the class and it looks like everything's still going to work properly even if they have the same class which is great at first I thought if they were using IDs I would have to duplicate this which which wouldn't be great also we're not gonna we're not going to have a mobile search box so we can remove this and image search I think this is yeah this is a click on the icon which we don't have that icon anymore but let's make sure let me scroll down to our to our text box here and search icon so we're using the class search icon for to make sure we're doing it for both no actually we're not let's add the class actually I'm not sure we may have styles attached to that so I don't want to just add the search class search input well we're not using I guess we do have a search icon up here Oh what is this for I got a double check and see what I did with this with this navbar and I can't it's not this I'll just bring it up like three thousand and is it one yeah that's it all right let me see what I was telling here oh okay that's why I couldn't figure out why I had to SVG's it's the the clothes so I have I have the wrong SVG class Image Search okay great so I've already given this the right class of this image search so let's just make sure we use the same oh we are using the same class all right so we're already good so I had already taken care of that and I'd done this months ago so that's why I did not remember at all so that should still work so if you see we're already looking for that that class and then we have a click handler on that class to do the search based on that value so if enter is pressed so this this e which equals 13 that that bothers me that it's only 2 equals I'm gonna I'm gonna fix that so anyway this this will work to do a search so enter will work a click on the search icon will also work and then search button we're not gonna have a separate search button so we can remove that as well we'll keep this here this check and we'll also keep this and so this should all work that we managed to remove a good bit of it and it should still work so let's test it out still getting oh I got a refresh I'm so used to the the auto refresh when I'm working locally that I keep forgetting let's see repeater outer Davis and once again I do want to keep refreshing this just to make sure okay great okay so let's see what line we're on Main Ave test like 33 okay so let's check line 30 whoops yeah I'm 33 okay maybe I just my my first thought on this error is that since the IDS of things are passed automatically here is that something that I deleted the ID was being passed in and used somewhere in here and now that's why I'm getting the error so I guess I'll go through quickly and check this out scroll see I don't think I've seen anything let me check the live chat see if you all have seen anything okay so Umberto's saying taxonomy data looks like a custom class and taxonomy manager okay all right so you're using taxonomy data it's okay repeater outer side we did see this right repeater potatoes let's see all the places where this is just just to see if this maybe has something to do with anything okay alright here's here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna check some of the things the classes of some of the things that I deleted and I'm sorry the IDS just to be sure alright no results and we didn't remove that hmm what did remove I don't know that we really removed anything to remove now we kept that it's double check where is it did I get rid of this repeater completely I thought I left it in and maybe I didn't okay I think that I think that's the reason so it's looking for for this and it doesn't it's not finding it so let's grab let's grab this and we'll just put it in here somewhere so we're probably gonna end up using this in the side nav but for now I'm just gonna throw it in here so that we quit getting the air I just want to test the check pucks or the the search box just to make sure it actually does work so let's see all right let me have okay all right so Umberto's says no space is that a bit yeah no space after the okay I don't know how a space got in there that's crazy look at that how did that happen so there was no space in there and then when I pasted it there was a space really weird okay let's what the heck Oh more spaces let's make sure okay let's see all right cool I can't see the search bar is that okay that makes sense cuz I didn't bring in let's say let's see what the would actually get pulled in the heck is all that okay all right okay okay thinking maybe it's yeah there we go yeah mmm now where's when let me see what mark up I even have in here okay with the header let's go to our main file and see I mean the master let's see where we're pulling that in it Wow what should I see let's see the dead does actually I don't really like how that looks let's let's do it as try HTML that's better okay so my main content so our nav here we go okay our main nav should be in between the utility nav and the utility nav mobile all right actually we don't even want that mobile nav anymore we're just gonna have one nav so let's get rid of that let's get rid of that and I'm not sure what that utility nav is I'll leave it in for now but I think we'll probably be able to get rid of that as well I don't want this see there's a lot of this markup here menu buttons yeah we don't need this mobile search box text box oh yeah we don't need a lot of this yes if any yeah let me get rid of a lot of this since we don't need it you don't need that and yeah we don't need this and we actually we don't even need the header class yeah I think this is probably gonna cause errors but I don't need any of this stuff and then you container I'm getting rid of this all right section gone go book on section yeah get rid of all of that there we go get rid of that and get rid of some of these spaces okay all right so you've got basically what we've done is there was a lot of markup here that is actually taken care of inside of this main nav component now so yeah main nav oh you know what we actually changed the name so that's probably a big reason why why this didn't work that would make sense so I think initially it was main that one and then I changed it to test and I never changed it in here so I may have made enough test tag name a nav okay I left it as made enough and for some reason it's saying may not one so let's put the right name in here if I can find it there you go well actually it doesn't matter now that this is the this is what matters okay so may have and I want to remove the things that we took out of here so that utility now is gone and utility that mobile is gone some of this other stuff is gonna go as well but we'll wait till we get to that point alright let's save that and see what kind of errors we're gonna get all right constant blows out to full okay all right so we're gonna need to get rid of some stuff here in our main test master CS file so let's check that out now all right so where we at line 40 so in line 40 we can get rid of this top header because we totally remove that okay and let's see yeah I'm not worried about that a lot of these these sections are so that they you can control what's in the header through the CMS but I don't need their the parts of the header that need to be controlled will be controlled but that's mainly just gonna be the links and that's only gonna be in the side nav so it's better just to take it out and let's see if anything else everything else seems like it's dealing with a footer okay all right let's try that I'm really surprised that how how easy it is to catch on to what's what's happening so like I said I've pretty much never used csharp before or anything dotnet other than me kind of messing around with it a few months ago but it's well you know they say the programming concepts the concepts remain the same it's just syntax that's that's different alright so I still don't see the search bar but I would like to check out what's going on over here page outer wrapper actually not sure why we're still getting that yeah I don't think we should be getting that bad menu okay so here is our interesting okay so basically we are getting the correct output on the on the screen it's just seems like there's some styles that are either conflicting or just not working because we didn't pull in any of the wow it's just oh it's probably just something simple that I could find in dev tools okay this is the on mobile stuff okay yeah we don't obviously since we don't have the media queries that are supposed to govern this probably what's happening is so the the desktop menu must be hidden somewhere I just can't find I can't find where it's being hidden I guess it would just be there we go show on large now actually now that I think about it none of the classes will work so I'm not sure I'm not worried about it it's showing up here that's just a matter of bringing in the right styles but you can see we are actually getting what we want the main thing that I'm worried about here is checking to see that we we can get that search that search bar so we're let's see where it should be okay so if I search input okay if you look for search input great all right so we do have an input here and it looks like I mean it looks good this looks like it has what it should let's see if we can bring this out somehow to play blog fixed I would say find it no no it's still down there yes okay all right so for whatever reason I can't see anything so let's go over my timer turned off so I'm gonna do well I guess that's it so we're just going to do two Pomodoro sessions today and I have an appointment in a little while and it's gonna take me probably a half hour or so to drive there so I got to make sure whoops my my camera's off again sorry about that so anyway I gotta make sure I'm not late for that that's why I extreme dab it earlier than normal today okay I'm gonna scroll back up to where I was before and answer as many questions as I can I should be able to get to them all it doesn't look like there's too many if you if you can't stick around for the question answer session thank you so much for watching I'll probably be back tomorrow around 200 did it freeze again already never unfroze I forgot to put in my password I keep running I keep running this command it's a pseudo killall VDC assistant every time it freezes and that makes it unfreeze temporarily so anyway let me yeah let me get to the questions if you have a question go ahead and put it in a live chat now and I should be able to get to it here in a few minutes okay okay no beer says I can't install Visual Studio code editor I'm using Windows 8.1 I tried several times to install it but it comes up with an error help me please man I'm not sure I don't I don't have any machines that are running a Windows 8.1 so I've never had anything running it so I'm really kind of at a loss for how how to do things on there but hopefully there's somebody else here in the live chat that has some experience with it all right see okay Alberto says the bad thing about asp.net is that it uses a lot of post backs of page refreshes at least reforms yes I've noticed that every time I do have to do anything with dotnet the whole thing's in a form so I don't know if you notice this but I mean check this out or that so the whole thing is in a form right so let's look at that that's all of our content basically in this form it's just weird what why is it all in a form and then it messes it up so trying to do things within this form like forms within a form it I've always had trouble with this so yeah and the page refreshes are terrible so I much prefer you know sending form data with fetch or with Ajax you know xhr and not having a refresh anyway I'm sure maybe if I knew more about it I it wouldn't be such a big deal and that is probably some way to work with it Harshit says where is this site hosted okay it's it is hosted here on campus in the in a different building that I'm at but probably I don't know less than two hundred yards from me is the server that that hosts this website so it's actually hosted on servers here but hopefully that will change when we redo the site so when we rebuild it will probably rebuild it with react and I don't know what we use for content management maybe WordPress maybe if we can find something else I'd kind of prefer to have something you know nodejs based just to keep the whole stack JavaScript I'm like somewhat thinking about just making my own really lightweight CMS I think that would be cool but we'll see so anyway at that point it'll be hosted elsewhere so maybe I don't know maybe digitalocean AWS I'm really not decided yet as to where it'll be hosted but it'll be something like that okay I'm buried so I see now that you asked if I deleted the repeater yeah that's it and that was in fact the problem so sometimes I just I don't look over fast enough to the live chat but I you're pointing out what I'm what I'm missing even though I don't always get to it right away oh wow I'm there's embarrassing even gave me the line then the number is line 152 thank you so much again I'm sorry that I didn't see it Nicholas asked is the react to the react project to complete its almost complete I worked on just some some little stuff some positioning like UI positioning at UI elements and things the only the only major thing left to do is handle the kind of clean up the email templates a little bit so that an email gets sent to the user who submits a form and it also gets sent to our project manager and making sure that those emails look alright that's about it also you know possibly just some some testing in different devices and things like that but there's really not anything significant that I could do a stream about that I think would be really interesting so that's why I switched over to this so I'll be doing handling those last few things you know kind of earlier in the day and then I'll be doing this for the stream and I still need to get some feedback from people in my department about project two to see what they think see if there's any changes needed it's possible if something comes up that I think would be good to do the stream about then I might go back and you know we'll switch it up and go back to project two and then you know kind of go back and forth and then it'll be you know in the title of the videos it'll it'll say what project it is but basically you know at this point I consider it for the most part done you know I think it could be in in less than a day I think it could be in shape to where you'd be completely ready ready to go all right so Berto says so this ASP control takes a data source the results from a query for example as data set okay and generates the HTML markup for displaying it okay he says you could learn all of the attributes to set for it but usually people resort to using the designer and Visual Studio okay yet so I read there was a manual and Ektron manual that came with this content management system and I looked through it and a lot of the stuff was saying like use the designer in visual studio well I don't I don't have visual studio I've never used it before and I'm I'm just like looking at this like can I just edit the code so I don't know but to me I feel more comfortable just looking at the code instead of trying to learn a different you know editor kind of more like a visual editor hopefully I can do everything that I need to do without having to do that so it's my understanding that vision that Visual Studio for Mac is not the same as Visual Studio for Windows so it wouldn't be it wouldn't be a simple thing for me to get that I'd have to either run Windows like as a second operating system on my Mac or get a better Windows I ever really old Windows laptop for testing and I don't want to run anything on that because it's too slow but it's so far I've been able to do everything in the code that I wanted to do world boss says is dotnet better than JavaScript so far just from my experience I prefer JavaScript but I have very limited experience with dotnet so I guess just take that a consideration when when you hear my opinion on that that I'm probably not the best person to ask I did I haven't I haven't had a fun time whenever I've had to work with dotnet the few times that I've had to work with it I enjoy JavaScript a lot better probably because I know it a lot better Nicholas says okay project three day twos yep that's it so yeah the the p.3d to project three day two so I just decided to shorten it like that because otherwise it adds way too much length to the titles so hopefully it's not too confusing okay let's see so we have somebody new saying hi say nice to meet you but it's in some other characters so I don't really know how to say that so I'm gonna try to translate that alright so sorry if this is wrong if this is not really your name I use Google Translate to try to figure this out so is it Clark John Peel so hopefully that's your name once again really sorry for messing it up but so Park Joe until says hi nice to meet you says I'm so I think they say they're new here so but welcome thank you so much so much for joining us and for saying hi and the latch at okay John John Hanson was saying I should have should add height so when we were trying to find this so I'm not gonna go back and mess with it now but all I'm afterwards I'll try to get this to display so we can see what's going on there okay so Umberto is talking about me posting this stuff on a repo so that he can port it over to MVC so I'm I'm interested in that but I'm just wondering like is that I don't know enough about this to even though what's what's entailed in this but would that work within the system I mean would it be would it work within the Ektron system or would this be something entirely different that would replace it so I'm not sure but I will I'll try to get you the I'll try to make a repo that I can have public the only thing I'm worried about is there's a config file that has like usernames and passwords for the database so I want to make sure that there's no more config files with information like that you know hiding somewhere so I just need to figure it out for sure and then get everything together and then I'll make a Omega repo so I don't know how soon I'll be able to do that but I'll try to get it done you know maybe in the next week or two okay okay Raphael says to work with asp.net webforms you need Windows Plus Visual Studio okay so there probably is some stuff that I can't do or I won't be able to do then alright so hopefully for what I need to do I'll be alright but I don't know I guess that that's kind of good rationale for me maybe getting a new computer here at work so that would be kind of cool I mean I'm still gonna mainly develop on my Mac because I'm used to that I like it but it might not be a bad idea to have a good Windows machine as well we'll see if I ask they probably just tell me to have the new web developer and the IT department handle everything because they're getting the new the new web developer gets a new Windows PC and the Mac okay all right I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so I'm gonna wrap this up I I wanted to say something now I'm forgetting oh oh I want to say this especially if anybody's watching actually our viewers have kind of dropped off at the end there which is kind of normal but I know there are some people that watch the show that are also in the react nanodegree program so here's a little bit of of information that was helpful to me you all maybe already know this maybe I just didn't read properly but I was really worried that my my second project the Redux project was due Friday so I've been working on it a lot lately trying to get it ready to turn in on Friday thinking that you know it's due I'm gonna like I'm I'm not gonna be able to finish the course if I don't do it well I stayed up last night until 4 o'clock in the morning working on it so from 10 from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. I'm working on it and then I'm going through the list of requirements and I'm thinking you know what there's there's still I'm not gonna finish this tonight there's too much left so I said I'm gonna look up if I can get an extension so I go read the course handbook and it turns out that the deadlines to submit the projects are actually just suggested deadlines to keep you on track the real deadline is the complete end of a nano degree program which I think for for my start time the end for me is at the beginning of November so really I have till the beginning of November to turn this thing in and I stayed up almost all night I only got three hours of sleep pretty much for no reason it was okay I mean it was really nice to get like six enter uninterrupted hours to just work on it and I feel way more comfortable with Redux now that I have and I did almost completely finish the project so the UI is just completely a mess it looks like something out of the 90s webpage I might actually leave it like that because I think it cool it's cool when it reminds me of the first websites I ever built but anyway I say that because I looked in the slack channel for the nanodegree and there were other people that had similar questions and weren't sure about it so I I gave them the link to the the place where I found that information so I'm just I'm thinking it's possible that there might be somebody watching this that that might might not know like I did so don't freak out you don't have to turn things in you know on the on the due date it's just suggested so but I do really want to get the project finished soon and move on because the next project is going to be react native and I've never done anything with react native but I'm really excited about it I just I don't know I think that's really cool it'll be awesome for me to have something on my phone an app that I made I don't know that just seems really exciting to me websites are cool too but like I've been doing websites for a long time so that's just it's lost some of the excitement like just the the wow factor of doing it the novelty has worn off but anyway so I'm sorry to go on about that I just wanted to try to be helpful okay Ally asked what is the react nanodegree okay so it's um okay alice has found it okay yeah it's says founded it's pretty expensive yes it's it's it was expensive it was sometimes they have deals and you can get it for cheaper but when I got it there wasn't any like deal or anything there was no discount so it was $500 which when I think about it now I'm like why did I spend $500 on that I wish I had $500 now but at the time I had recently completed a project and I just got a big check from a client so I was spending like I was rich and so it didn't bother me and but I think it's it's been really useful so far so I think it will end up being worth it I'll probably be a while before I do another nanodegree because it is a lot of work and money but this was been really useful so far I think I'm gonna do maybe a review like video after I'm all done with it and just kind of go over like what I thought and what I learned and maybe that'll help other people decide whether or not they actually want to pay you know the $500 to do it as well okay I just see Ali said would you say it was worth it yet so far like I said it would be nice to have have five hundred dollars right now but that I paid for that but so far it's been worth it and I'm I'm not even through the the core so I've learned a lot and I've been able to use what I've learned in my projects for work and it's helped me a lot for those projects so like I learned about react router in the nanodegree program and I immediately started using react router on my projects so that was that was very useful and I think I'll probably end up using Redux and one of my upcoming react projects so that'll be useful as well and I'm not really sure what kind of app I'll build but I'm sure I'll figure something out to try to use react native I don't want to lose what I'm learning so I really want to try to implement the stuff that I'm learning in real projects and just keep using it otherwise if I wait a couple months I'll probably forget a lot of what I've learned and and then it would be more of a waste and it wouldn't be the fault of the people who made an Anna would be my own fault yes races you can learn all those things from a book as well and faster yeah yeah you can there's definitely a difference the one difference that I've noticed from the nanodegree program that you don't get in a book is the code reviews so there's live help so I can just ask questions and have people look at my code just live and help me with parts of it and then when my project is you know at a complete point where I think it's finished I turn it in and then people review my code and offer suggestions like line by line suggestions for how I could improve it and that's where I think the benefit is because you're right the actual information I mean you can get that wherever you can just read the docs and I actually did I ended up reading through a lot of the redux documentation and then I really understood it a lot better I mean the course was nice too but you get I got a lot out of the docs as well so yeah and I guess actually I don't ever really use books so when I you can't get it from books but I just get it from websites like what why buy a book when you have more uptodate information online for free you know not to say like I'm sure there are really good books out there as well I just prefer reading it or watching a video but anyway also like the motivation of having deadlines is nice of having these projects and like clear goals is really nice you know if you're really selfmotivated you don't really you don't need that but I'm really busy between my fulltime job and my clients on the side and my four kids and my wife I need some like goals and some pressure to force myself to learn things you know on my own time and outside of work so that's good for me in terms of making sure that I do it because I I don't want to I don't want to not finish a class that I paid $500 for so there's definitely pressure to make it worthwhile but I wouldn't have if it was just me I would probably just put it off and you know so there's definitely benefits to doing it but it definitely depends on your learning style and your own motivation the one thing too about so Shave mentioned you can go faster the one thing too is I mean this react nanodegree it's not like a normal like a typical classroom setting so you do go at your own pace so in terms of speed you're totally in control of how fast you go through the lessons and how fast you build the projects but in a traditional classroom I do agree that it's it's definitely way slower than you could do if you're learning on your on your own for most people well Ali said books are also out of date as soon as they are published I would think that the course gets updated the course actually has been updated a lot since I started which is surprising so so that's cool I mean that's it's actually it's good and bad for me cuz I'm in like the very first class that started so the first day it came out I started so we're I'm going through and as people find bugs they get fixed but I'm already passed those lessons so sometimes I see where they'll say they fixed all this stuff and I'm like whoa I already I already figured it out you know there's some things that were just a little buggy at first and you just had to kind of work around it so but they they progressively keep getting better as more people go through the course so that's really cool okay oh sure a says what about like stackoverflow ready yeah i like to learn from stackoverflow I don't really go on reddit often and then you know there's other good online resources so there's a lot of great YouTube channels and then right obviously free code camp is great and there's um just looking at code reading the documentation for the things that I'm using is is really helpful looking at other people's code on github and there are some good like online books like the the you don't know Jas series is great and it's all available for free on github so I think there's there's a lot of there's a lot of great free resources out there but for me at least at this point in my life with everything I have going on this is probably the fastest way that I was going to learn more about react and redux and react native it worked for me in the past when I had let's say more time and less money that wouldn't have been the right choice for me but for right now I mean I'm not saying I have a lot of money but at the time I happened to be able to spare that money so and still be able to pay my bills so alright so let me okay I have another there's another question sure I asked hey are you interested in Android programming I've been into that lately but I've also been interested in react native I'm not interested in directly programming Android so I'm very interested in react native but I'm not I'm not interested in learning how to do you know for instance like to do Java or Kotlin for Android or Swift for iOS I think iOS is still Swift I'm not as interested in that I'd rather I only have so much time to learn just focus on JavaScript and try to get as good as I can with that then to know like a little bit about a lot of different languages that makes sense for me in my career right now I'm not opposed to switching I'm not against other languages it just so happens that I've already come so far with JavaScript that it I think it would just be better for me at this point just to keep going with it smilers asked that you have ite education not formal so I mean I took I took a programming class a C++ programming class in college but other than that I don't have any formal education and this has all been kind of selftaught through almost exclusively free online resources with the exception of this nano degree program and maybe like one course I bought from udemy that was I think it was on sale for like 10 bucks so other than that though it's it's been all free resources and just kind of learning as I picked up clients and learning what I need to do to complete their projects okay Oh James sorry I missed your question earlier I saw it then I forgot about it so James asks about tablets for coding so saying can i code with a tablet if so what would you suggest you guys see like for instance the surface pro 3 I don't have experience with that so I don't know that I could be that helpful for you I know there there are some tablets that come with a keyboard I would think ideally like you would want that right or I just can't imagine trying to to do a lot of programming on a tablet without a dedicated keyboard maybe even a mouse so if I were looking for a tablet that I could code on probably the biggest things for me would be like is it powerful enough obviously you're gonna probably want to use some sort of like cloud development that'll run in the browser so but you just I would just kind of want to make sure that it's powerful enough to run that and not be too slow and then that it's I could easily hook up a keyboard and mouse but other than that I don't have any like handson experience you know with using a tablet of to code okay I think I've gotten through all the questions now okay all right so I've been through other questions now and that's good because I'm gonna have to leave soon for my my den I have a dentist appointment today so I have to leave soon to go see my dentist and all right so awesome so this will end up being a longer video than I anticipated but we did some good work we got some we got a lot done it may not seem like that much to look at it actually looks worse than when we started but behind the scenes we worked through a lot of errors got a lot done I'm really excited about this I feel like I'm I'm finally starting to wrap my head around what's going on here and this is good I think we'll be able to do a lot to make this homepage you know a lot faster and just a much better UI and so I'm excited I'm really excited about this this would be cool at least for me a lot of people will notice this change this would be a big change so that'll be fun to see what would people around here at the university think about it so probably be back tomorrow around 200 p.m. Eastern time I'll let you know for sure what time on Twitter so you can follow me on Twitter if you like or if you subscribe to this channel you should get an alert at some point when I scheduled the livestream so you know either one of those two so you know one of those two avenues will we'll get you the time of the stream and yeah thank you so much for watching thank you for helping out in the live chat a lot a lot of good advice and good help and especially thanks to Umberto offered a lot of help and was very patient with me really not knowing what I was doing so I appreciate that that was awesome that you were very patient and kind about telling me when I when I was doing something wrong so again thank you and have a great day I'll see everyone tomorrow
