as always you know I've taught a lot of courses here Microsoft Azure Google terraform kubernetes you name it I've taught it for cloud over here so you are in good hands and I will see you soon soon in class ciao hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we're at the start of our journey asking the most important question first which is what is the Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals so the Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals is an entrylevel Microsoft certification it has no prerequisites so you don't need to have any prior knowledge of the Power Platform components or the cloud to learn this specific course this course covers the following key topics understanding the business value of Power Platform and its components such as power apps power bi power automate and power virtual agents identifying the capabilities and limitations of each Power Platform component understanding the dataverse formerly common data service and how data connectors and external Services can be integrated creating basic canvas and model driven power apps creating and sharing power bi dashboards and reports creating automated workflows using power automate understanding the use cases of power virtual agents and knowledge of the basics of AI and the power platforms AI Builder capabilities so who is this certification for the certification is designed for individuals who are interested in learning how to Leverage The Power Platform to streamline business processes automate tasks and create custom Solutions you may consider this certification if you are new to Power Platform and want to learn the fundamentals and benefits of Power Platform in general you are a business user administrator developer data analyst or I.T professional you want to understand the capabilities of power platforms such as building basic business processes using power automate and power apps and gain skills and data analysis with power bi and creating chat Bots with power virtual agents or you are a senior Power Platform administrator or developer or in a related role who needs to reset or refresh their knowledge after working for multiple years so now let's take a look at the Microsoft Power Platform certification roadmap to see where we would go after the Power Platform fundamentals and what kind of roles would be associated with those certifications so at the start you get your Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals which is at the fundamental level after that we have the associate level certifications such as the Power Platform App Maker Power Platform functional consultant and Power Platform developer and we have an expert level certification called The Power Platform Solutions architect it's really up to you to choose which field you're interested in a common route could be something like if you're a developer and want to develop and secure Microsoft Power Platform Solutions you could take the Power Platform developer at the associate level and then move on to taking the Power Platform solution architect at the expert level if your interest lies more towards data analysis you could take the power bi data analyst to maximize the value of data assets with Advanced analytics and eventually take the Azure Enterprise data analyst to build Enterprise scale data analytics Solutions if you're an I.T professional or citizen developer you could take the Power Platform App Maker to simplify and automate tasks and processes then take the Power Platform functional console resultant to extend and customize Microsoft apps and services it's also common for people to take multiple of these associate level certifications it doesn't have to be just one this is to ensure they have a wide range of knowledge on all of these areas for possible career openings another route you can take is the Dynamics 365 certifications which is a suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management applications it specializes in helping businesses manage and streamline their financials operations sales marketing customer service and Human Resources procedures also if you have an interest in cloud computing you can explore options such as the Azure administrator and Azure developer from there you could take the Azure Solutions architect or devops engineer at the expert level so as you can see there are many possible paths to take and these are not all the ones available on the list ultimately it's up to you to decide what you want to specialize in keep in mind that there is no single perfect route these suggestions are simply intended to provide some guidance and help you make your own choice voice so how long is it going to take to pass this certification well it's going to really depend on your background but if we had to generalize it we can look at it as kind of a scale and so if you are at the beginner level you're looking at roughly 16 hours and when we say beginner we're saying someone that has never used Microsoft Power Platform products like power apps power automate power bi Etc someone that has never used Microsoft Azure or any cloud provider or someone that has no Tech background or experience and when we're looking at the other side of the Spectrum which is someone that is experienced we're looking at somebody who can watch this at 1.5 to 2 times speed and are able to absorb this information very quickly so they have practical working experience with the Power Platform products and is familiar with using them they have experience with Microsoft Azure or any cloud provider like Amazon web services or gcp so they can easily translate that knowledge or they have a strong background in technology where they've worked in the industry for many years and so you know their study time is going to be a lot shorter at seven hours or less and so on average most people are going to take about 12 hours to study for this course and when we talk about the kind of stuff you'll be doing it's going to be 50 lecture and labs and we call them followalongs where the idea is you follow along in your own account and that other fifty percent is the practice exams so if you look at the length of the content which is around three hours then you know you should spend as much time doing practice exams to pass and the recommended time to study is about one to two hours a day for roughly 10 days so what kind of effort are we going to have to put in to pass the exam well you have to watch the lecture videos and memorize key information you'll need to do HandsOn labs and follow along with your own account although as a fundamental certification the certification is not very heavy on HandsOn material but it will provide a much greater understanding of the topics you'll need to know for the exam and you will need paid online practice exams that simulate the real exam and the last two here were things that I used to never suggest because you could literally just watch the video shows and pass however Microsoft has recently updated this exam so it's a bit more difficult and so for these last two points you do have to do these two things for the paid online practice exams that can be hard for some people so I've made it easier for you by providing you with a full free practice exam on exampro.com pl900 and so you just have to sign up with no credit card required and you'll get a full set of questions that simulate the real exam so for the contents of the exam the certification exam consists of six domains each with its own weightage that determines the number of questions from that domain that will appear so for domain one which is business value of Microsoft Power Platform we're looking at 20 to 25 percent for domain two identify foundational components of Microsoft Power Platform we should expect 10 to 15 percent of the questions from there for domain three the capabilities of power bi were sitting at around 10 to 15 percent of the questions for domain four the capabilities of power apps we have roughly 20 to 25 percent of the questions for domain five capabilities of power automate it's about 15 to 20 percent of the questions and for domain six are the complementary Microsoft Power Platform Solutions which include power virtual agents and power Pages it's about 15 to 20 percent of the questions overall the exam is mostly well balanced and evenly distributed across all six domains so you won't be faced with an excessive amount of questions options from a particular domain that may not be your strong suit so where do you take the exam well you can take the exam at an inperson test center or online from the convenience of your own home Microsoft has partnered with the test center Network Pearson VUE and it offers in person or online and these exams are proctored meaning there is somebody watching you to ensure that you are not cheating in order to pass the exam you have to score 700 points out of the thousand and so 700 generally equates to 70 percent but it's around 70 percent because Microsoft uses scaled scoring this means that they could adjust it based on how many people are passing or failing so always aim to get higher than 70 percent the exam contains about 40 to 45 questions so you can afford to get roughly 10 to 12 questions wrong there is no penalty for wrong questions such as minus one so you should always choose an answer and the questions come in a few formats multiple choice multiple answer drag and drop and yes or no questions the duration of the exam is one hour or 60 minutes so you have a little more than one minute per question the exam time is 60 minutes but the seat time is 90 minutes see time refers to the amount of time to review instructions show the online Proctor your workspace read and accept NDA and complete the exam and provide feedback and when you do pass the exam the exam is valid forever Microsoft's fundamental level exams do not expire and you do not need to do a recertification so that about covers the introduction of the course foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going through an exam guide breakdown of the Microsoft Power Platform fundamental certification so the first thing you want to do is to go to this link here learn.microsoft.com us slash certifications slash exams slash PL 900 and once you're here you want to navigate to this link called pl900 study guide this will open an organized study guide that Microsoft has prepared for us for the Microsoft Power Platform fundamentals exam we've already covered a general overview on what the exam is who the exam is for and a brief overview on the topics but we'll need to cover the exam breakdown in a bit more detail this is the section we're looking for skills measured which have been updated recently as of making this course so we already covered the six main domains describe the business value of Microsoft Power Platform identify foundational components of Microsoft Power Platform demonstrate the capabilities of power bi demonstrate the capabilities of powerapps demonstrate the capabilities of power automate and describe complementary Microsoft Power Platform Solutions so I won't be going through each point on the entire list because it's quite long but I'll point out the ones that I think you should definitely pay attention to starting off with the business value of Microsoft Power Platform Services you'll definitely need to know all of these Services listed here and their value and benefits for the extending business solutions by using Microsoft powered platform you'll just need to know the general overview of these services like Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 apps but describing how Microsoft Power Platform apps work together would be the most important one for the Power Platform Administration and governance the most important one here is would be the Power Platform security model and environments for the Microsoft dataverse it's an important one to know things such as tables columns and relationships in Microsoft dataverse you will probably see business logic and data flows in Microsoft dataverse on the exam as well as the components of a connector for power bi the two important ones here are power bi desktop and power bi service and you'll need to know dashboards workspaces reports and paginated reports you'll also need to know how to build a basic dashboard by using power bi for power apps all the sections here you'll need to know well which are the differences between canvas apps and model driven apps and their use cases and capabilities for both you'll also need to know how to build a basic canvas and model driven app for the power automate section the most important ones would be cloud and desktop flow and how power automate cloudflows use connector triggers and actions actions for power automate desktop flows is another important one and you'll need to know how to build a basic power automate flow for the complementary Microsoft Power Platform Solutions you'll mostly just need a general overview of power virtual agents and the purpose of topics entities and actions you'll also need to know the use cases and capabilities of power pages and AI Builder once again there's a lot on the list so I couldn't mention all the points so I highlighted the ones I thought were the most important but throughout the course we'll definitely cover all of the material in great detail thank you foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and I'll be giving you a walkthrough of our practice exam simulator so what we're looking at here is a free practice exam I provide for you all you have to do is sign up on exam Pro and you can redeem the free available content here you don't need a credit card at all these exam questions are up to date and closely simulates what you'll see on the exam you'll be getting a full set of 40 questions so it's a real simulation like the actual exam so I'll be clicking in here to start the exam and I'll show you what it'll look like we won't be going through the entire exam we'll only be going through a couple of questions so you can get an idea of how the exam questions are structured and the level of difficulty these questions are so the first question we have presented with here is you are working for a company that uses Dynamics 365 sales to manage their sales processes as part of improving customer experience the company wants to implement a chat bot on their web page to interact with customer questions they want to use Microsoft Power Platform to extend the capabilities of Dynamics 360 five sales which application should you use to create a chat bot and extend the capabilities of Dynamics 365 sales so we have four options to pick from and in this scenario the best choice here should be powered virtual agents so we'll choose that so the next question we have here is you work for a busy eCommerce company that has experienced significant growth in Customer Support requests to enhance the support experience for both customers and support technicians the company wants to implement a tool that enables immediate notifications when new support requests are submitted which tools should you recommend to achieve this goal in this scenario the answer should be power automate so you'll mostly be seeing multiple choice and multiple select questions but there'll also be a few true or false and drag and drop questions in there as well here's a multiple select question where you have to select two choices to get the right answer in this scenario the first two options should be correct but I don't want to spoil too much for you let's end the exam here so you can see how well you performed and to review the questions here we can see that we only answer two questions correctly out of the 40. all the practice exam questions provide an explanation on why the answer was correct and also an explanation for the wrong answers they'll also be links to the sources and documentation so you can reference the material you won't need to perform any coding and they won't ask you anything about code in this exam the length of the questions can vary some questions are short and straight to the point and in some questions you'll be given a scenario and you'll have to figure out which tool is best suited for the requirement in these practice exams I added a bit more context to it so that you're over prepared so if you do really well on these practice exams you should do well on the actual exam hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be answering the most important question what is Microsoft Power Platform well Microsoft Power Platform is a line of business intelligence app development and app connectivity software applications Microsoft Power Platform is composed of five key products power apps power automate power bi Tower virtual agents and power pages we'll be going through a brief overview of each

and scalability than traditional development approaches ultimately adding significant business value hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is how Microsoft Power Platform apps work together with Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps Microsoft Power Platform in Microsoft Dynamics 365 are two different platforms but they can work together seamlessly to provide powerful Business Solutions powerapps allows users to create custom business applications with little or no code these custom apps can be used to perform various tasks such as managing data automating workflows and analyzing data power apps can also integrate with Dynamics 365 apps to enhance their capabilities Dynamics 365 apps are designed for specific business functions such as sales marketing customer service and finance these apps are built on the common data model which provides a standard and consistent way to organize and store data across different applications power apps can use the common data model as a data source allowing them to connect and integrate with Dynamics 365 apps this means that data can flow seamlessly between power apps and Dynamics 365 apps and users can work with the same data across both platforms power apps can also leverage the advanced functionality of Dynamics 365 apps such as customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning capabilities in summary Power Platform apps and Dynamics 365 apps can work together to provide a unified and comprehensive solution for businesses power apps can be used to extend the functionality of Dynamics 365 apps or create custom apps that integrate with Dynamics 365 data this integration between the two platforms provides a powerful solution for managing and analyzing business data Microsoft Power Platform Solutions work together with Microsoft 365 apps and services to create a unified approach to digital transformation with the integration of powerapps power automate power bi and dataverse businesses can create customized solutions that automate processes visualize data and gain insights to drive informed decisions for example a company may use power apps to create a custom form that captures customer information and then use power automate to automatically send that information to Microsoft Dynamics 365 for sales they can also use power bi to create reports that show customer Trends and behavior and use that information to make strategic decisions the integration with Microsoft 365 allows businesses to leverage existing data sources and systems to build apps and automate workflows power apps and power automate can interact with Microsoft teams SharePoint Outlook and other Microsoft 365 apps enabling users to easily access data and Trigger workflows directly from their familiar interfaces additionally power bi allows businesses to visualize data from Microsoft 365 apps such as Excel SharePoint and Dynamics 365 alongside data from other sources this provides a comprehensive view of business operations and allows for better decision making overall the integration of Microsoft Power Platform with Microsoft 365 apps and services allows businesses to streamline their processes increase productivity and gain valuable insights to drive their digital transformation Journey forward foreign we've briefly gone over the main Power Platform products and their key features but we haven't really touched on how Power Platform apps can work together so the integration of Microsoft Power Platform apps is achieved through the utilization of a common data model which is a standardized and modular collection of data scheme is designed to work seamlessly together by leveraging this model various Power Platform apps such as power apps power automate and power bi can effectively collaborate and share data for example a power app can use data stored in Microsoft dataverse and power automate can automate tasks Based on data in a power app power bi can then visualize the data from both the PowerApp and power automate to provide insights for informed decision making the various Power Platform apps also offer connectors that allow for integration with other services such as Microsoft 365 apps and thirdparty applications by leveraging these connectors users can create endtoend solutions that automate complex business processes and improve overall efficiency Microsoft Power Platform has multiple apps that collaborate to offer a complete solution for users to design and handle personalized apps automate processes and analyze data power apps allows users to create custom applications with a drag and drop interface these apps can then be integrated with other Microsoft services and external data sources power automate enables users to automate repetitive tasks and workflows between various apps and services this can include automating notifications data collection approvals and much more power bi is a data visualization tool that allows users to create reports and dashboards to analyze data from multiple sources the data can come from various sources like spreadsheets databases or cloudbased Services Microsoft dataverse provides a centralized location for data storage and management allowing users to create and manage data entities and relationships between them all these apps work together seamlessly allowing users to create a customized solution that can automate their business processes manage data effectively and derive valuable insights through data analysis foreign the next topic we'll be covering is how Microsoft Power Platform works with Microsoft teams Microsoft Power Platform Works seamlessly with Microsoft teams a collaboration platform for teams to communicate and work together with Power Platform integrated into teams users can access and use powerapps power bi and power automate without leaving the team's interface for example users can create and share power apps directly Within A team's Channel or chat allowing team members to collaborate and access the app in real time similarly users can access and view power bi reports and dashboards Within A team's Channel or chat making it easier to share Data Insights and collaborate on analysis power automate can be used to create automated workflows within teams enabling users to trigger actions and send notifications in response to specific events for example a power automate flow can be created to notify A team's Channel when a new item is added to a SharePoint list or trigger a message in teams when a specific action is taken in a power app power virtual agents is a chatbot development platform within Microsoft Power Platform that can be integrated with Microsoft teams with this integration businesses can build and deploy chat Bots and teams to provide 24 7 support answer frequently asked questions and automate simple tasks overall the integration of Microsoft Power Platform with Microsoft teams provides users with a seamless and streamlined experience for collaboration and productivity hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be discussing is how Microsoft Power Platform Business Solutions can consume Microsoft Azure services Microsoft Power Platform Business Solutions can consume Microsoft Azure Services through their integration with Azure apis and connectors Azure provides a wide range of cloud services that can be leveraged by Power Platform apps such as Azure functions Azure cognitive services and Azure machine learning one way is through the use of azure connectors which enable Power Platform apps to access and manipulate data stored in Azure services such as Azure blob storage Azure SQL database and Azure event hubs this allows businesses to Leverage The Power of azure services within their Power Platform Solutions another way Power Platform can consume Azure Services is through the use of azure functions which can be triggered by power automate flows this enables businesses to create custom logic and Integrations that run on demand are based on specific events such as the creation of a new record in Dynamics 365 or the receipt of an email in Outlook power bi can also be used to consume Azure Services by connecting to data stored in Azure services such as Azure data like storage and visualizing that data through dashboards and reports this allows businesses to gain valuable insights from their Azure data in a userfriendly and easily digestible format power apps can consume Azure cognitive Services which includes Ai and machine learning capabilities like natural language processing speech recognition and computer vision to add intelligent features to custom applications overall the ability to consume Azure services within Power Platform Solutions provides businesses with additional capabilities and flexibility to build powerful customized solutions that meet their unique needs the Microsoft Power Platform security model is designed to ensure that data and resources within Power Platform applications are protected from unauthorized access or modification the security model of Power Platform is based on user roles permissions and data governance policies and consists of three layers tenant level environment level and data level security at the tenant level security is managed by the Microsoft 365 admin Center which allows administrators to manage user accounts access to services and other settings that impact the entire tenant at the environment level security is managed through the Power Platform admin Center which allows administrators to create and manage environments and control access to data and applications within those environments data level security is implemented using rolebased access control and Azure active directory to manage permissions and access to data within the platform this means that administrators can control access to data in actions within the Power Platform using authentication with organizational credentials ensuring that users only have access to authorized resources and data the platform also includes audit logging and Reporting capabilities which allow administrators to monitor user activity and identify potential security risks Power Platform has several builtin security features such as conditional access policies multifactor authentication and data loss prevention policies that can be configured to meet specific security and compliance requirements data governance policies can also be implemented within Power Platform to ensure that data is protected and compliant with regulatory requirements for example data loss prevention policies can be set up to prevent users from sharing sensitive information outside of the organization and conditional access policies which control access to data based on factors such as device type and location data protection is insured through encryption of data both in transit and at rest Power Platform services use industry standard encryption protocols to ensure data privacy and protection Additionally the platform is designed to comply with various Regulatory and Industry standards including gdpr HIPAA and ISO 27001 to ensure that organizations can use the platform to store and manage data in a secure and compliant manner overall the Power Platform security model is designed to ensure the protection and privacy of data while providing flexibility and ease of use to users foreign platform an environment is a designated space to manage and store an organization's business data apps chat Bots and flows it can be used as a container to separate apps with different roles security requirements or Target audiences how environments are utilized will depend on the organization's needs and the apps being built for example you can build your apps or chat bots in a single environment you can group the test in production versions of your apps or chat bots in separate environments you can create environments for specific teams or departments in your company with relevant data and apps for each audience or you might also create separate environments for different Global branches of your company in Power Platform each environment is associated with an Azure active directory tenant and is bound to a specific geographic location any resources created in an environment such as apps chat Bots connections and flows are also bound to that location each environment can have only one dataverse database which provides storage for your apps and chat Bots the apps you create in an environment can only connect to the data sources in that same environment including connections gateways flows and dataverse databases this means that an app created in what environment cannot connect to the data sources in another environment for example consider a scenario where you've created two environments named test and Dev and created a dataverse database in each of the environments if you create an app in the test environment it will only be permitted to connect to the test database it won't be able to connect to the dev database the next topic we'll be covering are environment permissions and Power Platform so there are two prebuilt roles and environments that Grant permissions environment admin and environment maker the environment admin role can perform all administrative actions on an environment such as adding or removing a user or group from either the environment admin or environment maker role provisioning a dataverse database for the environment View and manage all resources created within the environment and set data loss prevention policies after creating the database in the environment you can use the system administrator role instead of the environment admin role the environment maker role can create resources such as apps connections custom connectors gateways and flows using power automate within an environment environment makers can share the apps they create with other users or groups within the organization however users or groups with these roles are not automatically granted access to the environment's database if one exists access to the database must be granted separately there are five main types of environments in Power Platform wide in production this is the default environment and it's where you deploy your finished apps and solutions that are ready for use by end users two sandbox this is a nonproduction environment that you can use to develop and test your apps and solutions without affecting the data in your production environment three trial this is a temporary environment that you can use to evaluate Power Platform before purchasing a license the trial environment is valid for 30 days for developer this is a nonproduction environment that is designed for developers to build and test their Solutions it provides full access to All Power Platform features and capabilities and five default this environment is automatically created for each tenant when it is provisioned it cannot be deleted but it can be renamed and its settings can be customized to meet your organization's needs thank you hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is the Microsoft Power Platform admin Center and where to perform specific administrative tasks the Microsoft Power Platform admin Center is a webbased portal that allows administrators to manage and monitor their Power Platform environments including powerapps power automate power bi and dataverse you should always check for administration settings as your first step when looking to administer Microsoft dataverse settings are grouped into the following broad categories and are accessible by selecting the link on the left hand side of the portal starting with environments this section lists all instances of Microsoft dataverse data policies this section lets you set up policies to restrict which data connectors can be used with Microsoft dataverse to limit what data can flow into or out of Microsoft data versus tables and data integration this section lets you create or add predefined connections and monitor these connections between Microsoft dataverse and other data stores like Salesforce or SQL Server in the admin Center administrators can perform various administrative tasks such as manage environments create delete or manage environments and view environment details and settings manage security manage permissions for environment roles and data loss prevention policies manage data manage dataverse databases configure data policies and view data Integrations manage analytics view usage metrics monitor data flows and configure Telemetry settings manage connectors configure and manage connectors and view connector usage and Analytics manage gateways configure and manage gateways and view Gateway usage and Analytics manage custom connectors create manage and deploy custom connectors manage

the Power Platform admin Center by signing into admin.power platform.microsoft.com with their Microsoft 365 or Power Platform credentials thank you the Microsoft 365 admin Center is a webbased portal that allows administrators to manage and monitor their Microsoft 365 tenant including users groups licenses settings and security here are some examples of specific administrative tasks that can be performed in the Microsoft 365 admin Center why do user management admins can add delete and modify user accounts reset passwords and manage user roles and permissions 2. group management admins can create and manage groups assign group owners and control group settings three license management admins can purchase assign and manage licenses for Microsoft 365 apps and services for Security Management admins can set up and manage security features such as multifactor authentication conditional access and device management live settings management admins can customize various settings such as email settings SharePoint settings and team settings to meet the needs of their organization six compliance management admins can manage compliance features such as data loss prevention retention policies and ediscovery seven billing and subscriptions admins can manage billing information and payment methods view usage reports and purchase new subscriptions to access the Microsoft 365 admin Center go to admin.microsoft.com in your web browser enter your work or school account credentials and then you will be taken to the dashboard where you can perform various administrative tasks overall the Microsoft 365 admin Center provides a central location for administrators to manage and configure various Microsoft 365 services for their organization hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going through an overview of the dataverse Microsoft dataverse formerly known as common data service is a cloudbased solution that easily structures various types of data and business logic to support interconnected applications and processes in a secure and compliant manner it is a part of the Power Platform Suite of tools provided by Microsoft and is tightly integrated

customized to meet specific business needs it provides a set of tools for creating configuring and managing data entities fields and relationships and allows users to Define complex business logic using no code low code approaches such as formulas and workflows dataverse supports data integration with a wide range of external data sources including other cloudbased applications onpremises databases and various thirdparty services it also provides Advanced features such as data validation auditing and Version Control and can be used to build a variety of business applications such as CRM HR management and financial reporting among others here is an image that describes what's in the box of Microsoft dataverse breaking it down into categories such as security logic data storage integration and so on security dataverse handles authentication with Azure active directory to allow for conditional access and multifactor authentication it supports authorization down to the row and column level and provides Rich auditing capabilities logic dataverse allows you to easily apply business logic at the data level regardless of how a user is interacting with the data the same rules apply these rules could be related to duplicate detection business rules workflows or more data dataverse offers you the control to shape your data allowing you to discover model validate and report on your data this control ensures your data looks the way you want regardless of how it is used storage dataverse stores your physical data in the Azure Cloud this cloudbased storage removes the burden of worrying about where your data lives or how it scales these concerns are all handled for you integration dataverse connects in different ways to support your business needs apis webhooks Eventing and data exports give you flexibility to get data in and out a dataverse database is a single instance of Microsoft dataverse which stores data in a set of standard and custom data structures called tables a table is a logical set of rows that is used to store data rows within a table contain many columns to manage individual pieces of information about a single row you can create one or many database instances in Microsoft dataverse to host data behind your business solutions each instance of a Microsoft dataverse will start with the same set of tables to store data but you can always extend and customize the Microsoft dataverse database to meet specific business needs scalability a dataverse database supports large data sets and complex data models tables can hold millions of items and you can extend the storage in each instance of a Microsoft dataverse database to four terabytes per instance the amount of data that is available in your instance of Microsoft dataverse is based upon the number and type of licenses that are associated with it data storage is pulled between all license users so you can allocate storage as needed for each solution that you build overall Microsoft data versus a powerful and flexible platform for managing and processing data with a wide range of applications across different Industries and business domains so a common question asked is what is the difference between traditional databases versus Microsoft dataverse well traditional databases and Microsoft dataverse have several differences in terms of their architecture functionality and usage here are some key differences while the architecture traditional databases are typically relational databases that store data in tables with defined relationships between them dataverse on the other hand is a note code low code platform that uses a data model to store data in an entity attribute value format to scalability traditional databases can be scaled up or down based on demand but this usually requires a dedicated team of database administrators to manage the hardware and software and contrast dataverse is a cloudbased platform that automatically scales to meet changing demands without requiring any manual intervention three integration traditional databases require custom integration code to connect with other systems whereas dataverse integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft products and services such as power apps power automate and Dynamics 365. for customization traditional databases can be customized using SQL queries and programming languages such as Java or python while dataverse provides a graphical interface that allows users to create custom entities fields and relationships without writing any code five security traditional databases typically require extensive configuration to secure data at various levels such as at the network server and database levels in contrast dataverse has builtin security features that provide granular Access Control to data at the entity and field levels in summary while traditional databases are suitable for largescale missioncritical applications that require extensive customization and management data versus design for no code low code applications that require quick and easy development integration and management of data hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering tables and columns and dataverse a table is a logical structure containing rows and columns that represents a set of data here is a screenshot of the standard contact table in various types of columns it includes types of tables the three types of tables are standard tables also known as out of the box tables come preinstalled in a dataverse environment these include tables such as account business unit contact task and user most of these standard tables can be customized to suit specific needs additionally tables that are part of a managed solution and marked as customizable will also appear as standard tables users with the necessary permissions can modify these tables if the customizable property is set to True manage tables are those that cannot be customized and are imported into the environment as part of a managed solution custom tables meanwhile our managed tables that are either imported from an unmanaged solution or are created directly within the dataverse environment these tables can be fully customized by users with the appropriate privileges columns serve as a means of storing a specific piece of information within a table row much like an Excel column columns have data types meaning that you can store data of a certain type in a column that matches that data type for example dates are stored in columns with the date data type while numbers are stored in columns with the number data type the number of columns in a table can vary significantly ranging from a few to several hundred however having too many columns could indicate a need to reevaluate how data storage is structured for the solution in Microsoft dataverse a standard set of tables is provided by default and each of these tables has a predetermined set of columns the next topic will be covering are relationships and dataverse in Microsoft dataverse relationships Define the way that different tables in the system are connected or linked together based on shared data a relationship specifies how data in one table is related to data in another table relationships are defined by creating a field in the primary table that is used to store a reference to the related table this field is called a foreign key and it contains a value that matches the primary key of a record in the related table when data is entered or updated in the system the relationships ensure that related data is updated consistently across the tables which helps to maintain the Integrity of the data within the system relationships are an essential aspect of building complex data models and dataverse that can support a variety of business scenarios they allow users to connect and organize data in meaningful ways which can help to improve efficiency accuracy and insight into business operations there are three types of relationships in dataverse why one to many this is the most common relationship type in which one record in the primary table is associated with many records in the related table for example a customer could have multiple orders in the system to many to one in this relationship type many records in the primary table are associated with a single record in the related table for example many orders could be associated with a single customer three many to many this relationship type involves many records in both the primary and related tables being associated with many records in the other table for example a customer could have multiple orders and an order could involve multiple products foreign moving on to the next component of the data Versa environments environments are used to store manage and share your organization's business data apps and flows in Microsoft Power Platform for each environment created one Microsoft dataverse databases provisioned for use solely within that environment these environments also provide the ability to manage user access security settings and Associated Storage for the database and environment is created within a specific Microsoft Azure active directory tenant and its resources can only be accessed by users within that tenant in addition each environment is bound to a geographic location such as the United States upon creating a Microsoft dataverse database within an environment the database is created within the data centers located in the environment's geographic location furthermore any items generated within the environment including connections gateways power automate workflows and others are also bound to the environment's location by establishing multiple environments you can efficiently manage solution development and data storage for instance you may set up distinct environments for development testing and production use additionally environments can be created based on specific Geographic locations for example an environment for Europe and another for Asia may be established each of these environments is associated with zero or only one instance of Microsoft dataverse foreign the next topic we'll be covering are business rules Microsoft dataverse provides a feature to Define business rules which allow you to apply and maintain business logic at the data layer rather than the app layer this means that the business rules you create in dataverse are effective regardless of where you interact with the data business rules provide a powerful way to enforce rules validate data or set values regardless of the form used for data input they can increase data accuracy simplify application development and streamline forms for users both canvas and model driven apps can use business rules with actions such as set column values clear column values validate data and show error messages model driven apps can also use business rules to show or hide columns enable or disable Collins create business recommendations based on business intelligence here is an example of a simple yet powerful use of business rules the rule is set up to make the credit limit VP approver field mandatory when the credit limit exceeds one million dollars conversely the field is optional when the credit limit is below one million dollars by applying this business rule at the data level instead of the app level you have better control of your data this can ensure your business logic is followed whether it is being accessed directly from powerapps Power automate or via an API the rule is tied to the data not the app hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering are data flows and dataverse data flows in Microsoft dataverse are a way to extract transform and load data from various sources into dataverse tables with data flows you can automate the process of importing data from different sources and transform it into a consistent format this allows you to streamline the data integration process reduce data entry errors and improve data accuracy data flows are created using power query which is a data transformation in cleansing engine that enables you to transform data from a variety of sources such as Excel SharePoint SQL server and many others you can use power query to perform operations such as filtering sorting grouping and aggregating data and then load the transform data into dataverse tables data flows also support incremental refresh which means that only the change data is loaded into the dataverse table this helps to optimize data loading performance and reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed during the ETL process once the data flow is created and scheduled it runs on a regular basis such as daily or weekly depending on your needs the transform data is loaded into the specified dataverse table and you can then use it to power your apps reports and dashboards the next topic we'll be covering are data connectors Microsoft Power Platform is a system that enables users to create comprehensive business solutions by analyzing data through Power by Building Solutions using powerapps and automating business processes through Power automate data connectors allow Microsoft Power Platform to leverage data from different sources connectors act as an interface to connect to apis enabling the underlying services to communicate with Microsoft Power Platform popular connectors include Salesforce Office 365 Twitter Dropbox SharePoint and SQL Server Microsoft Power Platform employs connectors to efficiently utilize data from multiple platforms connectors act as a link between your data source and your app or workflow allowing data to be exchanged between them by utilizing connectors you can expand your business solutions to various platforms and incorporate additional features for your users connectors allow apps to connect to apps data and devices in the cloud there are two types of data sources tabular and function based tabular data sources return data in a structured table format examples of tabular data sources include Microsoft dataverse SharePoint and SQL Server functionbased data sources use functions to interact with data sources examples of functionbased data sources include Office 365 users Azure blob storage and project online those types of data sources are commonly used to bring data across many platforms and add functionality to your Solution by connecting to these data sources Power Platform allows users to create powerful apps automate processes and analyze data from various systems and applications in one centralized location foreign now that you have gained some knowledge about data sources you are ready to learn about connectors connectors act as a link between your data source and app workflow or dashboard Microsoft Power Platform has over 600 connectors for various data sources that are categorized as standard and premium standard connectors are free and available to all users of Power Platform these connectors are developed and maintained by Microsoft and they allow users to connect to a variety of commonly used services and platforms some popular standard connectors or SharePoint Outlook and YouTube premium connectors require additional licensing for your app and or users freemium connectors are created and maintained by thirdparty vendors and offer more advanced capabilities they may have better performance more robust security features or provide additional functionality a few premium connectors or SQL Server SurveyMonkey and MailChimp connectors facilitate the exchange of data between the data source and Power Platform which can speed up the implementation of Microsoft Power Platform Business Solutions one example of this is using Dynamics 365 apps such as customer service where you can create a notification for users through Power automate when certain customer types are added you can use a SharePoint document library to store files that are then used in power apps for management and distribution Microsoft also offers connectors to their Azure Services which utilize Advanced AI techniques to perform tasks like extracting text from images or recognizing faces and images additionally all Microsoft Power Platform Business Solutions can be utilized in Microsoft 365 apps such as teams enabling users to run power automate from within teams although Microsoft Power Platform provides over 600 connectors users can choose to create a custom connector to expand their app's functionality by accessing either a publicly available API or a custom API they are hosting in a cloud provider like Azure API stands for application programming interface and it provides a set of functions that developers can use connectors work by exchanging data between apis and assembling functions into powerapps or power automate since these connectors are based on functions they will call specific functions in the underlying service of the API to return the corresponding data building custom connectors offers the benefit of crossplatform compatibility meaning they can be utilized in various platforms like power apps power automate and Azure logic apps creating custom connectors you can create custom connectors using three different approaches using a blank custom connector from an open API definition and from a postman collection custom connectors and Power Platform can be used in various use cases including why integrating with nonstandard data sources custom connectors can be built to integrate with nonstandard data sources that don't have prebuilt connectors available this allows businesses to bring data from these sources into the Power Platform for use in apps and workflows to customize the existing connectors custom connectors can also be built to add functionality to existing connectors such as adding custom authentication or providing additional data transformation options three automating business processes custom connectors can be used to automate complex business processes that involve multiple systems and data sources this can help streamline workflows and improve efficiency for building apps for external users custom connectors can be used to build apps for external users such as customers or partners that require access to data from proprietary systems or databases hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering are triggers and actions triggers and actions are two fundamental components of the Power Platform once you have established a data source and configured your connector there are two types of operations you can use triggers or actions triggers initiate workflows when certain conditions are met for example a trigger can be set up to automatically start a workflow when a new item is added to a SharePoint list or when a new email arrives in a specific mailbox triggers can be set up in power automate formerly known as Microsoft flow and powerapps actions are prompted by the user or trigger and allow interaction with your data source through a specific function actions are used in power automate and power apps actions can be anything from sending an email or creating a new record in a database to posting a message in a chat application in power automate and power apps users can create custom actions by building flows which are workflows that automate repetitive tasks together triggers and actions allow users to create custom workflows that automate processes and improve productivity by connecting various services and applications users can streamline workflows reduce errors and save time Power Platform provides a wide range of connectors and templates that can be used to create these workflows and users can also create custom connectors and actions to suit their specific needs foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this section we'll be going into greater detail of what power bi is at its main components let's begin with a brief overview Microsoft power bi is a collection of software Services applications and connectors that work together to transform your diverse data sources into coherent engaging visuals and interactive insights power bi enables you to connect to your data sources clean and model your data without affecting the underlying Source visualize and share what's important with anyone you choose your data could be a simple Microsoft Excel workbook a collection of cloudbased and onpremises hybrid data warehouses and many more as you can see from the image you can use many data sources such as Excel Cloud databases Microsoft Edge Microsoft Access SQL databases and many more you can use them with power bi and generate all kinds of visualizations reports dashboards Etc that will help you find business insights within your organization's data thank you the next topic we'll be discussing about are the parts of power bi so power bi is made up of several components that all function together starting with these three fundamentals first we have a Windows desktop application called Power bi desktop secondly we have an online SAS service called the power bi service and lastly we have power bi mobile apps for Windows IOS and Android devices power bi desktop power bi service and power bi mobile apps are designed to let you create share and consume business insights in the way that serves you and your role most effectively now let's go over the power bi Concepts data sets reports and dashboards are the three main components of power bi they are all organized into workspaces and they are created on capacities so what are capacities capacities or a Core Power bi concept that refer to a set of resources utilized to host and deliver your power bi work capacities are either shared or dedicated by share capacity is shared with other Microsoft customers while a dedicated capacity is fully committed to a single customer dedicated capacities require a subscription by default workspaces are created on a shared capacity so that's all for the main components of power bi hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going over what workspaces in power bir so workspaces are containers for dashboards reports data sets and data flows in power bi there are two types of workspaces first we have my workspace and then we have workspaces so my workspace is the personal workspace for any power bi customer to work with your own content only you have access to your my workspace you can share dashboards and reports from your my workspace if you want to collaborate on dashboards and reports or create an app then you want to work in a workspace workspaces are used to collaborate and share content with colleagues you can add colleagues to your workspaces and collaborate on dashboards reports and data sets keep in mind that all workspace members need power bi Pro licenses workspaces are also the places where you create publish and manage apps for your organization workspaces can be thought of as staging areas and containers for the content that will make up a power bi app an app is a collection of dashboards and reports created to provide important metrics to the power bi consumers in your company apps are interactive but consumers cannot edit them app consumers and the colleagues who have access to the apps do not necessarily need Pro licenses so that's a general overview of workspaces in power bi foreign the next topic we'll be covering are data sets in power bi so a data set is a collection of data that you import or connect to Tower bi enables you to connect to import and combine many data sets in one location data sets can Source data from data flows data sets are associated with workspaces in a single data set can be part of many workspaces when you open a workspace the associated data sets are listed under the data sets tab each listed data set represents a collection of data for example a data set can contain data from an Excel workbook on OneDrive and onpremises ssas tabular data set and or a Salesforce data set there are many different data sources supported data sets added by one workspace member are available to the other workspace members with an admin member or contributor role so what are shared data sets a shared data set is a data set shared between multiple reports it's important to establish standardized data sets that serve as the one source of Truth discovering and reusing those standardized data sets is also key report creators can use optimized data sets created and shared by expert data modelers in your organization as a starting point when building Reliable Reports your organization can have consistent data for making decisions at a healthy data culture to consume these shared data sets just choose power bi data sets when creating your power bi report moving on to data set types so power bi data sets represent a source of data ready for reporting and visualization there are five different data set types and they can be created in the following ways first by connecting to an existing data model that isn't hosted in a power bi capacity second by uploading a power bi desktop file that contains the model then by uploading an Excel workbook containing one or more Excel tables in our workbook data model or uploading a CSV also known as a comma separated values file you can also use the power bi service to create a push data set and finally we use the power bi service to create a streaming or hybrid streaming data set an exception for this would be for streaming data sets the data set represents a data model which leverages the mature modeling Technologies of analysis services so that's the different kinds of data sets for power bi so the next component will be discussing are reports at Power B I report is one or more pages of visualizations such as line charts maps and tree maps visualizations are also called visuals power bi allows you to create reports from scratch import them with dashboard shared by coworkers or have it create reports when you connect to data sets like Excel power bi desktop databases and SAS apps for example power bi generates a report using the Power view sheets in an Excel worksheet when you connect to it additionally power bi Imports a prebuilt report when you connect to a SAS application so there are two modes to view and interact with reports there is reading View and there is editing view when you open a report it opens in Reading view if you have the edit permissions then you see edit report in the upper left corner and you can view the report in editing view anyone with an admin member or contributor role can edit a report if it is in a workspace they have access to all the exploring designing building and sharing capabilities of editing view for that report the people they share the report with can explore and interact with the report in Reading View when you open a workspace the associated reports are listed under the reports tab each listed report represents one or more pages of visualizations based on only one of the underlying data sets to open a report select it you are presented with a dashboard when you first launch an app select a dashboard tile that was pinned from a report to see the underlying report you might need to click a few tiles before seeing a report because not all tiles are pinned from reports foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going into detail on what is a dashboard in power bi so a dashboard is something you create in the power bi service or something a colleague creates in the power bi service and shares with you it is a single canvas that contains zero or more tiles and widgets each tile pin from a report or from question and answer displays a single visualization that was created from a data set and pinned to the dashboard entire report Pages can also be pinned to a dashboard as a single tile the visualizations you see on the dashboard are called tiles you pin tiles to a dashboard from reports and each report is based on a data set a dashboard is an introduction to the underlying reports and data sets selecting a visualization takes you to the report and data set that it's based on you can pin many kinds of tiles to dashboards you can pin a tile from a report pin a tile from another dashboard pin a tile from Excel you can create a tile in question and answer and pin it you can pin an entire report page and you can also add images videos and more to a dashboard let's take a look at some of the advantages of dashboards first you can see in one glance all the information needed to make decisions you can monitor the most important information about your business you can ensure all colleagues are on the same page viewing and using the same information to monitor the health of a business or product or business unit or marketing campaign Etc and you can create a personalized view of a larger dashboard and show all the metrics that matter to them so that's a general overview of dashboards in power bi foreign users can get confused between a report and a dashboard so we'll go over the main differences between the two because there will definitely be some questions on it in the exam for the pages capability dashboards can only have one page whereas reports can have one or more pages for data sources dashboards can have one or more reports and one or more data sets per dashboard reports can only have a single data set per report for drilling down in visuals this can be done for dashboards only if you pin an entire report page to a dashboard on the other hand drilling down in visuals is available for reports dashboards are not available in power bi desktop reports are available in power bi desktop you can build and view reports in power bi desktop you can't filter or slice a dashboard you can filter a dashboard tile in Focus mode but can't save the filter however filtering is available for reports there are many different ways to filter highlight and slice for favorites you can set multiple dashboards and multiple reports as favorites for natural language queries this is available for both dashboard words and reports but you'll need edit permissions for the report and underlying data set for set alerts this is available for dashboard tiles in certain circumstances but this is not available for reports for the Subscribe capability you can subscribe to dashboard and a report so these are the main capabilities you'll be using for dashboards and reports there are a few more but the list is simply too large to fit foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going through template apps for power bi so power bi Partners can create power bi templates with little to no coding and deploy them to any power bi customer using the new Power bi template apps you can create a set of outofthebox content for your customers and publish it yourself as a power bi partner you can build template apps that allow your customers to connect within their own accounts as domain experts they can unlock the data in a way that is easy for their business users to consume template apps are submitted to the partner Center to become publicly available in the power bi apps Marketplace and on Microsoft appsource power bi template apps allow power bi Pro or power bi premium users to gain immediate insights through per package dashboards and reports that can be connected to live data sources many power bi apps are already available in the power bi apps Marketplace such as the covid19 US tracking report Google analytics report and the Microsoft 365 usage Analytics the next topic we'll be covering is data modeling and visualizations power bi desktop is a free application installed on your local computer that allows you to connect to transform and visualize your data you can connect to multiple different sources of data and combine them which is often called modeling into a data model with power bi desktop you can create visuals and collection of visuals using this data model which you can then share as reports with others most users who work on business intelligence projects create their reports using power bi desktop then share them with others using the power bi service in power bi desktop you will begin to create reports in the report View there are five main areas you will be working with first we have the ribbon this displays the common tasks that are related with reports and visualizations next we have the report view or canvas this is where visualizations are created and arranged the data view allows you to view all your data available in your report it is an easy way to quickly check data types and validate data the model view allows you to visually set the relationship between tables or elements our relationship is where two or more tables are linked together because they contain related data this enables users to run queries for related data across multiple tables the third area we have is the pages tab this area is where you would select or add a report page located along the bottom of the page next we have the visualizations pane this is where you can change visualizations customize colors or axes apply filters drag fields and more and finally we have the fields pane this is where query elements and filters can be dragged onto the report view or dragged to the filters area of the visualizations pane foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is the types of visualization in power bi so starting off with bar and column charts bar charts are the industry standard for viewing specific value across different categories here we have a visual example of a bar chart displaying counts of visits by building and here we have the chart in a column chart format so let's look at some more types of visualizations in power bi first we have cards these can be viewed in single or multirow next we have kpis these display progress toward a measurable goal next we have Maps basic Maps these are used to associate both categorical and quantitative information with spatial locations then we have pie charts and pie charts show the relationship of parts to a whole another type of visualization is the question and answer visual this lets you ask questions about your data using natural language finally we have tables tables work well with quantitative comparisons among items where there are many categories these are some of the out of the box or prebuilt power bi visuals available from the visualization pane in power bi desktop and power bi service however there are some instances where you need a more custom Visual and these can be found in appsource for power bi foreign as mentioned in the previous video there are some instances where users will need a more custom Visual and these can be found in appsource for power bi so power bi visuals are provided to the public by Microsoft and members of the community who then publish them to the app source to make them available for use these visuals can be downloaded and added to your power bi reports Microsoft has tested and approved these power bi visuals for functionality and Quality Power bi certified visuals or visuals in the app source that were additionally tested to check that the visual does not access external services or resources after importing power bi visualizations from appsource updates may happen automatically without further notification so what is appsource app source is the place for apps addins and extensions for your Microsoft software appsource connects millions of users of products such as Microsoft 365 Azure Dynamics 365 Cortana and power bi to solutions that help them get work done more efficiently and insightfully than before next we have certified power bi visuals certify power bi visuals or visuals and appsource that meet certain specified code requirements that the Microsoft power bi team has tested and approved the tests are designed to check that the visual doesn't access external services or resources so that's a general overview of custom visuals hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be going over filtering data with power bi in a simple type of filtering called a slicer so data is the core of power bi as you explore reports each visual draws its underlying data from sources that often contain far more data than you need filtering is a technique used to focus on a subset of data in the chart making it easier to analyze and identify patterns or Trends power bi offers several ways to filter and highlight reports knowing how to filter data is the key to finding the right information when you filter a visual like a bar chart you are just changing the view of the data in that visual you are not modifying The Source data in any way remember to keep in mind that filtering only applies to reports not to dashboards a simple type of filtering that you can use directly on the report page is called a slicer slicers provide cues to ways you can filter the results and the visuals on a report page there are several different types of slicers such as numeric categorical and date slicers make it easy to filter all the visuals on the page at once so when should you use a slicer well slicers are a great choice when you want to display commonly used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access make it easier to see the current filtered State without having to open a drop down list filter by columns that are unneeded and hidden in the data tables and when you want to create more focused reports by putting slicers next to important visuals also note that power bi slicers don't support input fields and drilled out options explore the filters pane another way to filter data is by opening and modifying filters in the filters pane the filters pane contains filters that were added to the report by the report designer as a consumer you can interact with the filters and save your changes but cannot add new filters there are four types of filters first we have report this applies to all pages in the report then we have page this applies to all the visuals on the current report page next we have visual this applies to a single visual on a report page you only see visual level filters if you have selected a visual on the report canvas and the last type of filter is drill through this allows you to explore successively more detailed views within a single visual moving on to our next topic buttons in power bi so using buttons in power bi lets you create reports that behave like apps and thereby create an engaging environment so users can hover click and further interact with power bi material you can add buttons to reports and power bi desktop and in the power bi service when you share your reports in the power bi service they provide an app like experience for your users to create a button in power bi desktop on the insert ribbon select buttons and a drop down menu appears where you can select the button you want from a collection of options as shown in the image here are some key features and characteristics of buttons and power bi appearance buttons and power bi can be customized with various shapes sizes colors and text to fit the report design action buttons can be configured to perform a variety of actions including filtering data navigating to a different page or report opening a URL or file or running a custom script interaction buttons can be clicked by users to trigger the configured action and can be used to create a more interactive and engaging report experience selection buttons can be used as a selection tool to filter or highlight specific data by configuring them with a slicer or other interactive element integration buttons can be integrated with other power bi features and components such as bookmarks drill through actions and visual interactions to create a more Dynamic and customized report experience so that's a general overview of buttons and power bi hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering is power query editor so sometimes your data might contain extra data or have data in the wrong format you may need additional columns or to rename or hide existing columns you may have multiple data sources and need to define a relationship between them all these tasks are known as data transformation power bi desktop includes the power query editor tool which can help you shape and transform data so that it's ready for your models and visualizations power query editor is a data transformation in preparation tool that allows users to connect to and transform data from a variety of sources like Excel spreadsheets text files databases and web services with power query editor users can extract transform and load data from these sources into Power bi for analysis and visualization it provides a userfriendly interface for data manipulation allowing users to filter sort group pivot and aggregate data using a series of intuitive and easy to use menus and tools it also supports it's merging splitting and unpivoting tables custom calculations and Transformations a key feature of power query editor is its ability to create reusable data queries which can be saved and shared with other users or used to automate data refreshes this can save significant time and effort for users who need to regularly transform and update large data sets launch power query Editor to begin select edit from the Navigator window to launch power query editor you can also launch power query editor directly from Power bi desktop by using the transform data button on the home ribbon in the ribbon the active buttons enable you to interact with the data in the query on the left pane queries are listed and available for selecting viewing and shaping on the center pane data from the selected query is displayed and available for shaping the query settings window lists the queries properties and applied steps so this is the general layout of the power query editor foreign so the next topic we'll be covering is an aggregate at times there may be a need to perform mathematical calculations on the values within your data the mathematical operation could be some average maximum count and so on this process of merging values in your data using mathematical operations is referred to as aggregation the outcome of the calculation is known as an aggregate when power bi service and power bi desktop create visualizations they may aggregate your data in some cases the resulting aggregate may be appropriate but at other times you may want to apply a different type of aggregation to the data such as calculating the sum or average of values there are several different ways to manage and change the aggregate power bi uses in a visualization typically data sets consist of multiple types of data and at the simplest level the data can be classified as either numeric or nonnumeric Tower bi can aggregate numeric data using a sum average count minimum variance and much more additionally power bi can even aggregate nonnumeric data which is often referred to as categorical data if you try to aggregate a categorical field by placing it in a numeric only bucket like values or tooltips power B I will count the occurrences of each category or count the distinct occurrences of each category special types of data like dates have a few of their own aggregate options earliest latest first and last for example according to the image provided units sold a manufacturing price or columns that contain numeric data segment country region product month and month name contain categorical data here we'll look at some of the ways to aggregate your data some of the options that may be available for aggregating a field do not summarize with this option chosen power bi treats each value in that field separately and doesn't summarize them so then this adds all the values in that field up average this takes an arithmetic mean of the values minimum this shows the smallest value maximum this shows the largest value count not blanks this counts the number of values in that field that are blank count the stanctive this counts the number of different values in that field standard deviation variance and median this shows the median value this value has the same number of items above and below if there are two medians power bi averages them foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering the power bi security and administration power bi like many other Microsoft Services utilizes Azure as its foundation Azure is the cloud computing infrastructure and platform developed by Microsoft that guarantees the same level of security for power bi as other Microsoft Services when users sign into Power bi they use their credentials saved in Azure active directory which permits them to control the level of sharing for each report data or dashboard they can determine whether recipients are permitted to edit or just view the items it's important to note that users are responsible for the data they share if a user connects to data sources using their credentials they can share a report or dashboard or data set based on that data users with whom the dashboard is shared are authenticated against the original data source and will be granted access to the report this is beneficial to allow users to share reports and dashboards they have created but does require responsibility on the user's part power bi Administration is the management of a power bi tenant including the configuration of governance policies usage monitoring and provisioning of licenses capacities and organizational resources power bi is designed for selfservice business intelligence the administrator is the guardian of data processes and policies in the power bi tenant a power bi administrator is a key member of a team that includes bi developers analysts and other roles the administrator can help support an organization to make sure that critical goals are met so that's a general overview of the power bi security and administration hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be starting off by creating a Microsoft account so the first thing you want to do is to go to this link here called power.bi dot microsoft.com us and this will take you to this page here you can do this with other Power Platform services like power apps or power automate but since we'll be starting with power bi we'll be using this link and if you don't already have a Microsoft account you'd want to navigate to this button here and click on the try free button so this is the page where you would create your Microsoft account and enter in your email you want to register with and all the other information required let's go with this one Andrew Brown exam Pro gmail.com so for this method of registration you will need a work email so you can't use a commercial email account such as Hotmail and Gmail however there is another method to sign up this will require you to navigate to this page microsoft.com 365 slash Enterprise slash compare Dash office Dash 365plans this page provides you with a few Office 365 and Microsoft 365 apps plans such as Microsoft 365 apps for Enterprise Office 365 E1 Office 365 E3 and office 365e5 there is an option to try for free and this will allow you to access and use all the apps on this list depending on the plan they may provide partial use of the app or some of the lower cost plans may not include some features the key apps that we're interested in are power apps power automate power virtual agents and power bi we'll be going with the Office 365 E5 plan because it includes power bi Pro so let's click on the try for free button here we'll enter in our email address Andrew Brown exam Pro gmail.com the list here shows all the apps and services you'll be getting in the Office 365 E5 trial plan and remember that you have a one month free trial so you have to cancel the trial before that day to avoid any fees so click on next then click on setup account now we'll need to provide information such as our first name surname business phone number company name company size and the country we reside in once we're done that we have to accept the terms of service looks like we have to provide a verification code let's enter that code in and verify to proceed next we have to create a domain name we'll try to keep it simple so let's go with exam Pro looks like exam Pro is already taken so let's try to add a one it's available so we can use this after that's complete we can create a password and confirm the password then press next next we'll have to add a payment method so you'll need to enter in your card information here and everything else that is required once again you'll have to remember to cancel before the one month period to avoid any charges on your card after that's complete we'll have to review all the information that we entered in and confirm to start the trial it'll just take a bit to add the products to our account but once that's complete we can start using the Office 365 E5 trial so click on that remember to use your domain email that we just created to sign in so in this case it's Andrew Brown at exam Pro one dot on microsoft.com enter in your password and click on sign in if you want to install Microsoft 365 on your computer you can click on here I already have it on my system so I can skip this step for the domain we can use the default exam Pro one dot on microsoft.com for now we won't need to add any users or assign licenses for now we can continue here as well after that's all done we can go to the admin Center feel free to look around the settings and features if you want to but now that we have a Microsoft account we should be able to log into the power bi platform so first we want to go back to the power bi dot microsoft.com earlier at the beginning then we want to click on the sign in page we can use our Microsoft account email that we created so we can just copy that onto here then click on submit this should log us into the power bi service now we have access to the power bi service and we can play around with it so that's how you can create a Microsoft account hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be looking at how to build a basic dashboard by using power bi so the first thing you want to do is to go to the power bi page at app.powerbi.com home here you'll be at the home page for power bi which will have recommendations for you to go to such as your recent workspaces what you've frequently opened how to get started and much more so on the left side pane we have a bunch of tabs such as create browse data Hub metrics and so on before we create our own report and dashboard let's quickly go through a sample report that power bi has provided for us so we'll click on learning under samples we'll click on Revenue opportunities so now you're seeing a power bi Report with nice visuals and a breakdown of the revenue opportunities report we have the opportunity revenue and opportunity count on the top left there is the opportunity count by region and pipeline by stage on the bottom left the revenue and opportunity count by month is located on the top right and the revenue by region and state is on the bottom right they are presented with different kinds of visuals like bar graphs line graphs map visuals gradients and so on we're also able to interact with the visuals so if you want to filter out certain regions metrics or any component of the graph you can do that for example if I only want to know the opportunity count by region in the East I can click on the East bar and it'll only show and calculate the values and highlighted areas for the results on the left side page if I click on detail it will show us the underlying table that has The Columns of data used to create the report so let's go back to the report and we'll click on the edit button in the middle this is where you can edit your entire report you have many kinds of visualizations available and filters you can select the data you want in a specific Visual and stylize it to your liking on the right we have the visualizations pane this is where you can build your visual with all kinds of charts like bar chart column chart line chart scatter chart pie chart map chart and many more so let's take a look at the bottom left chart here it's currently a stack bar chart but we can click on stack column chart and it'll change to it right away you can try out other visuals and experiment to see if it fits with the data selected but let's leave it at the stack column chart for now and if we click on the format visual button in the middle we can format the visual of the graph to whatever we want there are many settings we can change for example we can click on columns then click on the colors tab we can remove the conditional formatting of the gradient and add in a solid color or we can change the conditional formatting of the color to what we want we could also change the spacing of the columns to match the size that fits the graph or however thin or thick you want you have plenty of other options such as grid lines data labels and so on there are also General properties where you can edit the properties like the height and size of the chart as well as the position and we can choose to leave the title Auto or not there are additional effects you can add or change in the background visual border Shadow and much more on the right side we have the data pane this shows all the data available that you can use to create the visuals so if we were to click on the pipeline by stage graph we can see that it shows the data that has been used in the visual with the check boxes in this case we've used opportunity count and sales stage we can select different Columns of data and choose the kind of visual that fits it best for example I can choose something like product code and revenue and it'll change the graph using the data that I've selected we will also need to change the title of the graph so we'll go to format your visual then click on General and click on title change the text of the title to something fitting like product code by Revenue so you basically choose what you want to display on your report using the data that you have presented and stylize the visuals to your liking on the Middle top here we have something called ask a question this is a pretty neat feature where you can ask a question about your data it will provide you with suggested questions for you to start out and you can show all suggestions for more results so we can test this out by clicking on something like top states by factored revenue and it'll provide us with the top states by factored Revenue using the data we provided you can select other questions to try out or you can ask your own questions related to the data the next thing we'll be doing is creating a dashboard okay so let's click on the save button on the top right next we'll click on pin to a dashboard select new dashboard and we'll need to give the dashboard a name so we can use the same name as before Revenue opportunities then click on Pin live after that we can click on go to dashboard so this is the dashboard of Revenue opportunities similarly to the report we can interact with the dashboard visuals and select the key points of data that we want to see there is also a drop down menu for the product code to filter out the product codes and more the dashboard has a builtin question and answer at the top so you can ask questions about your data similarly to a report it will provide you with a visual of data that corresponds with the question asked going back to the dashboard we can edit the dashboard by adding a tile or changing the dashboard theme for example I can change the dashboard theme from light to dark making it easier on the eyes for adding a tile we can add many sources of media such as web content images text boxes videos as well as realtime data we won't need to know this for the exam but you can play around with the power bi features as you like hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering how to create a basic report in dashboard if you want to create your own report and dashboard instead of using a sample report you will need a data set if you have your own data set then you can upload by going to my workspace here you can upload your data from OneDrive for business SharePoint or you can browse from your own PC they must be a pbix RDL or xlsx file I'll upload the sales data economic analysis I downloaded earlier if you don't have a data set at hand you can search for what online there are plenty of sources on the internet that provide free data sets for you to learn and practice for example you can go to kaggle.com which is an online platform that offers a variety of resources for data scientists and machine learning practitioners such as data sets and tools to facilitate collaboration and learning I found a data set here called sales data for economic data analysis I clean the data up a bit and trim some of the data to make things less complicated you can use whichever date data set you find or what another way to upload data is simply copying or manually entering in data so you can click on create on the left side click on paste or manually enter data from your Excel file Google Sheets or any source that has a data set you can copy and paste the data into the table if your data has headers in the first row you want to click on the use first row as headers you also want to rename the table so we'll rename this to sales data economic we can choose to Auto create report create a blank report or create a data set only but we'll choose autocreate report to use as a starting point okay here we are free to play around with the current design we have first we need to change this to edit mode so click on that then we need to change some of the data on the graphs to the data that we're interested in and to ensure that the data makes sense because sometimes the auto create report uses data like total sum of age which is something we don't want so I've chosen the data that I want for my graphs and the types of visuals that look appropriate for them now we'll be adjusting the size of the canvas and we'll try to go for a different look to do this we'll go to the format page then canvas settings and we'll want to select a custom type so we can change the height and width that suits the report we can enter in something like 1000 pixels height and 1200 pixels width you can choose what you think is best after that we'll be moving around the graphs and visuals to see where we want to place them or if we think it looks suitable we'll also be adjusting the sizes of the graphs in visuals so it makes sense or looks decent enough I'll be speeding through this section because it's mostly just adjusting the graph's positions and making sure they align well with the canvas so you won't be missing out on anything too important we want to try something a little unique so we'll be providing it with a dark background you will need to go to format page then click on canvas background change the color to a dark color and lower the transparency so that it's visible you can also use an image that you have on your personal computer by clicking browse we'll be using a dark blue gradient background we found with a simple Google search after seeing the white boxes I've made a few more adjustments to the placements of the graphs we will need to remove the white boxes from the graphs and text boxes so we'll need to click on effects and turn off the background so we'll have to adjust the font to White so it's easier to read we'll need to do this for these visual cards so it's the same process click on category labels then change the font color to white then on the callout values also change the font to White for the graphs we'll need to turn the background off so click on General then click on effects then click the toggle to turn the background off then you need to click on visual then click on the xaxis here you will need to change the value font to White then you will need to change the title font to White you will also need to change the font color to white for the yaxis you will need to change the title font to White so you'll have to click on data labels then click on values then change the font to White you will need to change the title font to White I realized I forgot to change the transparency to zero so you'll be able to see the dark blue gradient so as you can see it's starting to look better we'll continue to change the fonts for the remaining graphs we will apply the same steps like the sub of Revenue by month graph so we'll need to change the xaxis and yaxis fonts to White and we'll need to change the color of the title and data labels to White and we need to turn off the background so we'll be speeding through this process since we already know how to execute this the bar colors look at bit plain so we'll add a gradient effect to make it look more interesting to do this we'll click on format visual then click on bars then click on the FX button the default gradient color they provided looks decided so we'll press ok we also want to turn off the legend since it automatically turned on once we applied a gradient we'll try to apply this to the other graphs as well so we'll go through the same procedure click on bars then click on the FX button we want to keep the orange color to mix it up a bit so we'll try to find lighter orange for the minimum then we'll find a darker orange for the maximum then click OK we'll also want to get rid of the legend since it doesn't look too appealing in my opinion same process for the final graph we'll also give it a gradient okay so this looks fine it's not perfect but it's definitely more interesting than the default design that they provided for us after that you can save the report and we can do the same thing as we did in the previous video pin to dashboard and Pin live so all in all you can customize and design the report however you want using all the tools effects colors visuals available in power bi until you are satisfied with your design hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering power apps in Greater detail power apps is a low code no code platform developed by Microsoft that allows users to build custom business applications for web and mobile devices it enables users to create custom apps using a drag and drop interface and prebuilt templates without the need for extensive coding knowledge with power apps users can create apps that connect to various data sources including

that want to improve their customer and partner engagement through the powerapps interface you can build an anonymous or authenticated website that allows users to interact with data held in dataverse the same drag and drop experience you enjoy when building apps is available to build these rich interactive websites so that's a general overview of powerapps portals hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll cover is AI Builder AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability that provides AI models that are designed to optimize your business processes AI Builder enables your business to use intelligence to automate processes and glean insights from your data in powerapps in power automate with AI Builder you can Leverage The Power of AI without having any coding or data science skills you can build custom models tailored to your needs or choose a prebuilt model that is ready to use for many common business scenarios integration with powerapps and power automate mix using AI easy to add intelligence to your business why to choose an AI model type use the model type that suits your business need choose from a growing set of AI solutions to connect data select your business specific data from the available options three tailor your AI model depending on the type of model you can tweak custom models to optimize how your AI performs for train your AI model training is an automatic process it teaches your AI model how to resolve your business problem for example how to recognize your products on an image based on your business data and tailoring when trained your AI model can generate insights such as the result of a prediction or the list and number of objects detected in an image five use insights from your AI model use the results from your AI model across Power Platform to create solutions that meet your business needs even if you have no coding skills for example you can create a flow that automates document processing in power automate or an app in power apps that predicts whether a supplier will be out of compliance foreign you can use AI builder in Microsoft power apps in one of two ways depending on the model you will be using you can use AI models in the formula bar or add AI Builder components use AI models in the formula bar you can get support for the following AI Builder models that use power apps through the formula bar here is a table that shows the model types available and the build types you can use it's either prebuilt or built and custom for the sentiment analysis model type the build type is prebuilt for entity extraction the build type is for built and custom for key phrase extraction it's prebuilt for language detection it's prebuilt and for category classification it's prebuilt and Custom at AI Builder components AI Builder provides two kinds of power apps components choose your component based on the models you want to use components that use per built AI models that are ready to use right away business card reader for canvas app business card reader for model driven app receipt processor for canvas app and text recognizer for canvas app components that use custom AI models that you build and train form processor and object detector the business card reader is an example of a prebuilt component that uses AI components which can also be used in other ways by creating a custom model to create a model users can follow a stepbystep process using the wizard available on make.powerapps.com currently powerapps offers four AI models which are prediction this model uses historical data to predict future events form processor this model can extract text from images such as with the business card reader object detector this model can identify objects and images and provide a count of the number of objects present text classification this model categorizes text by its meaning to facilitate analysis the prediction model the AI Builders prediction model allows users to generate a model that can predict yes or no outcomes based on historical data you train the model by providing historical data that includes the yes no outcome AI builder takes care of the rest with the prediction model users can create solutions for various business problems such as will Elite convert to a customer will a project generate profit will a customer stop using the product based on their activity hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this section we'll be covering the functions in powerapps in a bit more detail when working with Microsoft power apps you don't need to have expertise in writing complex application code like a professional developer however you still need to express the app's logic and manage its features such as navigation filtering and sorting this is where formulas become useful if you're familiar with Microsoft Excel functions you'll find it easy to develop apps using power apps to create a formula you'll combine one or more formulas with the necessary and optional parameters these are some common functions used in powerapps and their purposes filter this function is typically used in conjunction with tables or galleries of data to narrow down the rows retrieved from the data source by specifying one or more columns in your data set to perform a logical test on you can return data that falls within a specific date range as a particular value or was created by the user for instance match this function allows you to check whether a value follows a specified pattern you can utilize it to validate if the user has entered a correctly formatted email address and if not display a warning message indicating that a valid email is required this function is particularly useful for conditional formatting distinct this function enables you to retrieve the unique values from a list of data simplifying the process of creating Dynamic drop down menus that display only valid values for a given column math functions powerapps features a variety of math formulas for manipulating your data ranging from simple operations like sum and average to more advanced functions such as aten and sin for working with radians power apps can create three types of apps canvas model driven and portals each is suited to different scenarios and end users the first one we'll be covering are canvas apps so canvas apps are a low code application development platform that allows users to create custom business applications using a drag and drop interface with canvas apps users start with a blank canvas and add controls such as buttons labels and text boxes to create a custom user interface users can then connect these controls to data sources such as Microsoft 365 Dynamics 365 SharePoint or other thirdparty data sources to create datadriven applications canvas apps offer extensive customization options allowing users to modify the appearance and behavior of controls create custom formulas and expressions and integrate with other Microsoft services they can also be deployed to a variety of platforms including web browsers and mobile devices canvas apps are best suited for scenarios where a high degree of customization and flexibility is required such as when building custom business processes or workflows some common use cases and capabilities of canvas apps include custom forms and data entry canvas apps can be used to create custom forms and data entry interfaces that can be integrated with various data sources like Microsoft Excel SharePoint or Dynamics 365 this makes it easier to collect and organize data in a way that is specific to your business requirements workflow automation with canvas apps users can build custom workflows that automate business processes like approvals notifications or routing of work items this capability can be integrated with power automate enabling you to connect to over 275 external services and apis custom dashboards and analytics canvas apps can be used to create custom dashboards and analytics that display key metrics and data visualizations in a way that is Meaningful to your business this can be integrated with powerby allowing you to create interactive reports and data visualizations mobile applications canvas apps can be used to create mobile applications that are optimized for smartphones and tablets this can be useful for creating custom applications for field employees sales teams or other remote workers integration with other services canvas apps can be integrated with other Microsoft services like Dynamics 365 power automate and power bi this makes it possible to create custom applications that are tailored to your specific business needs and that can be integrated with other applications or services foreign apps has many different components to build Solutions including screens inputs galleries forms and more power app studio is the webbased interface that enables you to create your app without requiring you to download or install a separate client by logging into https colon slash make.powerapps.com from your browser you can build your app entirely online using powerapps app for vet the first step in creating your app is to choose the format of your app mobile or tablet while both formats are compatible with mobile device a tablet or a computer each has different defaults regarding the size of the screens and controls once you choose the format for an app you cannot change it galleries the gallery control is used to display rows from a table of data the display of a row is then defined by a template which you can customize to meet your needs this allows you to control which columns are shown and how they are formatted power apps will then apply this template automatically to every Row in your data forms forms are focused on working with a specific record often based on a selection from a gallery and this experience a user browses a gallery to find and select the desired row to view the details on the form forms enable a user to not only view detailed information but to save new records and edit existing ones the various actions performed with forms are controlled by Form nodes allowing the form to serve many purposes input controls powerapps provides a wide range of input controls to offer maximum flexibility while customizing your apps these controls include text inputs buttons dropdowns toggles date Pickers and Sliders among others you can seamlessly integrate these controls into galleries forms and screens to create an aesthetically appealing and functional app furthermore all these inputs come with various settings for default data formatting and actions empowering you to develop an app that offers an optimal user experience for your business process intelligent controls in addition to Common inputs powerapps also provides a rich set of controls for more advanced operations these include hardwarebacked controls that provide access to features like the camera Barcode Scanner GPS and other Hardware related functionalities there are also service backed controls like the business card reader and object detector which enable you to incorporate artificial intelligence into your app without writing any code functions functions play a crucial role in connecting controls inputs and data sources and power apps by using functions you can create formulas that perform various actions such as formatting data sending data to a data source or creating animations these formulas are similar to excel functions and do not require complex coding they are easy to use and can enhance the functionality of your app hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be looking at how to build a basic canvas app so before we begin we'll need a sample data set that we can provide to powerapps which will enable it to connect and create a canvas app we will need to navigate to this pagelearn.microsoft.com and US slash power Dash apps slash maker slash canvas Dash apps slash get Dash started Dash create Dash from Dash data this page provides steps to create a canvas app with data from an Excel file and provides a sample data set we can use there are many data connectors to use but for this example we'll use an Excel file you are free to use your own Excel file but the data must be formatted as a table so the first thing we'll have to do is download the flooring estimates Excel file I already have the file downloaded on my computer so I won't need to download it again once you have it downloaded you'll want to upload this file onto your OneDrive so you'll have to go to the OneDrive this is part of your Microsoft 365 account and is linked to apps like powerapps power bi power automate and other apps click on upload then file then choose the flooring estimates Excel file I already have it uploaded on my OneDrive so I won't need to upload it after you're finished uploading you'll need to navigate to the powerapps page to do that you can click on the top left Square dots then click on all apps then you can use the search tool or you can scroll down to find power apps click on power apps to open the powerapps page once we have arrived here we want to click on create as you can see there are many connections to choose from but we'll be using the Excel file we uploaded so we'll click on Excel so after you click on Excel you want to click on OneDrive for business if you don't have a OneDrive for business connection already you'll be prompted to create one by clicking the new connection button then you'll click on the flooring estimates file choose the table and click on connect here you will see an app that is created with the flooring estimates data you can press the play button or F5 to preview the app and play here it provides the entire list of items in the Excel file that we provided it has structured the data in an interactive canvas app which displays the images and details on each item and it includes multiple functions such as a search option new item button and more you can click on the right arrow to view the item in more detail it will provide the category the image the name a description and a price for the specific item there is an edit button to edit out the specific fields that we've mentioned and there is a delete button to delete the item there's also a sort list button to sort by alphabetical order and a refresh button in case one of your team members has updated the Excel data set so you can click on the X on the top right or press escape to go back to the previous working canvas view also there's a good tip here where you can hold the ALT key to activate buttons and other controls while you are working on the app normally if you click on the buttons you'll just select and highlight the area and you can edit it but if you hold the ALT key you can activate the button in controls like this so you won't need to preview the app and can edit it while testing it so on the left here shows a tree view of all our items and as you notice that with every item that I'm selecting the things on the working canvas are being selected as well you can see that things like next Arrow one subtitle one search icon 1 and so on are correspond to in the working canvas so let's take a look at something like the subtitle one here on the right hand side it shows all the properties that we can edit for the specific item that we've selected for example I can change the font weight to bold which should reflect on the app right away I can change the text to something else like Ariel I can change the font color to something like blue or we can change it to something like orange but let's leave it the way it originally was for now so as you can see on the left in the tree view this app is broken down into three screens there is the browse screen which is the main screen you see with the list of items there is the detail screen which displays the details of each item and there's the edit screen which allows you to edit the fields on a specific item and each one of these screens has its own layout that is made up of buttons forms functions items and such for that specific screen for the user to interact with some of these buttons may have functions as you can see on the function bar it shows new form edit Form 1 and it navigates to edit screen one but since it's a fundamental course you won't need to know each and every function and how to use them at a high level so we can do some small changes to this such as adding a space to the flooring estimates title to make it more legible remember that this only applies to the browse screen so we'll have to change the for estimate title for the detail and edit screen as well you can insert all kinds of items and controls such as text labels edit forms buttons and many more so overall there are many ways to customize and design the way your canvas app looks using any structured data set you want you can add data integration from a variety of sources including Excel SharePoint and SQL Server and you can publish and share their canvas apps within their organization or even publicly hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering model driven apps so a model driven app is a type of app that is designed to present data in a structured and organized way using prebuilt components and a data model that defines the relationships between different data entities in a model driven app the user interface is generated automatically based on the data model which allows users to interact with the app in a consistent and intuitive way model driven apps and power apps are typically used for complex scenarios where data is stored in multiple tables and there are complex relationships between them for example a model driven app could be used to manage a customer relationship management system where data is stored in tables such as contacts accounts and opportunities the app would provide prebuilt components such as forms lists and charts that allow users to view create and edit data in a structured way one of the key advantages of model driven apps and power apps is that they provide a high degree of flexibility and customization users can modify the data model to add new tables or fields and they can customize the user interface by adding or removing components changing layouts and applying themes in summary a model driven app in powerapps is a powerful tool for building custom business applications that provide a structured and organized way to interact with complex data models before we go more in detail on model driven apps we'll go through the main differences between model driven apps and canvas apps the main difference between model driven apps and canvas apps and powerapps is the way the user interface is designed and how data is presented model driven apps have an automatically generated prebuilt interface based on a data model while canvas apps allow users to design the interface from scratch using prebuilt components and formulas model driven apps are best for complex data models with multiple tables while canvas apps are ideal for simpler models or highly customized interfaces here are some key differences between model driven apps and canvas apps and power apps user interface model driven apps have a prebuilt structured user interface based on the data model while canvas apps allow users to design the user interface from scratch data model driven apps are designed to work with complex data models that have multiple tables and relationships while canvas apps are better suited for simpler data models customization canvas apps provide more customization options than model driven apps but they also require more design work development speed model driven apps can be developed more quickly than canvas apps because much of the user interface is prebuilt but they may be less flexible in terms of design overall the choice between model driven apps and canvas apps depends on the specific requirements of your application if you need to work with a complex data model a model driven app may be the better choice well if you need more flexibility in terms of design a canvas app may be the way to go in canvas apps the App Maker has total control over the app layout with model driven apps much of the layout is determined by the components you add here is a table to view the differences between the two apps per category to make it more digestible it's a bit redundant to what we've already stated but it doesn't hurt to reinforce the information you'll need to know for the exam data platform for model driven apps its dataverse only whereas for canvas apps it's dataverse plus many others using connectors design experience there is no code component focused design for model driven apps but for canvas apps there is manipulation of control properties using Power FX Expressions eui control for model driven apps there is limited predominantly customization canvas apps have full control for model driven apps the app consistency is high differs predominantly based on the tables and Views chosen for canvas apps it's often low given the significant control the designers have of the user experience the migration between environments is simple for model driven apps and potentially complex given that the data sources may need to be updated for canvas apps speed of creation is rapid for model driven apps and relative to the complexity of the design for canvas apps it's automatically responsive for model driven apps and only responsive if designed in this way for canvas apps for model driven apps the navigation through relationships is automatic provided relationships exist and for canvas apps it's only where designed and applied using Power FX formulas accessibility features are built in for model driven apps whereas for canvas apps it's designed into the app create accessible canvas apps foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering the three design phases of a model driven app so model driven apps have three design phases why to model your business data to Define your business processes three build the app model your business data model driven design uses metadata driven architecture so that designers can customize apps without writing code to model business data you determine what data the app will need and how that data will relate to other data metadata means data about data and defines the structure of the data stored in Microsoft dataverse you create a data model that defines the structure of the data that the app will use this includes defining entities and the relationships between them you can also Define data fields views and charts Define your business processes defining and enforcing consistent business processes is a key aspect of model driven app design consistent processes help ensure that your app users can focus on their work and not worry about having to remember to perform a set of manual steps processes can be simple or complex and they often change over time you define the business processes that the app will support such as workflows approvals and notifications you can use the builtin tools and power apps to create and manage these processes the screenshot illustrates the impact of having a business process flow in place build the app after modeling data and defining processes you build your app by selecting and setting up the components you need in the app designer you create the user interface for the app using prebuilt components such as forms lists and charts the user interface is generated automatically based on the data model you created in the first phase you can also customize the user interface by adding or removing components changing layouts and applying themes foreign the next topic we'll be covering are the building blocks of model driven apps starting with data the table below shows the different data components that can make up a model driven app which can determine what data the app will be based upon it also shows what designer is used to create or edit the data component table tables or items with properties that you track examples include contacts and accounts many standard tables are available you can customize a nonsystem standard table you could also create a custom table from scratch column columns are properties that are associated with a table and help Define that table a column is defined by a data type which determines the type of data that can be entered or selected examples of data types include text number date and time currency and look up columns are typically used in forms views and searches relationship relationships Define how tables can be related to each other there are one and and one and then and relationships for example adding a lookup column to a table creates a new one and relationship between the two tables and lets you add that lookup column to a form choice this type of column shows a control that lets the user select among predefined options each option has a number value in a label Choice columns can require either a single value or multiple values user interface the table below shows the user interface components which determine how users will interact with the app and what designer is used to create or edit the component app apps determine the app fundamentals like components properties the client type and the URL sitemap a sitemap specifies the navigation for your app for it forms include a set of data entry columns for a given table a form can be used to create a new data row or edit an existing one view views Define how a list of rows for a specific table appears in your app a view defines the column shown Logic the logic components determine what business processes rules and automation the app will have Microsoft power apps makers use a designer that is specific to the type of process or rule they are needing business process flow business process flows walk users through a standard business process use a business process flow if you want everyone to handle customer service requests the same way or you can use a business process flow to require staff to gain approval for an invoice before submitting an order workflow workflows automate business processes without a user interface designers use workflows to initiate automation that does not require any user interaction actions actions are a type of process that lets you manually invoke behaviors including custom actions directly from a workflow business rule business rules apply rules or recommendation logic to a form to set field requirements hide or show Fields validate data and more app designers use a simple interface to implement and maintain fast changing and commonly used rules flows power automate is a cloudbased service that lets you create automated workflows between apps and services to get notifications sync files collect data and more visualization the visualization components determine what type of data and Reporting the app will show and have available in which designer is used to create or edit the component chart charts are individual graphical visualizations that can appear in a view or a form or that can be added to a dashboard dashboard dashboards show one or more graphical visualizations in one place that provide an overview of actionable business data embedded Microsoft power via power bi ads embedded power bi tiles and dashboards to your app power bi is a cloudbased service that provides business intelligence insight please another important aspect of a model driven app is the business logic model driven apps are created using the app designer users select tables dashboards business process flows forms and other components to be made available in the app which will then be automatically generated this means you will need to spend more time understanding what your user needs and how it is going to look business logic when incorporating business logic in your app there are two primary options available you can set business rules on your Microsoft dataverse tables or you can build business process flows with business rules you'll Define behaviors of the data layer business rules are great for setting conditions for when a field is required setting a default value or even showing or hiding a field based on criteria an example could be a table for tracking expenses you could have a column for type of travel and then build a business rule that dictates that if a user chooses automobile then the mileage field is required else it is optional this gives you the power to make sure you maintain data consistency in all scenarios and powerapps a business process flow is a feature that helps guide users through a specific process or workflow within an app they can be used to standardize processes ensure consistency and improve efficiency a business process flow consists of a series of stages and steps each with its own set of fields and actions users can move through the stages and steps to complete the process and business process flows can be set up to require certain fields or data entry before advancing to the next stage they can be associated with specific entities and power apps such as leads opportunities or cases and can be customized to fit the specific needs of the organization additionally business process flows can be used in conjunction with other features in power apps such as business rules to further enhance the user experience and streamline workflows hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be providing a brief overview of dashboards and power apps in powerapps a dashboard is a user interface that provides a summary view of data from various sources dashboards and power apps typically include visualizations such as charts graphs tables and other data driven components that allow users to quickly and easily View and analyze data in a centralized location powerapps dashboards can be customized to meet specific business requirements and can be created using various data sources including Microsoft dataverse Excel spreadsheets and SharePoint lists users can also create multiple dashboards and share them with specific individuals or groups within the organization dashboards and power apps are an essential component of data analysis and visualization providing users with a clear and concise view of key performance indicators Trends and other critical business metrics you can Implement dashboards with custom filters and visual Graphics to tie all this data together right in your app when creating your dashboards make sure they are simple for your users to consume without overwhelming them with all the data provide highlevel snapshots of your data and allow them to use filters to dive deeper into the data if needed foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this video we'll be going over a sample of a model driven app so the first thing you want to do is to go to the powerapps page which is at make dot powerapps.com here it provides you with a lot of options to build business apps you can start from blank dataverse SharePoint Excel SQL and so on let's start by using a template that is already prepared for us this will give us a better understanding of a model driven app like the structure and all the tables of data that are linked together so we'll be clicking on the create button on the left side panel scroll down and look for the templates as you can see we have a lot of templates we can choose from but let's take a look at Innovation Challenge which is labeled as a model driven app click on create now that we have it loaded we can look at this page in better detail so in the center box is the model driven app View on the left you can see the pages tab currently open you also have other tabs here such as navigation data and automation we won't have to worry too much about it as of now on the right hand side are the properties that you can edit or change depending on what you are selecting it could be the content type title icon ID and so on so let's press the play button on the top right to preview this model driven app okay so what we're currently viewing right now is a dashboard the use case we're seeing generally involves Gathering ideas and Concepts transforming them into projects and connecting them with larger business strategies and this model driven app has tables that are related to each other and we want to be able to track all of those things so this dashboard consists of visually appealing charts and lists of items that make it easy to see what's going on and this application has three tables in it we have challenges ideas and team projects so if we take a look at challenges this will show us a view of tables consisting of the name number of ideas launch date accept new ideas and so on we can sort however we like or filter by using more advanced features we can also edit the information on the tables if we wish to so if we were to double click into one of these challenges such as the connected operations at the top here we have a business process flow and this guides the user across the stages and steps of an endtoend process that you've made in your business that you want to track manage and report on so as you can see we have lots of different fields of information such as the description and order we have a drag and drop with multiple different boxes you can check like email teams and phone we have a list of stakeholders at other records so one challenge may be linked to many contributed ideas and so on I'm able to click on one of those ideas and see something similar for example if I click on the fleet automation idea you can see another business process flow at the top here you can see the visibility of that parent challenge record showing through with readonly Fields here you can see the investment required of fifty thousand dollars the time to Roi of 12 months status reason is active the idea score is 9 and the risk score is five then the other thing we can do with the business process flow is approve the project stages manually and proceed to the next stage however they must meet the set of requirements and if we look at the team projects tab we will see the list of active team projects here we see the fleet automation that we were just on listing all the relevant information on that so you can sort of see how the tables and data are linked together through many relationships and how it can be sorted and transformed into a dashboard as mentioned before this dashboard is built using these three tables challenges ideas and team projects which is part of the Innovation Challenge model driven app thank you hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this video we'll be covering how to create a basic model driven app or specifically a simplified version of The Innovation Challenge model driven app we showed earlier so as we've mentioned before model driven apps are built using Microsoft dataverse and if we click on tables you will see a list of tables ready for you to use for common activities or scenarios the most common data tables user account and contacts because when you are doing anything that involves customers these will most likely come into play you can choose to use them or not but you'll see that they're comprehensive you can add to them or you can edit them in your app so you've got that starting point so let's click on Solutions and click on Innovation Challenge as you can see our Innovation Challenge currently has no objects so we'll need to create some if we recall the Innovation Challenge at three tables challenge ideas and team projects we'll only be creating the challenge and ideas tables for this simplified version let's click on the new button then towards table so for the display name this will be challenge we can enable attachments if we want click on Advanced options and here we have many options and boxes we can select such as track changes setting up SharePoint document management and so on but what we want to select is the create new activity this will create a timeline that's going to be in the middle now that we have a table created we're going to need to create some of the columns that were in The Innovation Challenge app so let's click on columns under the schema box as you can see there's already a list of columns in the powerapps environment for common use cases such as created by created on Modified by owner and so on you can set up all kinds of ownership and security and permissions which allows you to control that at a very granular level if we recall from The Innovation Challenge app edit columns like description duration accept new ideas until and communicate via these aren't included in the common columns that powerapps has provided so we'll need to create them and customize them similarly to the app click on new column give the display name is description the data type will be text and we want the multiple lines of text to be rich text click on Save we'll now need to create the accept new ideas until column so click on new column again the display name is accept new ideas until use the data type drop down menu to select date and time and we'll select date only then click on save it the next column We'll add is the duration column so click on new column the display name is duration weeks and brackets and we want the data type to be number and select whole number click on Save click on new column again this column is the communicate via column the data type will be choice and we want to choose the selecting multiple choices as a loud checkbox and on the bottom we want to select new choice the display name will be communication here we'll be making the three choices the first one is email click on new Choice label the second choices teams then the last label is phone we can add color to the boxes to make them a bit more visually appealing and easier to distinguish by selecting the Box on the left after that's done click on Save next we have to sync this Choice with the communication choice that we just created so search for that and select communication save that as well okay now let's create the ideas table click on new click on table the display name is idea and we also want to have the same features as the first table so we'll click on the creating a new activity checkbox so we can have that timeline of activities in it let's add a column to the idea table called investment required so same process click on new then click on column the display name is investment required for the data type it will be currency click save you can make the app as complex as you want by adding it as many tables and different things to it so the next thing we're going to do is create something called a lookup column for the idea table this links these two together from the idea table back to the originating challenge table so we'll click on new then select column we'll name this origin challenge the data type will be lookup and the related table will be challenge click on Save so if we click on relationships from the schema box we should be able to see the origin challenge that we created between the two tables The Challenge and idea tables are linked together through their relationships you can also create relationships here on the top left such as many to one one to many and many to many a lot of the work is already done for you with the intersecting tables behind the scenes so you won't have to worry too much about that the next component we want to look at is views so click on views in the idea table then click on active ideas this is where you build your app component you get to choose the columns you want and do the filtering process this is a drag and drop interface so you can drag in the columns such as the investment required column we just created and we can add in the origin challenge into the view organize the columns and resize to your fitting we can also add and edit filters and sorting orders so that it comes up filtered by certain things you might want to Only See next click on Save is then click on Save and click back to return to the previous screen the next thing we'll be creating is called a form so you want to click on the challenges table and click on forms then you want to click on information the form type is main should be fine this is pretty much the skeleton and structure of the table where you'll be able to enter in information and create challenges so in here you're able to add different kinds of columns and headings and things on the page on the bottom right let's click on layout and change it to three columns wide similarly to the original app you can have one two or three columns next let's track some of the columns that we made that were for the Innovation Challenge app accept new ideas until can be placed on the top right communicate via can be placed below the owner the description Rich text box can be placed between the name and owner we can place the duration on the top right as well let's click on the components we'll be adding a timeline in the column here and we'll be creating something called the subgrid so we'll need to scroll through and select the ideas table for this and then the default view of active ideas is already set click on done move it over to the right column so let's rename these labels because new SG control with these numbers isn't very helpful we'll name the separate as ideas and we'll give the column label section the contributing ideas we can rename the middle column section to something like events you can customize it to however you're liking there are many features and components you can add to it so this should be similar enough to The Innovation Challenge app so we'll click on save a copy then click save it next we'll return to the innovation app page this time we'll be creating a business process flow which was the bar at the top that takes you from the end to end of the stages and steps of the process so click on new drop down menu to automation then process and click on business process flow we'll need to provide a name for it so challenge process seems fine we'll need to select which table it's related to so we're using the challenge table click on create on the top left we'll need to add more stages to the business process flow The Innovation Challenge app had four stages so we'll need to create three more stages you can create as many as you want but we'll keep it similar to the original let's give the stages a name just like the business process flow in the innovation app so the first stage is set up the second stage is track the third stage is Select and execute and the fourth stage is close in award in these stages we'll need to provide a data step for each one of them so to keep things simple we'll give duration in weeks for the data fields in all the stages if you don't have the data steps set up you won't be able to activate the business process flow you can also add conditions and more complex features but we'll keep it simple in this app after adding the data steps click on Saved then you can click on activate okay so the next step is to create the model driven app so click on new drop down menu to app then click on model driven app we'll give the model driven app a name so Innovation Challenge app is fine click on creative next we'll need to add a page so click on ADD page then choose the dataverse table then click next we'll be adding in the challenge and idea table that we created into our model driven app so click on ADD page again dataverse table then click on next find the idea table and click add we also want to rename the group one on our app so let's click on the navigation tab click on Group 1 and rename to something appropriate for the app like innovation next we'll need to click on the automation tab on the left we'll need to add our business process flow to the app so we'll click on challenge process after that click on Save then click on publish after that's done we'll go back to the Innovation Challenge app screen and at the top we'll click on publish all customizations once you see the publish all customization succeeded notification you can navigate back to the apps tab here you should see the Innovation Challenge app that you have created and customized so click on that we'll need to enter in the challenges that were in the original Innovation Challenge app so click on new here we can see the form that we created in this same structure we have the business process flow the name description odor communicate via and so on just like the original so let's enter in some of the information the name is connected operations we'll give that a description and fill in all the other stuff after we've finished entering the information in and selecting the things we want we can click on Save in the top and once we go back we can see that a challenge has been added to the active challenges list we can choose to add more challenges and ideas to the model driven app to make it similar to the original app so as we mentioned earlier this is a simplified version of The Innovation Challenge app you can play around with the tables the forms views business process flows and create what you want to learn more hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering power automate in Greater detail so do you regularly download email attachments before uploading them to the database does the process of authorizing a new purchase order involve retrieving a form from a physical location for signatures do you have to manually visit a website daily locate the daily numbers and then transfer them to another system power automate is a solution that can help with these and other similar scenarios it is designed to enable computers to manage repetitive tasks with power automate anyone familiar with the business process can establish a repeatable sequence that executes the process when triggered common scenarios and capabilities of power automate automating repetitive tasks like transferring data between systems dieting a user through a multistage process connecting to external data sources using various connectors or an API automating desktop based and website processes with robotic process automation capabilities access to data is an important aspect of app development and power automate provides over 600 connectors to connect to data and services on the web or on premises some common data sources included Microsoft dataverse Salesforce Dynamics 365 Google Drive Office 365. Microsoft Power Platform easily supports multiple data connections allowing you to bring data together from many platforms into a single automation additionally power automate enables users to create custom connectors using a Swagger file to connect to any data source that is not covered by the existing connectors so those are the main values of using power automate there are several types of flows you can create with power automate power automate works by creating flows of which there are three main types cloudflows business process flows and desktop flows cloudflows these flows are created with a trigger in one or more actions and there are many triggers and actions available through connectors such as receiving an email or a social media mentioned they are categorized as my flows or team flows based on ownership with my flows being owned solely by the Creator and team flows having multiple odors create a cloud flow to automate a task that can be triggered automatically immediately or on a schedule automated flows these flows are triggered automatically when a specific event occurs in a connected application or service such as arrival of an email from a specific person or a mention of your company in social media instant flows these flows can be triggered manually by the user through the power automate mobile app the web interface or other methods for example instantly send a reminder to the team with a push of a button from your mobile device scheduled flows these flows run on a regular schedule or at specific times such as daily data upload to SharePoint or a database business process flows these flows are built to augment the experience when using model driven apps in Microsoft dataverse use these to create a guided experience in your model driven apps desktop flows these robotic process automation flows allow you to record yourself performing actions on your desktop or within a web browser you can then trigger a flow to perform that process for you you can also pass data integrate data out of the process letting you automate even manual business processes so these are the types of flows in power automate the next topic we'll be covering in power automate or cloudflow templates so a cloud flow template is a prebuilt workflow that automates a specific business process or task in power automate these templates are designed to be easily customized and deployed allowing users to quickly create and share automated workflows that meet their specific needs cloudflow templates are available for a wide range of use cases from simple data transfers between applications to complex business processes involving multiple steps and approvals users can browse and search for templates in the power automate interface or on the Microsoft Power Platform website and can also create their own templates to share with others you can choose from a collection of templates to find the one that best matches your company's scenario search all templates or Browse by category to find your scenario and then follow the steps in the template to create a cloud flow from the template some common use cases for cloud flow templates and power automate include wide approval workflows templates can be used to create automated approval workflows for documents contracts and other types of requests for example a template could be created that automatically sends a document to a manager for approval when it is uploaded to a specific folder two social media monitoring templates can be used to monitor social media platforms for mentions of a company product or brand this can help businesses stay up to date with customer feedback and respond quickly to any issues three data integration templates can be used to automate the integration of data from different sources for example a template could be created that automatically pulls customer data from a CRM system and adds it to a marketing automation platform for a vet management templates can be used to automate the management of events such as sending invitations tracking RSVPs and sending reminders five document automation templates can be used to automate the creation of documents such as contracts invoices and reports this can help businesses save time and reduce errors overall Cloud flow templates are a powerful tool that can be used to automate a wide range of business processes improve efficiency and reduce errors hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be covering are the Microsoft power automate Concepts starting with actions and triggers power automate cloudflows use connector triggers and actions to automate tasks every flow has two main parts a trigger and what are more actions a trigger is an event that starts the workflow such as a new email arriving in your inbox a file being added to a folder or a new record Being created in a database triggers are used to initiate the workflow and determine when it should run an action is a specific task that is performed as part of the workflow such as sending an email creating a new item in a list or updating a record in a database actions are used to automate tasks and perform specific functions based on the trigger connectors are the bridge between the triggers and actions allowing them to communicate with other services and applications by using the appropriate connectors users can create powerful and complex workflows that automate a wide range of business processes connector triggers and actions are the building blocks of power automate Cloud flows allowing users to easily automate tasks and streamline their workflows some examples of types of actions you can have in a flow include Loops runs in action until conditions are met to move to the next step of the flow switch identifies a single case to execute based on the evaluation of input due until executes a block of actions until a specified condition evaluates to true apply to each executes a block of actions for each item in the input array Expressions underlying definition that describes the actual logic that runs in your flow that can be manually written you can also perform data operations in your flow such as compose create CSV table join or select these Concepts will come into play later when you build your own flows from scratch the next power automate concept we'll be covering in Greater detail or loops a loop in power automate is a control structure that allows you to repeat a set of actions for each item in a collection or until a specific condition is met Loops are useful for automating tasks that involve processing a large number of items or performing a set of actions repeatedly until a specific outcome is achieved the idea behind a loop is to make a desktop flow repeat one or more actions multiple times power automate implements the simplest type of loops with the loop action this Loop repeats the actions between the loop and end actions for a set number of times a loop index variable is created automatically to track the current iterations number there are four types of Loops available in power automate apply to each Loop this Loop allows you to process each item in a collection one at a time it is useful for automating tasks that involve processing a large number of items such as sending an email for each row in a SharePoint list do until Loop this Loop allows you to repeat a set of actions until a specific condition is met it is useful for automating tasks that require a specific outcome such as waiting until a file is available in a cloud storage service before continuing with other actions do while loop this Loop allows you to repeat a set of actions while a specific condition is true it is useful for automating tasks that involve checking for new data such as waiting for new emails to arrive in a mailbox for each Loop this Loop allows you to process each item in a collection based on a specific index or value it is useful for automating tasks that involve working with lists or tables such as updating records in a database these Loops are flexible and powerful and they can be combined with other actions and conditions to create complex workflows by using Loops you can automate repetitive tasks reduce errors and improve your productivity the next power automate concept we'll be covering is a switch in power automate a switch is a control statement that allows you to perform different actions based on the value of a specified input the input could be a string number or Boolean value the switch statement evaluates the input and Compares it to a set of defined cases if the input matches one of the cases the corresponding action is executed if there is no match a default action can be executed here is a simplified example suppose you want to automate an approval process based on the amount of a purchase request you could use a switch statement to check the value of the purchase request and perform different actions based on the amount for example if the purchase request is less than one hundred dollars send an approval email to the manager if the purchase request is between one hundred dollars and one thousand dollars send an approval email to the department head if the purchase request is more than one thousand dollars send an approval email to the CEO here is a simple visual of a switch layout so it identifies a single case to execute based on the evaluation of switch input you have a value that's passed through in case that checks to see if it matches if the case does match those actions are run however if there are no cases that match then the default cases run by using a switch statement you can simplify your workflow and reduce the amount of branching logic you need to write you can also easily add new cases as your business requirements change thank you hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and the next topic we'll be going through are conditions in power automate a condition is a control statement that allows you to test whether a specific condition is true or false and execute different actions depending on the result conditions are used to make decisions in your workflow based on the data that is being processed for example you may have a condition in your workflow that checks whether the value of a field in a SharePoint list is equal to a specific value if the condition is true the workflow might continue to The Next Step such as sending an email or updating another field in the list if the condition is false the workflow might take a different action such as terminating the workflow or notifying a user of the error power automate supports a variety of different conditions such as equals greater than less than contains starts with ends with and more you can also combine conditions using logical operators such as and or and not to create more complex conditions to use a condition in your workflow you typically add a condition action to your workflow specify the condition you want to evaluate and then specify the actions you want to take based on whether the condition is true or false using conditions in power automate allows you to create more intelligent and flexible workflows that can make decisions based on the data being processed and take appropriate actions based on those decisions foreign automate an expression is a Formula or a string of code that performs a specific operation or manipulation on data they are used to perform calculations manipulate text and evaluate conditions among other things Expressions can be used in various places within power automate such as within actions conditions or dynamic content for example you can use an expression to calculate a date based on the current date extract the substring from a text string or evaluate the result of a condition expressions in power automate uses syntax similar to that used in programming languages with functions operators and variables power automate provides a rich set of builtin functions that you can use in your Expressions such as string manipulation functions date and time functions and mathematical functions in addition to the builtin functions you can also create custom Expressions by combining multiple functions and operators to perform more complex operations expressions in power automate also support Dynamic content which allows you to reference data from previous steps in your workflow using expressions in power automate allows you to perform complex operations on your data and automate your workflows more efficiently by leveraging the power of Expressions you can create more flexible and robust workflows that meet your specific business requirements here are some examples of how Expressions can be used in power automate Dynamic email subject you can use Expressions to create a dynamic email subject line that includes data from your workflow for example you could include the name of the customer or the ID of the record that triggered the workflow date and time calculations you can use Expressions to perform calculations on dates and times such as adding or subtracting days or hours from a date this can be useful in scheduling workflows or setting reminders conditional actions you can use expressions and conditional actions to evaluate data and make decisions based on that data for example you could check if a value is greater than a certain threshold or if a string contains a specific word data Transformations you can use Expressions to transform data from one format to another for example you could convert a string to a number or a date to a string array manipulations you can use Expressions to manipulate arrays of data such as filtering sorting or joining arrays data validation you can use Expressions to validate Data before performing an action for example you could check if a field is blank or if a value is within a certain range foreign automate and approval is a type of action that allows you to send a request for approval to one or more individuals the approval action can be used to automate the approval process for various tasks such as expense reports time off requests or document approvals when an approval action is triggered a request is sent to the designated approver with the relevant information and options for approving or rejecting the request approvers can review the request and provide comments if necessary before making a decision once a decision is made the workflow can proceed to the next action based on the approver's response the approval action in power automate provides several customization options such as setting approval conditions adding custom messages or attachments and specifying escalation rules the approval action can also be integrated with other services such as Microsoft teams or Outlook to provide a seamless approval process within a familiar interface approvals actions actions are the events you want your flow to perform after the trigger starts the flow for example when a new item is added to a list created with Microsoft lists trigger and approval to have somebody review the new item this image shows the full list of approval actions that you can use in your flows there are four approval types you can use approve reject everyone must approve all approvers are given to auctions approve or reject a response is needed from each approver before the flow run is completed the actions that follow the start and wait for an approval action run after all the approvers respond or when a single rejection occurs approve reject first to respondent assigned approvers are given two options approve or reject approval or rejection by any approver completes the request the actions that follow the start and wait for an approval action run after any one of the approvers gives approval custom responses wait for all responses you define the options the assigned approvers can choose from all approvers must respond to complete the process custom responses wait for one response you define the options the assigned approvers can choose from a response from any approver

the next topic we'll be covering is AI builder in power automate to take advantage of AI capabilities you must first build a model with AI Builder AI builder in power automate provides several types of prebuilt models that can be used for various purposes object detection this model can be used to detect and identify specific objects within an image form processing this model can extract key data

number and email language detection this model can detect the language of a text keyword extraction this model can extract important keywords from a text entity extraction this model can identify and extract key entities from a text these prebuilt models can be customized and trained to meet specific business needs or users can create their own models from scratch using AI Builders drag and drop interface foreign hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and in this video we'll be showing you how to build a basic power automate flow so the first thing you'll want to do is to go to the power automate page at make.powerautomate.com here we are currently at the home page and it shows you all the things you can do like what would you like to automate and you can choose specific tasks that you want to quickly automate with a prebuilt template and on the left it shows a big list of things as well like approvals my flows create and so on what we're interested here are the templates because these are prebuilt templates that make our lives a lot easier most of the time there will be a scenario where power automate already has it created for you so you'll just have to enter a few fields for the trigger and actions and you'll be ready to go as you can see there are hundreds of templates available for you to fit your scenario there are various types of templates such as scheduled automated and instant some examples could be email automation approvals data collection and they can connect to other platforms like power bi teams Outlook and much more for this example we can try something simple like saveoutlet.com email attachments to your OneDrive so whenever you receive an email that has attachments in your outlook inbox it will also save those attachments in your OneDrive this can be useful in case you may forget something or you want to store important files in your OneDrive all of this is automated for you once you input a few fields of information we could also try something related to Microsoft teams for example we can search for teams something like send an email when a new message is added in Microsoft teams looks very simple and straightforward so this will send an email to whoever you select when a new message is added in teams this can be useful for alerting teammates that may not have access to teams at the moment or sending important messages that may be on teams but was not sent to your email so let's take a look at that for this flow we'll need to connect to our Microsoft teams account and our Office 365 Outlook I already have my account connected so I won't need to connect again but if it's your first time you'll probably need to connect to these apps click on continue so on the top area is the trigger which is when a new channel message is added here you'll need to select the team so this could be your sales and marketing team your development team or testing team and so on for this example we'll choose development and in this section we'll need to select the channel That the message is in so we'll choose emails the next part is your action so this sends the email you'll need to select who you want to send the email to for this section I will select my own email so Andrew Brown I could select someone else from the team but for this example I'll just leave it for myself this subject is new message on Microsoft teams Channel this should be finances is unless you want to change it up a bit you can customize the body however you like you can add Dynamic content which allows users to pass data between different actions in a flow making the flow more flexible and efficient users can extract data from various sources and use them as input to automate workflows without having to hard code them into the flow Dynamic content can include information such as email addresses file names dates and other data elements that can be passed between different actions in a flow so if we were to delete the message from we can simply add the dynamic content called message from user display name we won't have to change anything here since it's a simple automated flow next we'll click on Save and that's it your flow is ready to go you can go test this out by sending a message in the team's Channel and see if it sends you an email so I'm on my teams right now currently at the email Channel which is where I set up my automated flow to be here I'll type in something like this is a test after a moment we should receive the email at our Outlook so as you can see we have received the automated email from teams so the automated flow works great let's try to make another flow we can try to not use a template this time instead we'll start from blank so this is the trigger section where there are many to choose from we'll try something simple like when a file is created in one drive so click on that and click on create it's a very similar process to the previous method but here you have a bit more freedom so for the folder we'll select development and for the action we can choose whatever action we want and you can have as many actions as you need as well so we'll go with something email related like send an email let's search for email in the search bar and let's click on send an email so same thing as before we'll enter in the fields I'll send this to myself so Andrew Brown this is where Dynamic content is very helpful since the fields aren't filled in for you when you create it from blank the subject can be the file name and the body could be the file identifier you can give it a title if you want but the ones they generate for you are decent enough after that you just press save and this automated flow should be ready to use so this is pretty straightforward and helpful with automating repetitive tasks and much more hey this is Andrew Brown from exam Pro and we'll be covering power virtual agents in Greater detail including its main features and components power

hours of operation for that store use system and Sample topics when you create a chat bot a number of topics will be automatically created for you for per populated user topics that are titled as lessons these lesson topics provide guidance on creating simple to complex chatbot conversations using nodes a number of system topics these are for populated topics that you are likely to need during a chatbot conversation they are recommended to be used until you are comfortable with creating an endtoend chatbot conversation you can edit both topic types in the same manner as for topics you create however you cannot delete them the next component of power virtual agents will be covering are entities Empower virtual agents natural language understanding plays a significant role in chatbot conversations by allowing the AI to understand a user's intent for example if a user says I'm having trouble using my gift card the chatbot can recognize the user's intent and direct them to the relevant topic about Gift Card issues natural language understanding involves identifying entities in a user's dialogue an entity represents a type of real world subject such as a phone number zip code city or person's name prebuilt entities power virtual agents provides a range of prebuilt entities that represent commonly used information in real world conversations such as age colors numbers and names these entities allow the chatbot to intelligently identify relevant information from user inputs and save it for later use custom entities while the prebuilt entities in power virtual agents
