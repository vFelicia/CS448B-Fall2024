autocad is a popular computeraided design software used to design and model in 2d and 3d in this university course you will learn the basics of autocad hello hello and welcome to ada a course the first course that we teach for the first year students in lth in linden university um and this course is all about showing you the basics of autocad and getting you into cat drawing so it's going to be all about twodimensional drawing rather than threedimensional modeling at first but uh even with that there's a lot of things to learn and a lot of things to understand so we'll be using autocad exactly for that right once you actually opened up autocad you will be greeted with this welcome screen right the start screen and the start screen is going to have the recent documents uh row or whatever column i guess and it's going to have the basic buttons get started open files and blah blah so recent documents is basically if if you're all if you have already worked on something that file is going to pop up here just for convenience if you haven't it's going to be empty right so instead you just press the star drawing and that's exactly what we're going to do actually let me see okay uh so we're going to click on start drawing like that okay so this is what we have here uh this this kind of user interface and you can't really see the top top of the row but there's basically nothing there that's super important it's just a bunch of different icons if you click on the large icon in the top left corner the large a button you will see all of the same tools that are available for you create a new file open an existing one save files export files publish files or print files i guess right so printing is oh actually i'll i'll talk about it once we get there right um but the basic menu is is here right it's located underneath that large a button underneath it you have what's called the ribbon menu and this is the ribbon menu has a bunch of tabs so it's like categories with the tools that you can use but honestly the faster you learn the commands for the tools rather than the clicking on the icons of the tools the better it is right because uh it just speeds up your drawing process quite a bit once you actually remember the shortcuts or the commands for the tools so honestly i almost never use the the icons anymore i just type in the the commands and anyone that you ask who is using how to get this the same nevertheless uh we will be kind of clicking on these and and looking where they are but also we will be memorizing the shortcuts for them as well there is this home tab so the home type is going to be 99 of the time we are going to be spending in the home tab then we have the insert tab i will from time to time we will go in here and use one or two tools from here there's not much here then we have the annotate tab where yeah we will be spending good time here as well every other tab is we ignored it it's it doesn't exist to us we don't care right so it's only these three tabs uh by now you might be wondering well that that you probably have more stuff here right more floating windows here um that might happen because you either have autocad architecture rather than just regular autocad or maybe these days autocad just ships with multiple open panels actually can i show you let's see if i close that no start drawing it doesn't open up any panels here but if you have any panels opened up that are just floating on the screen close them click the x buttons and then just close them you don't need to see them right just click clean up the screen one more thing is right now what you see here on the screen is me logged into a school's computer right so on the school's computers for instance we are running autocad architecture 2019 and it has the home tab has these three dimensional tools of wall door and so on and also it does have the two dimensional tools we will not be using threedimensional tools in this course at all because first of all autocad is not that great for threedimensional modeling compared to competitors second of all it's better to first learn how to draw and then learn how to model rather than kind of trying to learn everything all at once it's much a easier learning curve that way um so we will be only using 2d drawings there's one more thing that i want to check and i will be checking i will check if there's a possibility on how to hide this and that the way you hide this is if you use a different profile a different viewing template and i'll i'll just try let me close this let me try to open it again but this time around what if we use no template metric now it still opens up okay fair enough anyway so those of you who have this build tab here just ignore it we will not be using it we will be using this and i'll be kind of switching back and forth between the two versions this version and the version that i have this version right here just so that everyone sees you know where different tools are located one more thing is the course website if we go to the course website it does have autocad basic commands pdf right here which i will open and actually i'll be using it too and this is not a lot of tools but i will be using it to go through these tools and kind of explain you what what they do before we actually begin well most of them before we begin actually going deep into drawing a building i will be showing how to do that as well but first let's just kind of look at the tools um so have that opened as well just ready for you right so let's jump into autocad uh back into autocad and here there's this grid that you see here is your main viewport right and it's basically a twodimensional view you can make it threedimensional with this box here uh by clicking on the on the side of the box and now it's it's a threedimensional space threedimensional grid but you don't wanna do that so what you do is you just click on the top of the box like so and it's going to rotate back to two dimensions we are going to draw it in everything in two dimensions flat right if your top the name top is not oriented properly let's see if it's like so if it's rotated like so just use these arrows to kind of rotate it back to to normal so this is what you want to see north south east west top right okay the way you move inside of this view is there's no there's no right click and holding right instead if you click and hold the scroll map or scroll wheel of the mouse you can pan the view right like that if you scroll the wheel of course you zoom out zoom in zoom out zoom in right into the view and and that's it that's all you need honestly you know you just need to be able to pan the view and zoom in to to the cursor by the way it always zooms into where you have your your cursor that's important selecting objects is that is done through by by clicking and dragging the mouse and by now you will notice that if you click and drag the mouse um with the left mouse button it kind of does this so this is what's called like a smart selection i absolutely hate it i or lasso tool lasso selection tool method i absolutely hate it i think it's obnoxious so the first thing that we will actually do is we will get rid of it right so let's get rid of that i just want it to be like a rectangular marking but it doesn't let me um to get rid of it here in the bottom you have the command line this is where you write all of the commands right um and i can just write options and hit enter so i wrote options i hit enter and it opens up options for me options um and then in the options options tab or options menu i can go to actually let's take a look at this re real quick just so that you know what's going on files this is basically where all of the supporting files are located you don't care about this display is you can change the color theme between dark and light whatever crosshair size let me show you i'll increase the crosshair size to 100 hit apply hit ok and now my my crosshair looks like this this is quite useful when you want to or my mouse this is quite useful when you want to align um see if stuff is aligned properly and i honestly i have been using it for quite a while it's quite convenient but at the same time sometimes it gets in the way right i'll type in options again and make it smaller was it five i think it was five i don't remember are you five yeah it was five okay so i'll i change it back to five everything else here is just basically how are things shown um i wouldn't suggest you going deep into this and changing stuff up um definitely not now later once you're used to the program opening and saving it's basically going to ask you what what kind of format do you want to always save the file in and that's don't argue with the program it knows what it's doing so don't don't mess around here plot and publish as well is it's basically where will you export out the pdfs don't argue with the program system let's ignore it user preferences let's definitely ignore it or wait yes drafting and 3d modeling um i'm just sorry i'm just really quickly going through this and seeing if there's anything worth mentioning not really defaults are absolutely fine 3d modeling we're not going to do any 3d modeling so we don't care and then selection so this is the big big boy where the culprit behind our lasso tool selection right so it's here allow press and drag for lasso this line right here in this tick mark right here is is the the culprit so i'll untick it and i'll just hit apply and hit ok and now it's fine you'll notice that the color is different depending if i'm going from bottom up or from top to bottom but it's uh it's i i will talk about that later what matters is that it's a rectangle right and not that ugly lasso okay so that's the first thing let me double check if in the other version in in this uh our autocad architecture version if it's the same i'll just go to options selection yeah it's the same allow press and drag for lasso and now it works okay let's jump back here so that's that um below you have a model space layout space and so on we will be talking about those uh during the last tutorial uh not right now and then you have a bunch of uh a bunch of stuff here uh that is not enough stuff i want to see more oh yeah okay that's enough stuff that's good we will talk about those as well later for now let's actually start start looking into the tools and start drawing right that's the fun part um the question is what's what are the units the measurements in which we draw is it centimeters is it millimeters is it inches is it horses per second you know what kind of dimensions are we talking about i need to actually make sure that i'm drawing for instance in millimeters i'm used to drawing in millimeters so what i'll do is i will type a command called units units enter and here i will see that indeed i am drawing in millimeters and this is my precision of drawing 0.0000 millimeters right so it's pretty damn precise um and degrees are or sorry the angle is in degrees not in radians that's great the precision is only full numbers of degrees which i have a problem with i do want the precision to be slightly larger for four degrees at least you know one number after the comma so i'll just choose 0.0 and then lighting we don't care we don't care about once i've made sure that it's millimeters and degrees i'll just hit ok and now we know that we are drawing in millimeters okay now it's time to draw the easiest thing to draw is a line right so the line tool is located here well the one that says line and if you don't see it then you might have this version where yeah it's here right or the shortcut for the line tool is l enter l is short for line once you hit l enter or you click on this icon here you will start reading you will need to read what it's asking of you in the command line so the way autocad communicates with you about what it wants from you to actually be able to draw stuff is through the command line so here it's asking line specify first point sure i need to click somewhere right so i'll just click ok then command line immediately switches to another question specify next point right uh sure i'll click again and then autocad keeps asking me to specify next point uh okay next point okay so you can see that i can keep doing this this for for for a while right just keep drawing the the lines which is not you know at some point i want to stop so the way you stop is you just hit enter right to finish the tool to finish the command you hit enter and you have a bunch of lines so now if i hover my mouse over them i can see that only segments like these straight line segments get highlighted and i can kind of select them right select this one select that one like that one for instance so i can click on them to select that's cool uh how do i unselect well i hit escape escape unselects them right what if i want to select many of them without actually you know kind of clicking on each individual line segment well i can drag this rectangle here around the ones that i'm going to select release and these get selected right um which actually and then escape to and select of course uh which actually um yeah let's do a small small bit a small tutorial about selection here uh because we already have some geometry that's available for us so i'm going to as i mentioned before there are two ways of how to select the the blue rectangle which happens when you drag from left to right and the green rectangle which happens when you drag from right to left right so the blue rectangle only selects things that are completely inside of that rectangle right so for instance let's let's look at this line right here this this line right here right if i drag the blue rectangle and it's crossing that line and i release that line doesn't get selected because it's not fully inside it wasn't fully inside of that blue rectangle if i drag a green rectangle and it's crossing the line in the same way it is going to to be selected right that's because the blue line only selects things that are completely or blue rectangle a blue selection rectangle only selects things that are completely inside of it while the green selection rectangle selects things that are inside of it and things that it's hitting things that it's crossing right so again the blue rectangle selection looks like that while the green rectangle selection looks like that because it's hitting this line hitting this line hitting this line and hitting this line right so that's that um right so so now we have something drawn cool uh let's select all of it and hit delete you know that's how you get rid of stuff you just hit the delete button mac users backspace probably i don't remember you can type in delete i think so yes erase sorry you can type in erase command and it's going to erase it um let me just see here l same same thing good i'm just double checking if yeah yeah okay double checking if there are no kind of discrepancies between the two versions that's good for now um so that's our line tool which is right here that's the first tool let me talk more about it um just so that you you get a better idea of how things are drawn so that line tool again l enter for line l enter um i i will specify the first point by just clicking but then the second point let's say i want it at this angle whatever angle right but i want it to be um let's see two meters long right 2 000 millimeters so what i do is before i click again you know to to finish the tool or to finish the line before i click again i can type in the desired length two thousand you know two meters enter and now it becomes exactly two meters long in that direction right which is quite useful what if i want to draw this line segment completely horizontal right or completely vertical doesn't matter then the tool that does that is called orthographic snapping and the shortcut for it is f8 f8 in the top of your keyboards f8 or a button that does that is located right here and in the bottom of the screen ortho mode and you can see in the brackets it says f8 as well if ortho mode is turned on if i click on it or if i hit f8 right so with f8 i can turn it on or off right if i hit a fit or turn it on and i draw try to draw the line and this time let me just use the tool uh the icon here and i draw the line you can see that it's locked to either a horizontal or vertical position right which is quite useful for instance i want to say uh 5000 millimeters or not let's do 2 000 5000 was way too long two thousand millimeters five hundred millimeters uh a thousand millimeters 500 more 300 millimeters uh 750 i don't know how long this is probably around 700 millimeters yes and then close it off and hit enter right i can have pretty precise dimensions when when i have ortho on so that's quite useful i will show you later a few more tips and tricks in terms of the angles and snapping to different angles but also turning ortho on and off is one of the smoothest workflows let's see or or most useful workflows let me get rid of this so that's how you how you work with lines and then horizontal and vertical snapping of of lines let me turn off ortho for now so i either click here on this icon or just hit f8 and i can see that that icon is turned off now um i can also i need to check here if that's the same thing yes you do have ortho mode here that's good um okay coming back here so that's line right um next up is polyline i believe yes next step is power line so line line tool is the most simplistic tool and it all it can do is just straight line segments that are all so to say exploded they are separated line segments right polyline tool on the other hand is it it can contain much more information inside of it what i mean by that is first of all let's learn the shortcut for it the shortcut is pl enter or clicking the icon of course but pl enter gives you the polyline tool and with orthographic snapping turned off i will just draw quickly draw a polar line without any dimensions whatsoever i'll just draw it whatever i have no idea what i'm drawing but it is what it is yeah let's see something like that and oops and hit enter to finish the the tool um so now this is a polyline rather than the line tool if i click on this you can see that everything gets selected this is a type of geometry that consists of multiple lines and all of them are joined into a chain of lines it's super convenient for selection purposes it's super convenient to work with and it doesn't really have any any drawbacks almost all of the lines that i draw during the design process and the technical process later on are polar lines not lines keep that in mind um right so we have our our polyline can you make apollo line into multiple lines right can can you explode the polyline into multiple lines yes you can of course you can just select it oh by the way if i use the blue selection rectangle it will not select unless i have the whole poly line inside of my blue selection rectangle while with the green one i can just kind of slightly hit it and it will select the whole thing quite useful um so right we have a polyline how to how do we make it into multiple lines how do we explode it well we use the explode tool when we have it selected we just type in explode i think it's ex el explode enter and it just explodes right so now all of these are separate line segments and then you go oh no i didn't want to explode it uh what do i do now well if you just did it really recently you can just do ctrl z you know undo and it's going to undo your tool right ctrl z control yeah control z this is undo ctrl y i believe is redo um yeah or if you don't want to do ctrl z or rather if you already have a bunch of exploded lines and you want to join them up well you just select all of them and type in join and hit enter and it just joins all of them up into one poll line back into one poll line so there is explode and there is join right quite useful okay there are more things about the polyline that i kind of want to show you let me just think if it's if it's the time if it's the time to show you those uh those things well maybe uh sure let's start pretty pretty hardcore pl enter so polyline i'll start drawing and i'll just create the first line segment and what if i don't want this to be a straight line what if i want this to be a curve an arc right i can't do that do it with a polyline tool here in the bottom you can see that it does have much more settings to choose from rather than just having give me the next point because it says specify next point or is it an arc is it closed would you like to close it is it half wave and so on so there are a lot of hidden settings in these tools that you will kind of you will learn them once you need them let's say it like that right once you have a problem to solve then you will learn that different tools have different like small settings that you can tweak to solve that problem we definitely don't have time to go through all of the settings of all of the tools and autocad it's a little bit too big for that but the basic one that i want to show you is the arc right and you can see that a is highlighted right so what i'm going to do is i could just click here but rather i will press a type in a as i'm still drawing the polyline by the way i'll press a hit enter and now i'm in what's called an arc mode right so you can see that all of the tools have changed or not the tools the settings have changed and i have more more even more settings to work with but for now i'll just work with this right so i have the arc tool and i can mess around with it quite a bit say something like that and now if i want to change it back to the line tool i all i need to do is just type in l and hit enter and now we're continuing uh we continue drawing in straight line segments right once we're done we just hit enter and now we have this kind of polyline uh quite nice quite quite useful which can also by the way be exploded and you know these settings or these these arcs can be deleted off and and whatnot uh yo why is my okay my autocad just lagged a bit but that's fine so that's polyline and that's all of the not all of them uh just one hidden setting inside of polyline i will show you more uh later once once we actually need them right let's cross off polyline from our list and then we have the arc tool and the circle tool oh yeah i already showed you i already showed you the advanced pollen apologies for that for not keeping to the script i just wanted to show it to you okay let's jump to arc and circle tools um i will well they are located here of course circle arc right and also um also here you have the arc and you have the circle uh but you don't have the power line here but if you expand it by clicking this this small uh triangle here you will see the poll line pop up here again i do suggest you using the command line instead so we have the arc in the circle well let's start with the circle it's easier so circle is c enter you just click on where you want the circle center to be and you kind of type in the radius that you want let's see 250 right so now we know that the diameter of the circle is 500 radius 250 and it's located right here cool um what else can we do with a circle let's see c enter there's like uh there are a few options here that we can use and i will for instance without clicking anywhere i will just select this three point uh 3p option like that and now i will click three times on the screen right and you can see that those three clicks that i made describe the the circle's position and radius right so that circle is touching those three points that i that i clicked i can do it again uh c enter three points click click and then if i say that well actually i want the third one to be right here it's going to be like a very weird circle click the three points again circle is touching them pretty cool then we have the arc tool which is basically i believe it's a yeah a short for arc hit enter and it's basically specify start point of arg okay specify second point of arc okay specify the end of arc okay so we have our arc done here if i want it to be a little bit um if i want to draw it differently i can by the way when you hit enter if you don't have any commands running and you hit enter it repeats the last command that you did so now i don't need to type in a enter i can just hit enter and it's going to kind of repeat the the previous command which was arc um instead of specifying the start point i will choose center here so i'm starting to draw from the center see from here and then it's going to ask me to give it the start and to give it the end right i'm basically just drawing part of the circle well arc is an arc is a part of a circle okay so that's that that's the circle and that's the arc that there's nothing more honestly to them um there's also like rectangle tools and whatnot uh perhaps i should wait i will be showing you rectangle tools later though there's no i haven't even written it down here so sure let's let's ignore them um for now circle arc line polyline is enough to describe okay so these four tools circle arc line polyline are enough to describe any kind of geometry absolutely like there's no type of geometry that you couldn't draw out with these tools right so the basics are super simple and what a rectangle is is basically a polyline with like parallel line segments right making it a rectangle i will just really quickly show it to you and then we'll jump jump into snapping possibilities so rectangle rectangle i just like to write erect but wait r e c r e c is is enough for for rectangle to start working as a command but i i don't know why i have a muscle memory of typing in r e c t rect hit enter uh it's gonna start drawing the rectangle and it's going to ask me to give it the first point sure i will just click and that's going to ask me to give it another corner point right or or i can give it the dimensions so i think dimensions is a much more useful use case than just giving it two points so i will choose dimensions and i'll say specify length for a rectangle so i will say well my length should be again two meters two thousand millimeters that's the length i hit enter and then i specify with four rectangles so i'll say let's do a pretty narrow one so i'll say 10 centimeters 100 millimeters right 100 enter that's it right it kinda is asking me for oh right right right sorry sorry that's not it once we added the the dimensions now with a mouse click i need to specify the alignment of the rectangle is it going down or is it going up right down or up down or up i'll say up and i'll just click that's it now it's done right and we have a rectangle which is basically just a polyline if i grab the polyline pl i start started working with it with ortho on which is f8 and i typed in 2 000 enter and i typed in 100 enter 2000 enter clicked here enter that's it that's this absolutely like these two geometries are absolutely the same right so that's that okay let's let's look into delete that let's look into object snapping and ways of how you can snap to different parts of objects and you know kind of merge everything together much more or rather use geometry as reference for creating more geometry you'll see what i mean the second all right so object snapping here in the bottom uh right here you will see oh snap tool object snap tool uh which basically that small arrow right next to it will expand will expand there we go a menu oh right there we go just fixing it uh we'll expand the menu or what types of sub geometries can you snap to so there are like end points of lines there are midpoints of lines and so on so i will i'll start showing you um different ways or or yeah different ways of how you can snap your geometry so for now let us untick all of the snaps all together right so nothing is marked click anywhere on the screen and let's draw a line right just a line line from here and i will be drawing it straight like vertical i'll just give it so if you can't just f8 or ortho snap turn it on and then you will be able to uh and i'll just give it 2 000 millimeters hit enter enter again right now it's drawn and honestly i just want to move it away from the zero zero zero coordinate so this guy right here is my zero zero zero so i will just select it m enter empty move i'll just move it away so when i try to move it with orthographic snap uh maybe i need to do this slower sorry sorry i'm speeding i will select it m enter m short for move enter i will click anywhere on the screen doesn't matter where i click and then as i kind of move my mouse you can see that you know it's it's being moved in relation to my mouse cursor but since i have orthographic snapping turned on it can only move horizontally or vertically right i'll hit f8 or turn off or to snap here and now i can move it anywhere on on the screen so i'll just move it somewhere here it doesn't matter away from the zero zero zero i'll zoom into it right so that's my my line tool now since we have all of the object snapping turned off if i want to create let's say a circle or yeah let's say a circle around this endpoint i can't because well i can't snap to it and i can get pretty close but the closer i zoom in uh i keep seeing that there's an error in my uh it's going to be an error in my uh in the center point where where i place it right so this is not to work instead let me hit escape to close that tool instead i am going to tick mark the end point snapping here that's enabled now and now if i choose my circle circle tool i can click on it oh actually when i choose my circle tool and i hover my mouse next to the end point you can see that there's this green icon appearing that green icon basically tells me that i am going to snap and i'm going to start drawing from this point right from this end point and it even says end point right that means if i now click the center point of this circle is right at the end of that line so i can make it larger um yeah let's say 300 millimeters and hit enter so now i have my line tool or or my circle directly centered around the endpoint of the line i can do this again c enter from here 300 enter right i have my two circles uh that's the first thing that you can snap to another thing that you can snap to is the midpoint right so let me enable that enable midpoint again i'll get the circle i'll start drawing the circle or rather i'll hover my mouse over the where i imagine the midpoint of the line is going to be which is right here i'll click and start drawing right so you can see that it even gives me the mark let me do that again as as i'm hovering it even gives me the triangular mark here and says midpoint right i'll draw drag draw it out and i'll say 500 for the radius right this circle is located directly in the middle of this line a circle at least to my knowledge yes the circle doesn't have neither a start or endpoint or it doesn't have a midpoint as well because it's infinite in in its length right so you can't snap to a circle in in this way said that there is the center snapping that we can do right center snapping for a circle so what i'm going to do is i will create one more circle somewhere close by somewhere i don't know maybe here i'll create one more circle and i'll just give it 500 millimeters again right and i will enable center snapping here i'll draw let's just draw another circle inside of the circle right so i'll choose a circle tool again and now as i as i hover my mouse on the edge of the circle you can see that green uh circle appearing or green markup appearing right in the middle right if i click my next circle is going to be drawn in the middle of the previous one right so i can give it 300 millimeters for instance and i can keep doing that right i can keep hitting enter you repeat the last command i can keep drawing drawing it out like so okay that's one thing next up we have geometric sender so geometric center is different from a center point in the sense that um i believe if you have a rectangle let me just check i don't want to lie okay if you have a if you just use the center snapping right it doesn't have um it only works on arcs and it only works on circles it doesn't work on closed shapes so if you have some sort of a closed shape such as a rectangle then geometric snapping is going to be the way to go right so i'll turn on geometric center or geometric center snapping sorry it's going to be the way to go i'll turn on geometric center and as i am moving along this this this rectangle you can see that the middle while it gives me that snowflake thingy it doesn't give me a green green icon meaning that i can't snap to it but if now i hover my mouse close to that snowflake now i'm able now i'm able to snap right i'll repeat it again hovering my mouse finding that until i see that that snowflake appear clicking on it and dragging out like that okay so that's done um so that's geometric center uh there's more stuff that you can do for instance if you have a polyline uh which makes a weird form something like that and as long as that polyline is closed meaning it needs to end where it started click and then hit enter right it's it's a closed polyline right now and i grab a circle it will show me where the geometric centroid is right and i can't snap to it but it's of course going to be funky it is accurate mathematically it is an accurate geometric centroid of this particular shape but it might be counterintuitive for you visually right seeing it there the way it's calculated is basically it's an average of all of the corners the average coordinate of all of the corners of this polyline just for for the geeks out there who want to know how it works okay so that's that um then we have node snapping which i don't care never use it it's basically if you have points in in your in your drawing we will not be using points so we don't care i will not be even showing you this quadrant snapping though is quite useful uh if i select it i tick mark that now every circle that i drew has a quadrant right it has a quadrant here here here and here i can actually show them by choosing a circle or rather on this one and i can see that now i can snap to this spot here i can snap to this spot here this spot here and this spot here right so i can i can snap to four points on each of the circles quite useful in in some cases right and you can kind of go even deeper and then kind of keep keep snapping to those to those quadrants to create pretty pretty intense graphics um right so that's quadrant snapping next up we have intersection so a very simple simple explanation would be if i have a line tool you know i just draw a line here and i draw another one here right let me actually draw another one come on i'll enter another one right here if i want to snap to that particular point i can by using the intersection snap right so it kind of finds all of the places where two geometries intersect right so i can draw a circle around that intersection now quite useful in this case you might kind of be using it for for this for instance right and then even smaller right so so that's in intersections it just finds intersections between any kind of two two two geometries any type of two geometries uh right so that's in intersection snapping next next next there's extension snapping um later not now ignore insertion snapping no perpendicular snapping though is super useful um let's say i have a line or rather we already already have a line i want to draw another line from somewhere here let's say from the center of this circle that would go at 90 degrees angle to this line segment right so i want to start drawing a line from here from the middle and i want it to snap to 90 degrees which is going to be somewhere here probably over here uh i want to snap it at 90 degree angle to this line so the way i do it is i enable i'll escape out of that enable perpendicular snapping like this grab the line tool start drawing and then it will give me where the perpendicular snap is once i click there hit enter i can see that between these two lines i have 90 degree angle really really useful stuff if you want to let me delete that if if you want to for instance if you have more circles here and you need to kind of find the 90 degree snap from these two circles to this circle for instance you can always do that and then kind of continue on finding the snaps to that's a very tight fit for that i need to zoom in but yeah right so that's quite useful um let me get rid of those two lines though right so so that's perpendicular or in other words 90 degree snapping then we have tangent snapping tangent snapping is basically um it's much easier for me to show than it is to actually explain let's say we have well we already have a circle here and let's say we want to draw we have one more circle here uh we want to draw from the middle of the circle from here a line that's going to seamlessly connect to the circle right here that is called the tangent line right and let me make sure that i have it turned on i don't tangent there we go now we have it turned on and now i can draw from the middle and find this icon here tangent click enter so now as the circle is going here it will seamlessly transition to this line and actually uh visually explaining it i think uh let me do one thing i will explain that tool in later stages of of this project or of this tutorial but let me just do do this real real quick this line and the way it connects to the arc is now seamless there there is no sharp corner right so that's a tangent let me undo that engines are quite uh quite useful in that regard um right i don't know what i'm what i'm drawing here something something weird something weird for sure so we have tangents right maybe one goes here maybe one goes here sure why not um next next next next next next nearest snap oh and that's actually going to be the last one because apparent intersection i don't like that kind of snapping i prefer a different work method so i will not be showing that nearest snapping is quite quite useful once you have it turned on and you want to create a circle just somewhere on this line it will constantly give you the nearest point to that line right or nearest point here right or nearest point here right so you can kind of just create a bunch a bunch of of of circles on on another well if you actually don't don't if you don't miss it see enter a bunch of circles on already existing geometry right so that's actually any point that is closest will be fetched by the nearest snapping um that's about it that's about it in in terms of snapping tools um the key thing is you don't want to have all of the snapping tools enabled because it gets too convoluted it tries to suggest too many ways of how you can snap to geometry and it it becomes a little bit tricky a little bit bothersome to to work around work around that so usually what i like to do is i like to turn off tangent snapping i like to turn on off sorry intersection quadrant snapping geometric center and center and i just leave end point midpoint perpendicular and nearest snapping those are the mostly used ones if i need some other snapping method i will enable it just for that particular tool a shortcut of how to turn on or off object snapping is f3 button f3 uh but yeah usually i just always have it turned on oh beautiful graphics that we've made here all right so that is snapping right and that is snapping let's take a look if everything is all right here that's the same thing here uh in this workspace as well good very good um right so next up we have the different ways of how you can modify geometry right so you can move it you can copy it you can rotate scale it mirror it trim it extend it blah blah let's go through them let's go through them and once we are yeah once we are done with this then we will start drawing our house little by little right so first thing is move right that's a pretty simple one let's say i want to i have this geometry here i don't know which one to choose let's see all of this i have i want all of this to move away or to move somewhere uh maybe to snap to uh to this point right here right i can do that by selecting all of it typing in m hitting enter m short for move hitting enter giving it saying the base point so clicking where i want the base point to be and i actually want the base point to be in the middle right and i can't select the middle because i turned off the object snapping so i will actually go in here and turn on center snapping right here so now i can select the middle click and now i can move it again if you can only move it horizontally or vertically then you need to hit f8 or turn off ortho snapping orthographic snapping um so i can move it now and i will just move it let's say to here doesn't matter or maybe to the midpoint here yeah sure to the midpoint here i'll just move it to the midpoint here click again that's it it's now located here right um also just like move there is copy i can select the geometry i can type in copy cop i think yeah c o okay c o is enough but i use cop for some reason co enter again from the midpoint let's say to ah for now i'll just kind of make a few copies uh horizontally so i'll just hit f or vertically i'll just hit f8 click click if you want to copy or move something by a fixed amount then instead of just clicking you first describe the direction let's see it's my horizontal direction towards here and then you type n by how much so i will just say by 500 millimeters enter well that's not a lot but you get the idea right so the initial geometry was copied to the side by 500 millimeters okay that's move and copy then we have scale scale is basically just changing the size of the object you can either scale a single object select one scale type in scale or sc word for scale enter and then select the point around which you're going to scale the object from which you're going to enlarge or shrink the object so let's say it's going to be this corner point right here or the middle of the circle doesn't matter this corner point right here and i'll just say that the scale needs to be five right five is five hundred percent five times larger right so this guy becomes five times larger i'll ctrl z to undo i'll select it again and i'll scale again around the same point but this time around i'm going to say 0.5 that is 50 not 500 that is half of the size right so it gets shrunken down that scaling um nothing nothing fancy about it then we have i believe mirror right yes we have mirroring so mirror is quite cool let me get rid of this let's say you already have this geometry done or not done but you have some sort of geometry and you want to mirror it to the other side usually you do that with doors and whatnot uh but let's just say you want to mirror it i can select all of it and type in mi hit enter am i short for mirror hit enter and then it's going to give ask me to draw a mirror line so it's basically going to be like the line around which it's going to mirror it's much easier to show than to than to kind of talk about it so that's my mirror line let me hit f8 to turn it off and now it's i think it's even easier to see what's going on right so now i can mirror this quite useful right that's my mirroring and i can do this uh this way oh yeah and once you're finished mirroring it's going to ask you would you like to erase source objects or no so would you like to delete the initial one or would you like to keep it i will say don't erase just keep it so no so we have mirrored this right and i can kind of do it again mirror let's say between these two points like that enter right now i have this kind of geometry going on um let me just double check here whatever any kind of geometry i select all of it mirror here well in case of here it doesn't ask you right next to the cursor but it asks you um here in the in the command line would you like to erase source objects yes or no by default it said to know so you just hit enter and you know it's done so that works in in in both versions as well so that's mirroring i really want to draw a line here so i will um maybe not from there maybe from here to here i don't know i i i just think it's it's uh it's gonna look better if if we have some some geometry in between so that's that that that is basically mirroring next trim trim and extend okay so for trimming i actually need to show it with a much simpler example and then we'll go in here and kind of i'll show you how to trim stuff in here uh so a very simple example would be i have a circle i have a line right and the line crosses the circle i want to get rid of this line segment that is inside of the circle i can type in tr trim enter it's going to tell me to select objects and unfortunately it doesn't say what kind of objects or select all so i can just hit enter to say select all enter right and it's then just going to say okay what would you like to trim so i want to trim this right i just hover my mouse over it and you can see that it's gone if i click it's really gone right so i can trim it away so what it does what trimming does it finds intersections right into intersection moments and it deletes geometry inside of those intersection moments or not necessarily inside because you can do you can do something like this pr enter enter double enter remember and then click here click here right it just finds the intersections and kind of delete stuff that's that's sticking out or going in so you're basically erasing segments uh in that way so if if i were to look at the more complex uh more complex example let's say i want to clean this up i can say tr enter enter and then then i can just kind of go to town and keep keep deleting this and i'll purposely make a mistake or not a mistake but i'll i'll do a thing that always happens and i'll keep kind of going here and trimming away all of these segments and at a certain point i can't anymore well i can still trim away this one i think yes but now i can't trim well i can't trim this there we go now i can't trim anything else never mind now i can't trim anything else there we go so these two segments here right can't be trimmed and the reason for that is they they both meet at their end points so there's no way for me to kind of you know these are full segments that are meeting in their endpoints and they're not being crossed by any geometry right so the trimming will not work on them so then i just kind of select them and delete them right so that they get trimmed away uh as you're using trimming pr enter it will you you can choose to select objects rather than selecting all so i can select for instance these two objects hit enter and now everything that i trim right it's just going to be trimmed by those two objects and why can't i trim this i can it's just i need to zoom in fair enough right um and of course it can also you can also trim objects themselves so these are like active objects during trimming um what that means is that i can't when i do it that way i can't just jump in here and start trimming it won't let me because it's it it has nothing to do with with these this geometry right here so i do prefer using tr enter and then just hitting enter again and then going going in here and trimming away um anything that i that i want in any part of the drawing right much much more convenient for me with that select all method right that's that's that let me just clean it up because i like stuff when it's clean there we go okay uh wait nope er enter enter yeah almost almost forgot about these two there we go now now it's fine um so that's trimming that is uh that is trimming then we have extend extend is basically if you have a polyline and it's doing this and you have another one and it's doing this and you want this polyline to elongate until it hits this power line right or this line segment elongate until it hits this line segment that is extend ex enter it's going to ask us to either select objects or select all this time around i always select the objects and these are the objects towards which i'm going to extend right so first i then select this line segment right i hit enter and that's important and then i can click on my other line segment and it's going to be extended towards this object right so that's how extend works um there are some cases where it's of course not going to work for instance if i just say line and i want to and i have this line and i want this line segment to extend towards this one it won't work right if i extend enter select this line segment enter and then try to select this line it will not work it will not extend that's because the there's no way for this line to extend so that it hits this line segment uh which actually brings us to uh let's see if it brings us to yes it does it brings us to another tool that's called fillet and the shortcut for it is f f enter fill it right uh so fillet basically extends two line segments until they meet at a corner right let's see this guy and this guy if i fled them you and you they get filleted into a corner the reason why it's called fillet is because you can change the radius of the corner right so it doesn't need to be a sharp corner let me ctrl z to undo and let me fill it again fill it or i write the full thing f enter and here i'll just say radius i'll click on the radius or type in r enter it doesn't matter if you click on or type in r and here i can specify a radius so i'll give it like 500 millimeters i have no idea how long those slides are but i i assume 500 millimeters will work 100 hit enter and now i will click on the top line click on the bottom line and you get filleted quite nice huh quite nice and it gives us a fillet of radius of 500 millimeters so that's how fillet works um there's also like options for uh fillet where we can see that now there's no options for fillet where we can never mind nevermind ignore ignore what i said uh i thought that it was the same as in rhino but it's not so just radius for now we will just be using radius delete that so let's fill it the left doesn't work with objects that are of parallel because there's no way for you to extend to objects that are parallel to lines that are pale okay okay apparently it does work what the hell okay wait fill that the let radius zero whatever it is is zero will it not work then it still works that's a smart cookie so then if you have two objects that are parallel and you try to fill it them even if the radius you specify the radius to be zero it's going to create an arc that connects the two objects that's nice that's a that's a new functionality of autocad that wasn't there before definitely wasn't there before let's see it in the older version of autocad if that's also the case well older version 2019 is not that old uh one line segment another line segment the let come on fill it let from here here yeah it does work here as well cool okay i'm learning something new as well so if you have two parallel line segments apparently it's going to just create an arc between them with the fillette even if you say you don't want any radius for the fillet to have cool uh what's next next up we have zoom extent okay so that's an important one um wait oh wrong wrong wrong autocad let's say here right i i've been working on this and i have zoomed out zoomed out and i must mess it up and i have no idea where i am right i have absolutely no idea what i where i am uh so what you can do is you can say ctrl a to select all so ctrl a selects everything that you have in your drawing and then what you can do is you can type in z enter e enter and it's going to zoom in to the geometry that you have selected so if you're lost in your drawing then ctrl a z enter e enter really helps but also it's quite useful where when you have like multiple drawings on one one sheet then just saying well let me copy bam um fade bam bam let's say you have multiple drawings on one sheet and just so that you don't need to zoom in zoom out uh what you can do is you can just select z enter e enter oh sorry in this case it would be z enter s enter selected oh enter i'm a little bit rusty apparently yes okay so it's going to be selecting the object z enter o enter zoom to object so zoom extends i made a mistake during this tutorial zoom extents you don't need to do control a you don't need to select all of the geometry it already recognizes where that the geometry is as if it's selected so z enter e enter extends will zoom into all of the uh geometries on your scene in your in your model model file automatically you don't need to select all of them beforehand that's useful uh yeah forgot about that one i apologize the entry enter there we go we're zoomed in uh so that's that zoom extents quite useful and then we have array and hatch these two i will show you later once we have some geometry going on in the rhino this is an autocad course in the autocad file once you have some proper geometry going on then i'll show those two then um let's draw a building enough of this let's let's draw let's draw a plan first right so i will i'll keep this why not i'll keep this but here i'll start drawing my my building right so the first thing that you do before you or actually no i will not keep this i will close this file all together or we can we can just select it delete there we go select the deleted clean clean sheet you know to start with the first thing that you do before you start drawing is you check the units we already did that right we are drawing in millimeters second thing that you do when you before you start drawing is you create layers in which you're going to be drawing it so up till now we will we were drawing in a single layer right which was the layer zero autocad works in layers and different line thicknesses different line types and line colors are described by different layers right and you can turn on and off those layers it works in a similar way as as photoshop actually in this regard one more thing that i didn't notice that autocad is vector based rather than raster based so think of it as photoshop versus illustrator right you're used to those too by now photoshop uses pixels while illustrator does it meaning that you can zoom into geometry of illustrator infinitely and it's not going to change resolution or it's not going to it doesn't have a finite resolution while um while in photoshop if you zoom in too close then you'll start seeing the pixels right so any kind of 3d modeling or drawing software for for commercial use is going to be vector based it means that your lines are infinite in in their resolution in their quality uh that's important to know okay layers right so how do we access layers well they are located right here the layers tab of course and you can see here it's it's our active layer layer 0. and if i expand this that's the only layer that we have layer 0 and it says it says that it's white but it's actually black well it shows white because we have a black background but it's going to print out black don't ask why just go with it i'll explain the print printing settings layer if you want to add more layers we need to go to layer properties so i'll click on that layer properties will open up this layer tab for us which let me expand it and let me just make sure that you see it there we go so here we have these four icons create new layer freeze oh wait new layer frozen oh create a new layer that's frozen uh delete layer and set set layer to current we don't care about these three we only care about creating new layers so i'm going to be doing that i'll click on this create new layer tab i'll choose and i'll say thick line or or just thick right so creating new layer calling it thick create one more layer call it medium and create one more layer call it thin right so we have these three layers here thick medium thin great what can you do with them you can turn them on or off you can freeze them and you can lock them for now just ignore the freeze area just think of it this way if you lock them you can't select the geometry of that particular layer in the viewport which is quite useful when you have a lot of stuff layered on top of each other uh stuff that you don't want to select can be locked which is nice then are those layers printable can you print so that's the plot area here what kind of color do those layers have what kind of what's the display color and what kind of line type and line weight so we will be changing that in just uh i guess in the next tutorial but for now i'll just change the colors just so that we can distinguish between thick medium and thin right so the thick layer i always like to choose red from here medium i always like to use blue and thin i always like to use green but it's absolutely up to you this is just something that i'm used to and as i'm drawing this is the way i color code my lines that's about it right so we have our layers set up and i'll keep the zero layer for now that's that's fine that's okay once we have them set up i can close and now i can uh create or not not create but i now i can expand this um dropdown list of layers and i can choose which one is going to be my active one the one in which i draw so i'll choose thick layer here thick it's my active one and now as i draw a circle for instance it's going to be red because it lives in that layer if i draw another one it's also red red right all of them are red um if i want to change a layer of an object all i need to do or multiple objects all i need to do is just select them and in the drop down list i just choose the layer right once i hit escape i'm back to my to the active layer in which i'm drawing but now the layers of these two objects have been changed and i can see that it blue might not go well with the recording so i will go to layer properties and change this blue to cn right to cyan not c and cyan uh just so that they pop a little bit better there we go so that is that's that right uh working with layers really easy in autocad let's start drawing so i'm gonna start drawing in thick layer uh with thick lines because i'm going to be drawing a plan and i'm going to be i'll start drawing from the walls right or rather from the section of the walls so the plan is cut at 1.2 meters yeah it's cut at 1.2 meters so that you are cutting through windows above the tables and whatnot so it's like a locked locked number um you can always kind of adjust the the height you know for different projects if there's a need for that but the default you know the default number that you should have in your head is 1.2 meters uh so that's how high we're going going to be cutting our our plan or our building and showing the plan uh through the cut so if we go into the course website and kind of read through this i can somewhere here that's the course description that's the deliverables yeah there we go uh no matter which client is chosen the building footprint cannot exceed 25 square meters okay that's like five by five sure but five by five is is not that convenient for me i'm thinking of a six by four perhaps yeah sure let's do six by four uh we'll we'll see how we can cram it in i haven't planned it out in my head so it might be a very crappy very crappy building but this is just to showcase uh the way you work in autocad um right so i need a i'm going to have a building that has a footprint of six by four meters six thousand by four thousand millimeters so i'm going to actually create a rectangle r e c t rect i'll start drawing it from anywhere doesn't matter and i will say that i'm going to draw it in dimensions rather than just clicking somewhere else on the screen so d enter right the enter and then i type in the length which is 6000 enter um did i not yes six thousand and now it asks me for the width and the width is going to be four thousand actually i can kind of get away with 4 200 but for now i'll just say 24 square meters that's fine as well 4 000. so and then i'll just choose that yeah here whatever there's the rectangle there um so that's my that's my outer footprint right outer footprint my walls have thickness of course and for this i will say that the wall thickness is going to be um 400 millimeters the outer wall thickness around 400 millimeters usually they are a little bit thicker than that but uh it's a summer house it's a pretty small house so 400 is okay uh so what i want to do is actually i want this rectangle to go inwards to make a copy of this rectangle inwards by 400 millimeters and there's a tool that does that i will show it on the side here real quickly if i have a polyline or a line segment and i use a tool that's called offset offset oh i think it's yeah it's just o enter and i type in the distance so here i'll just type in 400 enter then i can select the line segment here and i can offset it to either side to here or here this mirror and click and then i know that between these two lines the gap is indeed 400 millimeters right so that's offset really useful uh also works with polylines offset uh 400 like that right if i were to draw the same shape or similar shape with line segments though like that and then i did offset keyboard come on offset 400 then since i drew this with polyline and this with line tool this is exploded so that means that my offset is going to be a little bit more tricky like that right i will need to offset every line separately and then i will need to tr trim enter enter and trim away the doodads here right clean it up now they're kind of the same the only difference is that this is exploded while this is joined up right so back here back to our plan i can just do offset 400 and offset it inwards by 400 inwards because we are already at at 25 square meters or 24 square meters so i can't offset it outwards i need to opposite it inwards right so that's the the thing that we are going to be working with right that's our inner area not a lot of stuff to work on so let me just quickly plan this out let's see we have some sort of a block here toilet shower room entrance and the work okay so let's say i want a separate room here right in this area where i'm going to have my bathroom my shower and and whatnot in in in this particular room right um and it's going to be a little bit of an awkward room but that's going to work out so i am going to create a line segment right and i'll just kind of draw it out from this corner point to this corner point like so and hit enter right so now what i have here is i have a duplicate line right there is this polyline here and also this line segment the reason why i do this is because now i can take this line segment i can select it if you have problem selecting it you can always use the blue marking tool and just select it that way um and i can type in offset and let's say how wide how wide so the smallest shower that that is kind of nice still nice to have is around 900 millimeters so we can't have it thinner like than that so i will say 900 millimeters such a bad bad space though such a bad space okay let's do instead of 900 i will do one meter at least yeah one meter it creates an offset right and now for this line so this is going to be like a mark where my bathroom ends so i want to make this into a wall so i will offset it again i click on it and i'll type in 140 millimeters 14 centimeters that's enough for the inner walls right 14 millimeters and once i'm done i just hit escape or enter doesn't matter and i have my my two line segments that describe an inner wall right here i still do have that line segment here that i use right but i don't need it anymore so i'll just select it and hit delete just get rid of it all together right so that's my two line segments now what i want is i want to get rid of this segment here and this segment here so that is trim right tr enter enter and then click click enter easy right i've just successfully uh deleted those two segments and now i have a room here and a room here i don't have any doors or windows or anything but i do have a room that's one meter here and all of the remaining area is located here this is not clean anymore because this pole line and this line segment are two separate entities i want to join everything up so that this is a rectangle this is a rectangle and this is a rectangle so that i have three rectangles here so i'll select all of it and type in join hit enter and yeah that that's it just join them up right so now this is a rectangle rectangle rectangle closed very important that they are closed so that is that uh let's create an entrance doorway right or let's create a doorway into into the bathroom right so i'm going to create a line segment just from here to here from the midpoint to the midpoint because i want the door to be centered and the door is 90 centimeters so so the the width of the door is 90 centimeters the height of the door is usually two point in between 2.1 meters and 2.2 uh depends on on what kind of door you're using but usually uh what i like to do is do 2.2 meter high doors and add if i need to then i add framing inside so it kind of eats up a little bit a little bit of that height either way we have the line segment i will offset it um i'll specify the offset distance to b because i want to offset it to both sides it will be 45 centimeters so 450 millimeters hit enter and now i can just offset it up and offset it down like that right stay with me i hit enter now i don't need the middle segment anymore so i can just select it delete it right and i have these two segments now so i'll say trim enter i'll just trim away this oops trim enter enter always forget to do the double enter and i'll just trim away these two line segments here right so now what i've done is i created an opening in the wall right for for the door to be in i can select all of this type in join and now all of all of these segments are joined so i have one polyline here and one polyline here great let's do this again i will keep doing this just so that you can follow along quite quite easily so i want a door here right and i probably want so if there's a shower here i do want to have a window and there's a toilet here i do want to have a window here right um right so door window okay i will create a line segment from here to here and i will offset it by 900 millimeters to the side like so trim enter enter enter rather and then the same thing here um actually this one can be the the same size as the door so i'll just kind of be cheeky about it and just start drawing from from the doorway like so trim enter enter tr not trim god damn it i keep forgetting tr for trimming and i create an opening here so door door window and it's probably going to have a window somewhere here but we'll kind of take care of that side layer okay the thing is well first of all let's let's clean everything up by selecting the walls and joining them up just so that this is closed and this is closed right so everything is kind of neat and dandy the thing is that here while we are cutting through the doorway here we don't see the bottom of the doorway all we see is just kind of floor floor floor floor but here the window probably will not reach the floor right so that means that we will see the window sill right we will see the bottom of the window opening in the plan and i can uh not can i need to show it right so i'm going to go to the layers and i'll say that the layer in which i'm going to draw is the medium layer so let let's talk about this just a second thick layer is used to specify all of the lines which you get from cutting something right so i'm cutting the walls right and i'm looking at the cut of the walls meaning that they will be shown thick in the thick line medium line is stuff that you see as a projection right so you're not cutting through it but you can still see it so in this case uh if i have a if i have a window oh my god wait just bear with me sure that's that's fine so let's say i have a window um you know that that has some sort of partition partitioning whatever is just a window right in in the in the facade and i am cutting through that window like so right at this height i'm cutting through it and i'm looking at it downwards i'm looking at the cut you know straight downwards that means that i i will see the frame i will be cutting through the frame i will be cutting through the glass frame again and then wall right so wall frame glass frame wall but also i will be seeing the hole here right i will be seeing the the windowsill so that windowsill is not a cut rather it's just a projection it's just something that i see meaning that i use a medium line grab a line tool and i just draw it from here to here enter or either let's just draw a rectangle instead might as well polyline tool like that that that that that that's the windowsill right and i still i still have the red lines um above it i guess like the cut above it it's just that visually autocad needs to choose which kind of uh geometry to show uh if there's like two geometries on top of each other so you just choose to show the medium one but we don't care because we know that we have the thick line above it and my camera died just a second god damn it yeah yeah yeah you're good all right we're good okay so that's the window windowsill right now for the frame uh we'll do the frames in the next tutorial um for the doors as well right uh as long as we have the windows so it's fine one more thing is we have the floor slab right and then we have the outside you know the ground the gravel and so on those are things that are in two different heights and two different levels right because usually you have like a step or two steps near the entrance and blah blah which means that there's a a line where the floor slab ends right where where the floor just ends we need to mark that line so i'll use the line tool and just mark it here that's where my floor slab ends right so we have that going on now nice um we will be adding doors here the next tutorial a toilet shower it's a little bit it's going to be a little bit tricky to plan out but i we'll we'll figure it out we will figure it out for now um this is all that you need to do practice practice the lines practice the tools and so on and draw out the just the walls with the openings shown right properly so this is that one this is the level of detail that that you should have after the first day of tutorials next up i will not need to show you every tool uh so we will make a lot of more progress in terms of of drawing in the next tutorial for now get to work and have fun bye all right hello hello and this is going to be the second part of our tutorial series for router cat where i'm going to kind of continue on working on the plan and hopefully we'll move more forward with the section and so on so in the first part i've already showed you most of the most of the tools that we're going to use so here it's just designing right it's it's just adding geometry into our plan so let me let me keep the camera there that's fine should be okay okay so we finished off by creating openings here for the window for the doors and whatnot and creating a little room for our sink to be in well it's probably going to be somewhere here the shower and the toilet show let's continue so the the thing that i want to do is probably add the a little bit more detail into the window a little bit more detailing to the doors and and whatnot and then continue on working with this area right here so first of all i'm going to create a window so remember where i showed you before if you have a window like that and i'll just draw it in in lines without any thicknesses let's say you have you know a regular window in a facade and it's in the hole in the wall right and you're cutting through it like so so and you're looking down on it right you're looking downwards through the cut you're cutting through the wall right here and right here you're cutting through the wall you're cutting through the glass and you're cutting through the frames of the window so if you have divisions you would be cutting through the middle frame as well but i think for a window this size we don't need any divisions it's just going to be is lagging let's do it's just going to be this kind of window so we're going to cut through the frame here through the glass here through the frame here right let's do that a window frame what i prefer to use is five by five centimeters right it's not accurate but that is enough for our level of detail that we're going to be using so since we're cutting through the frame i'm going to be using a thick line right and i'm actually going to just draw the the cut of a frame anywhere on on the screen doesn't matter click apollo line tool just hit that f8 button or ortho or two snapping on so that it's horizontal or vertical and i'll just give it 50 enter to the side 50 enter side 50 enter there we go something like that so you could do a rectangle but i just i don't know i'm used to drawing it in polyline now we need to take this frame and place it in the middle of this opening here right on this side and on this side so i'm gonna take the frame i'm going to move it m enter and i'm going to move it from its let's say top middle point here all the way out to the middle point right here right here there we go click now it's here then i just take it i copy it by by using the command copy for some reason it's not making a copy i don't know why let's try again copy from here to here there we go now we have a cut through the frame right so this area right here is done and this area right here is done now we will be cutting through the window as well through the glass sorry as as well and for the glass since it's uh this is just graphics but i prefer to do it this way since we are indeed cutting through the glass you would think that we will be using a thick line but since glass is inherently transparent i prefer to use a medium line thickness for it just so that it's not too thick right um so let me jump to the medium layer and just draw a line from the midpoint here to the midpoint here so that is our glass in the window the thing is that if you think about it we are cutting indeed cutting through the glass but we are also seeing the bottom of the frame right here right this this edge right here will be seen right which means that here we need two more lines to show the bottom of the frame and for those two lines uh since i'm using a medium line to show the cut through the glass i will be showing those two lines that we actually see at the bottom of the window uh as a thin line right i will represent it with a thin line the reason why i'm doing this uh the reason why i'm doing this is because once we print it out or plot it out as a pdf and we have it zoomed out i don't want these three lines to merge into one thick one right or just just because we are so zoomed out and the thicknesses eat each other up right so i have them separated into two thin lines and one medium line rather than thick and two medium lines which would be a little bit more accurate but wouldn't represent the window that well that's basically it we we have a window now right we have the glass the bottom of the frame and the cut through the frame right here okay window is done now the door perhaps we should use where where do we on which door do we start working on let's work on this one right so the door is it's basically drawn um i can show you somewhere here the door is basically just drawn as always being opened unless it's a re reconstruction project and you already have existing doors in the previous project which you reconstruct then those doors are usually shown half opened at 45 degree angle but in this case since these are new doors we are going to be showing them at completely opened at 90 degrees angle from the from the wall and they will incorporate a door swing like so right well not like so actually i'm going to make this quite fast like that so it's going to be the door swing showing the travel of the door when you open it up as well as the door itself being open the door is shown in a neckline because you're cutting through the door and the opening of the door is shown in the thin line because it's a nonexisting geometry right it's it's something that you just use as a markup to show the travel so you don't even need to have a medium line for that it needs to be a thin line so that kind of doorway needs to be here needs to be incorporated here so the way i i really like doing it is by creating a line line two here um do we do it that way maybe we want a little bit of an offset okay let's first do a little bit of an offset so i will create a line or or rather two lines from here to here and from here to here these two line segments and i will give them a little bit of an offset uh five centimeters at most we can do even less we can do two centimeters it's up to you but i prefer using five so five centimeters enter i'll just offset that line inwards like so by five centimeters and that line inwards like so also 50 millimeters five centimeters so now we have um these two floating lines here and these two guidelines that we first had i don't need them anymore so i can delete them so so this is a bracket in which our door is going to be held and treat these two lines as your helper helper lines right we will be deleting them later on so now what i do is i create a straight line segment in a thick layer from the midpoint here to the midpoint here like that right i select it and now i want to open up the door right so uh this doorway or this door board i want to rotate it right so i'm going to use a tool that's called rotate rotate enter it's going to ask me to for a point around which i'm going to be rotating so let's say the door hinge is right here that point and basically then i can just either move it like so move the mouse like so and click or i can type in 90 degrees and hit enter well not 90 sorry minus 90. so apparently if if you add positive values it's going to rotate counterclockwise if you had negative values it's going to rotate no sorry negative values are clockwise positive values are counterclockwise so again rotate select this object enter rotate around here minus 90 degrees there we go so now it's it has been opened and now all i need to do is just create that arc right so i can either use a circle tool and trim away stuff from the circle tool or i can just use arc well let me show you it then in both ways so let me do it with the circle tool first i will create a circle from here to here from the midpoint here to the end of the door here i will create one more line from midpoint here midpoint here like that and now i will trim enter enter again and i'll just get rid of the unnecessary parts of the circle to just get that arc there and now i can delete all of the necessary stuff and change the arc of of the the doorway right of the door's wing so that's that um i will show another method of how to create that arc in this version here because we need a doorway here so let me do the same thing first from here to here we have a line segment from here to here we have a line segment i offset them 50 millimeters offset words inwards escape out delete the trash or the helper lines like that create a line segment ma'am something like this rotate that and this time around it's going to be counterclockwise so it's just going to be 90 degrees like that and now what i can do is i can just create an arc let's say arc tool or a enter and i will say that the center point of the arc or rather i will not be using start point of an arc but rather i will be using the center mode or the arc tool so i'll click on that in the bottom which will ask me to give it a center so the center is going to be located right here where the door starts right here and i'm just going to draw an arc from this point to this point that's it that's that's an arc that has been created now we clean up the trash again and change the arc layer to thin that's it so those are two two different methods of how you can actually use the or how you can add the arc sorry about this yeah that's fine okay moving on so we have uh two doorways we have a window perhaps i want a window here as well but first of all i need to plan out how my whole room is going to look like so let's say we enter here we will need some place to put down our codes and we will need some sort of a place for a for a bed and it's just going to be a small bed because we can't have a large bed here so let me just create uh just to see the proportion of the room let me just somewhere else on the screen uh let me just create a size of a bed that that i want and it's going to just be i'm drawing it with polyline 2 100 millimeters long um i'll go for one mirror 10 100 millimeters wide 210 or 200 and close off the pole line so that's my bed and it's going to be in the medium medium layer i'm just going to move it somewhere here and start planning out how how everything is going to be kind of arranged and how everything is going to look like that's not great let's see let's see let's see if we can make it better i'll rotate this from here here there we go reposition this to here that's a little bit better we can have uh a table here but the door is going to be obnoxious that's fine we can we can flip the door around let's see how wide the table is going to be so i can check the distance here i can measure the distance by typing in dist sort for distance enter and clicking on two points so from here to here give me the distance and right next to my cursor or also above my command line well we can't see it anymore there i will see the distance so let me try that again 1960 millimeters 1.9 meters that's a lot that's that's uh that's quite enough for shelving and also the the table so i'm going to do that i'll create a polyline and i will say that my table is let's go for a pretty thin one let's go for 600 millimeters 600 enter until here here here there we go and this block is just going to be representing my my table right so bed table there's gonna be a chair here and then this door is in the way right it's just messing everything up so what i'm going to do is i will mirror this door uh so that it opens up here the way i do that is just i'll create a line in the opening just to have the midpoint of the line i will select the door i'll type in mirror and then i will use the midpoint of that line i'll mirror the door horizontally like so and when it asks me to resource objects i'll actually say yes right so that it deletes the old version that's it now it has been mirrored quite easy um as you can see most of the time i have orthographic snapping turned on for this project um yeah that that is how it is okay so we enter really hate the entrance here though like the flow is really bad i'll solve this later i'll solve this layer i think there's there's there are ways of how to solve this um but for now let's continue so now i need a kitchenette right so kitchen cabinets are always have kitchen cabinets always have the same module size and it's always 60 by 60 centimeters so the refrigerator the stove the the sink cabinet all of them have 60 by 60 centimeters that's the not regulation but the default value let's see so i'll switch to medium and i'll just create that single rectangle of 600 mil by 600 mil by 600 like that that's our single segment for the kitchen and i'm thinking of having the kitchen right here right so that's let's say that's our refrigerator puppy that's going to be our sink our stove and or rather maybe maybe the stove is here the fridge is here the sink is here and the cutting area and food preparation area is here right so we have that that's good enough i think that's good enough and now i can add one more wall right here just just for how do i call it just a separation you know kitchen from the entrance also it will create a little bit of a hallway here just fine um so i will create a polyline i'll just draw out well let's go for thick line i'll draw out a wall but i don't really know how long the wall can be so what i'm going to do is i will create an offset for the bed offset for the bed and i'll give it like 900 millimeters like that right so now i know that this gap right here is walkable and it's it's easy to to kind of walk through and um yeah so basically i am able to walk around it so now i know that the longest um wall that i can have is something like this right in the gap between here um i will create a polyline now draw it out like so i'll give it 140 millimeters to the side and finish up here finish it up here and now i don't need the helper line anymore so i can delete it so that is my second partition right here which i think is fine you enter you put down your close you can work you can sleep you can use the stove or you can prepare food and you eat where you work yeah that's fine that's that's reasonable i think um here right here i have a line segment that i don't need in the wall because you know my wall kind of continues on here so i'll just trim it away trim enter enter get rid of that and then i'll join up these two line uh these two separate segments this one and this one i'll just type in join to join them up and make it at a closed uh polar line to to just have it clean okay uh once you enter you want to put down your clothes somewhere so i will create um a little bit of a shelf i guess not not a shell let's just call it close storage right i will create that and it's going to be um let's go for 500 millimeters 500 mil like that i have no idea how long this is so i need to actually before i create that uh that area right there i need to measure distance from here to here 1.2 meters we have 1.2 meters for that uh sure 1.2 by 500 millimeters so 1200 by 500 sure um i'll switch to medium line and i'll just draw it out from here to here 500 here to here this is where we put our clothes right um now i really want to solve this because this is kind of obnoxious that you need to close have the door closed of course you most of the time will have the door closed and it's going to work but visually it's not that nice so i am going to probably create a toilet here and see how far i can move this doorway away from the uh away from the desk so the toilet is well actually for the toilet you can consult neufert or you can just go to google let's just type that in real quick just give me a second just a second there we go google uh toilet dimensions dimensions images sure why not and just find any image here and then you can see 690 by 35 let's see so 69 centimeters by 35 centimeters sure i'll just draw it out as a rectangle for now because all i care about is just the size we will make it nice later uh 690 uh in well 350 in width 619 length 350 90 there we go something like that and just place it here which means that we do have a little bit of room for this to move out and i think we will we will use that i think we will use that should we use that yeah maybe we should uh so i'm just going to move everything to the to the side a little bit the way you do that is well you can just kind of select these two um these two polylines here and notice where where we have these points here i believe we can just kind of move those points around can't we let's see yes we can click on those points on those corners and just move them up and i'll just move them up by just sli a tiny bit um do i want to do that sorry sorry about this i i need to to design it in my head real fast do i want to move now i mean i do like the center composition here but maybe we can break the center composition nah i'll i'll keep it i'll keep it so i'll escape out of this and it's lagging escape i'll actually keep it that's fine it is what it is right the the opening when when the door here is opened you can't go through here but that is that is the bane of uh small small houses uh my thoughts were that i could move this opening towards somewhere here until here and then uh flip the door uh around again mirror it back to what it was before and then you will have a smooth transition and into the the toilet the bathroom but it's it's not ideal it's definitely not not ideal as well so might as well just keep it the way this is it's fine let's just move on so we have our toilet here the shower i don't even think we need to create a like a separate separate shower cabinet i think we can deal with this part here as a as a shower uh cabin uh in general so that's fine it will have a mark which shows that you know that the shower ends here and let me just measure the distance real fast how wide is it it's one meter wide so it's a pretty damn wide shower we can actually we don't need it to be that wide do we well we kind of do because if we put a sink here then we need a gap here yeah so so okay we will have a pretty large shower um but the depth of it is a little bit too big i think let's see the distance 1.15 meters um that's actually reasonable usually the like the smallest shower that you can have is 800 by 800 by 8 800 by 800 millimeters so something like this so here what we have is basically just a larger larger shower that's fine that's fine um maybe i will indeed move this line back by a negative or not negative just 150 millimeters so it's near by a meter a little bit cleaner right so this is where our shower is i think we have it planned out i think that's that's good enough now just adding a few bits and pieces here to the walls to make it a little bit more lively here okay so as you're preparing food you will want a window for sure so i will be creating a window here from here until here there's gonna be a window and let me just immediately make it thick line and let's draw it in a thick line there's going to be like a long window here and also you want a window for for the desk uh depending if you're using a computer or not um sometimes you don't want the window directly on the desk so my thoughts are what if we do what if we do a window that is straight up a corner window so it starts here and it's going to end here right so instead of that line it's just going to be a window all the way around and it's going to be like a corner corner window i think that's going to look cool uh so might as well do it and also it's going to be a little bit more of a challenge for us to actually make it nice so window right now i have a lot of stuff here that i don't really need to see so i'm going to expand my layers tab and i'll hide the thin line and the medium line layers by just clicking on the light bulbs here so now they're hidden uh just so that it's it's kind of easier for me to to work with this i will trim away trim enter enter trim away this whole portion of the of the building because that's where my window is going to be i'll make sure to join everything up so that this is a single polyline and this is a single polyline sorry and i'll turn on the medium layer again and make it my active one and i will draw out from here to here i'll draw out the window sill it's gonna be something like that right something like that and now all i need to do is just fill it the window sill into a corner right so i'll make sure that the radius is set to zero so fillet r enter r short for radius enter zero enter so i made sure that there's no rounding and i will just fill it this with this come on with this line enter to repeat the flat command and i'll fill it this with this there we go so they they get kind of extended and filleted into one one area or or one polyline well they are not one pole line yet uh these are two separate polylines that make a corner so i'll actually create a polyline here or or a line segment right there here and here i'll select all four of these lines that and that and i'll join them up join that's it now it's a single single closed polyline great so we have that now on to creating the window frames well to do that i will be using reusing this window frame here window frame cut here so i'll just copy it i'll copy it from the side midpoint right here to the midpoint right here there we go that's that's one frame that's being cut i'll also make a copy to the other side of the window from the bottom midpoint here to the midpoint here like that right now i need to know where exactly is the frame going to be located here in the corner and the way i do that is i'll just draw out two helper lines like that and like that so it goes from around the outer perimeter of the frame so from this point as well as from this point and they meet up in this corner meaning that now if i take this and i copy copy it from its corner point here to the corner here this is going to be like a clean transition clean 90 90 degree bend so i don't need the helper lines anymore i have the the corner frame located right here uh usually the corner frames do have a little bit more of a of a thickness to them but in this case since we're dealing with low uh low detailing level for our plants we don't really need to to show that that's fine the way it is now on to adding more frames because this is a pretty long window so it's going to have partitions i'm thinking of adding two partitions here so i will first measure the distance between this and this and i get 3325 millimeters which is not great but that's gonna do the trick i will just run um calculator three three two five divided by three is one point one meters approximately uh so what i'm going to do is i'm i'm just going to take this frame and i'll copy it i'll copy that that frame cut downwards by one one zero zero one point one meters like that and i'll take the bottom frame i'll copy it upwards by 1 1 0 0 enter escape out of the copy now i have like a pretty okay transition here and also i believe we do want at least one um window frame here in the middle so i'll repeat the process distance from here to here uh that's two two two five two five so that's going to be well math is hard okay let me grab calculator two five to five divided by two one two six five so i'll actually do this 1265.5 so i'll take this uh this frame right here i'll copy it to the side 2565 i believe uh no no no no no uh 162 5.5 162 5.5 no oh god damn it one two six five let's do it again i messed that up let me measure distance again goddammit uh two five two five right yeah two five two five divided two one two six five point five copy come on copy copy here to here one two six five point five enter there we go in the middle there okay so we have that done and actually it's not going to be in the middle right because the the frame itself has a certain amount of thickness let me just double check with measuring two distances from here to here we have one two one five point five and from here to here we have one two five nine point five um five nine point five one two one five so that is going to be i need to just keep calculator open one two five nine point five minus one two one five point five that's going to be 44 millimeters off of an error so i'm just going to move this further by 44 millimeters now it's in the middle um you don't really need to well sorry not 44 that's going to be 22. you don't need to do this uh now as i'm doing it you don't need to do this it can be in this stage it can be approximate it doesn't need to be that precise um but just wanted to to kind of do it just for purpose of of of being methodical okay frames are done now it's time for glass so that's just line segments from midpoint midpoint here cutting through the glass mid to mid mid mid mid to mid that's done and now with thin line we'll keep layer turned on so i had it turned off so once i selected the thin line layer it asked me to turn it on so i did so with thin line layer uh i will create two more lines for each of the window window frame like that like that i'm just hitting enter to repeat the command so i'm finishing the command and then hitting enter to repeat the last command to kind of keep drawing the line segments that that and finally that okay we are done we have our corner corner window that is finished all right so that is our initial plan and that seems okay there's going to be a sink here um questionable design here maybe if we do an arc it's going to be fine let's do an arc so i'm going to or rather let's let's just do a poll line first so i know that uh the distance of this window is 900 millimeters right 900 millimeters wide so i'm just going to make a sink that's 900 in in length um and the width of it i actually want to use like 400 millimeters because it's just a sink um yeah sure let's use 400 900 400 there we go so we have our sink here and i'll just move it m enter select objects enter from this point to this point right i just kind of move it and i'll place it in the medium layer like that and now um these corners right here are kind of obnoxious so what i'm gonna do is i will round them off as much as i can so my thoughts are i need to use fillet right for this so i will use fillette enter and i know that this is 400 millimeters so my radius cannot be larger than 400 because it will just break it will not work right so i'm probably going to use something like 300 millimeters i think that's going to be enough so fill that radius 300 enter and then this line for let's with this line by 300 then enter to repeat the fillet this line let's move this line by 300 that's it this is now a little bit better in terms of transit transition um what i really would encourage you doing in in your future projects is uh where we have the toilet we have this this area which which holds the water this whole area right here can be hidden in the in a wall right it can be placed in the wall but the wall of course needs to become thicker and as you place it in the wall above it you also have um possibility for shelves and and whatnot you know for for all of the you know toilet paper rolls and and so on so i would encourage you to in in your future projects just to do something like this um create a separate well in the medium thickness is it medium yeah let's do medium in medium thickness just create a shelf right enter come on just create a shelf that is around millimeters maybe even less 200 millimeters wide like that like that so the shelf eats up the bottom or the the last part of the toilet and the only thing that is kind of sticking out from the shelf is the the bowl of of the toilet is just more aesthetic it's just nicer right so i'll just grab the polyline tool and redraw just the bowl area of the toilet um for that i do need to have intersection snapping turned on enter so that i can so that i can start drawing from this intersection point here and kind of draw out this u shape here right and now i can delete the old version right so this is just the bowl and let's fill it let's let's make it nicer so i'll fill it uh first i'll measure the distance from here to here well or rather from here to here we have 350 millimeters so half of that is 175 millimeters so i'll do a fillet of 150 millimeters for both corners let our r enter how much did i say 150 right 150 from here to here 150 enter again from here to here 150. so we have that i will also close off this polyline by just creating a line segment here and joining it with the rest of of the bowl just to have it as a closed polyline and i will offset the bowl inwards by 50 millimeters five centimeters just to have something like that and now i will flat uh these two corners here with a little bit less of a of a radius so radius is going to be like 50 millimeters not more than that just to make it a little bit nicer so we have that and then just a small circle um the size of it doesn't matter the positioning of it doesn't matter just to to show maybe a little bit bigger just to show drainage come on yeah around the center point uh 1.5 times there we go so we have a toilet right i what what graphically i like to do is this toilet right here i like to make all of the inner lines thin while the outer line is medium right we are not cutting through the toilet um here in the shelf in the case of the shelf we are cutting through it but it is a furniture piece meaning that we are not going to be showing it in a thick line with a thick line rather it is going to be a medium line but it is going to have this kind of markup with a thin line this this right that means that this is a shelf okay same thing actually for this shelf as well from here to here and from here to here right or cabinet i guess so we have that done now for the sink same procedure we offset um 50 sure 50 is fine inwards we fill that radius 50. um i wonder if that's gonna be enough yeah that's enough actually that like that i will create a drainage hole here i'll just snap to the middle area that and i'll create a a tap you know where water flows from so i'll create a tap um i don't know 150 ml maybe 50 ml or no definitely not 50 ml 20 20 millimeters 150 something like that very simple uh you don't need to get rid of that you don't need to have it super super precise and this becomes a thin line as well so that's our our sink for the shower room i think what we can do is add a little bit of shelving here just a tiny bit like 10 centimeters like that uh well that will need to be medium this is for shampoo bottles and and all of that good stuff something like this uh then create just a circle somewhere i'll just snap to the midpoint let's see here and i'll say that the circle is 200 millimeters in radius and just move it probably somewhere here so that's the shower shower head right which will pour water okay the bathroom is done the bathroom is indeed done let's move on to the bedroom slash workroom slash kitchen slash dining room slash living room um to the rest of the space i'll i'll kind of work on this real quick so i said that i want to have maybe refrigeration can go here so refrigeration is basically just um it's marked out like so like that then you take all of these lines and you scale them scale to the center point by 0.3 let's see like that that's refrigeration uh then you have uh so you take your food out you kind of wanna place it and then it's a little bit cramped okay you take the food out do you want to place it immediately or do you have placement here and you cook here and then wash here take out wash cook place take out wash place cook yeah so okay so this is going to be a sink and for the sink i'm just going to let's let's just draw draw out some sort of polyline that's going to be um the width of the sink let's say it's 500 millimeters the length of the sink or the sorry the length of this thing is 500 millimeters the depth of the sink is going to be like 300 millimeters not more than that um 500 finish up fillet um and then we just fill it with just a little bit of a radius i'll just give it like five centimeter radius just so that it's nicer like that that that that yeah i'll just take this thing then and move it from the center point here to the from the middle point there to the middle point there and move it inwards into the cabinet by 50 centimeters something like that or 50 millimeters sorry something like that so that you have a little bit of area to to place your stuff in in here i need a tab so i'll just borrow the tap from here copy move it here of course it needs to be rotated so i'll rotate it that actually find the way it is but i like to have them off center like that trim from that away i'll create a circle here around this midpoint the size doesn't matter like that that's our sink right nothing nothing more than that then this is just a cutting area so we don't need to do anything with it and this is our cooking area cooking stove so cooking stove is basically um it just has four uh heater blocks right so what i'm going to do is i'll just be a little bit cheeky and i'll separate all of this into four four segments and then for each of these four segments i will just create this kind of a diagonal line and you'll understand why i'm doing this in just a second so i have these diagonal lines here um each of them have a center point right and i can use those center points to show you know to use as as center points for my circles which will show the heater blocks for the stove right so usually you have two that are in say the same size so i'll just use 70 millimeters for this one 70 millimeters for this one then you have one pretty large one uh so this one let's say is going to be a hundred millimeters and you have one a pretty like pretty small uh let's do 15. 50 millimeters now i don't need anything else i just have those those four heater blocks uh looks bad why does it look bad that's because it's too close to the to the edge here but well maybe we can just do this and no one will know that's better okay that's it that's it with the kitchen uh i will want to draw a cabinet above above the or maybe i don't want a cabinet i need to fix one thing the refrigerator is high right and the window is going to be behind the refrigerator so this is a bad design right so i'm going to re remake this this whole area right here um that's my bed sorry about that so actually this this wall right here it needs to extend until the end of the refrigerator so i'm going to how do we do this well let's let's first create that that wall segment here or rather first let's yeah let's create the wall segment here like that perfect now let's actually select the blue uh blue windowsill line and move its points from here to here you can also do trimming and so on but just moving those points around this is fine so we do that then we then we trim enter enter we trim away this area right here like so and we join everything back up so this is joined that's clean that is also clean okay so now i will take the frame copy from here to here how wide is it from here to here we have uh one point almost two meters that's still too wide so i'm going to oh it's not that wide but no i'll still add a division here so if it's actually i'll show you another way of how to do this if you just draw a line segment here and you use the midpoint of that line as your helper copy from the midpoint here to the midpoint here and then delete the helper you don't really need to do any maths it's right in the middle that's kind of useful um actually i'll just draw out the lines in one layer and then just switch the switch the layers around of already existing lines oh man the sun is shining that's not you usually you need to do this that's not usual in sweden i assume we will get like two weeks of rain now because of this displeasure that we have of the two days of sun okay so we're back on track right we we have this we have this done all right all right all right all right what's next i will add a cabinet above like near the ceiling but i will do that later not now let's solve this and then we'll move on to to creating the section so this we have our table right that's just a table we don't really need to add anything to it if you want you can add a monitor or you can add some books and whatnot you know you can make it more lively but it's just a table so that's fine and we have a bed so for the table i need a chair so i'll just kind of create a circle that's uh let's go for um radius of a chair radius of a chair let's say um 20 centimeters so 40 40 centimeters in time no that's that's too too little circle let's let's do 50. so 25 centimeters in radius something like that and my chair is going to let's say it has a bag brace that is an arc so i will just offset it inwards by five centimeters i'll just grab the i'll just create a two line tools here or two lines here to both sides um and then i'll just go to town trimming everything that i don't need so i trim enter enter i don't need this this this or that that's it um this whole thing gets joined so now it's it's a single pole line and this is another a line or rather a circle so here this guy right here is going to be medium this guy right here is going to be thin and the chair is going to be what i like to do is i like to rotate um rotate the the chair just a tiny bit that's not a tiny bit so let me rotate it back just a tiny bit to make it more lively and place it underneath the table slightly right trim away with the table there we go uh just so that it's you know under the table and and you can see that it's it's actually a chair um so that is that now for the bed the bed the bed the bed um we really need just pillows and and the bed sheets right to show this as a bed so that's not going to be tricky i'm going to just grab a rectangle tool and i'll just make two random rectangles for the pillows they pillows are not that accurate so i can kind of get away in making weird ones um just for reference i'll measure the distance that's 300 millimeters so i will fill that all of the pillows by 130 millimeters or 140 millimeters right so all of the corners get related wait that's again the let r enter 140 enter ah there we go now it works okay so just fill it let it fill it uh right now i should probably i forgot to mention one thing there's one more snapping option that that you can accidentally enable and that's called grid snapping which i believe is yeah it's right here snapping mode grid if you have this turned on then your cursor or when when you're trying to draw something it's going to snap to the grid lines like so that is obnoxious and i absolutely hate that so just make sure that grid snapping right here in the bottom is turned off right just just a tip okay so we have two weird pillows here one large one one one smaller one that's that's fine i can actually place them together and trim the let's see the large one with the small one like that go away like that i will make them pin like so so those are two two pillows and let me just position them a little bit more centered like so uh then we have a bed sheet that will go over the pillows so it just kind of goes over them like so right and it trims away of the pillows that is the bed sheet and the bed sheet uh usually the the way i i personally prefer doing it is it it has this kind of a hold here right so it's it's folded folded out that's it that's that's the bed with two pillows kind of tucked away be behind the bed sheet all right we have this uh this plan then the plan let's move on to creating a section so or or no sorry well maybe apologies just a second i'm gonna think can we move into section making yeah let's move into section making so the first thing that we want to do is we want to mark out where we're going to cut the building through right with what's the cutting line so i'm just going to create a straight line segment like that and i'm just going to see where with the move tool where i can position it so that it cuts and shows the most things so my thoughts are and usually you don't want to cut through the furniture you either show the furniture in the projection of the cut or you or you don't right but you don't cut through the furniture in this case we are going to be cutting through the sink but that is fine if you are cutting through furniture you you're not hatching it in so you're not filling in the cut that is important to note you're just showing it as if it's in the projection um let's do that i think we can do that because we will see quite quite a bit and my viewing direction is going to be that away right so i'm going to see uh i'm going to be cutting through the window through the sink through the door through another door through another window i'm going to be seeing the door the side of the the cabinet here the or the side of the shelf here the kitchen area kitchen front i'll see uh side of the window and um and the toilet what i won't see is the shower the bedroom uh or the the bed and the work table which is fine it's you know you can't add everything to a single section usually you need to do more than one section to show everything in the building that's fine um so the way i really like doing this is first i will go to layer properties here and i'll just create a new layer and i'll call it helper helper layer and it can be white that's fine just a single additional layer i'll make it my active layer so that's my helper and what i want to do is basically make a cut here so i need to to have all of the correct dimensions so my workflow and it might be i think it's it's a workflow of everyone who uses autocad is just dragging out just dragging out the the lines or maybe i should should draw it from here just so that it's it's clear more clear for you dragging out the main lines that that i wanna i wanna keep working with right that i will see in this section so that that can come in later well no let's let's do it now like that then this is gonna be a line this doesn't necessarily need to be a line but i will i'll add it um then we have the whole kitchen area so this edge right here is going to be a line and then we will have the last line here so we have a bunch of like vertical lines extended there's like uh that i forgot the name of it just a second how is it called um construction line i think it's construction line yeah so there is one more uh tool that can be used and it's called construction line so um it's it's located right here or the shortcut for it is x line and the thing about x lines is that they are infinite in length right so you can use construction lines but this is a very simple project so i'm not i'm not really used using them right in in this case so i'm just dragging out regular ones um right so we have that and now i i will just start drawing right so i'll create uh let's stick to the helper layer for now uh first thing that i do is i'll just draw a horizontal line this is going to be my ground right this is my ground line and basically my building starts here with this line and ends here with this line right and i'm taking that projection and looking at it all right so i have that going on and now now i can actually start drawing right so let me go and create a thick create a thick line here and create a polyline sorry change this to thick layer and create a polyline and i'll just draw out in between the the walls so this wall right here and this wall right here in between them i'll draw out the floor slab so i know that the floor slab will start from here will end here its height is going to be something around i would say 400 millimeters something like that or 100 initials up here bam that's done that's my floor slab and i accidentally um drew it above the ground line right so this is like our ground uh ground cut that where we start cutting through the earth so this is air this is this is air this is earth right so i'm going to just take this and move it into the ground like that okay so that is done now uh my walls right i'll just kind of create the the walls so the question is how high is the ceiling going to be and what kind of roof are we going to have that's that's the main question and i haven't sketched this out so i have no idea um my thoughts are let's have an awkward pitched roof why why the heck not right let's let's have an awkward awkward pitched roof maybe give me a second and i'm just thinking um or no i will not be making a pitched roof instead i'll i'll make like a like a separate some sort of a separated roof here uh why not so i need the height of the ceiling right so i will offset i will offset this ground line uh by by how much how much by how much i can also just copy it up as well let's say the ceiling height in my shower is just going to be 2 600 millimeters 2.6 meters which is probably going to be pretty high that's pretty high let's do less offset 2 400 millimeters also pretty high go again offset 2 300 millimeters i don't want to go lower than that so okay so that's my ceiling height in this area and for this area i will want a higher ceiling height so let's say offset three thousand yeah just let's just do three meters three thousand millimeters something like that so that's going to be the ceiling height in this area right here um i think that's going to work i think that's that should work right yeah that should work yeah it's gonna work okay so now um i have my floor slab i need to create walls right so i'll just grab a polyline tool and i will just start drawing in the walls so my wall here is going to look like that enter right and my wall here is going to be larger it's going to look like that enter right so i have one wall here one wall here and the ground slab here or or the floor slab here okay so we have that done now for the actual roof slabs i will create more offsets here bear with me offset and the roof is usually thicker than the walls these days the roof is around 700 millimeters thick in you know in buildings but for this particular summer house i think we can get away with uh 500 400 millimeters i'll just do 400 well 450 let's let's have the middle ground here so i will offset it by 450 and i'll offset the ceiling the the high splint up by 450 and the smaller ceiling up by 450 like that that's a lot of lines to to look at now right and you will get used to it eventually um now actually what i can just do is i can take a rectangle tool and just draw out the roof slab let's see how far will the lower roof slab reach probably until here right and then we will have the the large roof slab going on here yeah i think that's that's gonna be that's gonna be the trick so i have this line marked out and this is going to be how far the bottom row slab reaches so i'm just going to draw out oh now i forgot it's this line here so i'm just going to draw out a rectangle like so that's my bottom roof slab and then for the top roof slab of course it continues on from where the bottom row slap ended you know until here there we go so we have roof roof wall wall floor let me delete all of the horizontal lines we don't need them anymore we will be working with vertical lines but we don't need the horizontal ones anymore um right so we have that going on now let's create some foundation foundation blocks because this is a little bit a little bit obnoxious right the way this this connection looks like that's not a strong connection um so i'll create a polyline and i'll just create a block that how how with how deep is how deep is the floor so the floor is 400 millimeters deep so i'll create a foundation block that is plus let's say plus 600 millimeters so the foundation block is going to be one meter deep from the from the wall right uh so polyline going down 1 000 millimeters finishing up here connecting as as a rectangle same thing here well actually let's just copy it why not copy from here here so that's the foundation that's going into the into the ground okay that is them now i kind of want to clean everything up right so i will hide the helper layer for for just a tiny bit i will hide it and i want to join everything up into one big happy family and also one more thing that i want to do is add a wall segment right here because these two roofs need to connect right so i will create a polyline from here uh to here and it's going to be uh let's do honestly i would want to do 400 millimeters but in this case let's do 250 50 and how long is it 700 millimeters down and just close it off like that okay so now we have our our shape and honestly honestly the way i would do this i could start trimming and joining but this is going to be so much faster if i just uh change this to medium layer turn on thick layer or change this to medium layer escape out and draw redraw everything in thick layer as a single or as two polylines like that so just going around the perimeter yep messed it up there we go and then going around the inner perimeter like that then i just hide the thick layer i turn the current layer off whatever delete the medium layer and turn the thick layer again and i messed it up so there needs to be a line here and it needs to be joined up there we go you should see something like this right so that is uh the section of your or rather the exterior envelope of you of this particular building right that i want i also will add just so that i don't forget i will add ground here and here that's the ground cut line and i will actually take this uh this ground cut line and i will move it down by five uh or 50 millimeters just so that the uh the the floor slab is five centimeters higher than the ground uh the reason for that is when it's raining you don't want the rain to visit your house right so that's the reason that's the reason also it it's it's good for for kind of brushing uh the the dirt out of the building as well uh as as you leave the to the building okay so that's ground that's that's uh our little building here let's continue on so now i want to add partitioning walls because i can see that there is going to be a partitioning wall here where we will also show that we are cutting through the the doorway and also there is going to be like a retaining or partitioning wall that we will just see in the back right so we need that as well let's do that let us let us do that so i will go into my helper i will enable my helper layer i'll start drawing some rectangles wrecked rectangle so partitioning wall right here that just a rectangle um then there's no partitioning wall here but there is going to be a partition goal here but i accidentally forgot to add do we need to add or maybe we can use this um it can be kinda joined up with the shelf in a way yeah let's let's do it uh let's do it this way i'll just create a one more helper line from this point here downwards uh we'll create a thick line a rectangle just something like so like that and i will create a very weird with a medium line or rather this sorry sorry sorry sorry this needs to be a medium line because we are not cutting through it of course we are not cutting through it so it is indeed medium line thickness and i will create one more medium line that shows the shelf at the at the side so it's going to look like it is going to look weird but that is fine that is okay usually uh you don't have these kind of weird gaps here but actually we can kind of since we are since we are here and i just kind of fix it yeah let's fix it uh so i'll delete the two helper lines that are for help helper lines that i don't need anymore i will kind of add them later on i don't need these anymore as well actually i don't need any of these anymore great we can delete all of them and i wanna fix this area right here this is an awkward area so what i'm gonna do is i will go in here oh i know i know uh so let me just create a line segment here just so that i don't forget where it ends and all i will do is just take these points and move them to perpendicular snap what the hell perpendicular snapping is turned on why is this not working fine fine we will do it the other way around i will trim enter enter delete that segment here i will extend this line to here or enter extend to here enter this line like that and then i will create a thick line segment right here at and i will fill that there we go uh fill it with radius of zero so fillet radius zero from here to here that is done and now it just needs to be joined up properly join should be good yes it's good so ah right and now just a rectangle for the shelf like that okay so now it's done sorry i just wanted to clean it up a little bit um just to make it a bit a bit nicer okay so we have that done uh now for the let's add the doors and the windows into the walls right uh so let's start with a window opening here on the left hand side right so my windowsill is going to be probably somewhere around i'll just start drawing here from from the bottom up it's going to be offset and i'm going to offset it uh 1.1 meters 1 1 0 0 something like that and the height of the window is probably going to be until the until the roof right so i'm just going to not even measure but just draw it like that that's it right i will change this to the thick layer select it get rid of that join everything up that's done right so the the the window opening is done and then it's absolutely the same procedure as what we've done in the plan so i will not be kind of talking about it i'll just really quickly be recreating it i'll actually even make a shortcut i'll just borrow the existing window here like that there we go so we have a window here um doorway doorway is very simple all we need to do is just well we need to know how high the doorway is and it it is a 2 meter 2.1 meters high that's that's almost nothing that's almost nothing okay and i will just trim uh trim enter trim away everything except for except for the top you know this little area right here and actually i want to join it in with the with the roof so i will trim enter like that join everything up uh it gets joined up into the incorrect layer so i'll just switch the layers around like that um now let's go for the thick line because we are going to be cutting through the doors and just add a door segment here um honestly let's make it a little bit nicer i'll just borrow the the frame we will just use the same frame for the door copy from here to here like that that's that's the frame for the door and maybe we can make it a little bit nicer as well yeah let's just make it nice um so that frame is going to be all the way through and it's going to be five centimeters thick and 40 centimeters wide it's a wide frame right um and it's going to have a door going through from the middle of it like like that so we are cutting through the door and we also see the back of the frame as per usual right so we see this wall right here in our projection so that is going to be a medium line and it's going to be a rectangle like so i can't draw a rectangle properly let me just draw a pole line then instead 140 millimeters with there we go so that's our door doorway right and that's done now to show a doorway in the in the projection i already have the 2.1 meter height here so i don't really need to invent anything and i know that this doorway is 90 centimeters wide so i don't really need to and make any calculations i can just do this 900 bam bam bam like that um and then then i kind of want to i don't really need the bottom line do i okay let me explode so i explode this fall line i will delete the bottom line i will take this this line segments that are left again it's upside down u now i will join them up perfect and i will i will offset all of this by 50 millimeters inwards so that's our frame for the door and for the handle i will just where's that water tap i'll just use the handle here doesn't need to be precise just something like that so that's that's the handle um and that's honestly that's honestly it in terms of the doorway that's our shelf that's good that's our wall it's also good then we have the kitchen kitchen cabinet and we have another really large window here so for this window i know that here i'll have a kitchen cabinet and the kitchen cabinet is always 1.1 meters high uh so this window line that i i drew here kind of continues on right and the first thing that i'm going to do is i will make i'll probably make something like this right so the window is going to be located here and then i have the possibility to add shelving here in the top i think the storage i think that's that's fine so i will trim enter cut away that part right because that's where the window is going to be located now i can delete um and i will draw two line segments here as per usual join everything up ah change the layer change the layer of this one as well there we go and honestly i think i can just kind of cheat and do this yes i can okay so i'll just uh take that window and place it in there as well so we have that but also i have the window going until until here right because i see i see this with this this window area here and it's actually not going until the the wall it's actually stopping right here right uh so i will have let me draw this u shape here i will have a window here like that which means that now i don't see this line anymore because it's a corner window right so i don't don't have don't have neither this nor this line anymore so i can just delete it right because i as i'm looking through this i never see the you know here i see the the wall here i won't see the wall right because i'm looking through it i'm i'm i have a window that goes through the whole facade uh so that's done now i will offset 50 millimeters i will offset this by 50 millimeters like that and i will actually extend it just by grabbing the control points or you can use extend tool that's fine as well i'll extend it until this one so this is the frame that we see right uh now i can see that there are going to be divisions here uh well at least one division here so i'm just going to kind of draw out those two lines because i'm lazy like that and i'll use trim enter enter to kind of clean everything up so come on there we go and then get rid of the rest but that's that's my window yeah that that's that's all all i need to show um now for the kitchen cabinets uh and actually maybe i want no i'll i'll stick to this for the kitchen cabinets it's going to be uh just a polyline and just a rectangle or maybe we can do let's do let's do it this way from here to here 600 millimeters down here um so that is like one one block copy that that that is my kitchen and my refrigerator is actually going to be larger than that so i will i will say that my refrigerator is an arrow boy that just kind of fits in there like this right um now for the top shelving i actually kind of want to have shelves in the top so i'm just going to say um there's gonna be like a single cabinet here and then there is going to be like open shelving here so i'll just offset it inwards by 50 millimeters so that is open shelving and this is like closed cabinet shelving to which i can add a handle like that all right um we can do uh a wire tap as well uh wait where is our water there we go this it's uh that it's it's there right so i will just kind of create a a a circle trim trim enter bam do something like that uh create a poll line that does something like that offset 20 offset it so that it's like or rather let's first fill it uh let also 20 millimeters why this fillet oh right flat enter air r enter let's not use 20 let's use 50 millimeters in here and here like this and now i can offset uh by 20 millimeters outwards like that just kind of close off the pole line like so join everything up and now do a little bit of trimming so trim that and that then line um go lower trim come on trim enter there we go and you need to be also trimmed yeah uh so just you know awkward water tap with some big really big knob whatever okay so we have that that going on and that is fine that that looks okay and there is still sync and toilet that are left to do so i'll really quickly do it so for the sink i'm i'm thinking of having something like this um how wide is the sink i believe we used 400 right so it's going to be 400 mil here then it goes down by let's say 100 mil something like that and then it goes at an angle and that angle doesn't really matter right now so i'm just going to say something like that right that's it uh fill that uh flat corner or or just fill it radius uh 30 just let those radii like that that's our sink where is my trusty app right there i'll just kinda rearrange the rearrange it scale this bad boy 0.5 move to here and this trim this trims away tap good so that's our sink and then we have the last thing as our bowl and i will just take a look at the bowl how it looks like from the front uh that's ugly like a nicer one yeah that's good enough so it just goes kind of straight down well it does make a bend and it goes in a little bit um that's fine uh let's do it that way so i will create two guidelines here oh that's not uh how you want to do it guideline here guideline here how high are the bowls as well um 450. so they are 450 millimeters high that's that's good to know where's my autocad um how do we do this so there's going to be a line here it needs to go down and in okay so let's do an offset by how much it's going to kind of go in let's see by five centimeters like that like that now let's draw a line at the bottom at the base and let's offset it by 450 millimeters that's the top of the ball and let's offset it down by uh i don't know 150 millimeters this is uh from where it's going to kind of become thinner and now i just need to trace around so from here to here to here here here until here enter delete all of the guide lines like that that's our bowl yeah the proportion is fine i'll keep it that that's all we need to do and the flush the flesh button is located here uh now for the storage uh there is going to be um i i have made that that that cabinet in in the back of the bathroom so there is going to be storage involved here uh so i'll just draw a polyline from let's see the storage starts at the sink level so from here upwards um let's say for the toilet rolls the all of the you know stuff that you need at hand uh let's just give give it 300 millimeters something like that so this is going to be like open storage right this area so i'll just give it a frame of 50 millimeters just to show the frame oh that's uh 50 is too much maybe let's not give it no i will give it a frame uh offset uh 18 millimeters that's the thickness of an mdf board uh like that we need to clean this up a bit trim no no there we go so that's storage and then above it we will have like three panels um i think we will have three panels let's do three panels so from this side we will offset um by how much by how much by how much if that's a meter then we can do 300 300 400 i think that's that's reasonable so let's do an offset of 300. centimeters or millimeters offset by 400 millimeters something like that so that is kind of storage above the above the toilet done but that's enough that's enough i think we have the door we have the door we have the shelf here we have the retaining wall we have the partitioning wall window everything that we see here everything that we see here okay section is done let's learn one last thing and then we will call it a day so one last thing is hatch and by the way um for this section let's make the mark out a little bit nicer as well because it's a little bit you know um so let's make the mark out a little bit nicer usually there's no kind of convention for what kind of section markups to use the ones that the one that i really like using is a line segment that is i don't know uh in in this case it's going to be like uh 600 millimeters something like that it's kind of a line segment here then we have um then i offset it and i'll offset it by 300 millimeters no that is way too much i'm sorry i will offset it by a hundred millimeters yeah there we go that's much better and i will draw to the midpoint here this um this arrow and i'll just join up this arrow so now i i have a line and i have an arrow just like here line and arrow arrow is showing the viewing direction for this section and later i will add a text here or i can add text here now so the shortcut is text enter um you specify the start point here and you type in or you you specify the height of the text so what's the height what's the height i don't know let's do 200 for now and we will we will switch switch it up if it's too small so height is 200 enter and rotation angle of text 0 enter and now i can type in finally so next text text a that that's it escape uh we just drew we just wrote a right and i'm just going to kinda center it so one once i name this section it's going to be named section a dash a or a is that the dash it's probably a dash a a section a a and i will just place that section markup right here make a copy of it to the other side of the building very important to have section markups in your project please do so um right so that's text right add adding text that's nothing too fancy it's just basically you read what it asks you asks of you in the command line and you'll be good to go the text will need a separate layer so let me go to layer properties and let me create one more layer and i'll call it text right so that's going to be my text layer and my text is going to be yellow sure and then i'm going to create one more layer even more layers yes one more layer and call it hatch so hatch is basically fill right in in photoshop in illustrator you have phil in cad software you have hatch so hatch layer and i'll make it red green cn yellow pink or magenta all right so let's have a hatch layer with magenta color close that now i will take my markups and i'll place them in the text layer like so and now i will use hatch right to fill in the walls so i'll go to i'll make hatch layer my active one and i'll type in hatch or shortcut for it is just h enter so that's hatch and once i have typed it in it will give me the settings for the hatch of course where i can choose different patterns yes the word is pattern different patterns right uh and also like i can change the transparency the angle and so on so let me um let's let's do it this way let me create a rectangle like so and hatch it in right so if i just click inside of the rectangle and hit enter that's it it's hatched in right and this is it even has a pattern if i zoom in right and the pattern is super dense so it looks kind of filled in from from when i am zoomed out uh so that's a lot of bad things happening with the hash let me select the hatch and delete it let me also do a rectangle that is not closed right there's a gap here hatch click cannot be determined right can a hatch cannot be made close shows me even where so it only works with stuff that is closed off right uh can you go away please oh my god now now i'm gonna anyway let's ignore those two circles here um so it only works with enclosed uh boundaries uh that's the first thing the second thing it uh the scaling is very important and it it does become super heavy if you have a pattern for the hatch but your scaling is so small that it looks like a solid and you think that you have a solid hash like a solid fill but it's actually a very very tiny pattern your computer will get super slow because of that so let me do hatch again and here i can choose a pattern right so the solid patterns just basically fill in right it's just filling in then you have the angled patterns and you have a bunch of them actually is it possible for me yeah so i can click on that small icon there and i can see all of the patterns that i can choose from oh my god so so bad um so let's not look at the bad patterns let's just talk about these what you have here so hatch patterns usually determine the material that you're cutting through and if it's a solid hatch it's usually you saying that don't worry about the material for now this is just a proposal entry uh project and the material doesn't matter right but if you later layer down the line if you want to kind of add materiality to your drawings explaining that oh this is concrete while this is wood while this is steel then you use hatches different hatches that determine it so the regular angled hatch this one where i have my mouse is concrete usually right it's concrete then the one right next to it the one with the double line uh well okay the tricky thing is that it changes between country to country right the the regulations uh change between country to country but to my knowledge most of the countries use this as steel metal right so that's the hatch for metal and the third one is hatch for wood right so that is uh three main hatches that you kind of go through once you introduce materiality for now i'm just going to use solid hatch well actually i do need to talk about scaling solid hatch doesn't have any scaling because it's solid right it's filled in while these do so you can change the density of the hatch so let's let's talk about this let's let's choose concrete right the the regular angled hedge once i have this chosen and i hover my mouse over the rectangle i see it as solid but if i zoom in it is still solid no it's not there we go it's it's all messed up right it's it's super super dense so the first thing that i want to do is i want to change the density and the density is changed right here patch pattern scale right if i change the scale to 100 enter and i hover my mouse over the rectangle now you can see that the hatch has a hundred times larger scale and that is actually too big so let's do 50. yeah that's fine um just to show you you know so that's 50. then you have uh possibility to change the angle so this is uh you know the default hatch what if i wanted just horizontal well i just changed the angle to 45 well that's vertical but you get the idea right so minus 45 would be horizontal right so that is how you change the rotation of the hatch uh super useful uh for now i will keep it at zero and the default value for the hash is zero degrees then you have transparency don't mess around with transparency ignore the transparency uh there's one more thing and that is uh one more useful thing and that is set origin and it's basically if i let me just create this hatch and then click on it once once once it's created and i click on it it will give me the hash editor tab again right as if i was editing it and now i can change the origin right so this is a point from which the from which autocad starts hatching your geometry right so if i click on this set origin now and i choose let's say this point right here right the hatch will be aligned with that particular point so when you need something precise in terms of how it's hatched that set origin point is a lifesaver for sure that's about it in terms of hatching so now let's hatch our our buildings catch enter i will actually use the angled hatch why not and i will just be clicking inside of the walls because that's the stuff that we cut through right uh i could be hatching inside of the frames window frames but that's not no way too small no need to hatch those uh so that's that's the walls that are done enter and actually the hatch is pretty big pretty coarse so what i can do is i can just select it go back here to hatch editor and then just change the the density to like 20 maybe yeah 20 is nicer that is now hatch then and let's do the same thing with the ground because i want the ground to be hatched in as well uh so i'm just going to create a temporary polyline here maybe a little bit smaller maybe just goes from here to here something like that maybe a little bit longer there this is just uh you don't need you don't need to be precise with this um just hatching out the hatching in the ground so it's something like this and then i will start from my pole line start there just make a horizontal line and just use fillet with radius of zero to kind of let these two guys together so now i have a closed ball line and i will hatch and i will place a hatch inside and i will change change it to a different kind of a different kind of a pattern i'm just thinking what kind of pattern should i use maybe i'll still use the angled one but i will change the angle to 45 degrees something like that and i will change the density to 30 something like that that should be good enough and now i don't need that border anymore so i'll just delete it just to have the hatch right okay i think that is that is it can i check i will just check the notes uh just give me a second array uh next time arrays whatever uh not important text oh i already showed you text that's good uh less things to show you tomorrow um that's fine yeah uh so so that's good uh everything that i wanted to show today is shown tomorrow we will work on the axonometry and we will finish up the project right so that's that go to work and enjoy the process there bye hello hello and welcome to the last part of the autocad series where i'm going to and finish up this project and show you all of the remaining tools that we kind of need to use to be able to finish up so right now we have a plan we have a section those still need some some work and those stills need some additional information but most of the stuff that we want is already there the thing that's missing is the axonometry drawing so i'm going to do exactly that right now and then we will continue on with adding additional information and basically extracting the drawings into a pdf so to start off um axonometry or isometric view is basically a view from the top sometimes it's from three quarters of the top but uh in this case we're just going to be using some weird angles i guess and a very fast example would be if i have a rectangle and i'll just draw it completely randomly just some sort of random sized rectangle and let me switch to thick line just so that we're kind of consistent um let's see this rectangle represents the top of our shape of our box right so if we look at the box from the top it's a rectangle right so what if i want to show an isonometric view of it well first thing that i do is i check uh what kind of angles i can use so i can use 45 to 45 degree angles for the walls or i can use 60 to 30 degrees that's that's usually the typically that's the angles that you use so i will show you both of them in uh yeah i'll just show you both of those variations so basically for 45 degree angles you can't really do like drawing them with uh without any assistance is kind of tricky well it's not tricky it's just that you first need to draw it horizontally right some sort of line and then you need to rotate it every time by minus 45 well that's the other way around but but you get what i mean you know to get a 45 degree angle you just kind of draw the line horizontally and you rotate it that's not nice instead what we can do is we can use this polar uh tracking widget right here in the bottom it's f10 the shortcut is f10 so i will enable it by clicking on it and also we can expand it and we can see so you can expand it by clicking this small triangular icon right here and once you expand it you can see the angles that it's going to let you choose right so it's basically in increments so you can have like 90 degree uh increments you can have 45 degree increments 30 degree increments 25.5 degree increments and so on so for an axo that is 45 to 45 degrees i can use this 45 degree increment um color tracking is it called yeah polar tracking so i will enable that so now this is tick marked and now when i draw a line it snaps to a direction of 45 degrees which is great so now let's draw uh this this box uh in an axle to do that i need to know these two measurements so i'll just measure distance this like that and it's around uh i drew the box very randomly so i will just say that it's around six ten six thousand millimeters right so then i just grab a polyline or a line tool doesn't matter i'll just draw it at 45 degree angles as 6000 enter so that's my line right then i will measure the other wall like so and i see that it's 3251. so let's say 3250 millimeters i'll grab a polyline tool again i'll just draw it out yeah like so 3 500 3250 right enter that's it we have the two lines and that these two lines are going to be enough for me to finish up drawing this this particular this particular box because now what i can do is i can copy this line from from its base point here to the base point here and i can you can see that i missed so i'll do that again select it copy from here to here there we go that's much better and then i will i will select the other line copy from its base point here to the base point here that's about it right now now we have our um 45 degree angle axle off the top of the box but of course in an axonometry you can see it as a threedimensional um threedimensional object so let's see the height of this box is three meters three thousand millimeters so what i like doing is i like selecting the let's say this is the roof right i like selecting the roof plane and copying it copy and i'll just copy it from top to bottom like so and i'll just type in 3 000 millimeters right and hit escape so then i have the bottom of the box as well now all i need to do is just some additional lines for verticals and clean it up right so i'll just draw those slides like so like so and like so and then trim enter enter and get rid of everything that we don't need don't need that don't need that that's it that's the 45 degree axle right 30 60 degree axle uh or iso view would look like this well first of all i need to change the polar snapping polar tracking to 30 degree increments of course and then i kind of do the same thing so i remember that this is 60 or 60. this is 6 000 millimeters and this is 3250 millimeters so let me do this um i will find a 30 degree angle right here and i'll say 6 000 like so i will then find the 60 degree angle here and i i'll say 3250 like so and actually i can kind of continue drawing it this way or yeah let's let's stick to it i'll i'll copy right so the procedure is exactly the same copy like that it the height doesn't change of course 3000 like that accidentally moved it i guess in the incorrect way copy please move downwards 3000 enter yeah now it's good three lines bam bam bam those three lines are done and now or just trim enter enter get rid of that get rid of that and delete those two there we go so that's a 30 60 degree angle right very simple let's do this with our with our building um so i will say that i wanna i wanna kind of look at it maybe from this point on i don't know well if we look at it from this point on it's it's going to be the the large roof and then the small roof maybe that's fine or maybe we can yeah let's look at it actually from from here from this point right like so so i will measure distance and i'll do it 30 60. i'll measure distance so that's 6 000 millimeters in length and of course the width is going to be 4 000 millimeters like that or thousand so i will just grab a polyline tool and just draw it out like so and i'll see 6 000 in this length there we go 4000 along this line so make a copy bam and make and and then basically close it off right so let's say this is like the footprint of of my building right so this is uh this edge right here around my building then i need to know the height uh the height of it and here i kind of have um how do we do this yeah let's uh draw it from the ground yeah that makes sense so i'll i'll do distance sorry about this um i do want to actually select this join this up right and i want to first take the floor slab and move it up to the correct height right just like i did with the box in the case of the box i moved it down in this case i'm moving it up it's the same procedure basically so i'll just measure distance uh from here to the top here and i can see the distance is 3500 right so i'll just take this copy up 3500 like that and then i'm going to measure distance here distance from here to here that is two thousand eight hundred right so i'm just going to make another copy up two thousand two thousand eight hundred there we go right so now i have all of the levels that i that i will need for my axle and i can start connecting them um before i begin that hiccup right here i need to know where that hiccup happens right the change in the height so i'll measure distance again from here to here 2560. okay sure so along this line if i grab a polyline tool along this line is going to be 2 560 millimeters enter and actually let me extend it so i just have this polyline as a helper and i know that this point oh messed it up let's do this again two five six zero right or two six five zero oh my god uh distance two five six zero okay from here to here two five six zero uh come on come on just two five six zero enter did you snap properly this time yes you did okay good always double double check if it's if if it is snapping properly so i have that point here and now i can just draw that point up draw a line from that point up the height of the line doesn't matter because i can just always select things that i don't need so for instance i don't need this anymore and i can delete it and i can also trim enter enter and trim away the excess right so i have basically what i've done is i created this hiccup line right here and i know that with this hiccup line the top of the roof ends that the highest roof it ends so i'll just grab a polyline tool and i'll just draw it out like so or i could just take this line and copy it that that works as well okay so now it it doesn't look like much but once i start cleaning it up it will start taking shape so i'll do exactly that i'll trim and i'll trim away um enter this area right here is this this and also this right so that now is the top of my uh the top of my roof and that is the bottom of my roof and i can basically connect everything with vertical lines so there's going to be a vertical line here there's going to be a vertical line here and the vertical line here that's that's all i need to do and now it's just uh cleaning it cleaning everything up right so trim again enter enter and get rid of all of the necessary bits construction workers behind the glass hope you don't hear them let's do that all of the unnecessary bits and pieces that we don't need we just trim away and i can see that i can just delete that zigzag here so i'll just kind of delete it right so that's the shape that's the shape of of the beautiful building right wonderful um let's continue so what i want to add now is this well that's actually a very boring facade let me do this real fast let's grab a grab this copy rotate come on rotate and just create some sort of opening at least right right somewhere here and then of course i need to clean this up so i'm just going to make i'm just going to hide the medium lines for now or rather first i'll create two thick lines here here and here um turn off the medium layer select these two lines trim lead delete join everything up here and also join this join okay this is closed this is closed perfect okay so now we can we can actually turn on the medium layer and now we have additional window here which will not show up in the section but we we don't care um i deleted the hatch so i'll reinstate the hatch hatch um that's going to be that pattern the i believe i used 20 for the scale yeah looks like it i'll just click inside of the walls where i want the hatch to be there we go that is done enter okay so we do have a window here now so it's not going to be that boring at least i kind of want to now cut a hole out for this window and also of course for this window so the first thing is i need to know what's the height at which the windows are going to be located and actually both of their height is going to be the same it's going to be one one five zero millimeters above the ground line this this line right here so i'm just going to take this polyline i'll copy it up by one one five zero enter okay so that is the bottom of the window and at top of the window i can just measure the distance again so my window height is 1.2 meters so i'll just take this line again copy up one two zero zero enter right that's the top of my of my windows now i need to know where this edge is and also where this edge is right so i'll just measure distance from the end of the wall one five four zero and then it's going to be another one of nine nine hundred one five four zero nine hundred okay let's do it this way a line along this line to make sure that you're just drawing a polyline in in that particular direction and one five four zero we're doing one five four zero here and just honestly just drag it out you know so so basically we have this kind of l shape i i like using it this way um as as my helper lines actually i should probably like have these lines just to be more pedagogical in the helper layer because these are just my helper lines and i'll make my helper layer active as well we continue i just grab this uh i start drawing from this point along this direction and i will say 900 because that's the width of my window like so right like so so this rectangle right here is where my window is going to be located in the axle same thing for here but for here it's going to be quite simple i just measure the distance from here to here that's 400 of course and i can just take this vertical line here and just make a copy of it along this edge so i'll just snap somewhere to this edge and type in 400 and that makes it into makes it into a copy okay let's uh clean this up again right so i will just grab the thick line tool and i'll just grab a polyline tool and here uh just make sure that intersection snapping is turned on intersection that it's turned on and i will and i will just draw out this twisted rectangle here or project that rectangle here that's the hole for my window and i'll do the same thing here only that it's a corner window so it's going to be a u shape rather than a rectangle like that this right and now i don't need the helper lines anymore so i just delete them there we go this line right here uh line segment right here is not necessary so i'll just trim enter enter and trim it away okay so now to be pedagogical i need to give thickness to this right of course i i need to give oh by the way if you do this accidentally like if you accidentally rotate the view just click on the top top right corner box right here and then click on the arrow keys like here to rotate it back so that stop is you know where you want it to be um right continuing on thickness so to give it thickness all i need to do is just draw out a line segment here of course and as you can see i always tend to draw out line segments that are too thick and then i just simply trim it trim them back to to the thickness that i want right um and the thickness of the wall is 400 millimeters i don't even need to check that so i know that this line will go in by 400 well actually what we can do now let's do it the oldfashioned way um copy or offset offset would work as well offset 400 from here to here that's 400 and then draw just a line segment here offset that line segment by 400 and words like so and delete the original of course um trimming again enter there we go there we go there we go okay so that is thickness of the wall uh here and there's also going to be thickness of the wall here but in in this case i'm going to be a little i keep holding down the shift key sorry about that um don't hold the shift key as you're scrolling it's going to rotate the view uh so in this case i'm just going to grab a polyline tool draw this l shape right here take that l shape and move it along along the 30 degree direction right by 400 millimeters like so trim enter enter trim away the excess grab the polyline tool extend it you have your opening here right okay so there's no windows uh let's add windows of course so the windows are gonna keep doing it um the windows are going to be located let's see in the middle or or actually do i want them in the middle maybe i do let's say the windows are going to be located kinda in the middle of the of the wall right so i'm just going to take um this polyline that i already have and i'll copy it from this corner to the middle corner here and that is going to be my initial window or window plane right then i will offset by 50 because i remember that my thickness of the window frame is 50 millimeters offset it like offset it by 50 and just copy it inwards by i don't know 25 25 something like that and now it's just a bunch of cleaning up right so the more curves you have the more you need to think what you're cleaning uh but it's basically going to be if i trim enter of course i don't see anything that's going on here that's gone um i will not through the window technically you since it's glass you would see that the back side of the wall but in this case we don't want to show it so i'm not going to be showing it and that is basically it then i just delete the access and then we have wall window frame and glass right so we have our window here same thing for this uh same thing for this bad boy right here why am i doing this i think this is because in rhino the the shortcut is holding down the shift key to pan the view so i think that's why i'm doing it anyway um in this case it's exactly exactly the same procedure only that i'm going to draw a polyline like so let me make it make it white uh helper line layer so i'll just draw it as a white pollen so that it's easier for you to see make a polyline pop it in and i will just make a copy of it or rather i can just move it actually move it inside of the hole by uh so that's going to be middle of the wall that will need to be 400 um no the wall thickness is 400 so that's going to be 200 millimeters something like that so now it's moved in and of course it makes a bend here right so i can't have that line just located here it needs to go in and the way is going to go in like the way i'm going to find that point uh by how much this edge needs to go in i'm talking about this corner and this frame right here see how it's it's going in it's not you know resting on the side of the wall uh same thing here it can't rest on this side of the wall it needs to go in so i am going to just grab this line right here and i will make an offset of it by 200 inwards so now i can see the the new um the new line segment that i can draw and i'll draw it of course so helper apollo line from here upwards it's like that we need to clean it up because the more again the more curves you have the uh the harder it is for you to understand what the hell is going on so i'm going to delete all of the unnecessary bits um and i'm going to rotate the view as per usual i'm going to trim enter enter and i'm going to trim away the things that i don't need so that and i'm going to join things that i do need a second yeah um right so so now i have it offsetted offsetted uh by 200 inwards and that is great it makes a bend but we will never see that bend that it makes so we are just dealing with this plane here i will offset it now i'm just doing the same thing as i'm i was doing here offset 50 hello oh offset 50 there we go you go in then take this copy along this direction by 25 and then just draw that small little line right there for the frame um right now we clean everything up as per usual trim trim bam bam um no need for that delete okay so that's oh uh forgot that part trim bam bam now that's fine okay um so i have this done there's also uh i forgot one thing we have two partitions that's oops that's my bad so the way i'm going to do partitions i think is do we measure from the side of the wall yeah maybe maybe we just measure from the side of the wall right or is that a stupid way to do it maybe it is a stupid way to do it i know let's do it this way i'll draw two helper lines here right here and right here and i will measure their distances from this corner from where the window starts distance to this line is going to be 1100 and then another distance is going to be 3275 one one zero zero two two seven five okay i just need to i am sure that i will forget that uh so then what i can do is i can just draw a polyline from here like so um 1 1 0 0 like that so that's a point right here and let me actually mark it out just with a random line here and then another one is going to be uh yep forgot it two two seven five there we go two two seven five enter so it goes until here and i'll just draw it out like so so i have like these two two corner points and i know that if i were to make like an extension for the frame it would reach those two corner points so i can kind of backtrack right i can kind of do this i can grab a polyline and i can draw it like so please stop stop rotating okay follow line like so and another one like so right so so now i have anchored my my lines properly and now all i need to deal with is just vertical lines right so i'll just grab a polyline again and i'll just draw out i just need to make sure that i'm sticking to the correct position yeah there we go i'll just draw draw out vertical polylines here or vertical line segments and here right now i don't need those helpers anymore so i'll just delete them so that they're not in the way anymore like that and for these line segments i can actually clean them up a little bit more from come on trim enter enter bam bam i can clean them up a little bit more and i can start messing around with them so moving them around copy so you too will be copied enter and you will be copied along this direction by 50 millimeters right because that's that's the thickness of the polar line right um or polyline not the polygon of of the frame so i i drew this this line right here and then i copied it by 50 millimeters i don't need those helpers anymore okay so we have that done um and now i will just take these two line segments and i will copy them in by 25 millimeters for this thickness right here only that we will see it on the side copy along this direction 25 mil that's done okay time to clean it up and make it actually look like a proper proper window uh trim enter enter and now it's just a bunch of trimming here so the frame will merge so the frame kind of does this right it just merges um like so and of course you don't see anything behind the frame here as well you don't see anything behind the frame merges here um continues on here like that okay that's good and let's clean this up that's good and there are two line segments that are missing where the frame bends like here and also right here oh yeah and we don't need to see the inner line of the wall anymore so we can just delete that oh that that as well that's it that's that is our window in the axle right i will change everything to medium layer uh just because we are not cutting through anything so it makes sense that it is a medium layer except that for the glass i will change the glass to thin thin layer because there's too many too many lines that are concentrated uh in in one spot so i don't want them to merge like graphically i don't want them to merge into one thick line so i'm going to make the glass thin layer okay um now it's all about hatching it right and making it nicer um it's not a very difficult building that's for sure um let me just add the hatch and then we will continue i don't want to spend too much time here so i want to have planks let's see horizontal planks going around the building so i will go to my hatch layer and i'll create a hatch for it and i'll just choose let's say this wall enter so i've just created some random hatch i'll select it and now we can kind of go to town here so i know that this is uh this is 60 degrees this is 30 degrees if i remember correctly um so i believe if we do if we do zero degrees here oh sorry sorry where when the angle is 0 degrees it's at 45 right um so let me do or actually let me change the yeah i'll use this instead this hatch instead for the planks so instead of 45 we want to first start with horizontal so let me just say 45 degrees that is not horizontal so let's add 90 more 135 so now these are horizontal and now i can kind of rotate them so i need to rotate it back so 135 and i rotate it back by 30 degrees so that's going to be 0 105. one 105 there we go and i really want the planks to start from this point right here so i will choose it as my as my origin set origin this point right here so the planks start from here okay and now for the scale of the planks i think the scale is kind of good but maybe i'll i'll do like 15 something like that that's it uh now for the other wall same procedure hatch selected angle is not going to to be 105 uh it's actually going to be that's pretty close my guess is that it's going to be 15 right yeah it's going to be 15. you can always kind of rotate it with the slider here and see what kind of values work or you can do quick math in your head that that works as well so but but in this case the angle is 15. i used scale of 15 as well i believe and now i need see how these don't match i need the same origin point so i'll set origin right here and these don't match why don't they match oh right because the angle is different so of course sorry apologies of course they won't match but also that's 15 and that is also 15. they look very very different both being both being 15 um a scale of 15. either way that's good enough doesn't matter okay so we have planks here right we we have our our building um kind of want to let me just do one thing offset uh 250 go in when this is uh you you don't need to do this this is just me wanting to and i have something a little bit more complex in terms of the room until here bear with me it's not gonna take too long uh so that's gonna be that that that that's fine um can i go to medium turn off the hatch layer okay medium is my active turn off the hatch layer trim i'll clean this up a little bit just a little bit trim enter go away you are correct but you go away and don't need that anymore don't need that that or that this is fine like that did that trim again forgot one one part this um what select are you locked haven't accidentally locked it well that's awkward oh undo and do so that was a bug for that uh i will need to to fix it apparently uh that the screen was frozen for a little bit and i didn't see that there's there's a there was a bug so let's let's clean this up real fast so that you don't need to wait too long no need for that or that or that ah time when you want to do something nice you just need to deal with a crap ton of bugs okay so that's done this is fine no need for that this gets extended you and you get extended that all is fine and that just needs a line segment here okay a little bit more detail on on the roof just just to have something there okay let's let's uh let's move on uh so we have on our axle we have our plan we have our section if i want to maybe now it's the time to uh to create layouts for for plotting yeah i think it's it's time i think it's time so what we're going to do sorry what we're going to do is um i'm going to explain you what what layout is first of all i guess um so this is your model space this is a space in which you work it's not the space in which you prepare the the project to be printed out and where you work with additional information on the project well adding dimensions will be done here but everything else will be done separately in the layout so a layout is here in the bottom of this here in the bottom of the screen you can see layout uh layout one layout two and these are of just just there just doing their thing and we don't really need them we will be creating our own so i'll just delete okay you just right click on them and you just delete them delete okay oh this one doesn't delete you need at least one layout that's fine we will create our own and we will ignore this one so new layout you just click that plus sign you right click on it and you choose uh page setup manager well first let's rename it i guess first let's rename it and let's name it plan enter usually you the convention for naming them is zero zero dash plan and then zero one dash section zero two dash axo and so on so that all of them are kinda laid out properly but uh in this case we just have three drawings or whatever all right name name it whatever you want so that's our plan we go to page setup manager we right click on the layout name we go to page setup manager right here and we modify it here in the page setup manager you can see your layout one and the new one that you've created so you select it and you click modify okay so this is where you kind of set up everything about the layout uh and all all of the settings on how what kind of drawing you want to export right so let's start from the from the start uh microsoft print to pdf is fine i prefer using adobe pdf dwg to pdf is also fine but anything that can kind of generate pdf you choose you don't choose a printer because you will be exporting it as pdf right so printing is not just printing on a sheet of paper or plotting plotting is the same thing as printing by the way it's not printing on a sheet necessarily on a sheet of paper it can be printing to a file right so so to a pdf so in this case i'm going to choose yeah let's just go with microsoft print to pdf if if you want you can use adobe pdf you can use dwg to pdf whichever is to pdf you use uh so that's done let me just hit properties here and just double check yeah that's fine that's whatever i'll keep it with the properties paper size here we will find a3 that's the size of the paper that we're going to be using uh what to plot layout yes uh plot offset uh keep it at zero zero that's fine scale one two one yes so here the scale is off the page not of your model so the scale needs to be one to one landscape yes and plot style i use none for plot style i use none that's important that's it no need for anything else yeah no need for anything else let's just hit ok hit close and now you can see that the page became bigger right and this is uh basically this is like a window uh showing us our mall and we will position our our geometry in this in this page so how do you do that well the thing is first of all you need to understand the philosophy of layout so a layout is a digital a in this case a3 sheet of paper which has a window in it right it has like a hole in it and through that hole you see you see stuff that you drew in your model space right so you see this stuff in your layout important note right uh that this rectangle right here is the frame of that particular hole or that particular window right so you need that rectangle to be um first of all properly sized you know to fill the the the page and second of all you kind of want to understand what's the um what's the scale of of of of these elements because right now they're just kind of randomly zoomed in there's no scale right so you want to have the scale one more thing that i'm gonna do is i am going to before i kind of continue with the layouts i'll go to the model space and i will create some room here and of course my hatches will not let me so i'll kind of delete the hatches for a bit f8 i'll just create a little bit of space between these just so that when i grab the view of the plan it doesn't kind of grab a little bit of the section i'll create the sections in the sections the hatch in just a second for now let's just keep it and you can see that it by the way updates here okay so first thing is understanding that this is a page and this is a window into your model space and you had a look look at your model through that window um second this is this frame this frame uh i kind of want it to be let's go to layer properties i want it to be in a separate as a separate entity so i'll create a new layer i'll call it i'll call this layer no print do not print layer um and i'll keep it oh by the way here you can see it says white even though it shows black that that is not a bug that is how it works right so it will show up white in the model space but it will be black as it's printed out just something that just your autocad things okay so this frame right here i will select it and i will move it to the no print layer and the reason why i'm doing this is because when we are going to be printing out the layout i don't want this frame to be visible by the way those of you are thinking will the grid be visible no no the grid will not be visible in the final print um but i also don't want the frame to be visible so that's why i'm putting it in the separate layer and then we will just make sure that that layer is not being printed during the printing process then the next thing is well let's position this to the center so i can just kind of move it around right f8 i can just move it anywhere i want i did this window and now let's make sure that the scale or or not the scale that we are focused on the plan view right in this particular uh in this particular layout so i'm going to double click inside of it double click and now we are not we can't move around here in the layout but rather we are moving around in the window so when you double click inside you are done working within the window and you can zoom in zoom out so you can control the the positioning here right so what i'm going to do is i will select my plan and i will type in z or zoom and then i will here in the bottom i'll choose object so i've just zoomed in to this object right once i've done that i just double click anywhere else right not inside and now my layout is focused on this particular or this window this layout window is focused on this particular drawing right that's important i will now need to make sure that the scale of this drawing in an a3 page is a correct scale it's 1 to 100 1 to 50 whatever scale i want it to be right so how do you change the scale well for that you will need to access the properties of this window frame so i select this window frame and i type in pr short for properties and hit enter it will open up this page for me or not page this menu box for me and i'll position it here and here in the properties i can see that there's under misc right here there's standard scale and custom scale so i'll not be using a custom scale rather i will just expand the standard skill and i'll find the scale that i want in this case probably want to honestly one to 50 is enough for this kind of a project like even one to a hundred would be enough but that's way too small uh so instead i'll just use one to fifty right for for my scale you could use 1 to 25 that's fine as well but i'll use 1 to 50. like that and now my this particular drawing this drawing right here is at 1 to 50 scale right i will close my properties tab escape to unselect and from now on i will not be messing messing around with this particular layout i can still move it around and whatnot right but i will not be messing around with it now here if if i were to if i were to check ada05 requirements stamp each page will have ada05 stamp including the name of the student the date the name of the drawing and the scale of the drawing on bottom right side of the page okay bottom right side of the page we need a stamp so what i'm going to do is i will create a do we create one more layer yeah let's create one more layer and i'll call it layout text layout text and i'll make it just white color by the way there are two white colors uh this one right here which is two five five it's gonna say two five five here and there's this one here that's gonna say white this one the two five five one is going to be printed out white this one the one that says white will be printed out black okay rewind if you need it if you need to and then listen to this again i'll just hit okay so we're using the white that's going to be printed out as black escape and i'll just choose this layout text as my current layer uh current current layer in which i draw and i'll i'll kind of start going to town on this so the first thing that i want is a bracket like a a framing of the page so i'm just going to first draw out an a3 page um well that's not zero zero zero coordinates that's weird why well whatever doesn't matter i'll just draw out an a3 page um and it's drawn at one to one scale by the way so it's 420 millimeters by 297 millimeters by 420 by 297 right like that i'll just move it kind of close close to the bottom left corner like so so that it it fits with the page that we have here doesn't need to be perfect that's fine and now i will offset uh this this line here by uh 10 millimeters yes that's gonna be one centimeter that's enough by one centimeter so now i have the inner bracket and i don't need the old one uh of like th this gap is always one centimeter from the side of the page and i can use it uh for placing of my of my stamp so the stamp is basically just a bunch of information about the the project about the drawing and i'm going to be quite quick about this because there's nothing smart right so i'm still in the layout text and i'm going to write write some text actually right so i'm going to start writing here maybe that's a little bit too fast t enter short for text specify first corner specify second corner uh probably change the height of it from 200 millimeters to something a little bit less um so things that are uh less than three millimeters depending on the font are becoming harder and harder to read so i'm gonna say three millimeters why is this not updating dd you are user are not updating at all that's that is strange okay let me try again select this text and i double click you now i can't yes i uh can we change you three millimeters the effect of using the style you know just okay this is being um no this is being a little bit awkward m text this is a little bit too big isn't it but for some reason it oh it well there's some some issues here and there with the without account i guess so now it works let me just uh just to make sure that this will work as well let me try now it says 200 i change this to three draws as three either way um either way let's do this again and now let's do this cleanly i guess text text specify start point of text let's see from here specify height so i will specify um five millimeters in height specify rotation angle zero okay it just works sure uh my name is okay uh next text t enter first corner and i will here i'll just say and here it's doing another thing whatever name that's that's going to be where my name is going to be now let's do the date the name of the drawing and the scale of the drawing okay so i i still need some things and honestly once i have one text object i just kind of like to make copies of it and just like double click on it and write what i need to write so ad05 we will have the date and i know this is not the 20210202 i know that this is not the cleanest way of how to do it but whatever works for you there's there's no rule in how you need to draw it um and then there's to be title and yeah whatever title and date okay so now let let's uh make some some adjustments right uh we need to put all of this information into into this corner right here in a kind of nice nice way so i'm going to draw with a polyline i'm just going to draw out a table that is let's say going to be 200 mil long and that's not horizontal f8 200 millimeters by um let's say by by 40 millimeters by 200 close it off if we need to we'll we'll trim away some some stuff from it um and then i'm actually i'm going to just select this and explode it so that i can work with each individual edge separately or each individual line separately and i will say that aada05 is going to be located right here somewhere here and it actually is going to be scaled it's going to be twice the size to all other um all other information so i'm just scaling it to by two position it there we go make a copy of it or make a copy of this uh probably some something like so move this my name is gonna go here um you can just kind of position it like so like that and now i'm just going to kind of build a table uh build a table around it that that that looks okay i will center this as well okay uh now for the date and the title uh the title will go in here so i'm just going to move the title here and i'm going to kind of double click on it and change this it's ground floor plan so it's going to be ground floor plan m or scale 1 2 15. now we can say at 1 250. usually add is at what height are you cutting but here we don't really care so we'll just say 1 to 50. so that's ground floor plan and then we have the date 2021 and position it properly that's it uh that that's all you need to do uh right so you have your um your stamp here right um the stamp is it does have much more information in it but this is just like first practice okay so that is done we have our plan we have our layout everything is correct let's do two more layouts right so the way we will do other two layouts is now by right clicking and choosing to move or copy so we right click our existing layout zero zero plan move our copy and we choose move to end create copy right so there's going to be a copy created at the end of the layout line i hit ok so we have this one we will right click it and choose to we will choose to rename it to 0 1 dash section right zero one dash section uh that is done and then i'm gonna while i'm at it i'm just going to right click move an or copy move to end create copy okay uh rename rename rename to zero two axle right so we have section xo and plan and now layout one is just randomly there so i'm just going to delete it no need for that there we go the only layouts that we need are these three okay so we have that uh now for the section i will double click inside of this this window uh find the section zoom into it zs enter or that's that is not uh an autocad command that is rhino command z enter o enter there we go that is autocad command double click out select the frame uh pr for properties annotation scale no not annotation custom scale uh that standard scale 1 250 like that close it off that's done and i will just change this as well so this is section a dash a at 1 250 that's all we need to change here and that is done and now axo double click inside find the axle zoom selected z enter oh enter not zoom selected and this guy right here we don't really have a scale for it so this is just going to be axon axon metric diagram something like that and actually if you want to by the way if you want to resize your uh your window you can you can just click on these uh do that these you you select the frame you click on this corner point here and you can just resize it any way you want right that that that works as well uh axo doesn't have a scale so i will not be messing around with it too much i'll just keep it as it is okay so we have that done we have axonometric diagram we have section we have plan okay i think we're good so now in the model space um we actually need to or rather not in the model space let's go back to layout space let's change the colors i i think that's that's important to to to kind of change the colors before we do that of course we need to add the hatches i forgot that i have deleted the hatch so let me readd it real fast u u u u u and u enter select the hatch uh angled angle is going to be 0 and scale is 20 that's perfect that's it okay let's go back to the plan so that's how it looks like right now and to change the colors you change the layer properties right you change the the properties of the layers um for the colors so hatch let's start with the hatch right it's going to be the easiest one or rather let's let's leave the hatch for the last one um rather let's start with the thick line the red line right so here um well when i am in the model space and i look at layer properties i can only see one color right it's it's just magenta red yellow blah blah blah one line time one line weight if i go to my plan right here to my layout and i go to layer properties i can see two colors that is important because this is the color of the model space this is the color in which it's going to be plotted out or exported very big difference so i am going to in the um is it called white space no it's it's something else um in this column sorry sorry about that um in this column i'm going to change start changing the colors first right so the thick thick line uh i'll change from the red color to black right here or to white actually i know it's it's it's confusing but you'll get used to it so i'll change it to this white color not this white color this is this white is going to be printed out as white this white is going to be printed out as black right so it needs to say white here i'll change it to white and now if i doesn't go wait a minute yep that was that was my bad sorry i figured it out so apparently in the paper space right here um this is what's called the paper space you can't really override um the the color this way so i'll turn this back to red sorry about that that's a little bit of a hiccup uh instead instead i need to go into the model space so i need to double click to go into this view and here i can go to then i can go to layer properties just make sure that you don't accidentally scroll your mouse wheel or anything like that you don't mess up the scale i mean if you mess up the skill you can always kind of repeat the steps and get the scale back either way once i am inside of this view that this is super important once i'm inside of this view then i can override the color how it's going to be printed out so thick line is going to be white see it turns uh it turns to black text is going to be let's see text is going to be blue in my case or maybe red yeah let's go for red oh i'll say text is red sure no print is whatever a medium line is going to be also black so white i need i need naming conventions for this uh thin line white and hatch for hatch i will say dark red something like color color 14 something like that right so i have this once i've done that i will just escape out double click outside of the model space and now i can see the the colors have changed and i will just need to do this for every every layout here um a trick on how to do it for all of them would be just to go into model space and change every like in the layer properties come on in the layer properties change the colors here and then it will update for all of the layouts but sometimes in different layouts you want different colors um so so this is a little bit better to do so double click inside layer properties and i will just really quickly go through this so that was 14 that is gonna be white it's gonna be white i wonder if there's like a fast way of how to do this like setting everything to white oh the text needs to be red sorry like that double click and for axo uh for instance in the axo i don't want the hatch to be uh to to be dark red color i just want it to be like gray so here i can change i can change up the overrides just make sure that you have double clicked layer properties hatch i will just say darkish gray like that medium line i'll just go for black decline black thin line uh black text red okay something like that and now you can see here the hatch is shown in in a different way right from from all other layouts so that is my that's my initial setup and that is uh basically what what what i'm dealing with right now um right so we can go to model space and let's see what other things do we need to add here right what kind of other things do do we want to add for this particular project so let's see how we can import stuff right let's see how we can import objects into our scene such as a person a tree maybe maybe a tree for the axo i don't know maybe nothing for the plan um so importing if we go to pimp my drawing dot com at the link is right here to the linework library this link right here if we go here we can find the person which which we can use so i will just kind of use a random why are there and that's fine that's a good one everyone's kind of posing i don't want them to be posing i'll just get this guy so here we have this person and i can click on download dwg and it just kind of downloads it right and downloads the dwg file so i'll show in folder um that's uh that's the dwg file and all i need to do is just click and drag dragon into autocad release and click and then just hit enter enter enter right for for all of the questions basically now i have it in autocad right that is super simple super simple to do and it is what's called the block right so um you can see that all of this selects at the same time and i perhaps i don't want it because this is a little bit too much detail for my type of project so i will um and on sorry one more thing before we kind of look into what a block is it also imports with more layers or i guess it doesn't oh it does it just lagged if if the layers lag just switch between all and all used right and it's going to update autocad come on um so it does import with these two layers in our outer which we can just change like any other layer right in in the layout um so that's that's good so for this person right here i will uh look at the uh for this import right here i will type in properties and i can see that it's imported into the hash layer but that's whatever but it's basically well it doesn't say here oh yeah it does block reference right so this is a block i don't want it as a block so how do you get rid of it i want to use the lines separately how do you get rid of it from from being a block you just exploded so you selected you exploded and now you have all of the lines separated right so i only want the outline of this dude so i'll take the outline and i'll just move it from let's see the bottom of the the shoe to somewhere i don't know maybe near the window maybe somewhere here maybe here yeah somewhere here so i'll just please place him here right and then i can just use him to trim trim away the necessary bits you know which he's standing in front of that like that okay that's it i have my silhouette of a person and i don't need all of the other lines so i'll just delete them right so honestly then i can see that it's only the outer layer that i'm i'm still using the inner layer which had all of the lines inside of the person i am not using that anymore so i'll just delete it delete the layer altogether selected layer was not deleted i will not be deleting it i will keep it forever just don't worry about it anyway for the outer layer i don't care the color in which it's shown here but i do care the color in which it's shown in the layout especially in the section layout right here because right now it's purple right so i'll go i'll double click inside of that layout click layer properties and change the color to index color choose index color here and then to white close that's it double click out we're good to go so that's that's the the person let me do this again with the trees so i will just go to pimpmydrawing.com uh here in the bottom i'll choose trees i'll find a nice little let's see this guy right here download it as dwg that's a small maple tree that's perfect in autocad i'll make sure that i'm in my model space where is my maple tree five it's still being downloaded why is this so slow 123 kilobytes pause okay it's it's downloaded actually um so i'll just drag it in bam i'll just place it like so enter enter enter so i have my small little maple tree maybe i'll scale it up um from this point 1.25 just 125 so that is a little bit larger than the then the building and i will move it down so i think that's that that that looks fine um perhaps i want it on the other side as well so i'll just make a copy of it i'll keep it as a blog by the way in in this case because i don't really well in in case where the maple tree kind of goes behind the building i would need to explode it and trim it away but in other cases i don't maybe i will just to show you explode i explode the block trim enter enter and i just trim away the oh that's gonna be super laggy my mouse is frozen okay um so trimming huh let me turn off the hatch maybe that's gonna help uh make zero my active layer turn off the hatch i tried trimming again why is it why is it lagging i wonder shouldn't lag maybe that's because there's too much too many lines if it lags for you as well this this hard just don't trim the trees right just don't don't have them trimmed um i'll go make some coffee while while this is crashing and then we will continue yep so it completely crashed which actually i will use as an opportunity to show you how to uh if you have a crash uh what can you do about it right so when you load autocad again it's going to say that in your previous work session the program terminated unexpectedly blah blah and you can get a backup from your drawing recovery manager cool let's see how much it saved so i'll just hit close right here and i'll here on the left hand side of the screen i can see my backup file and i can see my uh that is not good that is not good at all let's see this one let's see this guy right here so as as you're clicking through it you can see like these three versions and aad05 that the weird one uh kind of looks like there is a guy there so at least that has been saved so i'm just going to double click on that and open it up and that seems to be okay um at least it does have the the stuff like that most of the stuff that i have done so we're not missing too much and let me change the camera exposure uh we're not missing too much so uh i will just really quickly um re recreate what i have been doing and this time around i will not be trimming the trees that's for sure so explode that so that get the outline move it m from here to wherever it was over here fine enter enter wonder what's up with the trees and then then crashing it never used to crash before maybe the new version really doesn't like the amount of points that the three pole lines have uh that's probably the the culprit behind it uh so just keep an eye out for that either way this is fine and now we just go to section and we change the the color of the outer line here to white there we go um like that oops go back to model and just to be sure i will save keep saving so i'll just save it as aad05 new hit save there we go okay so oh yeah and we don't need those so the trees three trees trees again drag dragging them in placing them uh one enter enter enter scale from here 1.25 just a little bit bigger just move it slightly down so that it's kind of positioned correctly copy it to the other side my god why that's fine um it is what it is so we have our trees here and i'll actually copy um f8 just have a proper copy here i'll say that one tree is located here while the other one is kind of located somewhere here maybe this one is actually here and it's actually a little bit bigger than the other one 1.25 again like that so let's look at it in this section so in the section i can see that the trees are being blocked off by the frame a little bit so i'm going to move the frame like that and like that just so that they are being shown and also i will change the inner uh inner areas of the trees to have a different color so i'll go to oops i first need to double click inside i'll go to layer properties and here i will just change the inner layer color to the medium gray hit okay close that's good same thing for axo oh for axle we actually need maybe we'll need to have a smaller axle that's fine i will just double click and scale out super vertical though click here and we make this bigger let me just snap it to the to the sides here like that uh that is almost good enough but i kind of want to move this tree up because i am dealing with the horizontal orientation of this so i will go or rather we can kind of select all of this z enter o enter zoom objects we can't maybe we can do it other way around if i just go to properties pr and here uh properties of the what the hell that's the polyline oh that's the frame that's the frame um i don't want to select the frame though so how do we do this we can select both of them and then from both of them i will just choose viewport and here i will just change the the scale um let's use custom and if i make this uh this number larger the scale should increase so looks like that let's do 0.0017 or something like that oops 0.017 there we go that's that's fine we can now um clip around here like so well that that was the incorrect line that is fine kinda still still work with this move this in like so grab the line segment here snap it no we can't snap it and grab that one then and snap it now it's fine okay so it was just a little bit of cleaning up there's there's nothing nothing special about what i've what i've done uh there is a little bit of a tree that's uh kind of sticking into the the stamp but that's fine that's uh that's okay if it if it's doing that um layer properties let me change the colors not for the hatch wait why is oh right right right right right i need to double click inside and then change the layer properties to inner line being medium gray and the outer line being black or it says white but it's black okay cool we're done good so that's how you import stuff and apparently you can't trim but that's that's good to know oh i messed it up so i accidentally zoomed out and now it's all messy so i will need to kind of select all of this zoom enter oh enter again double click out select the frame pr for properties and just make sure that the standard scale is set to 1 to 50. there we go so every time when you accidentally zoom out you need to do this exo is fine section is fine plan is fine okay model space um we have imported stuff we have that let's add grid lines let's add dashed lines and let's add measurements right so the first thing that i'm going to do is i will add grid lines to both the plan and the section and the way you do it is well first i'll just work with the helper line and i'll just draw them out so the grid lines are usually anchored to the inner inner walls inner side of the walls that's going to be one grid line that is going to be another one that is going to be the third one right here uh probably here is going to be the fourth one fifth one this one these are used for construction purposes and they're quite uh quite quite useful for that uh honestly i'm thinking of adding a grid line here as well i really want to add the grid line for this but maybe that's not necessary um sorry i'm i'm just thinking uh re real quick i'm just thinking how much we should add um let's stick to to these grid lines for for this particular example then i'm going to create a rectangle um and my rectangle is going to be like so so i'm just kind of drawing around the the building right uh and i'm going to extend so i'll select the rectangle i'll extend these lines to that rectangle so that they penetrate through the building completely like that and also i will trim the lines that are extending away from the rectangle like that once i've done that i just can delete the rectangle all together so that's my that's my grid lines and they will have some sort of a markup at the at the end where i can then kind of say what kind of grid lines i'm using so i will just use a let's just do a polyline and let's just say the length is a mirror now a mirror is too much 500 millimeters uh by tens too too little 50. sure 500 by 50. it's kind of a stylized ending for the for the grid line and from the smith point i will just kind of move it to the first grid line here and i'll kind of copy it to all other positions like that take both of these copy them to the other side uh like so and same thing for the vertical ones i'll just borrow this like so i will rotate it or not rotate around this point vertical there we go um move to the first one from midpoint to end point here copy copy enter and there we go we just kind of go to town with them like that copy from the top midpoint to the bottom end point of the grid lines let's make sure that everything fits in the plan everything does fit in the plan that's great let's go back here um so that's our our gridlines they do need markups uh basically naming for for the gridlines so i will borrow this text yeah this this section markup text i'll just copy it near the first horizontal grid line something like so let's go for below it right and actually that text here can be smaller so i'll just scale it scale it down by 0.5 to a pretty small text let's just double check how it looks like it's pretty small but that's fine and it's basically going to be horizontally i'm going to have grid line a and b and vertically i'm going to have 1 two three four five right so you always distinguish between directions by naming and the naming is alphabetical in one direction and in the other one it's numbers usually use numbers for the direction which has more grid lines as well so i'll just copy a a a a and this one i will just change to b uh the axle doesn't need to have a grid line uh to have any grid lines or any dimensions whatsoever so a grid line b grid line that's great same thing for these guys right here i'll just kind of take this copy this somewhere close by doesn't need to be perfectly precise i'll just rename this to one i'll just kind of make a copy of it so that's going to be one that's going to be two three four ah and stuff with the four copy four and five double click on the text rename it to two double click on the text rename it to three and the text four and the text five that's done now i just need to select these and copy them down copy um from here to here okay so we have our gridline markups done the grid lines themselves are still in the helper line layer so i need to fix that i will or axes i guess we need to call them axes sorry oh wait i'm not sorry it's it's both grid lines and axis in this case so i will select just the ends of them and i will change them to text layer so that the ends are going to be red and the axes themselves i'm going to create a new layer for them new layer and i'll call it axis or access doesn't matter axis and i'll here for now just change the color of them to be also well maybe not yellow maybe let's do orange right just to distinguish between them so these are going to be done in orange for now in the model space i just select them i messed that up there we go and we change this to axis layer there we go so that is done almost um if i look at it in the in the plan layout uh i can see the why is this that's strange it should be red right it's in the model space it's red oh sorry yeah the model space is in the green layer why is it here still shown as black just give me a second layer helper so it doesn't update what the hell that is a bug again that is super weird uh sure we can change them here uh while we are in the model space in the layout i can force them to be in the text layer i don't know why why that happens and now i messed it up i messed up the scale that's fine we just kind of zoom into it zoom enter z enter o enter zoom into it double click out select the frame properties and change the scale again to 1 to 50. it's so super strange that it doesn't wasn't isn't that reactive uh it didn't have this kind of bugs in previous versions uh i assume you will not have these bugs if you're working with an older version anyway um the lines themselves i want to change some properties of them so i'll go to or the axis lines i'll go to layer properties and here where i see axes first of all i'll change the color of them and i'll change the color to probably dark red color let's just hope that it kind of works oh need to be inside of the model space their properties here we change the the the axis layer color to dark red there we go uh so that is done but also while i'm at it i don't want this to be a solid line i want this to be a dashed line so i will mess around with the line type right the viewport or yeah viewport line type right so while i'm still here uh where i see vp line type i'll click on this continuous name here for the wait am i in the helper no for the axis continuous and i'll load a line type that i want and in this case for for these particular uh lines i want it to be dash dash dot long dash dot um that is used for the axes right so i'll just hit okay so now it got imported and we can use this line type right and i'll just choose it and use ok and now i can see that my line types have been updated and now they are dash dotted you can change the line type scale but i wouldn't suggest doing it if it works okay so we have this going on that's great let's jump into this section right here and we kind of need to add the grid lines to the section as well so i'll go back to the model space my battery ran out of the camera this is a long tutorial just give me a second new battery please there we go should be good so section right uh the the way you add uh gridlines to the section once you have them in the plan is super simple you just grab the ones that you already have made in the correct direction and you just copy them down uh perfectly down like so that's it that's done that's done because these are perfectly aligned right uh you will not be seeing gridlines a and b in this section naturally um then there's some change and here it actually updates i don't know so here we need to change the display as well of of these grid lines so i'll go to layer properties well double click layer properties and here i will just change from from the axis color to be that dark red color that i wanted and the line weight or line type vp line type i will change wait line type there we go vp line type i will change to dashed okay um that is done and that is it okay okay okay okay so we don't need to do anything with this this looks fine this looks fine oh yeah and double click out of it so that you don't accidentally zoom in to the drawing now one last thing before we plot everything out is adding dimensions and i'll start with the plan as per usual i'll create a new layer new layer called them just kind of name it them for dimensions and i will make it red in this case or we are using red color so let me make it uh orange we are using pink we are running out of colors here let's just have white then that's fine that's fine so dimensions is going to be done in white color uh let's find it dim there we go so dimensions one last thing right um if we go to the annotate tab here here we have the settings for our text for our dimensions and then and whatnot so there is um there are presets already so sorry the dimensions tab is right here right annotate tab dimension sub tab right here and there are preset dimensions that that we can see here and these are not that not that great we want to make our own so what i'm going to click on is this manage dimension style so again you click on this drop down box and you choose manage dimension styles right here which will give you this uh table where i can create a new dimension right and i'm gonna do that exactly that new i'll call it my pull them micro dimension uh and i'll start with uh whatever either standard or iso you do not start with annotative though that is something else do not tick mark annotative uh the way annotative works is uh as you're zooming out the dimensions will increase in size so they are kind of locked in size in terms of millimeters uh you don't really want that in this particular project in larger projects you do use annotate but that's going to be layer that's going to be much much later um use for all dimensions yes okay so do this hit continue and this is where you kind of set up all of your all of your dimensions so the first thing is color color is going to be uh by layer that's important so all of your dimensions are going to be colored by the layer in which they are in then line type is going to be by layer and line weight is going to be by layer so we are controlling the dimensions through layer not through block then you have baseline spacing if i change this to 500 for instance nothing happens whatever then we ignore it is it that bug again uh we'll see if it's a bug or not um you do have suppression though so suppression is if if you kind of change these things you can see what what changes here so if we suppress them lines both of them you don't see the the arrows anymore right so we don't want that to happen um extend beyond them lines uh that is this is by the way in millimeters so this is very very small uh if i change this to 10 you can see that these lines get extended uh much further so here i'm just going to say and this is where we're going to kind of start messing it up um for now let's keep it at 10. we will come back to this we will we will indeed come back to this everywhere where you see by block you change to by layer this is just the way you do it by layer right um we will come back to the extension in just a second also to the offset but for now i want to change the symbols so in architecture we don't use arrows we use dashes or ticks architectural ticks right so the arrowheads are architectural ticks the leader is architectural deck or the leader can be a dot as well that that's fine uh we can use a dot for the arrow size this is 2.5 millimeters in size that is way too small because you know this is like 400 millimeters thickness so we wanted the the tick mark to be around 100 millimeters and now you can see how it messes up the view that's fine we will fix it uh center marks um that we we will not be working with center marks that's fine uh arc length symbol we don't care about anything else here yeah so it's just these these four things here uh then for the text we will change the text height so the text height right now is again oh by the way text color by layer right um text height we will change this to higher uh text of course and we will use something around um i want to say 75 millimeters i'll just do 75 and now we can see that we are back back in business right so so it's it's kind of um back to what it was uh before text placement um i do want to offset it from so it needs to be above the uh and centered to the dimension line uh but i do want it to be offsetted above it a little bit more so i'll just give it like if the text size is 75 uh let's just offset it by 25. so it's kind of it has a gap here um text alignment aligned with dimension line perfect that's that's fine nothing else nothing else here fit for the fit over the only thing that i change is text placement if it doesn't fit uh in the dimensions it needs to be over the dimension line with a leader um it's basically if if text doesn't fit here then it's going to kind of draw this this line here um like an angled line and it will show a text somewhere else um then here you can see that it's like full num it's not full numbers it's with a comma and we are dealing with millimeters so we don't uh we don't do this we need to kind of show only full numbers uh so under primary units where it says precision i will change the precision to zero so it only gives us full numbers okay so we have that done tolerances we don't care about alternative units we don't care about do we care about anything else here no no we don't okay back to lines tab um under extended dumb lines i had it as 10 so 10 now is super small i will have it as hundred so the ticks extend the dimensionless extent by a hundred all right i think that's it i think that is it that's all we need to do let me double check yeah everything seems fine i'll just hit ok uh my cool dimension is now my new created dimensional style i'll click close i'll make sure that it's my active dimensional style here and now i can start adding dimensions so in the top and on the side here i want to add dimensions and also i kind of want to anchor the dimensions to somewhere maybe the corner here or maybe that this intersection between one and a is going to be my anchoring point that's fine um so these guys will have dimensions anchored to the axes while on this side i can just kind of add some some additional dimensions here and there that that i want to uh that i want to showcase maybe i won't maybe just for the windows um let's do it so my cooldim is my active dimension and here i have two options for the dimension styles well there's actually more options here because if you want an aligned dimension you can have that as well i will show you all of them or at least three of them so linear dimension is basically if i click on it and i click on first point click on the second point drag it out you know that that's that is a linear linear dimension so the thing about linear dimension is that it can only go either horizontally or vertically right it can't go at an angle if i want it at an angle i need to use what's called an aligned dimension where is it where is it where is it ah there it is okay so uh we click on the small icon right next to linear dimension expand it and we can see aligned dimension here if i select aligned and i click click then it creates this angled dimension right so for this particular building we won't need any aligned dimensions just know that you can have those i will just be using linear linear from here to here and if you want to have if you don't want to kind of keep repeating the dimension command you can use uh continue this pool right here which basically just will continue on from the last dimension that you've done and you can just kind of then only click once and once you're done you just hit enter and it's going to add the dimensions right so then i'm usually the way i do it is i create a single linear dimension and then if i want to continue from it i just click on continue and then do it that way now for the uh for some additional anchoring i will do i will do a linear dimension between the corner of the building to the axis one that is going to be 400 millimeters then i'll continue it until the start of the um of the window generally here and then i'll kind of continue it all the way through to the end of the building like so so now i have registered these two corner points here and also the position of the window according to those two corner points and i'll do the same thing here a single linear dimension from here to here or sorry my bad first of all from here to here then continue it until here here and actually just until here we don't need to anchor it to to here or do we well maybe we can why not so that's done that is done if we look at it in the plan view that is how it looks like and again in the plan view it's not showing oh yeah that's fine it doesn't need to show up as as red for now but i will double click inside i will go to the layer properties tab and for dimensions i will change their color to red like that okay so that's done that is done now for the section so for this section you typically you do have dimensions here but since this is such a small project i will not be adding them but you what you do have is you have elevations right uh you mark out different uh altitudes for for different things so we won't have a lot of elevations here we will have one here um i'll i'll just kind of draw lines here um there's gonna be an elevation here um and i want an elevation here but that doesn't really matter and an elevation here well yeah and uh elevation showing what's what's zero what what do we consider to be considered to be zero right so these are the elevations that i want to mark out and for that i first need a markup of the elevations so there are different styles of markups uh the one that i like using is this so we start drawing from the horizontal line and i'll just do like 500 mil uh that's too too large let's do 250 millimeters like so so we just have like this horizontal line that's uh 250 millimeters then i'm gonna draw down by uh let's say 50 millimeters like that this is going to be my helper line and this is enough for me to kind of this amount of lines is enough for me to draw out my markup so let me do it real fast online tool from this left hand side point to the end to the bottom then we move across up like that and we extend it like so right so this is you can treat this fall line basically as an arrow showing like looking downwards right and then i'm just gonna borrow a number here since i already have it move like that and i'm just going to kind of change the the layer of the number to dimensions double click on it and change change it to plus x point x xx or three x's right uh that is how altitudes are written while dimensions are written in millimeters altitudes are always written in meters with three digits after the comma this is how you distinguish between what's an altitude and what's an elevation or what's a dimension writer so let me copy this from this point i will want to show this point here i want to show this point here i will want to show this point here and you can see the graphical uh problems that we will have i will fix them i will want to show this point here uh point on the ground and this point right here right so let's get rid of the helper lines now like that that that no no need for that that that and that oh and that and now let's start kind of cleaning everything up so this guy right here uh intersects with the building so we don't want that i will just move it to the side and i will create one more line segment that kind of does its thing like so and for this one the same thing but in this case it doesn't need to extend too much a little bit more like that line segment drag it out like so everything else is okay um everything else is not in the way so now let's add the numbers right so always the floor plate like the top of the floor is 0.000 so it's neither plus nor minus it's actually plus minus right so i will how do you i forgot how to insert a special character oh no well if if you don't uh if you can't use a special character you can always do this plus minus that works as well 0.000 right that is our starting elevation and that is our floor plate then i know that this is let me just actually i don't let me measure the distance this is 1.1 meters above the floor plate right so this is going to be plus 1.100 right that's that's the altitude and this one is going to be again measured distance from here to here 2750 so it's going to be plus 2 pounds two point seven five zero then here we will have probably i'll just measure this seven hundred so three four five zero three four feels weird wait is it really three four five zero uh yes it is okay and then this height right here distance from let's see this line to here two three zero zero plus two point three zero zero and the last one here it's going to be i remember i just moved it by five centimeters down so it's going to be negative right minus 0.050 that's it that's that's all of the all of the elevations let's look at them in this section that's how they look like in this section and i want to change their their colors in the section as well so i'll go to layer properties double click don't forget to double click go to layer properties dimension and here just change it to whatever color we're using we are using red color for these markups double click out we're good to go okay so we have our plan we have our section and all of them have dimensions okay last thing last thing to do is to actually plot this out right to create a pdf or actually let me i'm now scared that i'm rushing and i will forget something important so let me just double check match properties okay that's that's one that that we can that i can show you as well uh one last trick i guess if you have let's say a line here right come on align right and it's in dimensions layer and you want to change its layer you can match match properties m a shortcut for it is m a and then you choose source object so let's see this guy right here right and then you just click on the object to which you want to match the properties to like that and it's going to move it in the same layer as the source and change its all of the properties to be the same of the source usually it's used for hatches if i have if i have a hatch you know something like this and i want to make it exactly the same as this i can match properties m a enter from this hatch to this hedge right so it just kind of matches these two hatches together quite useful quite a useful little tool um no we are not still plotting it out i haven't told you about the i haven't done one last thing which is adding dashed lines here we won't have any dashed lines will we almost nothing is above but here here we will have a dashed line because there's a like a cupboard above and that cupboard is going to be a little bit thinner than the than the block here so i'm going to create a new layer and i'll change to dashed so this layer will have all of the dashed lines i'll change the dashed lines color to also yellow let's let's go for yellow that's fine and in the line type i will change actually i will change it here in the line type i will change it to load it and i'll change it to just iso dash okay choose it okay and now we have a dash layer that's yellow and that has a line type of the dash right the dash um so now in that layer next layer i'll just create a polyline here that's going to go all the way to here and we'll actually we can kind of do this that would look pretty cool now let's stick to it um 350 let's see like that that so this is basically a cupboard above and you can see it's it's dashed but the dash is very very thin uh let's see if it's actually so thin in the plan here and it's not right that's because well you don't really see it do it's super yellow so let me change the color of it to black there we go so it is dashed here right oh i stood up by the way if if you can't zoom out or click out of the model space as you're in the viewport you can always click here where it says model you can click click on it and then you are going to be in the paper space right so you don't necessarily need to click out so let me fix this again one z enter oh enter double click out uh select this properties keep messing it up i just keep messing it up one two fifty what's that that's done okay so now that's that's a dashed line right there last thing thicknesses right everything right now is the same thickness we don't want that we want the thicknesses to be different and i will use global values rather than local values for thicknesses so i'll do that in the model space rather than individually i or separately in every layout so i'll go to the layer properties tab here and thicknesses are controlled through line weights so the thinnest line that you can have which still prints out by most of the plotters is 0.09 millimeters anything thinner than that uh some older printers will have problems with it and by older i mean printers that are used a lot uh so in the school for instance um anything lower than 0.09 will not print out that well when i see 0.09 i mean 0.09 millimeters so those will not print out that well uh so instead uh we are going to lock our smallest distance or smallest thickness of the line to 0.09 um and then everything the size that we will kind of keep increasing in in thickness in regards to that there's something else that i wanted to mention all right if you're printing with white lines above uh black background so white on black then your thickness of the lines needs to be a little bit thicker because there is a little bit of color bleed right off of the black color so if if your lines are too thin they will get eaten up so if you're printing with white on black i would suggest smallest line thickness to be 0.12 millimeters rather than 0.09 so here with the line weights let's let's go to town with them so axes axes are usually very thin so i'll use 0.09 on them dashed line is also a thin one i'll use 0.09 definition points i have no idea what those are we ignore them dimension dimension lines are usually a little bit thicker so i'll use 0.13 hatch depends on your style but i prefer using very thin lines 0.09 helper we are not using helper layer we're not printing with the helper layer so we don't care inner that's inner lines for the trees those can be super thin 0.09 then we have layout text that can be a little bit thicker 0.15 medium line thickness needs to be thicker than all of these so i'll choose 0.2 no print that's important remember we created the no print layer that one shouldn't be printed so we control it through the line weights we scroll down we don't scroll down we scroll up and we see 0.00 right that's the no print basically lines that don't have any thickness so no print will have 0.00 outer line for these things will probably be medium so like the same as medium so i will use 0.2 uh text uh text can be somewhere in between something close to dimensions so dimensions are 0.13 so let's use that 0.13 for the text thick lines i will go for 0.4 so double the thickness of the outer lines and thin lines are of course 10 0.09 um yeah let's see let's take a let's take a look uh you can't really see it here we need to start uh plotting it out for you to actually for you to actually see it right um so let's plot everything out uh shortcut for plotting stuff out or exporting pdfs is p no i lie it's not p just write plot i guess plot enter um it will ask you for this we noticed that you have multiple drawings um it's available for plotting multiple sheets at once what do you want to do so you can either plot out all of them at once or you can plot them out one by one for this particular purpose i will be plotting them out one by one just so that i can show you how you can combine them with the online tools into one pdf right so i will say continue to plot a single sheet right but you can use try batch plot you can use that as well so i'll continue it's going to kind of give me this plot settings again and i can actually click on preview here to see how it's going to look like produced by autodesk student version great um so yeah that's that's education version right there uh so we are going to be plotting out this right um i i just click the close button i hit okay and i'll just plot it to my desktop let me just create a new folder here i'll just call it plot raw plot raw why are you crashing again location is not available it is it's right here oh my god um pdf document sure i'll call it uh we're plotting out the plan so i'll just call it plan hit save and it's done uh and i can kind of take a look at it right here desktop plot raw plan double click that for some reason to rotate it that's whatever that why is it rotated you shouldn't be rotated don't be weird let's see it's lansky format that's fine what if i use a different lighting technique adobe pdf and i plot it this way i'm just kind of checking what what works more stable at this point so i'll overwrite it and i need to close this to be able to override it let's see if adobe pdf will will do as good definitely slower definitely slower come on you can do it it's not a big project oh my god man oh there we go it's also rotated okay so that's weird but that's fine uh we can have it rotated that's okay um so we have that then let's do the section by the way shortcut even faster shortcut is ctrl p uh continue plot i'll just use the regular one hit ok uh that's section save and then for axo ctrl p plot a3 okay exo save and of course you will have a you will have more you will have the title page as well but not i'm i'm curious to see what you'll come up with so i will not be showing you the title page uh let me just save this file just just in case it crashes again um so we have these three we have the plan right here we have the axo right here and we have the section which i mispronounced right here right everything seems to be in order even though it's it's a little bit messy then what you can do honestly like i shouldn't probably be showing you this but what you can do is you can open them up in photoshop let me just quickly really quickly show you how to kind of connect this to the previous previous course that we had so let's open up photoshop um i'll just take all three of these drag and drop them in as copies and i will as as i have drawn dropped them in it's going to ask me for how do i want to import this very important to have media box set as cropping rather than bounding box that's very important everything else is whatever hit okay then here media box okay and here media box okay so we have now them opened up in photoshop which means that here i can mess around with them i can go to image image rotation counterclockwise image image oops that's kind of a size that's bad image image rotation counterclockwise image image rotation counterclockwise so i have them like rotated back to to normal orientation and i also can add like create a new layer drag it below the existing layer uh grab the white color shift f5 to fill and and basically just create white background that way i'm going to do the the same thing for for all of them like that like that and also i can while i'm at it i can come in here and i can kind of select the autodesk student version then you can just no no no this was done with a professional version right don't no no no it's it's a normal professional version oops uh ctrl d or ctrl z ctrl z there we go uh this one will need a little bit more precision and up believe that a little bit of crap is left there but the teacher will not notice trust me delete that delete that and the last one delete that okay so that is cleaned up while i'm here i can kinda oh you can still see a little bit of the border no no no we delete the border there we go so i messed up a little bit there apparently that particular plotting technique still keeps like a tiny bit of the border that's fine uh there's also an option for you to um go in here where is it going here select this object and i believe there needs to be there needs to be like no print option here yeah there we go so there's also like this whole segment here where we can change the border the no print layer to be actually no print like so right if you click on this it's not going to be printed out that's something uh to to to know so it's either changing it to 0.000 millimeters in thickness or not printing it out altogether apparently uh 0.000 doesn't always work which is news to me it used to work i feel old um oh yeah axel we need to clean up the axle delete that delete that delete that nope i am deleting the wrong things or rather the long wrong layer there we go there we go there we go and now precision decision there we go good enough good enough um what else can we do with this i don't really want to do anything more with this uh you could while you're in photoshop you could kind of add color texture or whatnot to it but i don't really want to do it what i want to do is clean this bad boy up so this is actually this shows very well the difference between vector graphics and raster graphics see how the the lines are not infinite in resolution anymore uh this is because we're dealing with them in photoshop right and photoshop works with pixels so these three are now cleaned up i'll just save them just ctrl s to save i choose photoshop pdf i'll go to my desktop plot raw and i'll just kind of override them or let's just do exo clean like that i will not be saving the layer so i'll untick that i'll hit save hit ok everything else here is fine hit save and same thing here pdf plan clean no layers save section uh pdf section clean now layer save okay we are almost there last thing is combining them so you can either combine them with adobe pdf by just kind of selecting all three of them or acrobat reader selecting all three of them right clicking on them and choosing combined files in acrobat so if you don't have that option right if you don't have that option then you then then then you need to use the website combine pdfs online which is also super super neat uh drop your files here uh exo plan exo plan section there we go drag and drop them in it's uploading uploading it's done and now i can kind of arrange them so first i want the plan then i want the section then i want the axo and then i just click on combine and now it's downloaded here go in folder my computer is just not up to par one you can do it it's just opening a folder there we go so we have that and i'll just add it to to the plot raw for folder sure and i'll say aada05 geridekis get the minus right then i will i can either email it to myself and use the use they used to use the how is it called remote student desktop to login to one of the computers and open up the email from the the computer in the school and upload it to the to the server from there which is a viable solution and super easy to do or i can just simply if if you are a little bit more technology focused i guess uh you can just connect to the vpn blendvpn and then you will have access to the servers this is a little bit harder to do though but then you just kind of go to the thumb folder unprotected and in and you just simply drag and drop in your your file that's it you have successfully finished the course right let's look at the file let's look at the file this is how it looks like the thicknesses of the lines are okay they're not not spectacular but they are fine i would probably if i needed to kind of readjust them i would probably um increase the thickness in some cases let's look at it at a hundred percent i would increase the thicknesses and then in in certain cases the hash is fine the thin lines could be a little bit thicker though and the medium line could be a little bit thicker other than that this is okay that's the section section is okay section looks fine um and the axle looks great simple minimalist i like it right that is it that is it hope you will have fun finishing up the project i know it's a lot of information in the last uh last bit of of these tutorials but that is all of the information that you need to produce any kind of project honestly so that's great now once once you're done with the course you are fullfledged architects just kidding anyway go and have fun with the projects i'll see you next time
