hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to work on something that i think is really cool we're going to make our search function a lot better because we're going to use algolia and i'll explain what that is but we're going to use algolia to handle all our our search um all like getting all the data going through it all and providing the results and we're just gonna display it with react so that's the plan for today uh first of all i just want to say thank you to everybody uh yesterday who uh provided some encouragement and support to me on twitter and instagram so as many of you know i launched this project last week the one that we've been working on for so long um and so i i got a lot of positive feedback but i did get some negative feedback and um some of it was was very constructive and good and i'm okay with that uh but some of it was um a little bit more mean spirited i guess and didn't really even contain anything constructive um so that was kind of getting me down and i think i've just been stressed because i've been working a lot a lot more than than usual i wasn't feeling well uh because my even though i've i have been trying to exercise regularly i think my immune system was just wearing down so all these factors just combined at the point of yesterday morning i was just feeling down and it just was like you know little bugs in the site kept coming and i kept getting comments from people through email and social media and things that uh you know negative feedback and so i knew like you know i just i know how i am and with my history of depression i knew i got to do something or else i'm going to get really depressed here i'm not going to be able to function so that's why i um i reached out to you all uh on social media and just i'm just you all responded just overwhelmingly and i thank you thank you i really appreciate it and it definitely helped uh it helped me to feel a lot better i mean some of the messages were just amazing and there were some people like i had no idea that some people even knew who i was or watched the show or that i impacted them at all and it was awesome to hear that so i don't want to spend too much time and not do any coding but i just i had to say thank you to you all because that uh it really meant a lot to me and i'm i'm going to be going back and looking at those messages probably many times to you know just give me some motivation and and help me you know stay focused on you know just trying to do the best i can so anyway um i see we have a lot of people here so i'm sure there's new people uh let me explain briefly what's going on here i'm a frontend developer i'm employed fulltime at a small university and this is me doing my everyday work i'm in my office right now i'm about to work on a project the main website for this university that we just launched last week and uh so this is not a tutorial but i do my best to try to explain what i'm doing and i'm welcome to any questions that you have just let me know i'll take breaks periodically and answer questions at the end if there are any questions left i'll answer all your questions so hopefully you can still learn something from me or from the other people in the chat um even though right it's we're kind of going in the middle of the project right we've been working on this project for a really long time this is video 98 so yeah so that's what we're gonna do i'm gonna set a timer here in just a minute and we're gonna start with the code and i'm gonna kind of ignore the chat for a little bit while i code uh and then i'll come back to the chat and catch up on things so let me just very briefly just check out who's in the chat now and say hello uh hey i see a lot of you you're saying hi how's it going um i see there are some questions uh there are a few questions about why i'm using algolia over elasticsearch um so let me address this since it it's definitely gonna deal directly with uh what we're doing um i've tell you truth um i'm really impressed with algolia and yesterday i already put a bunch of data in there uh so i like what i see so i'm open to elasticsearch maybe in the future if i learn more about it and figure out that's a better way to go i'm definitely open to it but for now this is a feature that i really want to get live as soon as possible i'm not satisfied at all with the search that i created before it worked well for some of our previous projects because there was a small amount of data but with such a large amount of data with this site it just does not work there's there's too much it there's too much data for a user to be able to find what they're looking for you know the search we did before was just very simple if that word existed in that particular post it would show up well we're talking about thousands of posts here uh so a user's not gonna be able to scroll through all those uh so this is gonna help and and you'll see uh i'll show you what we can do with this data uh in a little while so if you're still confused about what algolia is or what it's going to do just stick around you know you'll see it in action okay so any of the other questions in there right now i'm going to get to those after we do our first coding session so let me switch my screens here you can see this is the site this morning i added a feature where different images would show up so it's kind of just a random as to what image shows up just a simple uh you know math math.random and uh in javascript and i just put all the images in an array and so it just does a random it grabs a url from the array and puts it in as the background image so if you click you get different images sometimes you click and it's the same one obviously because it's random so i just have some different i had some feedback on the images and they said it'd be nice to get images from different parts of campus and about different things going on um i did i definitely i got the most vocal feedback and this actually came from some students where um where actually they said well you know we're we're a catholic college but it doesn't really say anything about us being catholic on the uh main page except for this little thing right here and that was actually true uh it was kind of not really my intention to to do that i just kind of wanted to highlight all of our degrees because i wanted people to know we have really good academics here uh and from our research it showed that that was an area that we could improve on uh in terms of the public's opinion of our university uh but i threw some pictures in there see this is our original picture and uh actually from what i heard um these two women um saw this this picture and we're sharing it on social media and we're excited that they got on the website so i actually don't know who they are uh i just this picture i thought was really great to put on here shows women in stem and they just looked really joyful in the picture so i thought this would be a good picture to use but i'm glad that they like it so anyway let's uh let's get started let me go try to find my timer i'm all let's see okay that's better uh i'm going to start up my server let me make this bigger let's start up our dev server i did a get pool this morning so we're all up to date i've been working a lot from home um so i had a ton of of changes um lately i've been i i it seems like i'm busier now after the site launch than i was before the site launched we ended up finding a lot of of broken links because there were multiple urls for each page that i didn't really know about so that was that was a little bit crazy so i think we found almost all the broken links i mean i'm sure we'll find some more but um i'm trying to get some consistency in only having one url go to one page and not have all this stuff everywhere um okay so we got dev servers running now i'll be able to start up ngrok i'm going to copy and paste the link in the live chat right now and that's going to let you all check out the changes we're making to the website in real time and you'll be able to inspect it and everything right there on your machine so i guess i'll go over here and this is the live site this is at franciscan.edu you could check that out if you want um but i'm gonna go to localhost right now and i'm gonna put this on a different branch let me make this a bit bigger i think that's probably still too small okay so down here in my my terminal and i'm using visual studio code i know usually people ask about this and i just have the the little terminal option down there so if you go to view you can open your terminal right there and i always have two open one to run the uh dev server and the other one for commands usually like git commands but i'm going to go to a different branch right now and if you're not familiar with git uh it's basically like i can test out some things like a separate version of my project without messing up my main version that that i'm gonna push to my live server at some point so this will let us work without having to worry about breaking something because if we do we can always switch back to master branch make a quick change if we need to right so that's that's why i'm going to make this branch so i'm going to do a git checkout with a b flag that b flag is what's going to make the branch check out's actually going to switch us to the branch so we're combining two git commands and then after that i just type the name of the branch so this is going to be let's just call it search hopefully hopefully i don't have a branch called search all right nice i thought i might so we have a new branch called search and now what i'd like to do is i'm going to use a package from algolia called react instant search so i'm just going to copy and paste what they have in their uh instructions and get so that's yarn add react instant search dom and then algolia um algolia search so while that's loading up i'm going to paste i'm going to copy and paste into the live chat the link to this uh repository okay so if you want to check out this this package there's the link right there also let me give you a link to the documentation so you can check that out as well the second link is the documentation and then we'll go i'll show you the algolia dashboard and what's going on over there in just a minute all right so all of this is now loaded and i'm going to try to do just something really basic first to make sure everything works we're definitely i'm going to have to set up some api keys before it will work with the data that i brought in so let's get that running and i need to i'm just going to copy and paste the basic getting started code so you'll see it in a second when i paste it in here and let's see let's just do this on the search page so we already have a search page but what i'd like to do here is i guess add this search in hmm let's get rid of you know let's not get rid of anything for right now let's just add this in and then we know we'll probably end up getting rid of most of this but for now i just want a page where we can view what's happening so right here in this grid where we have our original search whoa and i tried to copy everything in there and that was that was a bad move okay let me do this a better way okay so i'm just gonna copy this component into in here oops and i don't even need this okay so we have this instant search component and we're going to pass in the index name and the search client so i don't have an index called best buy i'm going to have to figure out where my index i do believe i have an index called faculty or something like that uh let's see yeah wp post faculty so let's use that okay so i'm gonna this index um contains all of the data we have on faculty so all of our faculty profiles uh this one's kind of cool because we should also be able to pull images since we have featured images so hopefully we can get that working and then our search results will contain little thumbnail images as well which is kind of it looks kind of cool looks fancy right um now our search client we need to uh pass in some data for that and i'm gonna need to probably put that in a dot end file so i don't put all of my api keys out there let me see what i need i may need search clan index settings components to your app all right um if you're following along let me you know let me bring some of this over so you can see what i'm looking at so here's oops not that or am i looking okay here we go so here's the um documentation and then this is the readme for the github page so i'm right here i've just been copying and pasting some of this over and let me grab this while i'm here and i while i remember we'll just pop this down here okay i'll go with this um and then we need to do we need to bring this in and we can put this i guess wherever let's just put it right here it'll be easier less less scrolling around um so i'm not sure what values need to be here so that's what we need to look up so let's just check here in the documentation see if we can find it hmm okay it looks like this one is it's a little bit different huh all right let me know if you if you are seeing what i'm seeing here it looks like the instructions are different here and here i wonder let's see when the last time the readme was updated readme was updated a month ago so i'd say that's that's pretty new we're looking at i don't know what version this is okay i'm gonna check the chat too uh just to see if if you all notice something um api id and key okay uh hardship from the live chat is saying the one on github is old is that use the docs okay cool um okay and michael creole was saying the app id is latency the api key and the index name okay cool so actually this shouldn't be a problem for me to put this uh in here because it's not my secret api key right so uh algolia uh can be used clientside so like it it should be fine uh in terms of your your api will be fine right nobody's going to get access to be able to change anything on your api they maybe could pull data from your api which in my opinion is fine right because this is all information we want the public to have so uh why not give it to them all right so let's do that let me go to on my other screen i am going to go to my dashboard just to grab my api keys actually yeah let me show you the dashboard because the uh the secret api key is um is hidden right so nobody can see that anyway so i'm okay with that so this is the algolia dashboard we've gone to api keys and this is our application id i'm going to copy that and let's put it uh actually let's let's go with what the doc said um actually the docs don't even have me using algolia search so maybe i don't need that all right so let's let's go with what they say here let's get rid of this and get rid of this and scroll down there we go okay so we're not gonna have search client i'm gonna paste this we already have index name so let's get rid of that now we can throw in our app id oops our app id and our api key okay let's save that and let's see oh harshit says uh it's feeling too sleepy today see you horseshit i know it's really late where you're at thank you so much for uh for joining us and for helping out okay so hopefully everything else is okay i know i kind of switched instructions there in the middle we could probably get rid of i'm not gonna do it right now we can clean it up later but we may not need that algolia search package that i loaded so maybe i'll get rid of that in a little bit but first let's just see if if this is working uh let's see all right so it says use widgets here which it looks like we've already put in yeah we put in a search box and it hits so let's see if anything shows up uh you all may already know you may be going to that page already so i'm gonna go to search and see hmm nothing showing up here yes so it looks like nothing is rendering let me i want to inspect this and just see if anything is there see what's going on inspect oh it's popping up on my other screen let's see so it should be hmm yeah that's weird all right let's insert search box it's all right let's go back to the uh documentation i feel like i can't talk today i keep like searching for the words i'm pretty tired i was up before 5 a.m today it was actually exciting so there's a conference in russia a javascript conference called uh holy js and it's held i think twice a year once in moscow and once i can't remember the other location uh but i got uh i guess kind of interviewed to be a speaker at the one in moscow at the end of november so i had to do the interview at a time that was convenient in moscow time so it was 1 p.m in moscow when i did the interview but it was 6 00 am where i'm at so i wanted to make sure i got up early and was prepared so i may be speaking about how we built this app at a conference in russia in november i really hope i get to go uh because i've never been out of the country um oh i am gonna go to germany though for the um for uh the doc fest uh conference so that'll be cool so i may go from being 30 i'll be 33 in october so i'll go from being 33 years old never leave in the country to go into two foreign countries in november maybe that'll be fun all right let's see what our widgets are okay so search box that's good we did that right search box okay and then all right let's see about styling the widgets maybe i don't i mean it just it seems like i should see something without the styling right anything hmm maybe i'll i'm going to get rid of hits because i don't really know what that does right now and i'd rather keep it simple just you know if we're just trying to make this work so let's get rid of that and let's also get rid of see i don't want to try to i don't want to get rid of too much and then have let's just move this somewhere uh my fear is that i start removing this stuff and then it causes errors and then i have to try to go back and see it we're going to take up half the stream just removing things so uh let's see let's just throw something in here put a little further down the page maybe we'll have better luck if it's showing up yay look we got something so right here we have a search whoops i accidentally clicked on a link okay so we have a search here uh let's see what happens um uh let's see if we can find some uh education faculty members search okay nothing happened i'm gonna check the console i have it open another screen and it looks like we're getting an error hmm all right let me show you the air we're getting okay oh it's not here let me make this bigger okay okay so it failed failed loading post so it looks like it was trying to get something and failed and we got some errors here which tell you truth i'm not 100 sure this is just from algolia i i suspect it is but i'm trying to see i don't see anything that says for sure that it's coming from there so i guess we'll try um so it's trying to make a call let's see what's happening here's all our algolia queries and we can see let's let's make this large so we can kind of see what's happening um here's the results that we get um from the index post faculty and it looks like yeah we're getting we're getting data right so we we have here um dr alex plato i just saw him earlier today he's a good guy um he's also a philosophy professor and he has the best name for a philosophy professor okay so we we actually did get the data i'm just not exactly sure why what happened here okay so we got the data it's just not displayed let's look at our console again so it failed no that's not it there we go okay so it looks like it failed up here but it actually worked down here so maybe let's just get rid of everything uh restart it and then see what's happening if i can find here we are okay um let's just try it again we'll hit search again um let me refresh and then we'll do a search all right actually let me check first okay looks like we're getting whatever errors we just got before may not even be due to algolia let's go i'm gonna search again and see what happens interesting okay so it seems like we fail first and then it works um but in any case nothing is actually being displayed so let's go back to our documentation in about three minutes i'm going to go back and answer some things in the live chat harshit says you need hits component to display data thanks harshit i guess that component i just deleted was more important than i thought so let's throw that back in there we'll put it down under the search box the hits component and we'll go up here and make sure we import hits component hardship i thought you're going to sleep but you came back to save the day thank you okay oops let's hey look at this we we have it it looks not great but we have it cool so the data's here um look it's a live search so i just type biology let me zoom in this is so i just typed in biology and we get the the data uh let's type in i don't know see if we have anybody named joe no no jojo's there we go we do have some josephs though that that works um cool all right so next step then we need to make this look good we it's working obviously uh so that's important right it it's it's on the site we're getting the data it works here's the next steps because the timer's about to go off so i'm going to do these next steps just so we know where to pick off all right um not only do we need to make it look good which is definitely important but we've only searched for faculty right i have a lot of other things i want to search for so right now every post type is an individual index in algolia so we need to figure out how do you search multiple indices with algolia uh michael says that's fast yeah it's insanely fast it's so much faster than what we built so it's definitely it's better in many ways um so we need to probably the first thing we should do is make sure we have all the data in order so let's figure out how to search multiple indices then once we see what all the data is going to be like then we can figure out how we're going to display it first thing we'll do though is uh before we try to make our own solution we'll see what solution comes prepackaged with algolia i think that styling section that i skipped over is probably going to come in handy here so that's what we'll look for if we like how algolia styles it then maybe we'll do it like that hopefully maybe it'll work right off the bat maybe some minimal styling changes and then we can have this thing live like before i leave today which would be awesome okay short break i'm gonna go to the live chat i'm scrolling all the way up to the top i'm gonna answer as many questions as i can uh let's see just a lot of people saying hello so i'm not gonna read out all the individual hellos but i am reading them so i know that you said hi and i'm saying hi back uh mauro says uh if possible use test driven development i know i know i i need to be better with using tests and um i'm just always busy and i don't make it a priority realistically i mean that's that's the truth if if i made it a priority i would probably do it um but it's so tempting to just you know get code written without worrying about tests uh so i need to do a better job at that and um feel free to call me out on that if you all see me doing it too uh maybe i ought to take a course on um tests writing tests uh and part of the reason why i don't do it is because i just don't feel confident in my skills at it so that might be a good idea um karma says you're doing an amazing job don't listen to the negative feedback thank you i appreciate that i appreciate it i mean i sometimes there's some truth in the negative feedback so i'm just i'm trying to i'm trying to read it hear it you know and and see like what what is the truth to it um so like some of the feedback about not actually showing any not giving any indication that this is a catholic university you know the way that people were saying it was kind of mean but the truth was yeah actually i mean the previous website it was really obvious in this website it wasn't so the truth was hey maybe i wouldn't include some type of image that would show that so i mean it it's true but it you know when you get so much of that uh it does just kind of wear you down like even if i'm trying to to ignore it you know it still gets it's in there you know it's in your brain lorehan says uh uh a word i can't say uh to the haters no worries you're doing a majestic job oh i love that i'm a majestic job thank you i appreciate that morrow says algolia uses elasticsearch in the background it just makes it easy to implement oh awesome that's really cool i did not realize that um euro says you're looking bad don't take it so close to your heart oh well thank you i i appreciate the sentiment that stinks that i'm looking bad but like realistically my my eyes were probably red like i'm i was up super early uh let's see morrow says algolia is better for just front end devs if you're a full stack you can use elasticsearch so you have more control over the search okay good to know good to know like i said maybe i'll check it out at some point and use it on a future project or work it into this project seems like something maybe i'd i'd need to research a little bit more to get right though uh tripp says do you enjoy your job uh not are you happy with it but do you enjoy it i i really i do enjoy my job i mean there are always parts of a job that you don't enjoy so um uh sometimes like the the attitude of people that i work with not necessarily in my own department but like in the the larger organization um is frustrating um so i don't necessarily enjoy that part of my job uh but i do enjoy what i do i enjoy building um websites apps uh making them look nice making them fast and through that helping people to get information or do their jobs you know better uh than they did before i mean i think that's really cool um that's that's pretty awesome so i definitely enjoy that trip says as much as you did when you started coding honestly i think i enjoy what i do now more than i did when i started because i'm better at it now before there was just so much i had to think about everything everything was hard right there was so much that i didn't know and uh so much that i was like i don't know if i can do that now uh i know i'm more confident in the things that i know and i'm okay with the things that i don't know right i realize that i can't be an expert at everything so i've just been able to let go and not worry that i'm not an expert at everything and just say you know what like i'm i'm gonna do what i know how to do i'm gonna try to learn as much as i can but at the end of the day like i'm gonna try to produce something awesome you know no matter what technology end up using or whatever like um so i i like that uh i don't know i think it can be like that with everything when you first start something it's it's fun because it's new right but then you get into this area where like you start to realize um how bad you are at it because you're new and then it's not as fun because you see other people doing awesome stuff and you can't do that yet so once you get past that and i i think i'm i'm past that to a certain extent right there's still a ton of cool stuff i want to be able to do but i can't yet uh but i can do a lot so now it's it's fun you know i know okay if somebody asked me to do this thing i know i got this right now it's not a matter of can i do it it's well like how am i gonna do it how fast can i make it how nice can i make it look um what new tech can i use and learn while i'm doing this and that's just that's fun it's fun for me um and the added thing of being able to see you all in the live stream is just like this whole another level of just coolness to the to what i do that uh was is just unexpected and really amazing so um that's a really good question that made me think but i i i like that i like that question okay definitely didn't get through all the questions i'm gonna start up my pomodoro timer again and let's see cool hershey just gave me the algolia css awesome so let's go over and throw this css in our head there we go so we have our layout here and let's grab harsha put in that css but i want to just you know what i'm i'm just don't feel like actually typing out a link tag so i'm going to grab this uh let's see i think this is what horseshit does instances themes oh maybe this is different actually this is different i wonder i'm going to grab these because they're already there reset this all right we'll try the reset one first what is the difference okay all right let's they recommend using the reset so let me grab this one and we'll paste this in so we have this little head component and that lets us throw in things like link tags right so we already have this link tag of our page.css and which page.css gets used on almost everything so might not be a bad idea to just make that global i'd have to make sure okay let's see what we have now hmm okay looks like maybe didn't do anything where's my css okay that came in why did not do anything reset is basic algolia is more stylish okay so let's go with the more stylish one okay let's go back here and see let's see what the algolia one is where's my whoops gotta close that tag whoops keep going the wrong way okay all right oh yeah that's definitely uh different here okay cool so now we're getting this still like we're getting a lot of um a lot of this so we probably need to say to indicate somehow exactly what data we want to display because a lot of this is is completely irrelevant but this is pretty cool i mean this is not it's not exactly the style that we use for the for the website so i would be okay with adding it like in here with this type of styling temporarily just to get a good search in there because the functionality is important uh to get in there right away but and then maybe going back and redoing it so that it matches our material design style but this is good enough i think it could work uh definitely need to figure out oh you know what i just said at the last end of the last pomodoro session that we were gonna get all our data before we started styling and i completely forgot okay well we reversed reverse that and let's see sorry my boss just sent me a question um okay so up to this point it's been mostly me entering data and some student workers and i haven't gone through the process yet of uh really teaching anybody else how to enter data so it's a little bit crazy for me because every time some of these change like i get these questions so um all right let's check our documentation and figure out how to get uh search multiple uh indices right is that how you do it and it's not indexes right it's indices i don't know i think it's indices okay let's see if it says it um parameters hmm okay charbel says sometimes it is indexes all right let's go to the dashboard and see what it says all right algolia uses the term indices so i guess we'll just use indices for now and all right there we go multiindex why didn't i see that there we go you can use multiple index components each index component takes one prop okay all right let's check out both examples so it looks like there's there's two different ways to do it um not that one uh let's go to source and check out app okay so they have instant search and they have one index there and then underneath hits they use index oh and then results in the second database all right let's just copy and paste this and see how it looks see if this is what kind of what we're going for let's import index first and then we'll use it down here whoops down here so under hits um sorry i did my boss messaged me again so let's put in a real index name let's go to our dashboard and see um faculty i thought i had more than this oh well um could go with campus security because i i think that's all those those all have the data that they need so we'll go with that so jesus is that what it was oh it's hyphenated there we go okay all right oh okay all right so this will put them they'll be displayed but they'll just be displayed below interesting okay all right let's see we need i'm just not sure about that i mean i i just don't know about it it works but i'm not i'm not sure that that's the best thing hmm let's look at the other option so what is this react instant search multiindex it seems a lot more complicated but maybe it'll give us what we want um mad touch this says my phone is tripping i'll catch you later see ya thanks for watching all right um i'm just telling you 12 minutes okay let's try to get this other example working let's see we may need to put this yeah you know what let's just grab this whole component let's make a new component and we'll we'll do this or how about this let's just get rid of this entire search page and pop this in here and call it search no okay and react auto suggest i guess i have to do this um yarn and all right so we're getting react auto suggest and uh api keys i got to put my api key in again it's so convenient when they have that little button that copies automatically i mean it seems like something like i don't need this you know but really it's so helpful and what did we have uh wpp post faculty and then campus and let's go with news cool let's see carousel react instant search connectors hmm uh let's check out the package json from this example make sure we have everything react on react instant search i'll just suggest uh looks like we have all the packages michael was shocked that i just deleted everything all right why is this not working what the heck it should be react instant surge connectors all right let's go back to the documentation maybe you need to use the autocomplete connectors all right so let's see what it says about this let's see all right let's copy and paste this and just search for it and see what comes up okay when you want to display a widget using another library like material ui hey cool i do want to um what are connectors how to use them hmm okay when i when i first installed this i installed react instant search dom and not react instant search right let's check our package json yep okay here's we need to do let's go yarn i don't know what the command is let's try to remove let's double check and make sure i don't need this thumb thing okay cool we removed it all right also while we're at it let's remove algolia search you're going to go your search then uh we can install yarn or we could we could do yarn what is it called instant react instant search all right so as horseshit mentioned earlier the for whatever reason the instructions in the readme were out of date so we started with those instructions and then we moved over to the other ones which were newer unfortunately it was actually different packages so hopefully now things will work so let's go back and see yay all right look how beautiful this page is all right let's let's see um we want to say see if we have computer computer science nothing what is happening we expect i can't see anything why is this this box all right yeah what is going on can't read property trump undefined all right looks like some weirdness is happening finish loading posts here all right we're getting stuff right let's see who we got from here there we got these queries results faculty yeah yeah we got who is this yeah dr christina safranski she's a very nice woman talked to her last week um all right so for whatever reason we're having some issues getting this rendered but it looks like it works though it's just um it's not so we're getting the data that works that's important let's see where i've gone wrong hey maybe i'll look at the error message that that seems like a good idea okay uncle type can i read property trimble undefined auto suggest js41 it's just 77. all right let's check this out 77 ought to suggest okay you know what probably one of these props i passed in is not working right with the data that we actually have all right so those look good all right so see what these are doing it's value stage search for product placeholder section hit section index all right my timer went off let's do another break and i'm gonna scroll up and try to figure out where i left off so we can answer more questions and probably do another pomodoro session after this figure out what's going on just it feels like we're close you know just have to sort out what's going on there with all those props uh might not be a bad idea to just go to the um uh documentation and figure out what those props actually do uh massoud says i want to learn computer software coding system uh awesome well hopefully you'll be able to learn something from my my streams feel free to ask any questions what's up dude says hey you future bald guy it said blad guy but i'm assuming bald guy i hope i don't go bald but i mean it could happen am i kind of like my hair uh aditya says hey you're doing a really good great job please keep it up thank you i appreciate it divya says today i had a react redux interview i was supposed to uh to make an app which renders data from their bitcoin api and it made me so confused because i made a fetch data action with axios uh get request oh well i mean what happened did you end up being able to do it i mean how did it go uh mit plus says thank you for your awesome informative answers you're welcome thanks for watching uh hardship says are you gonna use react instant search yep actually that was probably really early on before i said i was gonna use it uh let's see phoenix says today i successfully created my blog site using gatsby it was previously plain html and javascript it's a great tool made a few uh mistakes they cost a couple of hours but i learned oh that's awesome congratulations uh how many says uh amazing progress on the website since last time i saw a great work oh thank you i appreciate it um albert asks what css library i'm using it's called material ui uh mamo'd gave me a little um winking kissy face with a heart emoji so thank you carlos says hi jesse hello everyone good to be able to watch live again haven't been able to watch live these days back awesome well i'm glad that you are able to watch live it's good to see you john says i guess i missed a bunch at the point you came in not too much i guess carlos says jesse maybe you can come to switzerland would be great that would be so awesome so all right so anybody that uh may at some point ever want to like hang out with me or get a cup of coffee or whatever um if you're ever near pittsburgh let me know because i'm not that far from pittsburgh and i would drive up there and hang out but if there's a tech conference near you let me know like in enough time that i can try to apply to speak there and then i'll go or if it's in the united states my employer would may pay for me to go so that would also be okay if it's outside the united states i doubt they'll pay for me but if i be if i was a speaker the conference would probably pay for me to go and then i'd be more than happy to come hang out uh so i try to stay up to date on the conferences but there's so many of them it's just it's hard to keep track of all of them and i really like going to conferences and meeting people and speaking let's see let's see john says nice opportunity think of me on your travels since you share your birthday with me oh really we share a birthday no way so my birthday is october 29th so uh if anybody has lots of money laying around and wants to buy me something i'll send you a link to my amazon wishlist and no i'm just i'm just messing around uh but um if you want to wish me happy birthday that'd be cool let's see i mean you don't have to right now but like in october turbo asked if i've ever been to an o'reilly conference i have not but i'm really interested in it they seem like huge like cool conferences so um definitely would be be interested in going they aren't they they're they're kind of expensive i can't i don't want to say for sure but i like vaguely remember that those conferences were a little bit more expensive than the conferences i usually go to okay my timer went off again so i'm gonna i'm just kind of scanning through to see where the next question is so i can start there next time okay 235 i'm gonna write down this question or that time stamp oh my goodness i just looked at my phone i don't think i've ever had this many notifications let me see i wonder if y'all can see that like that's all the notifications across the bottom there i so many all right i don't know what's happening it's lots of news stories and youtube notifications all right we're gonna do one more pomodoro session try to get this working if i can't get it in one more session then i'll just read the rest of the questions and we'll end it and i'll work on it later on hopefully and um i got until five so at five the university's having this this like um oktoberfest thing so we have a campus in austria in gaming and uh so they call it garming fest but it's basically like an oktoberfest thing and that's at five and my kids are coming my wife's coming so i gotta finish by then oops my boss just sent me this to show me that the title hmm okay so that is actually a big deal i don't know if you can see because it's small but there's no title tag on these pages so that's important for search engine optimization also there's no indicator that of what this page actually is so the url you can see it's the theology faculty but it'd be cool to have a title on the page which is already on my list anyway but it's it's gonna move higher up on my list now that my boss said to do it so i just told my boss that i'm gonna finish the search thing first and then i will move on to that um so i think that that will be good uh let's see where do we leave off oh the props so we're getting an error about okay so the error happened let's see if we can get a better filter render under suggestions all right just kind of wanted to check out that error message see if we can get a hint of exactly where it was render suggestion it looks like it's the suggestions part tag name um all right so let's read about this render suggestion prop first and see if we can figure it out um where are we at autocomplete that's the autocomplete component right yeah let's see if we can find that then so let's see did anything come up when i search for that connect autocomplete let's see there that does not look like what i'm looking for all right let's see what this does hmm i just want i just want to know what these props do right it's not hmm i actually named all right so it seems like let me read this error message again so it's trying to trim a property that is undefined i'm assuming then that it's that hit property that's undefined so we're passing in a string of name and a string of marks so that should be fine it should be defined the only thing that potentially could be undefined is hit so we're passing in render is it render suggestion oh that's just render suggestion period get suggestions oh you know we need to go up to suggestions fetch my suggestions clearly requested justin's value let's figure out where all this stuff is getting passed around okay so that's supposed to return hit name maybe maybe name isn't a value so i mean hit should work right but if it's trying to get name let's let's see our data let's go back to our network and see what we're getting so a result and we have hits right so each hit is going to be here so we have hits and we have name we don't right no we don't have name so what do we want to use so this is supposed to be git suggestion value now we don't really want name we want i'm assuming that name would be what's actually displayed so let's see i guess we want title post title so a1 is for this particular hit it's just going to go ahead it's in a particular head let's see if we can just do a hit dot uh post title and see if that'll work okay just kind of scanning through to see if there's anything else that we might need to change okay and there should be a title what did i call that post yeah there should be a post title for every piece of data that we pull in since we're dealing with with all posts uh i'm gonna refresh this and let's go back to the console see what we're getting window id okay that's fine um so we're gonna go see we're getting okay uh we're not getting that error anymore that's good uh we're still not displaying anything we're not displaying anything so let's let's inspect just to see if if it's just um yeah nothing's coming up ah that says post underscore title oh is that it was it did i put the wrong thing in uh good good catch on that let's double check that it's it is post underscore title awesome i'm so glad you saw that who was that uh swag swaga caught the post underscore title and that's probably our issue i'm really glad you caught that because it may have taken me forever to figure it out all right let's see if we get something now no let me refresh manually just double check and make sure okay still not let's see if we're getting any errors though okay no errors oops not on the console all right no errors which is good let's see if we can do that and yeah i was wondering if we can make an error by typing in some gibberish but still no errors so that's good okay let's see render section title let's check out where that's at render render section title all right actually that's not it we want not the section we want the suggestion hmm and let's say instead of the hit let's let's see if we can get the title to render here i'm not really sure what yeah i'm there's got to be some documentation for this that i'm missing that explains more about what what this does failed prop type string supply it's a highlighter expected okay so it does expect an object not a string so let's bring it back down the head okay oh okay that's a great idea let's log this we're gonna console log hit just to see what we're getting and that was destroyer of worlds says log the object great idea when all else fails console log to the rescue i'm just i'm going to do that to um just to clear the console all right let's see what we get whoa all right up here okay so this is what we get when we get uh hits so it should be hit dot and this post title would give us the title okay um maybe wasn't the same name before maybe it's looking for the attribute and it's going to highlight that so maybe what we need to do is say maybe it's going to use this value for the search well it's worth a try we'll figure it out in a second yes that was it okay cool yeah who needs documentation trial and error right all right cool so all right so that's that's what we need basically it will show uh whatever we put in here tag name i don't know what this tag name thing is um let's try to give it another value uh let's give it this post type value and see what happens okay so i don't know what that is it didn't do anything visually let's see if it did anything down here oh post type what's bio highlighted it's supposed to be highlighted and it's not interesting hmm let's see all right this class is supposed to be highlighting it but it looks like i don't know maybe we're missing some styles but i still can't find what happened yeah i don't know what this uh tag name is for but at least we know we can get that uh displayed which is cool okay viple says the name that you are giving to tag name is becoming the tag name um oh okay no it's not okay yeah so the the post type should be campus security but if we search that's not actually listed anywhere on the page kept here but this is not it has extra stuff there so that's not it so i'm not exactly sure what this is doing right now all right but this is this is good um this at least lets us know like what it's working we can get the data back and we can display the data on the page right so this is good news and what we'll be able to do then let's see the data we have make sure we have the the proper data okay so what we need is okay so we definitely need the title and content or i should say we don't we don't necessarily need to show the content i guess we just need to make sure that i get searched if we have an image it'll be cool to show the thumbnail image the only piece of data that we're really that we're missing that's very important is we have a special field called uh what's it called called search url and that was added with a wordpress plugin called advanced custom fields i need to create a plugin to be able uh to have algolia through the algolia wordpress plugin be able to get the data that's in advanced custom fields so i can't complete this until i do that so that's definitely going to be i mean that's a crucial step that has to be done and it would also be good to find some documentation for what what i can do with this component this uh autocompletes or is it auto suggests was i searching for the wrong thing the whole time i was hmm where is auto suggest from so hmm okay so this is why i couldn't find documentation i think this is a completely separate thing okay there we go cool look at this we got all the props right nice now we can see what this is all right so suggestion value implemented to teach auto suggests what should be the input value when suggestion is clicked okay render suggestion okay so in render suggestion we could do whatever we want all right so that's that's pretty cool um input props pass through arbitrary props to the input must sustain at least value not change okay go to everything just it's just highlighted we'll be called every time the highlighting session changes should render suggestions all these other suggestions all right there's all kind of cool stuff i'm not going to read through all this right now on the stream that will be boring for you all but this is really cool i'm gonna paste this in the live chat and that way if you all want to check that out you can but this seems really cool like uh we could definitely do a lot with it and customize let's see render suggestions okay so we're getting i wondered where we were bringing in highlight we're pulling in highlight from instant search all right so if we want to know what's going on with highlight we need to look that up in the instant search documentation there we go all right we use the mark tag to highlight this tag is specifically made for highlighting pieces of text the default tag is em mostly for legacy okay so this is the actual html tag that gets used then interesting let's see what that looks we should be able to see that now now that i know what i'm looking for yay look at that so post it's literally taking the word post type and putting it there that makes sense now so we could throw in mark and see what that looks like okay now we can see the highlighting is working that makes a lot of sense all right cool so highlight yes so this just says what we want to highlight create a custom hit widget we create a custom widget for the results oh okay interesting hmm so i wonder if we could do something like i wonder if this will work if we could do this so i started using a different keyboard at home so my typing is like all over the place i think because of this um let's see if we can get content to show up here i want to see if i can put both of them together if it'll work yes check that out nice so oops didn't mean to click on that nice let's just throw in a an ugly br in here for a second what it didn't work all right anyway that's really cool so that's awesome alright anyway my timer went off so for now i think we made a lot of good progress not ready to go live with it just yet but it came really far it's it's nice so let me go back to the chat right where i left off at i'm gonna answer all your questions okay first i need to take a drink of this gfuel because i'm tired i haven't said this in a while but if anybody from gfuel is watching uh i would definitely allow you to have the honor of me sponsoring you just if you give me some free g fuel i would shout it out on the show just a suggestion started out there or if you're a rival company 2g fuel i would be interested in switching if i could get free stuff that has caffeine in it all right i'm sorry i lost my place i'm just stalling okay here's my it's a question okay 12 35 what am i listening to i'm like distracted by this atlantis morissette song that's playing right now on my headphones i had 90s music playing it says how does it get all that data does it send a get request so we're talking about algolia does it send a gate request per letter you type to algolia which does what amounts uh to magic and then sends back a response um um let's see uh let's see what it does uh we can go let's move the console back in so we can see it at the same time what is that okay so we'll we'll keep the console here and let's see what's happening yeah it looks like we're getting data back on every on every click we can look at the network um at the xhr request and see should we go actually it's hard to see there's too many all right but i mean that's a lot of requests so i'm well yeah i'm guessing on every single time we type i have no idea how it does it that fast uh but that's that's pretty cool we can check our dashboard and see i wonder if it'll tell us like the activity 24 minutes wow yeah so in the last 20 last 24 hours we had 455 queries uh 90 of queries under 15 milliseconds wow that's cool let's see okay so there's a conversation going on a little side conversation about this all stem from birthdays and age and keto and weight loss so it's has i've seen so mad that's just saying i've seen a couple of people do the snake keto diet and drop a billion pounds quick i'm not a huge cake fan but sweet coffee is my weakness so i just brought that up because uh i i did earlier in the year i did like kind of a really strict diet and i wasn't trying to do keto but it ended up being kind of like a keto diet and i did i lost like 15 pounds uh and it it was like somewhat quickly so definitely worked but i it's funny because part of the thing that i did have to give up was like putting a lot of stuff in my coffee so i got in the habit of just drinking black coffee because it's you know almost no calories so you just drink black coffee all day caffeine's like kind of an appetite suppressant and you feel kind of full so anyway just just reminded me i'm back on a diet but it's way more relaxed at this point john hanson says uh it is fast it's going round trip to google where pista is oh actually so we're not going around trips so this may explain a little bit about why this is fast so we have a round trip not back to wordpress but what we've done is we've exported as json all of the data in wordpress and it's just sits here in you know on algolia servers or whatever so it just goes to there it grabs that data and comes back so i think that helps explain some of the speed that it doesn't have to go through wordpress through php into my sequel and then back out which uh you know that saves a lot of time see nikki says uh front end masters is free right now can't follow any lessons there now sadly but i recommend to check it out oh cool all right so everybody uh front end masters is free right now so check it out i can't i don't remember if i've ever done one of their courses or not but i've heard good things about them so if you're looking for a course um you know definitely check that out michael says earlier we were talking about how i i did get a lot of complaints i don't know about a lot but um very um intense complaints about the new website not um showing the university as being really catholic so like here's the new site um and michael says isn't the name franciscan kind of a giveaway that is catholic yeah i mean i i think there's a good argument to be made that the the university uh already has enough catholic stuff associated with it that we're not really at risk of losing that just because we uh don't explicitly talk about it on the homepage like our logo has a cross in it um we do have the name franciscan right so i mean there's uh there's something to be said for that but uh it wasn't an unreasonable suggestion that maybe we put something a little bit more overtly uh catholic you know on the website so um so since i wasn't really opposed to the idea you know i i put it there but i i mean i think based on the data that we have we we do have um a problem with the the perception that our academic programs aren't as good as academic programs from other schools okay so i don't know that that's true but that's the perception that we got back from from some uh surveys and stuff so that's what we want to try to showcase what we do have so people realize what that we have a lot of good stuff going on here academically as well char bill says ask for a quick tutorial on ngrok i don't really know much about ngrok other than it works it's a command line tool uh you just start running a server locally and then you put in you just run a command basically saying ngrok here's where my server is port 3000 you hit enter and it it gives you these urls and it does everything else so um they have free plans that are pretty limited uh incontrivable who built ngrok was extremely generous and allows us to basically have an unlimited free plan for free codecamp live streams otherwise if you want to be able to have a lot of users at the same time a lot of people accessing your url you do need to have uh you know a paid plan i think it's a monthly thing but that's pretty much it i mean in terms of like setup and what you need to do it's you know really easy there's like a few steps to set it up but once you do it like you're good it's set up forever on that computer all right i'm trying to find a question there's a lot of like back and forth talk between everybody in the live chat which is awesome but if anybody's interested you can read the the live chat when you're watching this later on but i'm not going to read it all out uh let's see uh rithik says what is the name of the software visual basic uh sorry if it sound weird but i don't know it's um visual studio code i think you're referring to the code editor visual studio code thanks that dutchess says uh there's nothing wrong with bald for guys anyway earlier somebody said that i i think they were trying to say that i was gonna go bald which may be true uh and i said i didn't want to go bald matt duchess says there's nothing wrong with bald well i thank you i appreciate it i actually used to shave my head um it was especially nice like during the summer time it's nice and cool uh you can wear a hat you don't mess up your hair like you're basically your hair never get gets messed up because you don't have any so it wouldn't be like completely weird but i like the option of having hair oh nikki says so nikki i think correct me if i'm wrong but i think you're talking about this said you had no idea at first what the this number was in the top until you saw it was a tell link as did anybody else have that impression is it obvious that this is a phone number or not if it's not obvious what could i do that would look nice that would make it more obvious that this is a phone number because i i mean i obviously knew it's a phone number because i put it in there but i don't know how it appears to other people so let let me know um do you think this is obvious enough or not if not what should i do uh julio says try this cool new extension for live sessions vs live stream vs code that's that is really awesome i've heard of that i haven't had a chance to use it yet but i i would love to um to use it at some point eva says you should bind your class methods or use arrow functions uh like methods of class um yeah i wonder at that point in the stream i wonder if i had already i was copying and pasting a lot of code so that may have been stuff i copy and paste it in um if not if it was stuff i had already coded then let me know because i if i can improve it i definitely want to so anyway thank you for mentioning that ava let's see dextre of world says are you using sass or style components uh no we're using what are we we're using a variety of we're not using either one of those we're using like plain css inline css i don't even know what's it called css and js is that what's called when we do the um css as a javascript object so we have a variety of methods unfortunately i don't have sas uh set up so but i normally do prefer to use sas i've used style components a little bit before in another project and i think i i think they would be cool if i knew more about them but i'm not comfortable enough with them yet to really be good with them nikki says was that atlantis morrissette song called ironic cause it's like rain incomprehensible gibberish no it wasn't ironic what was the one what's it called let me check it was uh you oughta know that was what it was called it's actually kind of like hardcore atlantis moreso was pretty hardcore back in the day that was from the jagged little pill album john hanson says i'm doing keto drop 20 pounds awesome congratulations i said i also do intermittent fasting no more afternoon energy crash and better focus than ever workouts are much better too that's awesome that's that's really cool uh codaly says hi there hey how's it going carlos says having been a university psychology professor for 11 years i don't think that overtly showing that the university of catholic is a is a plus um yeah this university is a little bit like um so there's like a small niche of uh universities that attract like um let's say like very devout catholic students and families uh so franciscan university is is one of those one of the leading universities that does that so um the families that send their their kids here kids that come here like basically are looking for a place where um they won't feel like an outsider for being a devout catholic you know um so it is kind of it it is a plus for what we for our target audience so uh and that was what some of the students and some of the professors were worried about was like are we dropping that you know or are we trying to attract you know different students now are we trying so i mean that really it wasn't what we were doing at all in fact we were just unfortunately what we have happened sometimes is a student will really want to come here you know because of the reputation that this is a good place where you can come you don't have to worry about a lot of bad stuff going on but they didn't feel like they get a good academic education in whatever particular field they wanted to go into so they went somewhere else so our attempt the idea was okay well let's let those students know that we also have good academics right so carlos i think you're right for for a large majority of of people out there you know they they would either could care less about the to university being catholic or it might be a negative thing but like i said we have a kind of a unique niche that we're in right now uh carlos says i would go with what you would research or do a blind test showing clickthrough rate with the catholic symbol or without it and see which gives you better clickthrough rate for action actually i do i really want to do um some some tests on different like different images and different things we do and measure clickthrough rates so that's going to be something that i hope to get set up soon so that we can really measure those things so that when people come to me with with ideas or criticisms or complaints i can have this data to show like you know i can see why you feel that way but that's not really what's happening you know and show them i mean also i'd like to know what works you know maybe i'm mistaken maybe they're right you know so i do really want to have that data that's a great idea oh okay um i had asked about the phone number and um several of you are saying put a phone icon in front of it that is a great idea that's a great idea i'm gonna add that to my trello board right now so i got let me bring over my trello board just so y'all can see what i what i have going on here in case you haven't seen it before so like this is the algolia search thing and we put it we just put in three pomodoro sessions so i'm gonna up this to six to say that i've already done six sessions i estimate it would take five but actually this card was just for research so i guess i should do another card for implementation but anyway uh the research part only took me like one pomodoro session before i figured out i definitely want to use this but let's say add okay and i'm gonna it says add phone number add phone icon in front of that bar phone number i'm gonna estimate that that's gonna take me one pomodoro session and then i am going to assign that to myself there we go all right okay okay nikki says i'm not familiar with that format for the telephone number you know what actually this is not really a common format in the united states i just like it for style reasons so i i think that's you're you're not alone and being unfamiliar with that format i think a lot of people might be and i just didn't i didn't even think about it so normally there would be hyphens and maybe even uh you know parentheses so i think i like the the periods but i i agree that's probably confusing so i think i'm going to go with the icon i'm going to keep the periods but i'm going to go with the phone icon that makes it really obvious all right uh swagga says uh nikki that's how most tollfree numbers look minus the periods in between yeah yeah i mean that's yeah the periods are um uh not not really common i don't really know where i picked that up from but i saw it on a site before and i thought that looks that was kind of cool gerald perez says what are you doing um well we're just kind of finishing up doing some question and answer we did some coding earlier um morrow says that okay so a lot of you say add phone icon i appreciate the feedback from you all i think that's a great idea um it looks like gerald is not a fan of uh atlantis uh elena's morris said so i'm telling her early stuff i think is is pretty good i i think it's better her i'm not a huge fan of her later stuff but she was really edgy at first and it was i liked it um nikki says uh the devout catholics seeing the site will immediately link franciscan with well saint francis so it's not needed in my opinion but i get the point i nikki that is a great point like i like i said i'm not going to make a big deal about it or argue because i mean at the end of the day i want to code i want to make things right that are performant and look nice right so content is not even exactly my thing um and unless it starts affecting performance or like really messing up the look of the site and then i want to get involved uh but i i think you are right i think it's an overreaction on the part of the people that were saying it is that uh you know the the people you're right the people who are devout catholics will know that that franciscan university is a catholic school right and they will will understand the reputation and um there's a ton of other information on the rest of the website in our social media on our youtube that will definitely explain that so yeah i think um having i mean what images do you end up having like this one right with the students praying right images like that i think will help to to you know calm you know so people can just calm down and realize like you know we're not we're not trying to take away anything um so you know i think that'll be good you know but at the same time it is it is kind of odd to see that as like hey i'm looking for university so i can get a degree so i can get a job and this is your image here so it's just like um you know it's it's an interesting thing right there there are several um like schools of thought here on campus about like who we are as a university and um i think there's a a good group of people that realize that we're we're a mix of different things right there's all kind of reasons that people come here but then there's some very opposite groups that say like we need to focus on um academics right academics is the main thing and there are other people saying like no we need to focus on on uh our faith and like that's why people want to come here and so yeah there's a huge difference and then even within the academics it's like some people say well we we don't care about making people job ready we're going to learn for the sake of learning you know and there are other people that are saying no like we need we need to have programs that will enable students to like provide for their families and get jobs and things so there's there's just a whole lot of discussion uh so um you know it and something as visible as the front page of the main website becomes the focus of discussion you know because everybody sees it so anyway uh we actually did have data that showed that students really responded positively to like aerial like drone footage and stuff so that's why we threw this in here um carlos says you guys need to do market research for those things yeah that's the thing like we have market research but number one like it's just not not everybody has seen the research right it's not like we publish it everywhere um although there's no reason why we couldn't so not everybody's seen the research and even when people do see them see the research people want to like think how they want to think right it's hard to convince them otherwise so if they already have this opinion that they hold strongly even when you show them the research they come up with all these reasons why it doesn't matter right so um when i'm gonna make when i make decisions i really try to follow the research that way i always have that to fall back on it's like this is not my opinion or at least it's as little about my opinion as i can make it uh and it's more about the numbers it's more about what we see from the research so uh when i was doing redoing this page for the last time i had a pdf of the market research open at the same time and was looking at it all and saying okay this is what we want i also had like the most visited pages on the website from analytics over the past year up saying like this is what people are clicking on so um anyway so i'm with you right there like carlos i'm i'm totally on board with that i think that's the way we need to go uh we need to get data on everything and we need to actually do things based on that data that's not exactly what how things have been done in the past uh here so it just takes a while for people to switch over and and learn to trust the data and not you know their intuition about about things so uh you know it's just gonna take not everybody's gonna gonna change some people are really excited about the change and they're like yes finally other people you know they they resist it so we'll see how it goes i mean my department is pretty far ahead when it comes to this kind of stuff i've been here three years and since day one i've been trying to get data and make decisions based on data so we've come a long way from where we were uh and hopefully it'll get better but anyway i'm getting far afield from actual coding here uh anyway my department is marketing by the way so i'm not like in it or anything like that i'm in marketing so market research and as much data as we can get from that from our interrelate analytics is very important to us uh let's see oh wow i've been streaming for over two hours now okay so it looks like i've gotten through all the questions thank you all so much for uh for watching and uh for all the help uh there's definitely like several times in the stream where i would have been stuck and i you all y'all helped me out so i appreciate uh
