hey everybody its Jesse and uh today we're showing it a lot done and I actually want to try to get through like a whole a whole process usually I just work on random stuff and I don't always get it done so I want to go try to go start to finish and take you through the process of creating a custom post type in WordPress with custom fields populating that with some data getting that data pulling it into a reactor and we're gonna make a template in react to display that data and we want that a user to be able to go to a page and have that page automatically generated with a unique URL so we're gonna need to edit our server j/s file to be able to handle that so I want to get all of that done while I'm streaming so that's a lot of stuff but I've done it I don't want to say a lot but I've done it you know three or four times before you know recently so I think we can get it done I'm gonna check the live chat say hi hey everyone so I apologize in advance if I'm a little weird for this dream because I I only got like five hours of sleep last night so I was up I ended up not being super tired last night so I applied to speak at some conferences which is kind of exciting I've never applied to speak at conferences before so we'll see what happens I don't really know if I if my submissions were even any good because I've never even seen anyone's submission before but hopefully I at least get some good feedback you know even if I get rejected that would be kind of cool if you want to see my um what I submitted to some of the conference's it's available online so check my Twitter I sent out a link last night so that people could actually check out my idea for a talk and then this morning the baby was up really early so anyway that that's why I didn't get sleep but I'm gonna try my best to stay focused I do have one question for you all to start someone asks what my Twitter handle was Jeremy asks it's it's in the description for this show it's just it's Jesse are Weigel so jay esse r w e i GTL and let me I had one problem so I really wanted to get you all a link that you could go to to see all the updates so I started a dev branch that's gonna be like the cutting edge stuff the latest stuff that we're doing for this site and that is going to be updated at our server I don't know if anybody remembers when we set up the load balancing but we actually have three droplets running node and react and we are only a load balancing between two so I never shut down that third droplet because I always thought it would come in handy for testing and today it has come in handy so that's the droplet that I can just give you the IP address for and you all can can check it out now I did get it working but I just tried to update it and for some reason it quit working now here's what I think happened my session timed out when I was used logged into the server and I didn't use usually used p.m. to to start the server but I didn't even set it up I just started it you know with just a regular command just npm run start and I never shut down the server so right now I can't start the new server because port 8080 is already in use so normally I would shut it down by pressing ctrl C right but that doesn't work because at least I don't think it works I can sure you double check but I don't think that's gonna work for me yeah how do you shut down a node server from the command line if it's not actually like the process is not actually running in my command line right now like I'm I can't see it so if anybody knows how to do that let me know and then I can get this up and running and you all can have a place where you can check out all the latest stuff without having to download this repository and run a local server so I I'll figure it out eventually but I just figured maybe somebody is really familiar with node and just knows exactly what command I need okay Patrick did have Patrick had a good comment he asked about the on change event with materialized so okay cool so I've gotten the the command so let's go sudo kill all node is that it which other so anyway yesterday we couldn't I couldn't get this select thing to work and I said that I would let you all know how I ended up getting it to work so let me let me do that now all right cool so that works so if you go to let me find the IP for you I'll paste this IP address in the live chat and it's the IP address is 1 6 2.2 4 3.8 6.67 and maybe if I can remember I'll put it in the shared description so anyway this will show the latest stuff so this will actually show you that this is working now all right so the only thing this is the only thing that actually has a working category right now I'm pretty sure nothing else has been put into categories but that is working I'll show you how I got it working in a second also for some reason these borders on this top one just start coming and going I haven't replaced the borders with hrs yet so I need to do that but I did get this working so I have this little toggle here and this is just changing the state within the component so within the component there's a display content set automatically to false if it's false it displays this when you click it it sets the state to true and displays the Falaise this and this one when you click it it sets the state back to false so let me show you the code for how I got this working and then we'll get started on on what I actually described in the title in the description for this video so within that's material select that's what we have so within material select what I've done is basically just gotten rid of all the materialized stuff so I'm not initializing the materialized I should give some background in case you weren't watching yesterday and you're not sure what I'm talking about I'm using the materialized framework it's a CSS framework it uses some jQuery stuff and changes the Dom so it's not ideal for react but we've made it work so far and this is the only time we've run into an issue where I just couldn't get it to work I was spending way too much time yesterday getting it to work I probably should have given up on it sooner but it just didn't even occur to me during the stream until the very end so what I did normally what materialized does is if you have a select input it goes through all the options and then it creates new Dom nodes for new elements and it creates a new ul and then each option becomes an Li within that ul so that all happens after you know with with jQuery so that's not really registered in react now that wasn't even the main issue so that was one issue but the main issue was that whenever we changed that select input that event wasn't registering for react so when I try to have this on change handler to do something it wouldn't do anything it didn't recognize the change it would actually run it was weird it would run twice on render that was because it would actually render once and run and then it would make an API call to populate all these options and then re render and then we'll run another time but then when I actually tried to change the select input to select one of these options it wouldn't fire off an event so that's that's an issue with materialized and and react so I think that the issue is probably on the side of materialized and how it's done it's not I don't think it's a react issue from what I can understand there were some some pool requests to try to fix that but I don't think that it seems like the maintainer zuv materialized don't see that as a bug and they just recommended using the react materialized framework which is an attempt to make materialized work with react and turn everything into react components so so I don't think there's any chance anytime soon of that being changed so just in case you're trying to use materialized as well you can either go the route that I did or you can try to use react materialize instead or try to do some type of custom fix but I'll show you you know basically what I did is now I'm using just a plain select input I did do some extra styling so I could make it fit in so let me show you I mean obviously this doesn't look like your default select input when you click it this looks like browser default right I can't really do much about this browser default and it'll look slightly different depending on the browser but you know assuming I want to stick with a select input and not try to do something some type of custom list which I don't really want to do it right now it would be okay but it would be a lot of work I think for a slight improvement and I'm running out of time to work on this site so I just changed things so that it mimics the look of this search box okay so and how I accomplished that was with all of this it's really big mostly because of all these vendor prefixes which I think if you put things within the style JSX tag it actually Auto prefixes for you but I had copied this over from a previous project where I had figured out everything I need to do to style this in the materialized fashion so I didn't I didn't try to redo that I just copied it over so it's not hurting anything to have the vendor prefixes in there and it's working so I'm not gonna mess with it and then I just needed to add in this this part at the bottom let me bring make this a bit bigger I think is this is a bit smaller than I normally have it so I had to add in this the reason I couldn't put it right here in the style JSX tag was because of this so it thought I was trying to incorrectly escape something within this string because of the slash so it wouldn't work so if you try to use content and then you know one of these this basically makes that that little try upside down triangle they call it a carrot that's the little code to make that so if you're trying to do something like that it won't work in style of JSX so this code is all on github you can check it out under the dev branch so if you want to kind of look into how I did this place it's not really a lot it just looks like a lot because the vendor prefixes and a lot of it is just trying to override browser default things all right so that's pretty much it I'm gonna check the live stream now see if there's any questions about that before we get started okay we have somebody card carnage I'm not sure how to pronounce the name kar IE KR n IE j carnage I don't know sorry about not know not to pronounce that but anyway says hi everybody I'm looking for a job react job so I guess so hopefully you you can pick up some react knowledge on this stream if anything you can probably pick up some mistakes to avoid when you when you do this my stream is really good at demonstrating the pitfalls and mistakes that can be made and sometimes even how to fix them but anyway I'm not sure that anybody watching now or in the live chat is hiring so I don't know that I can help you but anyway I keep keep us updated on the job search I'd love to hear how it goes okay the will Frank says long time viewer first day hey how's it going thanks for saying hi I realized there's probably a lot of people who watch who never speak in a live chat which is totally cool I'm actually am usually pretty quiet and chats and things myself when I'm watching so I totally understand and maybe you're just doing other things and not a computer yours feel like listening or watching but don't be shy if you can if you can say hi that would be cool because I noticed you know there's always the the analytics shows that there's always way more viewers than people talking in the live chat and today we actually have fewer of yours than we've been having normally so I don't know what happened maybe the topic is not great today it's still a decent amount of years though so I think we have like 40 right now which is I mean that's I'm always amazed that anybody wants to watch me cuz forty or forty three now cool person I see react a Fabian how's it going haha Evo says hi Jesse not James's son hey how's it going that yesterday Evo accidentally called me James in the chat which was just fine that it didn't bother me bill says hey it worked but listening in the background today awesome that's that's cool that's why I imagine that's probably a lot of people may be in the same situation especially if they're in a similar time zone to where I'm at because this is the time when people are normally at work John said is it not always with the more simple coding it saves the day all these things like reactor webpack other complex systems for me at least now is overkill yeah I I agree to some extent that I'll react webpack all that stuff increases the complexity and increases the possibility for bugs so if you don't need to use those things for what you're trying to accomplish you you are probably better off not using them but for a lot even you know if you're trying to learn them there's no reason not to do a small project with it because if if your purpose is not just to produce a product if your purpose is to learn then you know make something simple with react I I actually uh a few weeks ago when I was on vacation I built the free code camp weather app I don't know if you all remember that challenge is kind of early on in free code camp challenges but I built that I rebuild it and react I had built it once just with some jQuery and I did it just simply to get some practice and to learn it definitely doesn't need to be built and react but but anyway to speak to John's point that definitely was the case this time with materialize it was trying to do all this other stuff and beyond what a normal select input does and you know the select input that's been in HTML for for years and years worked fine for this use case so it was definitely the solution and better off hey Zanna says hi hey how's it going glad you can watch Jordan asks how do you hook up WordPress with react okay cool I'm going to show you today how we hook up WordPress with react so I'm not going to explain it right now because we're I'll be able to show it to you we're gonna do it during this this stream and I'll start that in just a minute I just wanted to say hi to everybody and you know at the beginning of the live chat before I get get to the code ego says John if you have this many modules of stuff to keep track of a tool like web pack is a lifesaver react is also really nice and I think that they will become even more prevalent yeah that's true that's a good point you know like if your project is complex it ends up helping to have things like react and webpack like yesterday I showed you all that I think it was yesterday I showed you all that mess that was the the jQuery site that I had made which basically did a lot of the same stuff that this site does but I built it all with jQuery and it was just a bunch of crazy spaghetti code and it's really hard to maintain now I really can't wait until I have the time to rebuild that in react so in that case using something simpler than react which was I would argue that jQuery is probably simpler than react at least it's simpler to learn but that ended up being worse as the project got more complex so I think there ends there's a tipping point in the project of you know where some of these tools actually do end up helping Zanna asks did you debug it Zen are you talking about the the select input thing that was happening so I don't know maybe you might have joined in right after I explained it so sorry if you missed it but basically yeah I did get it working and I just went with a normal select input so I just got rid of the stuff that materialized was glowing and just went with a normal select input everything worked fine and I just did some styling to make it look like it was it fit with the materialize styling all right so think I'm gonna I'm gonna scan through quickly the rest to see on the live chat and then I'm gonna get started okay bill bill said he watched the replays of the last two streams and at one point in yesterday's streams I accidentally showed his project instead of my project and he says it's cool though because it was on github as opensource so yeah sorry about that I mean I'm glad that it's cool and everything but I'll have to be more careful about doublechecking what I show I try to keep everything that shouldn't be shown on my other screens okay so they all go asks about the Auto prefixing the CSS inside the JSX I'm not sure I think the I think if you use next J s the Auto prefixing everything comes builtin so I I don't know I have to check it out I just always assumed it was Auto prefixing I thought I saw that before in my code that it was all in a prefix but now that I really think about it I would have to double check to say 100% for sure so don't take my word for it without doublechecking but I'm pretty sure it does get Auto prefixed as long as it's inside the style da J or the style JSX tags okay okay so Zanna did didn't hear the explanation the beginning so I gave us a slightly longer explanation and I showed the code so Zanna if you if you get a chance later on you can watch like the first 10 minutes of the stream or something the recording and get a longer explanation okay I'll wait Patrick centerlink what's the link Patrick I'll check it out of my sheep okay that's weird okay so this should check this out I'm probably not gonna fix this right now I'll do it later since I want to do something else on the stream but Patrick just sent this so what browser was that that's it on Ubuntu with with chrome okay well that's no good so I'll have to work on that Danny but if anybody else checked this out let me know if you're having anything similar happening obviously like Chrome on a Mac it looks like this it works blown on Ubuntu it looks like this I mean I really want it to work but realistically there's probably no actual user of this site who's like in the target audience that would be using Ubuntu so if that's the only place where this happens I probably won't worry about it just because I don't have a lot of time yet so I gotta worry about you know the other browsers more browser operating system combinations more but yeah I'm gonna have to take a look at that although I really won't have a good way to test it because I don't I don't have Kubuntu and I don't even think you can test that on browser stack off to check I don't think you can test it on Linux let's see okay Patrick just said the same thing that there's not a lot of site people going to the site with Linux okay it's good to know the and I'm definitely going to check it out with some other combinations of operating systems and browsers devices to make sure that there's not similar errors happening elsewhere so thanks for sending that so Oh actually I did want to before I started I wanted to mention a little bit about the net neutrality thing that's happening so especially for those in in the United States right now there's like some the federal government has some stuff going on where basically it could end up being really bad for the internet like things could be blocked like so I wanted to show some of you may have already seen this but there's these videos that are they're really short so I think I'm just going to show this video quickly this net neutrality video which we'll be able to kind of explain things a lot better than I can and let me try to bring this over I think it's just only a few minutes so let me throw this on here yeah oh it's not even it's 33 seconds so okay so anyway that was just a really basic of what's happening so if you're if you're interested and just putting your name out there as being against this then you know check out the the URL which was battle for the Netcom so and today is like the official day I think where a lot of stuff is happening to raise awareness and kind of protest that possibility of the internet being you know way more regulated by companies and different than it than it is now and then it probably should be alright let's see I just want to check the live chat really quick to see what other errors you are getting okay so Windows 10 in chrome is the same issue so okay so Evo says Evo's found the error already which is awesome thank you so much you have a color value of inherit in the CSS rule button for input select area which comes from materialized okay alright so evidently there's something being being applied from materialize the materialized framework that's affecting that so oh so I'll check that out okay let me open post the link to the dev site again for for those either came in a little bit later so I have a 1/3 droplet now that's running the dev branch so I'll try to keep it updated with the latest dev stuff so until I get approval for the changes from the people higher up than they I'm not gonna make them since they're really significant changes for for a lot of pages I'm not I'm not just gonna try to make them live on my own I need to get some approval first so for now they're gonna exist only on this at this IP address and okay cool Evo is gonna open a github issue with an explanation of what's going on with that select input so I'll definitely check that out and actually if anyone is kind of shaky with the JavaScript skills but is really good with their CSS that will probably end up being a CSS only solution that might be good to contribute so otherwise I mean I'm I'm sure it'd only take me a few minutes to figure it out but especially for new people who are trying to get some some more things on the github profile that might be kind of an easy thing to do so enough of this we're gonna work on something totally different so I'm gonna move this off the screen and I'm gonna do this off the screen and what a bunch of stuff off the screen I can keep this on the screen also yesterday one more thing just continuing from yesterday yesterday I had a pool request from Rene which switched over to using preact instead of react and it made things smaller the bundle size for production was smaller a lot smaller so when I tried to use it on this test server I was getting an error I was saying R is not a function so I'm not sure what was going on it worked fine locally but when I tried to actually build it and run it I was getting there so I ended up not merging that pool request I didn't accept it yet I'm not saying I won't accept it but I just need to get it working on the actual server first so so I added I added that to to the actual pool request I added a comment about it so if anybody has any ideas for that you know please you know comment there on that on that pool request on github ok so today what we're gonna do let's start with WordPress first so I'm gonna do I'm gonna start here in our WordPress plugin so you've probably seen this before this is a wordpress plugin that we're using to make a bunch of custom post types so here's what we what we need to do here's the the kind of the end goal for the user the user needs to be able to click on a link that will be like the title of a PDF document right so in the about page we're going to create something to display these links some new section but I don't want them to just link to PDF documents right because that's that's no good for search engine optimization I'm not really sure how screen readers handle that so I'd rather have these PDFs converted into HTML but I also want the PDFs available to download so I'd like a user to be able to go to the about page see a list of the titles of these PDFs click on it when they click it opens up an entirely new page on a react site that has the contents of that PDF in HTML and then also has a button to be able to download the PDF and I want that all to be editable from within WordPress so we're gonna make a custom post type I guess a PDF page post type and it needs to have your normal title and content fields which are there by default but then we're gonna add one custom field that's going to be the URL of the PDF and actually we should probably might want to do the title field should be good I kind of thought maybe we might want to do a separate field for PDF title but I think the title field should be enough that we could pull into use for the link text so that should that's all we need to do on the wordpress side and then we'll come in we'll build the the page that that's going to be populated we'll build out the section that needs to be in the about page and then we'll update our code in our server das file to direct people to the right place and make the right API call to get that data so let me copy so I think you you I've done this before on a stream so I'm just gonna copy this did I get the I don't know if I got the top part so I'm doing it again so I'm going to copy this and paste it now I'm just gonna change all of these and I wanted to say instead what did I say was a PDF PDF page yeah I think that'll I think that'll be obvious to the people who are editing it what I would that is okay so this is how it will display these are all the display names that'll be like in the WordPress admin panel and then these are the names that'll be in the code so let's make PDF all right so now I'm gonna say that oops actually I'm not gonna save it okay copy this let me bring over my WordPress admin panel here so I need to login I just let me bring this over and I need to upgrade to the newest version so I was just waiting to do a backup so I have one of my coworkers purchase a subscription for this backup plugin that we can use on and I think an unlimited amount of site so I'm just waiting to get the info about how to install that because generally you don't want to really do too many updates on a wordpress site without backing it up I've done a lot of updates on small sites without backing up and I've never actually had anything happen but it's a good practice to to do the backups if you can so you can manually you don't need a plugin you can manually do the backups but I don't have like PHP myadmin installed or anything like that so I just I don't really feel like doing the backups from the command line and I'm not even sure I have SSH access to this droplet so let's go actually that I have no idea why that I've keeping this so small we'll make it a bit bigger and I'll increase the size so y'all can see what's going on so I'm gonna go into plugins here and I'm gonna find I passed it up there you see I custom types that's our plugin and I'm gonna edit now if I did have I don't I don't really have any access to this server either FTP access or SSH for some reason the accesses and it isn't working I didn't set this up someone else set it up and so I just never figured out what the issue was so this is why I'm updating the plugin like this normally I wouldn't update like this I would probably probably use FTP and just open the file directly in my editor but this works too so all I've done is just copy and paste of the new stuff I'm going to update it also I mean normally it wouldn't be a great idea to update stuff on a live WordPress installation anyway I'm pretty confident though since we we changed a minor thing that it should be fun and since everything if you mess up something in a plugin you like very quickly realize that you mess it up in WordPress like you'll get this white I think it's like a white screen or something and you can't log in your site so if that happens you want to go in with FTP or SSH whatever you can and just rename the plugin folder of the plugin that you just changed is causing the problem and then that'll let you get back at least into your site and have your site running again and then you can revert to a previous version or whatever you change you can revert it back and try to figure it out best thing to do would be to have a a dev version of WordPress that you can test it out on first which I did not have set up for this yet but I may end up setting it up at some point so let's check out our PDF pages alright so now we have our PDF pages so you can see it's just like a normal wordpress post right just basic stuff we do want to add one field though and for that I'm gonna use a plug and I'm not gonna custom code that so let's get on our custom fields plugin and we're gonna add a new group and we'll call this PDF page info and I'm gonna we're going to make sure that it shows that it only applies when the post type is equal to PDF page I'm gonna add a field the field label is going to be actually I was gonna make it PDF URL but it should probably be an upload so let me see file okay so we will upload that I kind of didn't want to at first because I wasn't sure I wanted to have all the PDFs hosted there on the site but they'll probably be less room for error if the PDF just gets uploaded and I can pull the URL otherwise it's gonna be someone manually copying and pasting or typing out a URL and then two things could happen that I could see either they mess up the URL and it doesn't work or something happens to the place where that PDF is hosted so even if just the change in the file name occurred then the link wouldn't work anymore or that server could be down or something so it probably is better if we just have the PDF there it within the WordPress and it's a droplet on digitalocean I could always upgrade the storage if I need to if things start to get crazy I don't really anticipate that that much will get uploaded that I would need to upgrade stores so this should probably I'm actually not I'm not gonna require this because the way we're gonna display this the way I want to display this is I want these pages to be just informational pages so it's not gonna say right away that these are just PDF conversions the PDFs almost gonna be like an afterthought like if you want the PDF version here it is so in case there's at some point down the road they want to just include some information in this page without actually include having a PDF version I'm gonna make this not required and I want to return the file URL and that should be it now we can let's see I want to put this up high after the title so it's really obvious I do want to put this in the standard meta box I think the seamless kind of looks a bit nicer but it's more familiar for users to put it in the standard box so what what I don't need here so I want to hide the permalink I want to keep the content editor so when we're only using WordPress for the API we can hide a lot of things because they won't really work so we don't need the exurbs we don't need the custom fields because this isn't talking about the custom field we just made this would have been if we if we added custom fields through WordPress has kind of like a builtin way to do custom fields that's not nearly as userfriendly and powerful as this plugin we don't need discussion comments revisions could be helpful the slug is unnecessary authors unnecessary format I'm gonna hide featured image for now I don't think we'll be including images at least a featured image and I'm not gonna worry about categories or tags and another track back so this is going to simplify the UI significantly so you'll see when we go back in there will be a lot less than there was originally so I'm going to publish that and now let's go back in we'll add a new page okay see so here's our file input so we can add a file and actually this PDF I'm just gonna put this PDF in just a little have something and let's add a title test page and let's grab some just some some text to throw in there and I just grabbed some some bacon ipsum which is a taste to your version of lorem ipsum we don't really need the sharing buttons but I didn't see an option to get rid of these so I'm not worried about it now it won't make a difference whether this is checked or not but we can see you know really there's it's really simple for people to edit things in here there's not much that can be done so I'm gonna publish this and that's all we need to do on the wordpress side of things so it should be it should be enough for us just to have this one instance of it we kinda think there's really only one spot where we would display more than one set of data and that's that's one the about page so we may have to just hard code in some some other examples just to see what it will look like but this should be fine for now so that's it for the wordpress side of things and we'll check out the wordpress api now just to make sure that we're getting the data and as soon as you see the data I'm gonna go I'm gonna check back in the live stream because that's kind of the end of part one of our little mini project here so I want to check out the PDF pages oops was a PDF page there we go PDF page so here we go so when we make an API call to get a PDF page this is what we'll get back we actually don't need all of this data so we'll probably filter it down because we'll just need the content and we'll get the URL here we go here's our PDF upload URL so that's pretty much all we need and the title alright so we have that and I can move this over I don't think we need it anymore now I'm gonna go to the live chat quickly next step is going to be editing our about page to give users somewhere to actually click to get to our new page that we're gonna make all right so I'm gonna scroll up a bit in a live chat see what I missed okay Evo just added the github issue thank you so much for that the issue about the appearance of the Select okay Jeremy is bringing up there's a slack channel now for for free code camp it's FCC pair programming slack calm and Joe says FCC just keeps getting better every day awesome I like that that comment okay it looks like Zanna has included some images of that select input as well from Ubuntu on Firefox and Chrome okay so it looks like on Firefox it actually is working I'll put it on the screen quickly so it's working but it's black in the background so this might be a little bit more challenging than I thought because you know the we need it to show up the text to show up is white when it's selected and we can't just simply make it black because it wouldn't show up in Firefox so off to think that one through a bit more to make sure that the text is readable I'm trying to think the last time I did this it was on a white background so I didn't have the same issues I mean as possible I could just change this so that it's not on a black background anymore if I can't find some way to make this work and then that would just solve the issues because we would have a darkcolored font and it should work all the time because this this then would have a white background instead so anyway we'll see actually what do you all think about this black bar anyway so I've gotten some feedback from coworkers and the feedback so far was at first it was a little jarring but it only took you know a minute or so to get used to it and then it was it was okay so not great feedback I mean I would rather have wow this looks amazing so I'm not I'm still not sure about it myself now that I've been looking at it for so long I'm used to it but I just kind of I didn't want to just all white you know I wanted something else here to kind of set these off you know these controls these filters off from the rest of the content so if anyone has any other ideas let me know and I'm definitely open to some alternatives I mean I need to be careful I can't spend too much on it so if it's at a point where it's good enough I'll probably just have to leave it because we're running out of time so I don't I don't really want to mess with it too much but a color change shouldn't be that big of a deal you know if I really find a color that that I like I'm open to spending the time to change it okay yeah and so in regard to the slack Channel yeah I can't so a few people are saying they couldn't get into the slack Channel they need an invitation or something I had the same issue I couldn't get into the slack Channel either let me I think I still have it up on my screen somewhere at least I did I've way too many windows open I'm not sure here it is I find it yeah so this is what I'm getting signin to FCC pair programming and when I try to signin I can't so it says contact the team administrator and I'm not sure who the team administrator is or what their contact information is so has anybody been able to get in if so how okay his Hannah says all that is a bit unintuitive can you just use categories instead I'm not sure I'm trying to look at the timestamp for that was that in regard to to this bar here you know Evo says I don't really like that people are now using slack as a new generation of email maybe I'm just stubborn or getting old he says I'm twenty but I just can't really get used to it so I'm not sure that that 20 is old I guess if you're a kid 20 years old but yeah i'm i like slack but I'm not sure that slack is a actual email alternative I use slack for different things that I would never normally send an email for so I know there are people saying like slacks gonna kill email like emails that I don't buy that I emails probably gonna be around for a long time because everybody's used to it it works but slack is really cool for what it does and so I like I like that if I want to send a quick message to somebody that would be a waste of time to send in an email slack is really great for that okay so I'm getting some feedback about that section maybe change it from black to the like the red color and then that may that may look better okay Zanna says maybe like just leave it leave it white but add like a border a thin border at the bottom and the top or even like John said to make it make it that red color okay I'll have to try that out oh okay I see what is n I see what you're trying to say here so then let me let me try to explain what I think you're saying you could let me know if I got it right here so instead of having the word all right here which doesn't really say much have it say like categories or something and that would that would make more sense I did originally have it saying choose a category but I got an error so basically I had to like add in manually that the the word selected into that into that element into that option and then react gave me a warning it wasn't really an error message gave me a warning saying not to do that I don't know why I shouldn't do that but I could definitely change that back so that category is the first thing actually that would make sense it would definitely work if I would just say choose a category is the first thing that people say it's not going to be disabled the problem right now is it's disabled and greyed out a little bit I'll just make it have the same value as all and then that way it'll show everything if someone happens to click on it again who cares it'll still show everything or they would just naturally click on all okay yeah I think I'll do that I think I might actually do that right now since it's such a small change it would be better just to do it I mean I have it open already so let me I do want to double check would I put my I lost my terminal I just wanted to check to see if I had anything that was not committed here it is okay so it's clean you know obviously I'm gonna start doing a lot of stuff directly on the dead branch and just kind of merging in all the different branches that I've been working on into dev like as they start to get closer to being done so I'll take out disabled and I'll put in a zero and then that should automatically make it the first option so I say that it didn't Auto refresh there we go so that works better you can click all here what you want to make sure this works if I click choose a category it still works us all okay so that look better okay Patrick says get some Patrick suggested saying all categories Johnson's and categories yeah I think any of that work I probably I'm just gonna keep this just so that I don't spend any more time on it but anyway yeah I'm glad that that you brought that up because okay Patrick likes what I ended up with I'm glad you brought that up because I it was something I had thought of earlier and I thought the same thing that it would be weird and then I just kind of gotten used to it and and just kind of forgot about it and I never like I never wrote it down usually make a little note in Trello when I think something like that but for some reason I didn't and so just kind of forgot so it's really good to have all these people looking at it you know all of you looking at it and you know just in general on a project it's great to have other people look at it because when you're building it you just get used to certain things and take for granted that people are gonna understand it so it's really like I mean doesn't really matter how good you are as a developer I think that's it's just like a natural thing is that you can't look at it with fresh eyes like the user would a new user because you've been looking at it for so long I mean maybe if you waited a year and then looked at it again and you've forgotten it you know that would be the only way but I mean who has time to wait that long okay so that looks a lot better now let me commit that I'd hate to commit make a commit for such a small change but the other changes we're going to be doing you're so unrelated that I'd rather just just do it so so we're gonna commit we're gonna get commit and then we're gonna use the flag am so this will add the file and make the message at the same time so we don't separate it into two steps and let's see this is gonna change default option resource category select okay that works probably what's gonna happen is I'm gonna change that at some point so if I end up using a select somewhere else in the site I'll probably make this option be like a prop that you could pass in the text for this option I think that's the only thing that would have to change everything else could stay the same and it would work possibly like some of the colors could end up being options that get passed in but that would really be it then then it would make this component like fully reusable and as possible am I using okay so I'm not really using any colors here so this could stay and that would oh yeah I am I'm using this color so potentially I could just pull this and include it here so that the color could actually be a prop as well so I'm not gonna do it now but if I do end up using this again I'll pull that in and then it will be reusable all right so we need to bring up the about page cuz that's what we're gonna be working on and let me go back I wanna check the last shot just really quick let's see I'm bare toasters I wish I could open source this HR portal page so is that I'll bear are you is that what you're working on now and you not allowed to open source it that's things I I I definitely prefer at least now definitely now that I'm doing streaming I prefer to work on things that can be open source Patrick is bringing up the new stuff and NPM five point two point zero is NTX it's a new command that's really useful so you could do like npx create react app new app it'll grab the latest create react app without polluting the global node that's cool yeah I saw some stuff on Twitter about it but I didn't really read into it anymore so people on Twitter seem to think it was really really useful so I have to check that out hey Sebastian's here how's it going yeah Sebastian pretty much all you missed I kind of explained how I fixed the select input from yesterday and I made a custom post type with a custom field in WordPress so we haven't really done too much with react yet and we're about to jump into that right now okay so in Patrick just put a link in to a medium article about npx so if you can get to the live chat and check out the the link then that should tell you a bit more about it I'm not even gonna attempt to read out the link because it's super long all right so we're on the about page the first thing let's just look at it and figure out where we're gonna put this thing so here's our about page now so let's see all right so this will definitely can stay down at the bottom this is the least important section I'm not sure I'm thinking probably we could probably put a new section here and that would make sense just visually it would break up this kind of double whitespace section since most you know we're breaking it up everywhere else so probably another red section something you make maybe another another red section in between here I'll probably give it a title just as more information for now and then if if it needs to change then it can change it's not really a big deal so that section will say more information and then it can have its I mean it's really just gonna have lists of links I don't think there's that many links right now I think it's like at most six or seven but it could potentially be more so would like to think of a way that it won't get too cluttered up if there's more I'll think about it let's just start to throw in some code now and then see how it looks and then think about right now I'm thinking maybe just like two columns of links and there they're gonna be Auto populated from an API call so I'll just have to figure out some way to distribute them between the two rows evenly and then hopefully the list I mean if the list ends up being like a hundred links it's going to be a super long section I'm okay with that I guess because I said I think the collaborator section is probably not really that helpful to users so not really not really a big deal all right so let's go back and unfortunately this is super long because I haven't transferred any of this stuff over to being pulled from the WordPress API so it's it's all just hardcoded in here but what I want to do is grab the red section that we're already using and I'll just copy and paste that down here and then that way we don't have to waste time typing in code that we've already typed in so this is a collaborator section that's the start of it so we want to pop this in right here and so we actually we need to put in this new section here let's see where if you like container put in another row here and we'll call this I don't remember what I originally was going to call this I'm just going to put information there for now we don't want this flourish white because actually I never ended up building yeah I think I don't think this is doing anything right now this was supposed to do something a long time ago and I guess I never removed it that was one of the things that just got pushed to the side as not really necessary to get done before we launched okay so we'll have that and we're gonna want two columns let's get rid of all this we don't need it and s12 is fine but we want to make this m6 and that'll give us our two columns and inside here you have EUL and then Ally and we're gonna have an a Atrus okay I just want to fill this in a bit to give us an idea of what were what it's gonna look like okay so let's see okay not great just look great right now let's see so obviously we want to change it I'll probably make these I think it'll look a lot better if they're both centerline obviously the the color is gonna change to be white you probably do with making the the font size for the links a bit bigger and maybe like some more space between the list items since they're gonna be things that people are going to want to click on I want to make sure there's enough space especially so on mobile people don't accidentally click you know users with big thumbs have trouble hitting target so I think you usually want to have at least 48 yes so that's only 20 pixels tall the click target for that's only 20 pixels so the Li itself is even only 25 pixels tall so we definitely want to make this bigger increasing the font size will help to but then maybe we'll increase the line height so I want to at least hit like 40 pixels and that should be decent for for people even with with larger thumbs okay so hook like you remember all that so new color Center it increase the font size and then we'll check it out let's see I think I'm just going to give this a class this section of class of PDF links all right and now that we have that PDF links then we can target this down in our style JSX section here and let's go with make I want to make sure I override anything that materializes doing so otherwise I guess I wouldn't normally need to be that specific but I don't want to mess around that should be specific enough there that'll work so we want to deal it a color of white and let's do a font size of let's try 22 and see how that looks we also want we want to Center it so we want to Center that within the columns actually we don't I'm not gonna put that down here because we already have a class for that I think this will work if we do if I put on this row this might work to the line Center it's just Center I think it is so I'm trying to remember with the materialized classes for this I think it's just Center so let's see what that did alright cool what did everything so here we have it here's all our links we did get a little bit bigger here but I think it's still not big enough for a target yeah so it's the only 25 pixels so I don't know that I want to go any bigger with the font size so maybe we'll just add some padding to these links and then maybe a little Morgan we'll see so down here let's give it some padding and let's get let's give it a pixel all around and then between these allies let's give normally I would flip the order of this I don't know that it bothers me but I guess it'll be okay for now let's give it a margin of let's see let's go I don't want a huge margin so let's go four pixels and then zero on the sides there so this when you only have to the first number it first unit is the top and bottom margin and the second one is the left and right margin don't know what did I do I messed something up let me just try to give it a refresh maybe that's all yeah there we go remember that when something weird happens just refresh before you panic alright so now we have a area that we can click on of what is it like 40 what was that 40 it's actually 41 over a little bit it's actually not exactly how I wanted it so let's mess around in dev tools here for a little bit and see two one so I increase this a bit and we'll see so this is our a tag and these are L eyes and what was happening let me try to exaggerate this so we can really see what's going on so let's make this spacing bigger okay that's actually a bit better there's like some overlap where the click target will seem like it was down here in the spot so that's too much spacing but I might go with like 8 pixels let's see weekend I don't know if you can tell that I'll try to zoom in so that what's happening is the click area is kind of bleeding over into the area of the margin so I might get rid of the margins on the lis and just put it directly on the a tags and see how that is because otherwise I don't want there to be I'd rather have there be a slight gap of the the clink targets so let's just pull this and for now just get rid of that okay so I want to see how it's working hmm and that's what I thought would happen there we go so initially what had happened is it wasn't working because of the way it was displayed now it's definitely working I switched to displayblock but now that's too much so might not even need a margin Oh actually no I definitely don't want it to displayblock because then it's gonna go across so let's take that out and now that's not gonna change it alright I'm not gonna mess with this anymore it works I just like oh maybe I'll actually test it on a phone just to see maybe I'm worrying over nothing and it would be fine to click I think this is too much space between the lists and the heading here so I'm gonna remove some of that space other than that it looks weird because these titles are really small but the titles are definitely gonna be bigger everything on this project has huge titles so I'm more worried about having not enough space for the titles and then wrapping onto another line okay so we'll just leave this kind of as is and then get rid of this space and then we'll be done with that for now and we'll we'll work on the page and then obviously we're gonna want to pull this in this date in through the API for now lo I want to just get all the pieces working before adding that extra complexity of pulling in the data okay so let me remove remove this margin for now we'll just keep the padding let's actually let me I want to see what's causing this space so it looks like we do have a margarine on the bottom of that div but we also have a margin on the H tag I'll try getting rid of the well we have a margin on the UL so we have quite a few margins going on here if I get rid of the margin on the h2 and on the div that should be enough I'd rather do that then come to mess with the UL all right so I'm going to do some inline Styles now and in react you can you do inline styles as JavaScript objects so the first bracket your in JavaScript and then the second bracket may put you in an object so we're gonna go marginbottom we're gonna camelcase it and we're gonna say zero and then I'm just gonna copy that and paste it on this h2 as well and let's see and that did not any refresh okay let me restart my server and since I'm restarting it this would be a good time to check in with the live chat okay so John has says how about instead of a new section to break up the white space you just had a thin red bar above collaborators on the about page minimalistic and the page content seems filled up enough okay I mean I I obviously didn't see that before I already did this so I'm gonna keep I probably keep this section the same because I already just made it but I actually kind of liked that idea I'm gonna keep that in mind for if I need to add other sections because I don't like being tied into like always having to break things up in the same way John so we have two John's so the first round I just talked to is John be the next one this is John John Hanson says the API data I'm guessing JSON yes it's JSON is this type of file difficult to gzip from the server the project I built went live but all testing shows JSON only file type not compressed done hmm I don't actually don't have experience with that can you can you gzip JSON files from the server I don't I don't know does anybody have any experience with that all right Zanna thanks for answering the the question about the editor Patrick said Patrick said that says yes he likes this question when it gets this question we are getting dangerously far and we were getting dangerously far into the stream without someone asking which would break the streak of every stream so thanks yes thanks for asking that I honestly don't know if it's been asked every stream I'd have to go back and watch them which I probably won't do because as is the case I think with most people but the sound of my own voice just sounds really weird so I usually don't watch my streams often occasionally I'll watch just to see if I can like improve things sometimes I watch to see if I'm saying filler words a lot like um and things which I do and I try to work on huh but it's been a streak of enough episodes that I think we have an official streak going so we'll just we'll just try to keep it going well we are an hour in already crazy actually even more than an hour and when did I start I started it too huh okay John Henson says is it not 44 pixel height and the width minimum for four button links are the reason for using pixels over em2 your website I'm not really sure why you would want to use eeehm or pixels I'm just used to pixels so I can guess I can usually visualize how many pixels the thing will be on the screen because I'm used to pixels I'm not good at visualizing at all what eeehm would be so that's why I use pixels the only other unit I ever use are vh + VW that's also easy to visualize because it's just a percentage of the screen but I'm sure it's probably whatever you used to would be what you end up using unless there's some other other reason why you would want to use a different unit on jar says using REM or e/m is a good practice so yeah I just I see a lot of people using it I'm just not sure why what the benefit is to using it so if anybody knows I'd be open to to hearing about the benefit to using that I don't really know that I would switch at this point since I'm so used to using text the benefit would have to be really big for me to try to switch right now since I'm I've gotten really good at just being able to visualize things in in pixels so I would need a really good reason to switch from it Oh someone's name in the lab chat is inside the matrix that's awesome a great name I used to be a huge matrix fan like back you know when the first matrix came out oh no way all right so bill says there's an app called like so that you can start when you do a stream that will help analyze use of filler words I'm gonna have to look that up because I listened really early on in one of my first streams I listened through the whole thing and I couldn't stand it I used the word um so often it drove me nuts and then on the next stream I apologized profusely to everyone for making them sit through all of that so I really made an effort afterwards to stop that but I think I'm slipping back into it especially on days like this where I'm pretty tired and I'm mostly focusing on on the code so once I get started and I'm talking about something it's usually better but what I'm trying to code and talk at the same time or read things off of the live chat I do say I'm a lot I guess that's normal but I'd still like to quit doing it if I could jonbi says I was so upset they didn't name the sequel's the matrices so this equals to the matrix I like that one Jeremy says I don't even know this filler words my dude so cool yeah I actually read a study where they said that so some people tried to stop using filler words by talking more slowly and pausing instead of using filler words but they did a study where people were more I wanna say how did it go basically people had a much more negative view of speakers who took long pauses then of speakers who use filler words so if it's a choice between pausing and filler words you're better off using filler words so I guess I guess it could be worse than using filler words all right so let me get back to this so this is for now good enough so that we can click on it and make sure it goes to the right place which is all I really am going for for now so now the next step is going to be let me commit this first and where we got okay it's weird out this keeps doing it every time the hot module reloading happens it doesn't load all the styles that's so weird alright so now let's go back to the code we're gonna have to make a new page and next J s and I want to use one of these pages as a head start so I think these pages are pretty much the same single event single news the news page is probably what I want yeah this page has some extra stuff that I don't want to have to change that so the news page I think is more basic am i pulling in I am pulling in some stuff that I didn't add like the SEO description I don't even think I'm ended up making that text I think we're fine I'll copy this page and we use that to make our new page here so I'm gonna call this PDF page don't yes no actually okay it shouldn't matter what the name of the pages now that I think about it and maybe it will I gotta check out my server file for a second hold on okay so what I want to check is with this goes down so let me check out our events page real quick I just wanted I'm worried about what's gonna show up in the URL so I can't remember how it shows up okay so this does show up is events okay okay I see where I put it so I so I can put whatever I want right there so it doesn't even really matter what's here okay that works let me was I know it's right here PDF I guess I'll hyphenated since I was already hyphenating stuff but now that I think about it it doesn't I don't know that it makes much sense probably should have been camel casing this I think the only reason I hyphenated it was because I'm in the pages folder and normally whatever the titles here and the pages end up being URLs and in URLs you're more likely to see hyphens and not obviously not camel case so PDF pages I should say PDF page give me a single page to PDF page such as okay so now we have our PDF page and I can paste in all of this stuff and let me make sure that I really need this so I don't want posts what I want are PDF what was that PDF page we brought this over didn't we I think I'm maybe I must have moved it over again I couldn't remember I think it's just PDF page is what we put in a the API call so we're gonna filter by our ID which is actually gonna end up being the slug we're not gonna need so this is where I filter out what we actually need I don't need taxonomy x' I need content I don't need the excerpt I'm gonna keep it the ID you know actually I don't know if that I even need the ID I don't need tags or categories we're not gonna have an image any featured media all right so that's all we need this will cut out a lot of the other stuff now I need to make sure that I get rid of those things down here if I was using them so this works we don't want let's see what the information this description tag obviously we're not getting anything from the description tag because we're not pulling that in so I guess I can take it out for now just make things more simple I might put it in later on and I'm gonna pass in you don't need that now we got our error page if we need it that are sticking of we're gonna we're not gonna have an image for now we're not gonna have an image but we might add an image to just have the same image for all the info pages for now I think it'll be fine we'll just put in just kind of like a normal title so let's just do an h1 and do there's something we'll have to set it as will need to use dangerously set enter HTML because it's it's possible that sorry I just stuffed in the middle of the thought so basically it's possible that there could be characters that wouldn't show up properly if we just put this props title rendered inside the tag so that's why we do dangerous asset enter HTML because sometimes there's special characters that don't render properly or if I can just close this we'll try it out we'll see how that looks I might have to put that in its own row to make it show up better but it should work there and drops a 20 I guess has to put 0 in here okay we're getting the data I should probably use destructuring to get rid of all this but I'm not I'm not worried about it right now there's not really a lot going on okay that's good for now this will give us enough to see obviously we're gonna have to do something with the URL and have some sort of button to download the PDF but for now this will be enough to be able to see what's going on so now we need to go to the server da JS file and I'm just gonna copy and paste what's already being used here for single news and we'll change it out and say we just call that info I think it should be fine I don't it's easy to change later on if I need to as long as I don't think of too many people of link to it actually I'm a bit worried that they might think info is too informal it's kind of kind of a pretty formal type of thing type of organisation that this site's being made for I don't want to put information because they just make it unnecessarily long so how about I just put I that'll be fun I mean YouTube just has a C and their custom URLs for channels so I think that's fine I could put a P for PDF but like I said up I don't want it to be thought that this page is you know just a transition of a PDF I want the PDF to be thought of as the secondary thing the original plan well that I was told is that it was just going to be a bunch of links to PDFs but that's not really a good thing to do on the web it's it's hard you can't search through that content search engines can't see it at least all the content within so so I argued passionately against that idea and so this is this is what was agreed upon so we need to make this our PDF page per mg okay so this is gonna pass the name so we just need to make sure when we make our links the name the slug for that post is what comes after this in the well after this in the URL so this ID part needs to be the slug when we format our URLs for the about page and then everything should work so I'm gonna save that and I'm gonna make sure that I say this as well since we changed the server I need to restart it and I just need to make sure of the the slug so I don't know where I put my I'm just gonna go over to my wordpress installation here oh here we go I finally found my data here's the data I was looking for before so I just need the slug as his test page and I don't know that I was pulling in the slug no I wasn't I need to make sure well I don't need to pull it in here nevermind I don't know what I was thinking so what I need to do is use test page as our URL that's it so I should be able to go in here now and type in I slash test page and that that happened but what is going on okay I see when I copy this page this news page I hadn't copied over shoot what was it I need the side nav actually that's really weird it shouldn't be like that but it's a within nav that should be taking care of that it should should take care of the global and its side enough so I just want to make sure servers fine that's working fine the PDF page I'm 14 looks like I'm I'm not bringing in enough okay so I'm bringing in layout within layout nav should be brought in it's that that's odd am I trying to hit the side now somewhere else no this is low phase you all right so I shouldn't have to do this but I think I'm just gonna do it to see if this gets rid of the problem I mean maybe there's something that's going on because it's a parameterised route that I don't know who knows but if this fixes it and that's all I have to do then I'm happy about that you know it didn't all right so that's really odd so I want to check out and see if this is working I know I want to compare I want to compare this to our our file for single events right because the single events used to be the same as the single news and this actually is working so let's see what's different between these ones I'm gonna get rid of that that I added to the top components okay this is interesting so in the single event I'm not using the layout component so that I mean that's a really big difference Wow for the single event this is this is kind of the old way before he switched over to doing things like this I'd hate to switch back to this just to make it work but if I can't figure out what's going on then maybe I'll have to I'm gonna check the live chat just to see so basically everything is pretty much working like we wanted to we're getting it kind of an error unrelated to what the goal was having to do with the init function for the side nav okay so but at least at this point we've successfully had you know you can see the flash quickly of the content well let me let me restart this dev server so we can see it so you can quickly see the flash of content that comes up and it is the content for the page it says test page it has our lorem ipsum so that's working so I guess it's it's mission accomplished kind of for what we wanted to do now I just need to figure this out so I'm gonna go back in the live chat and see if you all have given me any ideas about the problem or if there's any questions that I can answer now since this is now already two hours in it might be a good time to just you know answer some questions and and finish up since since I've accomplished what I wanted to for this dream and then I'll just fix this before I leave today or tomorrow morning okay so we were having a discussion about fonts the units for fonts of pixels versus a.m. and Zanna says the idea is you you ever want to change your font size you just changed it once and all EMS will just use it how does anybody do you say EMS or do you say Ms I'm not really sure I've ever heard it pronounced so I don't know let me know okay so basically the pixels are won't won't respond so it's just much easier to scale your fonts up or down okay okay cool thanks Zanna sent me a link from CSS tricks so thanks thanks for sending that as more information about the whole font units discussion so anyway that's cool I mean that's pretty legit reason for using it so like I said before not sure that I'll switch right away it might be more of a gradual thing but that's pretty decent decent reason I'll just have to get an idea of like what what pixel size compares to the near the rem3 M's okay Umberto says at least from what I understand and the the the REM unit is compound the compounded scale of the font so if you have REM styles nested it will keep scaling to the most recently scaled size then Zanna says so pixels at the root REM for components and then EMS for text okay I'll definitely have to learn some more and give this some more thought before I start implementing it but it definitely seems like there's some advantages to it okay Alberto says the dev tips youtube channel has a good explanation so actually I off to watch that I really like the dev stiffs channel so if anyone wants some a good resource for learning like CSS and some more design related stuff check out the dev tips channel I the the guy who does that he doesn't do many videos anymore he got a job at Google and is just really busy so I haven't seen very many videos from him lately but his old videos are still really good and pretty relevant it's not like CSS changes that often and a lot of what he does is mostly CSS so I think they're still useful and he's pretty entertaining too easy to listen to Travis that's his name I'm pretty sure the guy from dev tips is his name is Travis okay Santa says there's this whole debate over the pixels okay so so maybe I've stepped in here into some some turbulent waters here with with this debate so I'll have to I definitely won't have time to study up on this right now because I gotta get this site it done but that'll be on the list I may have time to watch the tips video though because I could do that while I'm doing other things multitask a bit alright we had another question about the code editor Thank You Zanna for answering the question again John Hanson says innerhtml found found that out the hard way there's the special characters yeah so that was back when we were I was referencing using dangerously set innerhtml for stuff so like for the title and for the content here so it sounds like you shouldn't use it and I think I'm pretty sure at some point on a stream or something I had someone who was like a little bit upset that I was using this but my thinking is well number one like what else are you gonna do like this this comes through and there's special characters in it it gives you like the character codes and study actual characters and it's it's unreadable you can't you can't have that also as long as you control what data is coming in here which which I do then there's no reason not to use that you wouldn't just pull in random data from somewhere like you'd never want to pull in data that a user could enter you know just some random user could enter because maybe it would be you could do some malicious type of stuff with JavaScript but in this case you know this is the proper way to do it it just happens to be named this crazy name dangerously set in HTML just to warn people but if you know what you're doing then there's no reason not to use it Philip Philip B don't worry about asking the question about the editor that's it's like I totally don't mind when people ask about the editor it's just kind of like a running joke here because everybody asks about the editor so I've gotten so many questions about it that we started joking that we need to have like a chatbot and this job would would be just to say what what the editor is and like made with theme and plugins and stuff amusing so but don't don't feel bad at all I know I used to think the same when I was kind of beginning and starting out that was what I wanted to know all the time when I saw somebody's YouTube video I was always too kind of too embarrassed and shy to ask in a youtube comment so I always was like searching through the comments hoping to somebody else ask the question and then I'd be able to find out what the editor is so I totally understand the desire to know what's going on with with other people's code editors okay and then someone whose name starts with F and then there's a lot of numbers anyone want to explain exactly what he was working on so I'll try to give a really really fast summary of what I've been doing but I've been streaming for over two hours now so it's gonna be tough to sum it all up but basically I made a custom post type in WordPress with a custom field and then I exposed that data by the WordPress API I then pulled that data into a react website that was also using next jazz I use some custom routing in addition to the routing that's there by default for next G is to do what's called parameterised routing so that I can populate a like a template react jazz template based on the post slug in WordPress and do an API call to get the data from just that slug that way it doesn't matter you how many pieces of data are in there there will always be another page there will always have a nicelooking URL based on the the slug for that particular post so thanks that actually wasn't bad I thought it would take me longer to explain it so I'm not sure how how much since that made just such a quick explanation but that's basically what was done along the way we talked about some other things too but in terms of code that's what we did actually I didn't notice it Philip so Phil you just started coding yesterday so awesome welcome to coding and I'm not sure Philips in I didn't see Philip say say anything else so I hope I hope you didn't leave Philip but if you're still here welcome to coding and that's really cool that you're getting involved so right now we're at a point in the stream where we were kind of at an advanced level but every time I start a new project I'll start out with some basics so there's always going to be some basic things that even someone who's very new could probably benefit from so you know check out some of the videos like the titles of some previous live streams and you know if the title is something that interests you you know check it out there's definitely some beginner level stuff in there and I definitely don't be afraid to ask any questions and the live chat or in the comments of the videos you can even direct message me on Twitter I'd be happy to you know give you some advice if you need it John Hanson said I like how we see Jessie struggle that's how it's done I'm glad you like Amy struggle is that's what a lot of the stream is me struggling is when I'm not on the stream I don't have nearly as many issues but believe it or not I usually get a lot done and don't run into so many problems for some reason especially lately the streams have been really difficult and I've just had these like errors and stuff pop up and things just not working out which is fine it probably makes the stream a bit more entertaining and more interactive because you are trying to help me fix it if I just flew through everything and got it all done really quickly it it I don't think that would be as good for the stream it might be better for my project but not not great for this drain okay so we get some commentary here on the pronunciation so okay so we have e m we have M Janice's M's Sara's heard it at M's hey Sarah I'm not sure that I've seen you in the chat before so welcome Sarah okay so maybe I'll say m's now it seems like the the MS one out in the live chat so the the CSS unit that spelled e/m I will pronounce M from now I'll evil s about the format that the content comes through with a dangerously set innerhtml property so if you have content coming in that has HTML tags and you don't want those HTML tags to be displayed you know literally on the screen then you use dangerously set enter HTML then the HTML gets evaluated like it should by the browser you know so all your tags will work properly so it'll it'll be viewed as actual HTML content instead of just a string it's said that made you say we should we should call it live coding with Jesse and the atom editor and then no more questions we just put some text in the corner Eva says she's pathetic yeah yeah I don't know I don't mind the question I think it's kind of fun I I really I don't think I want to put it anywhere that I'm using atom editor I think it would be more fun to just see how many times people ask the question I'm not annoyed by it yet so if I ever do get annoyed maybe then I can have something in on the screen I already have something in the description for the for the videos it's it's there somewhere if you just have to read the description and Amica so sorry if i'm pronouncing that wrong it's eme ka so let me know if I'm pronouncing it wrong so a Mika says hello hey not sure I'm not sure if I've seen you in the chat before so welcome if this is your first time chatting okay so Amica want to know if the code editor does some sort of live preview or any kind of preview so by default I don't think it it uses it does a preview there's probably some sort of plugin they could do a preview so right now like I'm running a development server on my computer and it does it like reloads everything which you can't see it right now because I have this error message on the screen so it's not it's not coming from the editor but if you if you really wanted an editor that could give you a live preview just want to think of which one would do that well I know like there are some cloud editors that do that like cloud 9 is a cloud editor that does that should I think desktop I guess like Dreamweaver does that I don't know that I would recommend using Dreamweaver but there may be there's a lot of plugins I'm using Adam and there's a lot of plugins for it so maybe able to do that Sabo so SSD a bow or so SE must try to pronounce em I'm gonna say Sabo for now since you're still doing this I left the stream maybe two hours ago yeah I am still doing this sometimes the streams are quite long there's some surprise you just don't post the editor and plugins used to make the video about it in the info I did I do I have the editor I have a I'm pretty sure I have a link to the editor in the info I don't have the plugins the I showed all the plugins yesterday on the stream I keep intending to make a like a recorded video for my own youtube channel where I go through how I have Adams set up and I go through all the plugins and everything I just haven't had time to do it yet okay so the the person with lots of numbers in their name and the live chat asks can you summarize this project for me yeah I'll try to do click summary it's it's a react website that's built using next Jas which is kind of like a scaffolding tool for react that comes built in with routing and serverside rendering so it's a react site that's pulling data from a wordpress site the WordPress site has no like publicly visible face to it it's just being used as a content management system so that users who have no coding skills can put in the data easily and then that data comes into the react site it's displayed it looks nice it runs quickly that's pretty much it I mean there's not really it's pretty straightforward there's some other stuff involved like we're doing load balancing between two different node servers the WordPress installation is on a separate server so there's some some extra stuff that's going on that may be a bit beyond like just a really basic project but that's pretty much it yeah the stream will be available to watch so add a question if the stream is available so it will be available to watch usually within a few minutes after I end the stream you can watch the recording and I just saw that Patrick already answered that so thanks Patrick inside the matrix that says you should make a counter in the corner for how many times it's asked for people asking about the editor that would be really cool okay so so amicus question about editors that have a builtin preview thing so Sabo says brackets has a builtin preview that works with Chrome's a builtin plugin and Sara says Adam has one a plugin as well so awesome Thanks thanks for that information that's definitely a better answer for Annika then then I had oh and John Hanson says that Adam does have a builtin development preview so that's cool I didn't realize that the Adam theme I'm using is called the SETI theme its SETI the SETI theme inside the matrix says I use the live server plugin and Adam and Visual Studio code to see live preview okay so that's I guess you can check out that plugin so that's uh that's pretty much all for the live chat really I think I did a good job of keeping up with everything so normally I go back through the live chat and answer questions but since I kind of stopped at several points and answered questions I don't think I need to go back if I did miss your question I I'm sorry about that do you can put it in the comments for this video and I'll answer it later on or you can just direct message me on twitter my the link to my twitter is in the description for the video so i think i'm going to end because the stream has been going on for almost two and a half hours now so it's going to be a very long stream and I'll figure out what's going on with this and I'll let you all know tomorrow what the problem ended up being and that's it so if anybody has actually I got something else in the lab chest see inside the matrix's sorry I couldn't help with the air I'm not learned and react or next yet yeah oh don't worry about it yeah I'm like I'll figure it out and you all helped me so much don't ever worry about not being able to help with a problem because I've gotten so much help and so much great information from you all and in the live chat and and so much encouragement too so you all have been great actually I mentioned at the beginning of the the stream that I had submitted proposals for a talk to a bunch of conferences last night and you can if you check out a tweet I had like last night so it still should be up at the top in my Twitter you can actually there's a link to see what the presentation is but just to save you the trip the the title of the the talk I'm pretty sure I titled it something like how live coding changed my life or something like that so it's really cool and basically it's all because of you it's not it's not actually the act of coding while talking it's it's all of you it's the interaction I've had with you all and how encouraging you've been and hopefully you've been in the community that's been built up so that's really the amazing thing that I think is it's just really it's really unique you know something I've never had before I usually work alone hey see you later Zanna then asked to go so I'm saying she said goodbye in the lab chat Oh see you hopefully tomorrow you can make it for the stream so anyway that's I always kind of never really knew what I would talk about at a conference that I could talk about maybe better than other people but I think this is something because I've experienced this now in this community so so I finally have something that I think it's worth you know I could do a good job and really you know tell people something that's that could be valuable I think I did apply to do a talk about next using next Jas with an API and all kind of stuff and react but I think there's a lot of other people that could give a talk like that too and probably better than me so I'd be happy to give that talk it would be more technical but I suppose it wouldn't be quite as unique as what I could could talk about in terms of the you know the live coding yeah so Jana asked where is the talk at so I don't really know I I apply to some some talks in the United States one in in England and oh no I don't have the talk on my channel yet so I haven't you know fully like thought out everything I would say I definitely have a lot of what I would say you know kind of in my head but if I get accepted to a conference to do it then I probably you know I'll do it all I was thinking I might even do like practice as a livestream you know just kind of practice the talk and get feedback before I actually have to give it at a conference so maybe I'll do that so I don't know I've never spoken at a conference at a tech conference before and so we'll see I might not get accepted at all but I think I'll probably just keep applying you know as I see things come up just keep applying to or submitting talk ideas and maybe I'll get one and maybe we could actually think it would be really cool if I got to go somewhere that was like near where one of one of you lived and then could have like an eat up or something of you know like freak freak out camp people or something that would be kind of fun but I don't know we'll see I think there's a conference in Argentina that I'm going to apply to as well but they want you to do like a threeminute video telling why you should be there so I need to make the video first like what else where else I applied some places in Florida in the United States I think conference in New York Tennessee Washington DC so kind of like all different places but anyway I don't want to I don't want to just kind of go on and on with with talking so I'm gonna wrap this up if anybody has any advice for me in terms of trying to get accepted into conferences that would be really awesome even if you just want to check out that link on Twitter to what I said to try to get in the conference I mean if you if you have any advice you know for just kind of the way I presented my idea about how I could do it better I'd really appreciate that cuz I don't know I think it would be really cool to share that like what's going on here with our little community with with more people I think it'd be really really helpful if like more people did did things like this so anyway is that's it that's all I got for today oh I'll be back tomorrow at 2 p.m. Eastern time and and until then have a great day see y'all tomorrow
