everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse today we're going to continue on with where we left off in the last stream so I haven't done any additional work with that so you haven't missed anything I have merged a few pull requests so we'll go over those quickly ready the beginning of our first Pomodoro session and what I want to say oh sorry about not being able to stream yesterday I did do a very short stream on my youtube channel if it was about coding on blockchain with aetherium and solidity so just going through a tutorial if you're interested in in crypto or blockchain programming like distributed apps check that out it wasn't a very good stream at a lot of interruptions and things but I guess it's a little introduction to that kind of thing the link to my channel I think is in the description of this video so we're gonna get started soon I'm gonna give everybody a few more seconds to come in I'm sure some people are just getting their notifications that we went live and hey everyone hey Nicki's in the middle of working on a pool request for the routing so iniki's has just added something to the routing hastily typing some explanation on the pr and github I was just looking at that at that pool request actually so I'll hold off on that and wait and maybe I'll check it out later then if you're in the middle of updating it let's see let me make sure all right I got through most of the pull requests that were open so if you if you're working on this code or you have this running you know locally make sure you do a get pull since some of the code is just changed literally you know five minutes ago I was still merging pull requests okay so up to kind of our normal normal numbers here so I guess we'll get started let me get everything set up we have n grok up and running already so I'm gonna paste that in the live chat for you all so you can click on that link that I just pasted into the live chat and you'll be able to see the website as I work on it and actually there's a new feature now on youtube so i think the live chat now gets saved and you can see the live chat as you watch the replay so as everything came through you you'll be able to see it I think that's really cool I haven't tested it out or anything I just saw the message that that's available today so hopefully that'll work that'll be really nice for all the other people watching later on watching the recordings and let's start our timer so if you're not familiar with this dream I'm doing my regular everyday work as a frontend developer and I do my work in Pomodoro session so 25 minutes of coding fiveminute break on the stream we do 25 minutes of coding but then during the fiveminute break I answer questions in the live chat and then at the end whatever questions are left over I just take a long break and answer all those questions so feel free to ask any questions don't worry if if you're new you know ask ask any questions you need to understand I'm more than happy to explain what's going on here so let's start this up we are working with react which is a JavaScript library oops I should bring the site over so everyone can see it huh there we are and I did say I would show you some of the pull requests that we get we have so let me let me show you we've had just recently I just merged in these one two three these three by J Meza Kappa so thank you so much for those and these were some these are some UI things that have really been bothering me but I just didn't really have the time you know to get to them so I really appreciate that because I mean this this really ends up being a big help you know all these these little things make a big difference in the final product like those details you have no idea how annoying it was unless you maybe you do if you're trying to click it when you'd open up the side nav and try to click here and nothing would happen or try to click here and nothing would happen right and you had to click right on the words for the link to actually open so I was giving presentations and I I didn't get it exactly right and nothing would happen I said that is not not a great user experience and definitely wasn't great during my presentation so that's awesome so now this whole thing should be a link awesome and a definite is a link we also have cursorpointer now over this icon to let people know that it's a link which we didn't have before and we have some styling on our majors pages that we were working on before we had some issues with with the BR tags to wear on other pages on the news pages we didn't want them because there are a ton of BR tags just here and there and making the formatting look awful well we actually do want to be our tags as they are playing an important role on our major pages so those are the things that J Meza CAPA worked on so it really appreciate that anybody that's interested in submitting pull requests you're definitely welcome to if you need some help let me know don't be afraid to submit something even if it's your first time submitting I'm not gonna yell at anybody or get upset if something's done wrong sometimes I'll just accept the pool request and if one or two things need fixed I'll just fix it after I accept the pool request other times I may just point out the things that need changed and you could submit the pool request again so this is very beginner friendly when I help as many people as I can to you know get get pool requests in and build up their portfolios with you know legitimate and helpful contributions to this project and all the other projects that we work on okay so that was a lot of intro oh no oh no I you would only see my face the whole time I'm sorry everyone I'm sorry I didn't have OBS like it was behind some other stuff so I couldn't tell all right sorry buddy real quick this is what I was talking about these entire items now are linked so you used to have to click on just the text now it's a link this now is cursorpointer and that's pretty much that's pretty much it I had showed that the last three pull requests if you want to see him there the last three closed pull requests in the repo I'm really sorry about that that was bad that was a long time of me showing things so apologies to everyone and John mentioned my gray beard hairs again so I I deserve that one for for making you all stare at my face while I was thought I was showing you my screen okay oh cool so Joey's Joey did the pool of those last three pool crests and he's here Joey thank you so much those were just like perfect exactly what I wanted I really liked it and some of the solutions were totally different than how I thought I would solve it and I really liked it especially how you when you put in the code here I'll show you just quickly how I did this so in a in our CSS our new CSS that we're importing here we basically wanted to keep all the CSS and my thought was well let's make a whole nother stylesheet and import it here and this is so much more simple he just said on the root component and putted this in for all BR tags did display unset that's awesome I didn't even know you could do unset but really cool I think that's oh it's so much better than than what I was thinking of doing so I really love that that's one of the big benefits for me of having to review pull requests I learned so many good techniques from you all what I'm trying to review the pull requests I read pretty much every line of every pull request so now I'm not talking about like NPM packages and stuff that you pull in of course I'm not reading that but like the actual code that was at it I definitely you know check that all right so now cool Joey says it was my first open source contribution other than just fixing Doc's awesome congratulations congratulations I'm really happy for you Joey you didn't text job so you should you should definitely be proud of your your first you know code contribution okay so let's go to our search component in our last episode we were working on this search component and we got it working to the point where we could search for a certain keyword and it would search across multiple post types in our WordPress database and using the WordPress REST API we would get the results back as a JSON file and then we would map over those results and display the titles of each one of those posts that that matched our keyword so now what we would want to do is well two things definitely need to happen right away one we need to figure out why we're only getting ten results no matter what word we put in so it's probably something that I need to add to our to our string to our URL where we're you know sending our requests and secondly we need to make a better looking user interface for this search right now it's a very basic search bar and the search button or not stout at all and the results aren't aren't styled so today will be more about the styling whereas last the last episode the last stream was more about the mechanics of how are we going to format our query and get the data back now we're gonna try to make that data look nice I do I see some questions in there so I just want to let you all know if you've asked a question I will get to those questions as soon as or my timer goes off here this Pomodoro timer okay so let's actually let's try to go to that search page no it's not working anymore what's up with this phase cannot be property data of no hmm that's weird alright let's check out our page here and see what we're doing okay maybe it's trying to read the data here and we don't have it so alright so we're gonna try to do a check here first then see if that exists No okay so say we have stayed at all did we even initial I know we didn't States data let's just initialize data as didn't plan on starting this with an error search gives an error in masters well let's see okay I think it has something to do with at the very end of the episode keep saying episode it's we need to say that the end of the last stream we were already on that page and we are grabbing data without a page refresh and I think that was it like it didn't there was always data there in state so it wasn't causing an error but now that we've just tried to load it again and state is basically empty then we're getting the error so I cannot refer you Tate oh no I think my check is wrong and I should've let's see I need to go back and look how I check for similar things previously since I for some reason just can't remember how I do it and spread it in zero right I don't know I already was doing the check you're right Nicky I already had a ternary there I already was checking for this state data but it wasn't working there we go okay now it works I believe the problem was that I didn't actually have anything here for data so at some point that state does get set but down here it was trying to check to see hey if if if this say data exists you know then move on but there was anyway you get what I'm saying right so we forgot to initialize our state within just data but just having it be an empty array so let's let's just test this verify that's working and there's no more bugs before we move on so just do a simple word yep all right cool so it is working here's what it would gave us alcohol the titles I'm gonna do a refresh yep okay again yep awesome it works so sorry I gotta change my Spotify okay michael says you need to knock on your wall and tell him to keep it down can you hear there is a conversation going on right outside my door to my office so apologies for the noise there all right so let's style let's tie our search bar first we'll get that search looking better actually do you even want that I don't think we need alright let me know what you think do we want a separate search bar on the search page or is it enough to just have a search bar here or here I mean I I guess on mobile I can see an advantage to having another search bar because you would actually I mean either way you'd actually have to click again let me know what you think yeah so what I'm gonna hold off on styling this for now I'll leave it there but I'm not gonna style it if we end up deciding we don't even need another search bar so for now I'm gonna try to give these just some basic style and try to get more than 10 to show up and where is this I think I can look let me look at a previous project because I know we use this previously and we got more than 10 results for sure so we're going to go to this catechetical Institute site where we pulled some code from before and where we pages resources and let's see what we're using here there we are so we have this per page 100 so let's put that in here let's save it and now we go back here let's try it again there we are okay so now we're getting a lot more so essentially we can get 100 results back now so we don't even have a hundred piece of content we're gonna eventually I think we'll have to think about like do we really want a hundred results should we go like 20 at a time and then give the option to load more you know do what do we want to go with like infinite scroll style I mean these are all things that we will have to decide but we don't have to decide right now so I just want to bring them up so that we can all think about them but what a better user experience would be and then we can try it out and it you know it's one of those things that could easily be changed down the road where we know if we get feedback from real users you know could definitely do something you know differently okay I check my time all right about six minutes so let's see what we can do with six minutes of your styling some of this first thing we'll do is let's grab another component and pull it in here these are probably going to be these will be cards let's think how we want to display these alright let's just let's go with something really simple for now I think I'm gonna do I'm not gonna try to use an existing component just now originally my idea was to have this all like you know cards of multiple columns of cards but I have a different idea now I think I'm gonna make the search results look more like like a Google search or something similar a users are I think more familiar and comfortable with that so that's what I'm gonna go with for this that also frees us up a bit because with the cards I know if I do the card style I'm gonna get feedback from other people here at the University of you know can we put some images or some video in there then that's that's just going to be a little bit extra you know more things to handle more things to load and I don't know that that would necessarily enhance the experience we could certainly have one type of search that's a video search or an image search that we can have that content but I don't like the idea of mixing the content together and having it display if that does pilot can see it in my head hopefully that makes a little bit of sense but it's difficult to make just text content look good if it's in this kind of masonry layout alongside primarily video content or image content you end up depending on the screen with it just looks weird so I'm gonna try it like this I'm gonna stop talking and try it just try to do something now so let's see yeah I'm in the right spot so right now we just have divs each one of these is a div what we're gonna want to do now though is so we want to keep this as the title certainly yeah let's let's keep this as the div here but then let's make this let's go the mage I'm just gonna make this a span for now and we're gonna call this class name title whoops classes title whoops there we go what does that classes it's not define yeah we didn't define it let's forward some classes oops I put that in the wrongs now that was the right spot but then I also need to bring in with styles ten how you do this what am I doing wrong yeah I'm messing this all up alright let me just go back for now what am I missing from these other pages with style styles I'm bringing in I bring this in oops with styles and now maybe this will be better so don't need a data let's see with styles shoot food is the with root here do I need this let's see alright Jilly saying maybe export default with rude with style stuff it alright let's try that alright let's try that okay cool oops yeah use one okay now we're getting classes is not the fun all right my timer went up went off so we're gonna get this working when I get back and here's why this isn't working I never defined classes okay so I'll define classes when we get back taking a break is nice because when I stop trying to look for the problem and I took three seconds to take a break I realized I never defined it that's why it's saying it's undefined of course all right I'm gonna go to the top of the live chat and answer the first questions first see how far we can get down the the chat gospel says I'm just a beginner in programming I had a study C C++ Java but I couldn't no coding till now okay cool um I think that you're saying that this stream is helping you learn how to code effective coding so that's awesome I'm really glad if that's the case what you're saying I'm really really glad that that helps you out so thanks for watching feel free to ask any questions step 7 it's ste pienso Stepan says hello Jesse I'd like to ask how to learn how to integrate HTML to WordPress how did you learn doing this where'd I learn about this I guess there weren't really a lot of tutorials available when I started to learn I'm assuming you're talking about using the WordPress API like this I started using the API before it was a part of press corps so kind of early on and they were on version two at that point so it wasn't like right at the beginning but I just read through the documentation and tried to find any info I could on on blogs and things like that and then just tested things out so it was kind of it was kind of tough honestly at first there's a lot more information now yeah but I was just kind of you know kept trying out so you definitely need to know how to make you know requests to the API so whether you want to use you know Ajax or fetch or Axios or you know something like that so learn how to make requests API you know calls with JavaScript and then WordPress installs come automatically with the API now so you can get data right off the bat you know with any wordpress site that is up to date Mayor s why won't you develop this site using WordPress or laravel or it's just personal preference well we are kind of so we're using WordPress for the content management and we're pulling data from there I prefer the frontend and you know all the things that the user ends up seeing and is not wordpress i my wordpress i think is great for a lot of use cases but if your goal is to make a site that's very versatile and fast as well as having the capability to be a progressive web app I don't think WordPress is the easiest system to use so that's why I like to go with react react has a lot of those capabilities and depending on how you build it with next or create react app a lot of those capabilities come built in so it it gives me a lot more freedom to more quickly change things and add features than it would if I worked with WordPress now if I was very skilled with PHP it might be easier for me to change a wordpress theme but I'm Way more experienced with JavaScript than I am with PHP so this this worked well for me and I like the fact that my data is decoupled from my the rest of my my front end there because it gives me the ability to pull in data from different sources totally migrated to something else if I wanted to either with the front end or the back end because they're not tightly coupled like normally in a wordpress install if you do things normally with themes you know the look of your site and your WordPress installation are all together so it would be very difficult to say like hey I love other site looks but you know what I don't want to use WordPress anymore for this I want to switch to let's say Drupal well essentially that means you're going to completely rebuild your site and have to transfer all your data I mean I guess you could potentially say no you have to if you didn't like if you like the look but you didn't want to deal with the WordPress backend you'd have to redo your whole site this way what we could do is say ok let's transform press data somewhere else and just pull it into the site just like we were doing before might have to change a few things in where we're making the API calls but essentially your site can remain to you from a user's point of view exactly the same even though everything behind the scenes has changed yeah so those are some of the benefits that I see from having them decoupled or not doing it kind of the traditional WordPress way all right obviously as you can see my timers up let's see where I'm leaving off I mean just write down where we're leaving off so I can go right back there okay all right let's go back I do need to take a drink I have a new G fuel shaker by the way so G fuel if you're watching sponsor me this is the New York comiccon shaker which I got for free for ordering G fuel when there was a sale or something some reason today abs like super thirsty my mouth is dry truthfully I think I'm like right on the the verge of being sick I did take some pain medicine because my throat is starting to hurt and kind of swell up so I didn't want it to be a problem for the stream so it took some pain medicine but that's all why you make it through to the weekend I have I have another presentation tomorrow and I need to give that presentation and then I'll be okay I don't know if I'll be able to stream tomorrow though actually because my wife is going on a retreat this weekend so she's gonna be gone overnight on Friday and get back at some point Saturday evening so I need to get out early and get the kids from her and then pick up my older ones from school and my older ones are gonna spend the night at my parents house on Friday so I will still have the baby so it's going to be kind of weird for me to just that me and the baby at home so we'll see how that goes I mean I'm I'm perfectly capable of taking care of the baby but it's just so weird to have like an empty house okay what did I break before we left off another I broke something hello okay this these classes right so let's just pull in well yet am I not using no I'm not using it here where am I using it here classes I guess it would have been faster for me not to try a copy and paste that Oh don't need these all right let's see if that works yeah that works awesome let's get rid of that mess okay so now we can't use these these classes so we're gonna make for now just two spans we're gonna make probably make this atone component at some point there may have been something in material UI that would work better for this like a list component maybe we should use that let me just try this first and then maybe we can check out the mature UI documentation quickly to see if there's something premade that might be better for us to use rendered so we need to set a title rendered we need excerpt I don't know if we have suitable excerpts for everything we're gonna find out here in a second Wow okay Wow hmm I was not thinking that we would get HTML tags in with our excerpt didn't really want that okay yeah Joey says need dangerously said innerhtml yeah I am yeah that's what we need to display that properly I I think I don't want the HTML to be rendered so that's this kind of a problem with the data right now there may be a better way in WordPress that I could strip out the tags there hmm yeah often work on that WordPress so for now I will display these until like as is so I'm gonna do a little bit of styling here so let's go title we're gonna make this font size 24 pixels it's got 24 pixels font weight font weight is 400 and I'm messing this up there we go and then let's go and then excerpt is gonna be font size 18 pixels and then weight we're gonna set to 300 okay now let's see what kind of a difference this makes this phone is here Johannes why do we have this in here sake get rid of that okay so this is a little bit easier to see where everything is wow that's huge for an excerpt yeah Wow I'm gonna have some serious data cleanup to do if we're gonna be able to do this search like I wanted to Wow michael says at this point we wouldn't blame you for cursing your predecessors yeah alright how are we gonna handle this okay here's what I'm thinking right now we can't rely on the excerpt or content to be in any type of format that it needs to be in I don't think I'll have time but I still don't have a date for launch so I don't know I don't know when we're gonna launch I need to be kind of ready to launch let's say at the end of this month but we could realistically have two more months I don't know so let's say I only have till the end of this month before we launch I don't think there's any way that I can go through every piece of content and clean this up or even add in an extra field of my own type of description I can't do that so I think we're gonna have to just stick with the titles of the pieces of content yeah it's got to be that so we should have alright let's have the data that we can have this should be somewhat decent the titles they will need some work but that's a lot easier than changing large chunks of text so I I probably would have time to go through and change titles and then the content type so we can display the content type and the title in between those things perhaps we can give the user enough information alright let's do that the third thing that we need to worry about that I don't think will solve today's where do we then send the user right like what right now WordPress has no idea what the page URLs are so when we display this do we are we trying then to send the user to a page and the site or would we want to just display the full content to the user I mean they're gonna expect to go to a page right yeah I mean I think we need some way to link up the main place where a piece of content would exist on the page to a URL based on a content type we should be able to do that okay I just want to get that out there so we can think about it I'm not gonna try to solve that problem today what we are gonna do today is try to pull in content type and let's try to pull in well we already have the titles we're actually we're going to need to put the titles in through what's the dangerousness at enter HTML because we have special characters like this that won't display without it alright so let's do that let's do that now let's get rid of this and instead put item I think it's type so item type and then let's go to to uppercase is a thing right to up for kids so it is alright and instead of this let's put let's call this type and let's change this a bit type and we're gonna make this I guess that's fine we didn't really have to do to uppercase there we could have done it in CSS yeah let's get let's get rid of this because let's do it in the CSS the reason I'm going to do this is because this is gonna come through kind of weird and actually it's probably going to have some hyphens in it so we may need to pull those out but for now let's do text this text transform yeah text transform there's an uppercase or capitalized I think it's uppercase and then for this we need to do dangerously set enter HTML it's an HTML like that yeah equals and then what are we doing in here is it double I think it's double I always have to look this up HTML and I think this is how you do it okay that looks all right and we do that we don't need this here anymore you can just close that tag okay all right okay so yeah I did something with the dangerously set innerhtml they said it okay so it is capitalized I was right the first time so yeah I definitely want yeah I'm gonna need we're gonna need to transform these somehow at the very least I want the send me my door no I think they're just unloading equipment right in front of my door we need to remove the hyphens but I'm not worried about that for now I just want to get this displaying oops no must be in the form of oh I need double double these yeah all right cool so now we have the special characters this fling and now we know what the type is all right wonderful all right let's check I'm checking the live chat just to see if anyone had any suggestions about what you were just doing Joey says react HTML parser might be better practiced and dangerously set in our HTML yeah you're right that could be better usually when I have like when I have control over what data's being pulled in it's coming from from sources they really like media people my team are gonna be the only people who have access to I don't worry about it as much but in general you're right it is a good it would be a better practice to use something a bit more secure I Nicky's trying to get my attention would is let's see alright I'm not sure what was going on all right so this is not shake my time seven minutes yeah this is not really good looking we could make it a bit better I did say we were gonna check out the material UI documentation so let's let's do that quickly now I think I missed I want to see what that popup was no anyway demos there's a list yeah it's not really what I want not the grid let's see what the expansion panels look like yeah I don't think I want expansion panels here that's pretty cool okay so I think we're good with what we have what I'd like to do is add some space between these maybe maybe even will try space it first so okay John was trying to get my attention so what let somebody see what's up John okay mark down to JSX will work what all right so what are we what are we gonna use markdown to JSX for let me know why we should use markdown to JSX I'm not I haven't used it before okay so I want to move this up and let's make let's call this classes starts search results so for our search results let's go with margin all right let's check that out see what it gives us okay a little bit more space you can definitely tell what's what actually this entire thing needs to be placed in our kind of grid that we've had on other pages so constant continue let's shout out let's pull this content container out of here and just try it over here on the search and see what we have layouts he puts this yeah shhshh alright so this is just some like basic layout styling right now we just want to wrap the container or we want to have a container around all of this he was from oops I was using theme is not defined what's I can't use theme I gotta put theme in here okay and my timer is going off now I'll see if that did it No area okay so now we have a little bit of space there so that looks nicer so basically we just we added this container that gives us various widths depending on how large the screen is that's where these theme break points came into play so these are built into material UI so when we bring in theme we're able to use those built in break points and you can see we we made a container out of this div that just contains all that basically everything on our page you know except the the app bar all right so that's that's as far as I think we're going to get today you can see basically where I'm kind of going with this is that we will have clearly marked content types and then titles right now the titles are a bit of a mess but we are going to clean those up and yeah so I think it'll be we're gonna have to add a link to link users to a page that they can get more information obviously and then we still need to create a bunch of ways to sort the data and filter the data okay so let me just let's commit this then I'll go to the live chat answer any questions that anyone has to get an oops yarn see oh I apologize this font was probably a bit too small for you all sorry about that so it's yeah that's pretty much it okay great that passed ooh kids push all right so all the changes are now in github and I'm gonna scroll back up to where we left off at in the live chat and I'm also gonna take off my sweater it's really hot in here I don't want to turn on the fan and you know have all that extra noise so excuse me a second it's not even really cold enough for a sweater here I don't know what I was thinking when I wore this today okay so we left off now michael has said just got here no Ambridge today ya know Amber's today if you watch the stream that I did yesterday on on my youtube channel my son Ambrose was there he's three and then my daughter Cordelia is one I'm gonna oneandahalf something like that was also in the in the video my wife may have made it on I don't know if she made it on camera or not she was in the room and so it got a little crazy with with the kids there and at one point Ambrose was running behind me with just the shirt on and nothing else he went to the bathroom and couldn't put his underwear back on luckily it did not get on camera alright let's get I'm just growing down now looking for questions while it says for search page autofocus the input bar that is a great idea I definitely definitely want to do that I think that's that's an awesome feature the website can I use does that and I love it every time I go there I I noticed that and I'm so thankful that it just saves me a click and usually when I go to can I use like I know exactly what I'm looking for I just want to look at it really fast it's perfect so yeah I definitely want to do that that's a great idea smiler says hi cool beard when I saw you last time you were without a beard I was I was that was probably a while back a couple months ago at least yeah so right now I have have the beard I'm thinking maybe I'll keep it for a while I kind of thought about shaving it recently I don't know let me know what you think should I keep the beard should I shave it I don't know why I'm thinking about shaving it may I'm just getting bored with it but let me know what y'all think michael says you don't need a search page you just need a search results page yeah I mean I I agree but you know essentially a search page in the search results page you're going to be the same thing it's just going to be a page wherever you display results you know the only question is are we gonna have another search for or not either way I mean that the page is going to look almost exactly the same I think there's a discussion about buying laptop versus desktops and different things so I'm not going to read through all that hopefully if this new feature works like it's supposed to on YouTube you all that watch this later will be able to read through that discussion as well trade Oz says hi Jesse your thoughts on typescript I have not used tight script myself I mean I've like read over it in some repos they use it I think typescript is a cool idea I could see how it would be useful I don't like it enough for me to use it but I haven't really had a lot of experience with it so I could see why typescript could potentially be a better way to do things so I wouldn't adopt tight script like across the board but potentially like for a specific project it might not be a bad idea to require typescript on on a project yeah so I don't know I kind of think it's so it's correct me if I'm wrong but the typescript could potentially I don't like it it makes your code I don't know how to say this so this is my take on Titan script like I said maybe I maybe I'm wrong I don't know a lot about it but typescript is basically a more strongly typed version of JavaScript I mean it's it's still JavaScript right but it's it's like this layer on top so potentially typescript would have the same advantages as a strongly typed language it would be harder to write bad code or insecure code so that's why I'm thinking like depending on the project if you really needed you know that those type of safeguards I could see it as being important but on most projects I'd prefer to use regular JavaScript it'd be accessible for more people to be able to read the code and contribute so anyway that's my thoughts and if I'm totally missing the point of typescript please let me know I guess I I have not done that much with it and I've seen very little typescript code so I could be getting it completely wrong see michael says this stream reminds me that I'm not the only geek in the world of course I get upset at my son when he only watches youtube videos with people doing things instead of doing things so here I am Nietzsche says how you updated the branch you used for a pull request when updates happened to the master branch while you're working on it something with a git rebase or as simple as a pool what would be the best way can you let me think yeah I guess you'd have to update your your fork with the new stuff and I can't remember I did this like sometime within the last month and I can't remember how I did it I totally how did I do that it's not something I do enough that I remember and I always have to look it up so yeah I mean I would assume however you normally update your fork that's what you would do and just make sure that your particular branch gets updated with with the new stuff as well michael says d fuel when react drains all your health John says I've heard Django is a good alternative to WordPress I've I haven't worked with Django I've heard it talked about a lot or mentioned a lot I don't really know whether or not like it really is it really would be an alternative to WordPress or it exists kind of in a different class so from what I understand Django would be like it's a PHP framework or library so Django might be to PHP what like angular is to JavaScript something like that I don't I don't know if that comparison is correct exactly but yeah so it seems to me though that Jenga would take a lot more knowledge about coding to use and WordPress you don't have to know anything about coding to use WordPress if you really just wanted to so that's why I think WordPress might be in a different class and ennis it's Enes and it says why don't you put semicolons so I'm using JavaScript style guide it's called like standard style so standard yes and you don't need to use semicolons with that so they're all they're very few and rare cases where you actually need a semicolon or else it changes the meaning of your code so of course in those cases I would most certainly use a semicolon but I've never come across one of those cases in my code not that I can remember so I prefer not to use semicolons because given the choice between writing more and that more doing nothing or writing less of course I will choose to write less but I'm cool with people who like semicolons so this is your entirely free tool of semicolons are not in this live chat michael says the difference this is the difference between frontend and backend devs the frontend devs want to make it look good the backend devs want it to be right yeah yeah and I'm like stuck in between right now so I I want it to look good MB right let's see Jeff says can you limit the display text to a certain length I can we could definitely limit the text for now though I think I'm gonna try to just not have the text because I mean the date is not in good shape I'm not even sure that all of our data like all of our posts even have Xers I mean we could just pull in the actual text and this give a little bit of it but I I don't know I think it's going to be weird I'd rather show less and have that less look better then just dump a bunch of stuff on the page that potentially might not even make sense see Joey says there's probably an HTML parser package that could be used I did something like that with Python a few years ago yeah yeah for sure and I think someone mentioned it a little later on in the stream michael says don't do it don't do it was it when I was putting in danger as I said enter HTML it's not quite as dangerous as it sounds as long as you for sure know what's going to be put into that that element well Jeff had mentioned putting a link to the page and your attire you're right that definitely needs to go in there josephus is this Quincy no this is Jessie I just volunteer for free code camp camp Quincy is the man in charge so occasionally he does stop in and in the live chat but I don't think he's watching today michael says was the search a big problem in your previous meeting if not why stress it did come up in one of the meetings think yeah you know and I don't remember exactly what we what I even said about it in the meeting but I just know so the search is a feature that we definitely want oh I know I remember now how it came up yes so it is it did come up there right now people weren't happy with the current search and you know they want it to be better so I did talk a little bit about how the search was going to function so I need to you know come through with that at some point the reason I'm focusing on the search right now is because when I'm not streaming I need to be moving data over and getting it in better shape which is pretty boring so I'm trying to do things on the stream that I don't know a little bit more interesting and have some kind of immediate visual feedback so I think that that's better for streaming so that's why I'm working on the search stuff right now it may not be a hundred percent necessary right now at this point but it's definitely a feature that I think we should have for launch people are going to expect the search okay so John was mentioning markdown JSX a while ago and I had asked him to explain more about it so he says markdown JSX will make the HTML markup read as JSX markup even though you're bringing it over that string of HTML okay yeah you're right that that would make sense John says you wouldn't have to bring over all the content but maybe a preview of the first few sentences or so as it shows in the search results yeah Nietzsche says yeah strip the HTML tags from the excerpt and truncate the excerpt Michels say did I do the pull request right what pull request did you do pull request through this repo did I miss it or are we talking about a different repo let me know okay Joey says I didn't use yarn cm I'm guessing I should use that for all future commits yeah Joe please use yarn cm for four commits it's it's okay it's not like a huge deal but we're trying to keep kind of a standard commit message structure so yeah try to use that next time oh excuse me he says get that go time for lots of french fries bye everyone please give me feedback on the PR and get up okay I will try my best to look over that pull request and get you feedback sometime today if I can and Wow I really wish I had lots of french fries I'm kind of hungry right now Oh John Hanson says focus on an employee input field will not work and react when set in the HTML input element has to be set in j/s though it can be buggy depending on what else is announcing and how many other listeners are in use okay that's good to know so that that will not be as easy as I thought it would be okay oh I need to correct something I said earlier so Joey and Nino tell me that Django is a Python framework my apologies I was mixing up Django with laravel sorry about that so for whatever reason I mix up Python or Django and Largo so Django is a framework for Python and then if you want a PHP framework laravel is the way to go so that's the better comparison so comparing I believe and maybe I'm wrong on this too please let me know so comparing Django to WordPress I don't think is necessarily like an exact comparison there but laravel and Django would be a better comparison let me know disclaimer here I haven't worked with any of those frameworks so please don't take my word for this I I haven't taken the time to learn about any of this oh I brush it and just say shouldn't say anything I don't want to mislead anyone ok Michael's talking about the node Resource Manager rebo oh ok Oh Michael off to check that out so I've kind of been like honestly I've kind of been putting that stuff on the back burner burner since I already turned it in and I've had you know a lot of requests coming in for this project and then we have that Java Script AF side project as well which I'm finally starting to actually you'll get ready to do some work on because I haven't had time so apologies oh I'll try to take a look at that as soon as I can alright well I am to the bottom of the live chat so thank you everyone for watching and for all your help and your advice definitely I definitely got a lot of good opinions I always like that gives me a lot to think about and the end result always ends up being way better than what I intended I might be back tomorrow tomorrow I got a short day and I have a presentation I can't remember what time my presentation is so if I do stream tomorrow it may be at a weird time maybe not at our normal time but yeah so make might see tomorrow maybe maybe next week either way I hope you all have a great day maybe a great weekend and hopefully I see y'all back here for the next stream or will work again on this search function all right thanks again see ya
