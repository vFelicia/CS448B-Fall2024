hi in this video we are going to cover computer security now in computer security there's a couple things that you guys might already know but you might not and how to keep your computer and your files safe now the first kind of thing we're going to talk about is something called a dictionary attack and this has to do with your passwords when you're creating a password some sites make you do you know a special character here and more than one number but nonsequentially and you know like you have to have an extra letter that doesn't i mean they could be really really specific on how complicated they have to be and it's actually a little bit unnecessary the kind of attacks they're trying to guard you from are these dictionary attacks which literally there are computers that are programmed to go down all of the words in the dictionary and try them as passwords for every username and assistant for example so if your password is kangaroo they're probably going to break into your account now most people's passwords are not this simple but that doesn't matter they're trying to mass attack everybody's account with this type of strategy and all they need is one or two people or one or two percent of the people to have these simpler passwords that are just a word or numbers that are in order now in general when you're creating a password you want to have some capitals some numbers some symbols sure but one of the best ways you can mix it up is just to throw some random letters in there to really make sure that it's not a word that they're going to find in a dictionary it's not a common name nothing that's too sequential if you will now phishing is have you forgotten one of those emails that's from like amazon or they say you're they're from visa and they need you to log in and fix something right now or else you're gonna lose your account you're gonna be fined and you know they come up with all these great reasons why you need to log in right now and they provide you the link fishing is something that generally targets the older population that doesn't know necessarily the difference between an actual amazon.com and what looks to be amazon.com there are two ways to safeguard yourself from phishing one look at the address in the browser if it says amazon.com you're probably safe it also should have an https that little green thing next to it to ensure that it is actually amazon another way to do it is to just exit that email open another browser go to amazon.com and see if there's any alerts there most likely there won't be unless it's obviously a real threat encryption and https now if you're at your bank or you're on your website for your bank maybe you're doing it from a public place maybe you're at starbucks and you're in the wifi you need to check your bank you might be worried about your password security and you should be anything that's sent along these packets might be intercepted by someone else what you want to look for is the https because that means that the site you're sending the information to is encrypting your information encryption is just a scrambling up of all the data and unless you have the code to unlock the encryption it's just googly arc just means nothing in general whenever you're showing private or sensitive information you want to check for an https to make sure your information is as safe as it can be i have a quick addendum about https while https will protect you from people outside of your network if there's anybody on your network who like is connected to your wifi or maybe wire with a wire connected to your internet connection https doesn't protect you from anybody there so you still want to be careful when you're on public wifi connection um a couple other general tips don't share passwords between important accounts uh say your password's a very strong password but if for example target.com gets hacked into and that password there is the same password you have for your bank and your email you might be kind of out of luck um also don't download strange files a lot of these kind of trojan or malware or viruses that happen are in files you need to download they disguise them as well as they can but if you're it's not from a trusted site uh you want to check for that dot pdf or dot txt or jpeg uh if you don't recognize that or it's not if you think you're downloading an image and it's not an image file format don't download it it's that's too fishy and once they're in there they can pretty much run your computer uh from the inside so it's pretty scary stuff um another way to keep yourself protected is keep your software updated specifically software that uses the internet and interfaces with the internet one way that the bad guys are trying to get into your computer is finding holes and gaps in security of older versions now those bugs have been patched in new versions so if you continuously update your security and update your software you're not going to have as many problems so these are really just like basic things basic things you should know about how to keep your information safe on your computer
