hello everybody we are going to get started momentarily and we're just going to wait for this to get started say hi in the chat i will try to pronounce your name i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to most of the time i can't so people end up getting offended i'm just going to close that out here we go hello jvs that's my admin on my discord server casper the ghost hello we're just gonna wait for people to filter in okay see i already can't i'm just gonna call you pera santi what's up patel hello logical programmer cardinal that is a moderator so you better behave yourself all right now they're just coming in too quick but yeah we're going to get started very soon very excited for this we already have 110 people watching all right all right logical programmer the first high was enough all righty i'm excited from brazil hello hello if you want to see my discord server you can go to my youtube channel which i'll show you in a second all right wow 363 already watching all right awesome so you know what i think we're going to go ahead and get started all right so first of all for those of you who don't know me and many of you do because i have my own youtube channel i've been doing this forever for the last 10 years i'm gary simon i've been a ui ux developer and a frontend developer as well did i say ui ux developer i should say designer and you and a frontend developer as well for the last 20 years and i've been an instructor for the last 10 years and i've produced many courses um over 800 videos on my own youtube channel and my goal is just to help people become better designers and frontend developers but for this stream we're not going to be focused on frontend development at all which is strange because we're coming from free code camp right um that's why i thought it would be really interesting to do a live stream here where i introduced some design concepts and the understanding of ui design fundamentals to for those of you who are frontend developers or just programmers who have an interest in design all right so right here i'm showing you at this site designcourse.com it's going to be relaunching very soon in several months time if you want to learn and you want to be able to be notified when this officially launches we're working on a hard now enter your email go to designcourse.com and you will be notified when it launches so here is my youtube channel you can also i check this out it's just design course the link is here in the description of this video and go ahead subscribe up watch my channel i'm uh usually uploading twice a week along with am i i do a live ui ux review usually once uh a week maybe sometimes once every two weeks so it i'm gonna be doing the same sh i do the same show all the time on my own channel so if you like this go ahead and check that out and now we're going to talk about you know i something that plagues a lot of uh beginning designers or perhaps if you're a front end developer or a programmer already and you want to be able to design so i'm going to first talk about something that's going to sound really unrelated tennis all right so i'm sure many of you if you ever tried to play tennis or golf or bowling or any new sport you're terrible at it at first i mean your first time you show up you're not sure how to hold the racket hopefully you know at least to hold the handle or the grip i but you're just terrible at it right and it's interesting because when it comes to ui design you're able to watch and you're able to look at another great design you're able to observe and say hey that's a great design you're able to look at a tennis player like roger federer and say hey this guy is a great player so we're great at observing design in sports in greatness i but we're terrible at creating it so why is that well simply because you lack the muscle memory and you also lack the fundamentals the understanding of the fundamentals so when it comes to ui design the reason that you can observe and say hey that's a great design but you can't create it yourself is because you lack the fundamentals you lack the understanding of ui fundamentals and you also probably lack the muscle memory you haven't done it enough all right so my goal in this stream is going to be to help you pinpoint the areas where you're failing in your designs all right and so this i can do this very quickly i could take a look at most of these lines i i haven't seen yet and i'm going to be able to say okay this is wrong this is wrong that's wrong and so this is going to help you understand even if i'm not look if even if i'm not critiquing your own designs you're going to be able to basically you're going to benefit from it even though i'm going to be looking at other people's designs so don't get dis discouraged if your design wasn't chosen so first of all how do you submit your design well you just go to twitter and the hashtag live ui ux review it's also mentioned here right there that's the hashtag that you want to use live ui ux review and just submit uh your design it could be a live website i it could be maybe a figma prototype or it could be an adobe xd prototype or whatever it could just be a flat jpeg mockup screenshot it's it's really i'm not too picky about that all right so we already have a few that we're gonna get started with so the very first actually the very first entry came from roxanna and this is uh what she produced right so we're going to close these tennis players out all right so this is her design as you can see we're going down here oh by the way i will also ask you guys to rate it so in the chat here in youtube i'm going to ask you to rate these designs from a scale of one to ten and i'm not gonna look at your answers i'm not purposely going to not look at your the uh the youtube chat and then i'm gonna see if my answer aligns with yours all right so we'll get to that here in a second so i this is i'm not really sure exactly about what's happening uh it's obviously like a nutrition uh maybe a diet sort of site a service of some sort but i can notice a couple things right away that are immediately wrong first off is the navigation the navigation you can see the links are home about us in meals however there's not enough white space so when i was talking about ui design fundamentals and how it's so important to understand those things white space or sometimes referred to as negative space is one of those ui design fundamentals so there's not enough white space between these elements so if i kind of uh try to scale this up a little bit more you see there's hardly any white space up here they're really cramped together so that that that makes it difficult to use which results in a ux issue a user experience issue so you want to spread those out further away from each other first and foremost second off i would say it's a little bit strange to have this large area right here i get out of here what are you doing i'm trying to get that off there we go all right this large circle right here so i would definitely scale that down because it's just it's taking a lot of attention away from the eye to an area that's not that important the search bar is not that important next up we see we have this really cool i like the design here and the the creativity it's kind of like a graphic design this is a strong part of this page here so far um but i think what needs to help to be addressed here a little bit more so is having a call to action you should always have an area where it's immediately identifiable where the user should go whether that's to click a link fill out a form or scroll down now we do see right here it says scroll down with a tiny little arrow but that's not obvious enough so you'd want to maybe perhaps take that scroll down area right here put it maybe underneath this lorem ipsum text this descriptor and with when you get into html and css maybe make it anime up and down to catch the tension of the eye all right so coming down further you would probably want to avoid big walls of text like this um and also if you do have two paragraphs which you do you want to create that white space that's separation between them coming down further this part is pretty good like i said though a lot of people when they're on a landing page and for a service or an app or a website of some sort they don't want to read a ton when they're on the landing page they're just kind of scrolling down so i would probably reduce the number of uh words that you have here in the verbiage um yeah and this is a pretty pretty good though there's a lot of good things happening i like the colors though uh the color and contrast all is working well i like the use of photographs so there's a lot of good things happening here so what do you think this person should get for a rating let me know in the chat one being the worst and then 10 being the best and then i will let you know here in about 10 to 15 seconds about what i think this one should be rated i should have the the uh jeopardy or wait is that yeah the jeopardy okay i won't sing again sorry about that for me i'm gonna go ahead and rate this one which i see nobody is bothering to rate it there we go we got run one rating i'm going to give this one there is a lot of white space in between here probably too much between this as well okay i'm going to give this one a 6.6 yes i'm doing decimals somebody said 6.5 they got very close but yeah pretty solid overall so thank you for that submission roxanna all right so next up we have from a user of sama let's click this all right i'm going to refresh these just so if there's any animation we'll see it all right so this is from assam and this is a by and it feels like i need to right here we're at 100 zoom the default zoom i'm going to go ahead and increase this it feels like at this viewport width which is you know i'm on a 4k resolution monitor i there's too much white space around here so you want to fill this out more and make sure you're adhering to because this is an html css javascript already you want to make sure you're you're really targeting all of the potential uh viewport or the resolutions and i feel like you can probably fill out the space more by making these a little bit larger first and foremost so you remember uh in the previous entry when i talked about having a call to action we are lacking a call to action here entirely so first of all there's nowhere i can't scroll down on this so it's just that this one page right here or the above the fold so to speak um so i can't scroll down and all we have here is a an area um where it says you know if you have any questions uh or any queries feel free to get in touch on twitter or via email i'm going to make this a little bit larger so we can all see it and then the email or the call to action right here is just a plain text it's not even an ahref mail to form so it's not even a clickable link i this is the email so this is a really bad call to action uh because you want to make it as easy as possible for people to contact you especially on the context of your portfolio where you're trying to get work you don't want people so this isn't a ux issue this has nothing to do with ui design um you don't want people have to work extra in order to hire you or contact you for a quote or just to hire you so at the very least make this a clickable link but even more so than that the ideal approach for here for this situation is i would completely get rid of the email and i would put in a section an actual clickable button that looks like an identifiable button that really stands out like a call to action button should uh where people click on it to view your work why would somebody contact you if they don't know if they haven't seen your portfolio so that's a big thing here so in terms of i in ux there's something called information architecture also in terms of ad copy i i wouldn't be directing them to just contact you right away you do have a link up here to your portfolio but that's not good enough you you want to make this main hero section as it's called this whole section up here you want to make it directed uh and really focused on the area that makes most sense for what the user wants all right and sometimes you know we have to make assumptions but when it comes to you user experience design you'd also want to get feedback from real users and say hey what are you most interested in seeing uh is it is it my email address or is it maybe my portfolio so i've done enough of these to know that it's the portfolio that's the work that they want to see the most so put a link to your portfolio or a button that's real identifiable as an actual button and then also i would put maybe a secondary call to action because you can have two of them to your actual i would say email address or a way to contact you also another side note when it comes to your portfolios always have a way for them to contact you with a form on your website all right don't just put in an email address or make them click this to to load up their email why they could be on their phones and maybe their email client or they don't have an email map app that's set up on their phone so that's a missed opportunity they might forget when they get home always have a form on your portfolio so people can contact you all right so that's really maybe mainly this is a ux issue for the most part looking at the ui design and and how it's actually designed it's it's not too bad i don't see anything that's really coming out and just you know being hundred percent wrong but these are major ux issues here so given what we've seen here what do you think this person should get for our rating one being the worst and 10 being the very best we'll see if most of you agree all right let's see i think you know i'm going to be factoring in the issues of the ux so this isn't just about what it looks like it's about you know those ux issues as well so on a scale of one to ten i'm probably going to rate this one a i can see you guys are i'm not trying i'm not looking at your your answers yet i don't i don't want to be influenced by other people i'm i'm just going to say a flat out four all right now if i were only looking at the ui design you know it would be a little bit higher than that not much higher but the ux issues were hurting it for me and it looks like a lot of you i pretty much agree i see a seven up here i see uh threes a bunch of threes actually so it looks like we were pretty much agreeing for the most part all right so let's close that one off and i'm going to pick out the next one and again if you want to submit your design i'm probably not going to get to it because we have so many entries already we you can go ahead to twitter though and do a live ui ux review hashtag with your entry so let's click on the next one all right i made this website for a school please check it out this is from ahmed all right so what i think when i see this design which by the way i haven't seen it yet this is the first time i'm looking i i i think to myself kind of a little bit boring and bland um with the gallery just kind of like a gallery starting right away i i think it doesn't have much semblance of a structure structured ui design where you know you're utilizing like a hero section to do something interesting and say something interesting a lot of people if they didn't know exactly what type of site this was which i do because it's for school you told me already they wouldn't know right away what this site is about we i really wouldn't know i i don't know what's happening by the the logo so you're making people guess and again this comes down to a ux issue i you want people to know within the first couple seconds what this site is about i all i see is somebody who's giving a speech it may not have anything to do with school so that's one of the things you want to address with a strong headline your ad copy is very very important uh the copy that you use on your site a strong headline sometimes you can use a sub headline as well to to elaborate a little bit more um but just having a photograph here i just i wouldn't do that i try to try to actually formulate it into a situation where you have a nice hero section um you can still use a photograph maybe as as a watermark photograph or something like that there's a lot of ways you could approach it but you want to address what this site is about so i we have pregrade primary secondary checking this out clubs and societies all right so one thing here on this resolution i we're looking at just the kind of the desktop portion all these uh little blips where you have a title and then the description uh you could put those side by side in at least two columns that way you can save up vertical space instead of having it all listed out you would do this for instance on the mobile version because you just don't have enough space to put them side by side but you want to make sure or you're really wisely using all the space that you have available and then of course if you went all the way out here then you could possibly if you weren't using a fixed container here you could possibly use three columns all right all right so i think that's a good review and outline of what's happening here the type here for the most part is pretty good it's a very simple design so it doesn't necessarily mean that it's bad it's a bad ui design or a bad ux design actually simple is great for you user experience purposes but i think the the one issue here is what i mentioned first and that is an issue of ux i you want to address what people are doing so what do you guys think this person should get factoring in the ui and the uxi issues or the nonissues for this design one being the worst and 10 being the very best i'll give you guys a few seconds to get your answers in and for me yeah by the way try not to spam too much there you there's no reason to spam your answers don't worry i'm not picking out any of you individually to say uh you know i i'm there's no reason to spam please don't do that just sit your answer once that's it all right so for me i'm gonna give this one yeah again we're probably gonna have to rate it on a little bit of lower side just because you know the ux issues and the ui design could be improved so i'm gonna give this one here just a flat out 4.8 or so maybe around five it looks like i'm i'm actually being a little bit nicer than you guys or girl sorry um so yeah thank you for that submission the next one up is going to be from i let's see ammer and this one actually looks pretty impressive so let's check it out all right all right so i'm going to refresh just to see if there's any initial animation there is a loading screen right here all right so i program websites i create websites i develop websites a little bit i would probably change i would change that up a little bit because some of those are a little bit redundant create and develop uh maybe design if you do design um what i thought was uh pretty impressive about this is right here i am a 15 years old front end web developer so this is a 15 year old who made this and it looks pretty nice so definitely i like what i see here especially from a 15 year old one thing i thought was a little bit too small just a tad bit on the small end is it's the type here on this resolution you should probably be up right around here so it's a little bit enlarged so i had to use my my browser zoom i'm at 150 so that's one thing to think about um the call to action they definitely have a good call to action that stands out pretty well i personally would probably make it filled in by default and not outlined just so it sticks out just a tad bit more but that's that's me splitting hairs um i program so i like the headline it's a pretty pretty unique headline and then he expands a little bit further on about you know what exactly exactly his expertises are which is a frontend web developer specialist at vue.js and a freelancer so this is pretty solid um i just think it needs to be a little bit larger so about me for me personally i think that should be work we want to say portfolio more than we want to know so much about you um so you could put two you could put two uh buttons in here and one could be outlined and then one could be filled in because you do want to have a primary call to action and that's emphasized through your ui design so let's see what else i latest projects all right simple enough sometimes it's nice to have these kind of in card formats um so that they're not not just flat out screenshots that are placed on here um there's a lot of different ways but i i would suggest go into google and type in ui design cards and you might get uh some other ideas to to more interesting ideas to to showcase the thumbnails and the information along with them but this is pretty this is this is not that bad i mean i hover over it i can see this sometimes people instead of requiring a person to hover they'll put that at the bottom of the card that way all the information is right there and you're not requiring extra action on behalf of the visitor um coming down here this is pretty good i so another ui design fundamental that's extremely important for everybody to understand is what's called visual hierarchy all right i talk about this all the time and if you're a coder and you're new to ui design you probably never heard of it but visual hierarchy isn't just specific to ui design it applies to all sorts of design like graphic design and print design all that stuff and when it comes to visual hierarchy what we're talking about is we're using our ui design principles our fundamentals in order to place uh emphasis on the most important elements and also to separate elements visually from each other so visual hierarchy i is very important to get right in terms of your typography so what i mean is we have web design here it's a larger font size so the scale that's another ui design fundamental and it's bold i it's larger than these elements right here so you could see there's a clear separation between the title and then also the little informational blips underneath them sometimes you can you can even further uh create a further separation between two different elements in order to create that visual hierarchy through color and contrast even so i can take out my browser tools and i can come down here and we could change this color maybe to slightly less white a little bit less contrast and that will create a further separation between those elements visually which reinforces the visual hierarchy so let me show you so we come down a little bit now if we go down all like this way too much we can see there's a massive separation now between the title and these blips underneath them but that's really bad for people who don't have great eyesight you know they have visual impairments so you want to make sure you adhere to a minimum contrast rating uh the wcag 2.0 go ahead and research that it's the minimum contrast ratios that you should have i so but we can come out maybe right around here if we go up here you can see they kind of blend together the title and the description or these these the subtitles if you will but if we come down here it creates a nice little separation between the two even further so so that's just something to keep in mind i might also take these these are paragraphs and they're separated by break elements i would probably change that because these are lists this is the frontend development topic now i would change these into unordered lists because this is what they are but the reason i'm mentioning that is because you could probably separate those out a little bit further a little bit more white space vertically between each other the contact me all right so this is extremely important i'm really interested in what's going to happen when i click on one of these text fields let's see enter your name don't want to do that you want to have at least a floating label if you're going to have like this placeholder item right here you want to have it floating meaning that when you click on it it will automatically transition above the text field because it's a ux issue again it's an accessibility issue because when you're you should never rely just on placeholder values for your your text fields and your form elements i the reason being if i start typing out my name well i don't my name isn't my name is gary i maybe for some reason i come back or i forget maybe i have memory issues all of a sudden now i have no clue what this text input is about because there's no label there so the best way to to fix this problem either use floating labels or just use a dedicated label that's always visible and your form will be your forms will perform much better all right so good call to action for the send button here and yeah i think that's enough time on this one what do you guys think this person should get a rating for uh one being the worst and 10 being the best you could put your answers in on the chat and you'll see how we'll see how close we align together yeah there's no super chats here that's for sure okay i like what i like the dark theme i really do um the contrast is all working well a lot of things are going right but nobody gets better if i just talk about what's right all the time i really like this section this is this is done well for me i'm going to go ahead and give this one a rating of let's see how it behaves responsively that's good i like what i saw there i'm just going to give this one a it will be our highest rating so far i'm going to give it like a 6.8 6.9 very good thank you for that submission all right so next up we have from a user i build a bitcoin wallet where users can send and receive bitcoins with django check it out and if you like it you can check out the tutorial i made on how to build a similar site on my channel okay they're using some promotion here all right so it's called ging wallet ging wallet alrighty let's refresh this to see if anything interesting is happening all right so these carousels um on hero sections i would opt to completely i would get rid of that one thing that's a big issue as well is the the photographs they're just redundant um they just they're just bitcoins they all look the same i would get rid of that completely instead i would just use keep your keep your headline one of these headlines here have a sub headline and if you want people to create an account now well have that be a part of your hero section right here definitely do that so notice create an account now but it's not linked anywhere what is that about so you're going to require people unfortunately to go up here and click register uh in order to get their account set up so by the way why is that why is that what i can't even see register the type so there's there's a huge contrast that should be white so why not i can guarantee you if if you're sending traffic to this website right now which you're probably not um but if you were and this is what you were launching with i would be able to take your sign ups probably increase them by like 500 percent if we restructured this whole section right here and you got a person to put in maybe one of those form fields like the register perhaps with an email um and then like a get started i that way you're utilizing it's so so much better um so that's my that's my review for here what do you guys think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best now me i'm i'm reading some of the comments i'm not trying to i'm not trying to ascertain if this is legit or not i'm just looking at the ui ux solely don't go here and actually use this site i want it it's not even secure for me i'm going to go ahead and give this based on what i see probably a maybe like a 2.9 or a three or so all right now uh let's check out another one we have another personal portfolio so let's check this out casper the ghost dot me all right so there was some animation let's refresh it all right so one thing right off the bat that's a little bit too fast refresh casper irvinson web developer make it stick around maybe a one to two seconds a little bit more if you're going to have something like that anyhow in the first place all right so visual hierarchy that's one of the things i was talking about this is a good visual hierarchy between these two elements the the person's name which is kind of like a label and then frontend focused web developers so those are done pretty well however we have all the space vertically um what we want to do to fix this issue is fix the um the issue by the way is the fact that there's not enough white space separating the projects and contact section the little buttons the call to actions from the other two elements up here so what we want to do is we want to take these the button container will want to do a margin top he only has 20 pixels so we want to go maybe i'm just going to use m units by the way oops like five maybe seven m units yeah we'll just do six and now things can breathe a lot easier they're not so cluttered additionally i i would use something like flexbox or the grid the css grid to try to get this pushed down uh and center it vertically within this container because it's just up high and then there's hardly anything happening down here so again you know i wouldn't use margin for this we'd use uh place content center or something like that but nonetheless margin top you know we want to push this thing down i not 20 m units more like uh am units or so and now just take a look at this and i'm going to refresh it so you can see the original and just pay attention to how this just feel looks and feels so much better so if i refresh look how it's all just kind of you know it's kind of cluttered up there it's put at the up at the top so these are the things when it comes to ui design fundamentals and understanding them and understanding how to apply them that really make or break a design i'm not saying that this thing is completely broken there's a lot of good things happening here but it can really complete a design so looking at this here i it was an issue of alignment so this whole blip right here was it's just it's aligned up to the top too much too high because it's leaving an uneven amount of uh white space down here and also white space between these elements right here um coming down all right my backpack i like being unique uh in your copy so that's good um all right one thing i also don't like uh which he's this person's not doing here at all i is a lot of portfolios that i've seen do this thing where they show progress bars for their skills don't do that because you you don't really want you you might be ha you might maybe you're trying to become hired at some you know maybe google or whatever and they really need somebody who's proficient in javascript but you're putting that you're 10 percent proficient in javascript i wouldn't lay out my cards like that because you're letting people know what your absolute weak weaknesses are if you're if you're a frontend developer and i you know maybe you're not that great at react maybe just don't put react anyhow all right so there's different ways to do this i like okay if you're gonna do this that's fine i think the layout gets broken a little bit when you shift it to a second line right here so the ui design kind of suffers from that if you're going to have this many you can probably use a carousel if you want or just utilize uh or structure this in a different manner to where it's not uneven where you just have two on their own down here all right so now we have some cards right here by the way okay and here's something that we haven't faced yet borders most of the time you don't want to use borders borders were something that were really popular you know back when i got started in the late 90s and the 2000s into the 2010s just about before web 2.0 came along but the borders you don't you completely do not need this border right here underneath projects i would take that sucker out it's a border bottom so i'm going to hide that there you go we've already now we created a pretty solid change here just by getting rid of an unnecessary border because it's completely unnecessary in this context you don't need a border here i you have cards we have the label we know the cards are in relation to this label so you definitely want to get rid of your borders another thing i would change here whenever you have two buttons i'm not usually a big fan especially in this context like on a card of having them styled exactly the same because then it just becomes overwhelming you have all these buttons one should be secondary and not emphasized as much so maybe one is just the same color as this background right here with the view on npm being maybe white or something and you can make it maybe have a border as well i along this button and that way one is a little bit more emphasized over the other coming down here this about me section is quit pretty weak because all it is is just a a paragraph underneath it and it spans the entire width practically of the design and reading that becomes a little bit of a headache so you could put a picture of yourself like in a twocolumn layout and then situate this stuff to the right but there's a lot of ways you could approach it but i wouldn't just do this um in and of itself one thing that's also throwing me off the about me is a little bit like gray but the main content is white i would reverse that all right so i like this section the most i'm not sure if you've used some sort of like um what do you call a library or some type of you know component that was predesigned but i do like this the most all right so right here last thing the form probably i i would take the especially on this resolution right here it makes sense to keep it like that but when you have it all the way out here these are really long form fields take it and create at least two columns take the enter your name your email can go right next to there and that way you're saving space vertically as well but at least you are using the labels which is great all right so what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the very best well the timeline is selfmade well that's very uh that's impressive i like this timeline a lot that's this right here is the strongest part of this ui design all right get your answers in i will give mine very shortly i'm just looking at it and just trying to think you know what do i think this person should get there's a lot of things happening right here and the contrast is is solved solid it's pretty simple which isn't bad that's not a bad thing i'm just going to give this one a 6.5 i believe yeah right around there now some people have asked me have i ever given a 10 no i have not there's always some tiny little issue that i can uh i can pinpoint because trust me i've done like 50 60 70 80 of these shows i'm not even sure how many all right so let's check out who is next i all right all right here's another portfolio this is from megan all right so if i refresh this we'll see if there's any animation no there's not which i that that doesn't mean like there should be i just like to show if there is all right so there is a that one issue that i addressed before which is you're not addressing what what this site is exactly about i know it's about you but what is it that you do we need to be a little bit more specific about that i like that you're being you know a little bit unique especially with the topography i like that part um but i do think the navigation over here can have it needs a little bit of work just having these buttons kind of like really separated out and each one of them being their own button encased in this design like that it feels just a little bit i guess you could say it's designed in a manner that's kind of uh amateur i guess you could say or yeah just amateur i would say what i would do in this context if i were you and trust me this is one this is a tip i haven't talked about this here yet gaining inspiration from other designers so i'm going to show you a couple sites dribble.com so most of you may know of dribble.com but it features some of the best uh dui designers so if we go to the popular section here you'll gain a lot of ideas about different ui elements uh if you don't see one maybe you're trying to work on a vertical nav bar or sidebar like megan has right here well i vertical navigation like if i type in vertical navigation i'm probably going to see a lot of different ideas for the designs of vertical navigations and if something really sticks out well to you i'm not saying copy it pixel for pixel but gain inspiration from it when you're a brand new designer and you try to come up with designs from scratch that's a very that's a that's a tough ask i mean you're putting a lot on yourself if you're you're not an experienced designer i'm not saying don't don't screw my words up here i'm not saying go out there and copy things pixel for pixel but i'm saying you need to expose yourself to other designs and other great designs in that way you can start to develop an eye even if it's just through observation so that you can start to apply some of these to your own designs and in fact i would say like here here's here's a real nice sidebars right here these are really nice uh the way that they're done and really pay attention to why they're doing the certain things they're doing notice hers has these little icons right here i'm gonna i'm gonna zoom up so we can see this these have nice icons as well but each one of these being separated out and being in their own buttons and being real far apart from each other kind of just throws off the flow of this this ui design i noticed how like a lot of these examples you know what you want to do is look at similarities between these examples why do they look good why are they so effective well i could tell you one reason is they're they're pretty close together and they're not all in there in they're not all encased in their own individual buttons i and and so that makes it simpler to use um and they also provide a state maybe you hover over them they're going to have their own little design where the background changes in a very subtle manner and maybe another manner where it's actually selected maybe that one sticks out a little bit more but for this these are all i really just encased in their own little world because they're they're separated out far apart and they're also their own uh project uh or the button rather uh so that that's my review here you would definitely want to change this up um and also the other thing that i mentioned let us know more specifically about what you're doing what this website is for rather than just being about you all right so what do you guys think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best where am i from i am from the united states i live in ohio one being the worst 10 being the best i'll let you guys know what i have that problem i say guys all the time i'll let you people know i i'll let you people know what i think here in a few seconds i'm going to give this one for what it is and again i didn't i don't have enough time to go through everybody's like every page so i apologize for that for what i see here i'm going to give this one a a 3.3 or so i think all right all right so next up who is next all right i have one picked out here this is from user colb colby i think all right so this is a behance.net gallery submission so it's it's nothing that's realized yet it looks like it's a it's a messenger redesigned for the iphone so you know as a matter of trying to practice and get better you can do redesigns and and see that if you you can challenge yourself to try to come up with something better in terms of the ui or the ux experience of popular apps so looking at this real quickly i wish you could have like a little bit higher resolution photos to look at this looks really solid though in my opinion good visual hierarchy the type looks good and well separated between each other yeah this looks pretty solid in my opinion oops did i just click off of that oh there we go um this one is a little strange to me because the chat screen we're using two different color schemes so this one's blue but this one changed to uh pink so that's a little bit confusing to me um i'm not sure if that's maybe demonstrating like user color preferences or not but if not you don't want to do that you want to you want to be consistent in your application of your ui design principles and those things being you want to be you want to consistently apply uh your your usage of colors so you want to have a color theme that you use across the whole site and you also want to i apply the same topography the same type of uh margins and padding white space on and all that stuff the scale all that all that good stuff but outside of that this looks pretty pretty solid for what it is i think because there's not enough screens and because it's not highlighted enough resolution we won't bother doing a rating here but it is good i it's probably one of the highest rated so far just by looking at this right here all right um let's go ahead and check out another one we'll do another portfolio i think after this we'll try not to stick to portfolio so much uh let's refresh it to see if there's any animations wait what was that so if you notice if i refresh this there's like text over these little cards and it just it goes away really fast why are you doing that that's strange to me yeah so i want to do that because that serves no purpose there's no way a person's going to be able to read all them and then it just hides so it leaves me angered when you do that now this is cool i do like that that is a cool way we can hover over it and we have a nice uh sequence based animation so that that this works pretty well i would probably increase the padding which will help the white space inside of the container because these are out a little bit too close to the edges so i would increase the padding there that's pretty solid i welcome my portfolio i specialize in ui ux design in front of development so what this person's doing is this they're they're taking the they're taking the visitor straight into probably what they want to see the most the work but i would still probably also have something down here in this big empty open space i that says do you like what you see maybe you can hire me with a button a strong call to action outside of just having their work here so if i click about all right so i like that you did something unique up here instead of just having a paragraph about you uh so that that works pretty well right here um it's a little bit the type is a little bit strange to me because we have a label up here let me tell you a bit about me um i honestly i think what i would do that looks nice see right here when it's on three lines it's nice and centered but when it's not it's kind of it's it's pushed up a little bit so the alignment is off so it probably sounds like i'm really nitpicky but these things matter uh they matter at every re at every viewport trying to get your site up look at this so these are things like if we don't test them well enough and we don't take this browser and drag them in and also try to test them on real devices that we can see big issues somebody might be on on an ipad and they're looking at this and you're like what i can't read the bottom of this or why is this cut off if this person makes a website for me are they going to do this to my site and then this could literally something like this could literally be the difference between getting a two thousand dollar project and then just not getting chosen at all so i would i definitely make sure you address these issues uh as much as possible to make sure nothing bad like that is happening all right so do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best let me know i'm going to wait for your answers to come in i'm not seeing them just yet i think there's a delay happening i'm going to give this one a flat out oh and by the way another thing you know this whole blip here should be vertically centered so that way there's not a big amount of white space just sitting there for this one i'm going to give this a rating of yeah i'm going to give this a flat out just a six and it seems like a lot of you are agreeing with me on that based on upon a quick glance at least all right so we have another one here this one is for a sas project not the css sas but software as a service so this is from user uh daniel all right so let's close this out by the way we've been running for 54 minutes so we'll probably be over here in about 20 minutes or so i will keep on doing this um maybe even longer i'm not sure we'll see how this goes all right so this is a figma prototype so it's not realized in the browser yet with your html and css so understand that and this let's see here so i'm not really sure what this is about the user didn't tell me or i didn't at least read it so unique web home about us pricing contact dashboard save time with unique web the allinone management solution for your minecraft server okay so based on that verbiage now that we know it's a management solution for minecraft why is there no visual indicator that this is about minecraft so we're using these these generic sort of uh illustrations probably got from some site somewhere but they don't say anything about minecraft this is where creating or either yourself but if you're not an illustrator and most people aren't illustrators maybe hiring somebody to come up with a really good illustration for this hero section that indic that indicates that this is about minecraft management so it's about thinking uniquely in order to create a nice relevant graphic here because i had to read the sub headline in order to understand what this is about whereas if i had a visual indicator through either a screenshot or an illustration like this i would have known a little bit quicker that they this is something about minecraft right the login button is too big so scale is one of those things to understand about ui design fundamentals that will help your designs the login button is too big in relation to the size of all the other elements so i would i would i would scale that back also does it make sense from an information architecture standpoint to have a login button be your primary call to action wouldn't it perhaps be maybe something maybe you have a free trial and you have a get started button that would probably perform a lot better people who are already members they're not going to be going back to your website and like clicking this they don't need to click this they'll usually look up and click on a dashboard or a login link outside of that the i would change the card background because it looks like it's in a slightly different hue than this background color so it's a little strange what i like to do um is i like to take this the background color that is sitting on you know what let me do this real quick i'll open up adobe xd and i'll show you what i mean because it's kind of hard to describe what i'm talking about um so this is going to help us just a little bit more so let's say we get this a similar background color so i'll just go here and this looks like it's it's somewhere in the blue desaturated right around there okay so if you're gonna have cards like that sorry i hid the chat let me move this over if you're gonna have cards like that a great way to give them separation is to do this so here's our card maybe we have slightly rounded corners what i'll do is take the background color so now it becomes the same background and becomes visible and then just take this color picker and make it maybe slightly darker i would not change this hue because look how ugly that looks we start pushing up here that's kind of what this person was doing it just doesn't look good so what you would do instead is get that same background color and then just either make it lighter i'm just pushing it up very just very barely like a couple pixels or you can make it darker like right there and so that looks a lot better than what you had before right here so notice how they're in different hues it just doesn't make sense it doesn't look as good outside of that i would probably increase the line height from your headlines right here and then when it comes to price comparison tables this is another great tip you can go to dribble type in price comparison or prices to try to get ideas but you usually want to emphasize one or the other and again you do that through ui design um and also change your verbage sign up sign up sign up so that these are all styled the same you really want to emphasize one or the other all right so what do you guys think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the absolute best i'll wait for your answers to come in for me i think i know what i'm going to get but this one probably yeah again i i hate to give like all almost all the same ratings but this again is probably somewhere around like a 6.2 or so there are some things that are happening well here so i mean there's a lot of good things but those things are really taking away from the overall score all right i we're gonna check out just a few more somebody said attend you must have really loved that all right or it was the actual user all right well it's great to be confident yourself right all right so let's go ahead and check this one out so we're going to write we're going to refresh this all right so there's no animation first thing too much white space up here in this uh the nav bar i'm not sure if that was intentional or maybe it's it's an issue with the html css but you want to get that right underneath where you know these end second tours and travel amazing place on earth might want to rethink that verbiage there a little bit um but the biggest issue is this button this i can see there's a little bit of a gradient in it going from dark purple to lighter purple in the middle with explore being something that you can barely even read what i would do if i can change this easily sometimes depending on what people are doing it's hard for me to change stuff but this shouldn't be that difficult the background we need to change to white we'll make the font weight bold uh font size maybe not that large like that at this resolution this this right here should be like four rem units there we go that's looking better and then this font size should be like 0.7 rem oh wait that was the margin i changed well you get the point uh one point or maybe like two ram units there we go this looks a lot better because you're utilizing the space more effectively because we're on this larger viewport and it's not so small and we've also made this call to action stick out a lot more so contrast is another one of those ui design fundamentals that really helps a design come together if i refresh you'll see the original and you can see just when those few things are off it doesn't look as good so you want to have good contrast especially when you're using a photograph watermark based background for your hero section all right so that's a little bit uh interesting one problem though i can see the pixelation here i on this so it looks a little bit cheap because i can see along these bezier curves there's pixelation occurring so you don't want that you can actually achieve this uh if you set if you structured your html a little bit differently and use css to create like an svg overlap and that way there will never be any pixelation looking at these cards this is one thing i haven't seen yet um with these reviews is using the drop shadow drop shadows and i've done videos on drop shadows you can do a search on my youtube channel they're not always bad but i see especially you know relatively new ui designers they get it wrong because they they really emphasize the drop shadows too much so that's the case here you want if you're going to use a drop shadow like this a big soft one on your cards make it very almost unrecognizable you don't want them to stick out too much because it always makes it look cheap or amateur or outdated in terms of designs because this is something us designers back you know in the early 2000s we used to do a lot of we thought drop shadows were really cool all the time but that's not so much the case anymore and that's for there's a good reason for that and that's because people don't really care about your shadows they care about the content so you want them to be afterthought as much as possible also i could see these these card backgrounds are actually transparent so that's why we can see this element in the background which by the way is not svg this element right here should completely be an svg graphic not a png or anything that's raster based because i can see all the pixelation occurring again issue with a contrast right here when we have a dark purple and then we're using black text no no no no these should be white so people can actually read them also an issue with alignment we see we have a column structured right here which is defined by the first element being this label but then you're pushing it over just a little bit and it throws off the flow of the design same thing right here this is unnecessary to have this indent indentation or this white space so white space isn't always a good thing you have to know how to apply it correctly a border here unnecessary don't want that creates too much clutter uneven alignment right here and this button button should be white the tag the the actual text so yeah there's a lot of small issues here and it's interesting i could probably take this design and make it go from a rating of about five probably to like eight in the matter of 30 minutes if i if i had enough time to work with it and everything and that's what you can do once you develop that eye and understand the ui design fundamentals so what do you guys think this person should get for writing one being the worst and 10 being the best we are going to do one more because my voice is becoming extremely scratchy we will do one more um and then we will conclude the show one being the worst ten being the best for me i'm going to go ahead and give this a rating let's think here um 5.6 yeah something like that i think that's pretty fair all right i'm gonna check out one more i like to screen the submissions on my other monitor just in case somebody decides to troll me uh fortunately not many people have ever done that all right all right here's the last one cream digital all right all right so how about we do something different for this very last one what do you think is wrong about this section the most let me know in the chat like what does this suffer from the most and i'm talking about ui design fundamentals what like what what is the one thing that could be corrected to really make this design better i'm not asking for a rating seriously people just spamming a rating and i'm not even asking them sharma said light theme alignment bland not enough space alignment font size and white space too much white space it's a boring hierarchy all right so i would agree with the people who said white space of course there's a i mean not white space i'm sorry alignment the one thing that is immediately thrown off is the we have a column that started right here uh based on the first element we see which is the logo um but offset to the left over here is their you know their their headline and sub headline and call to action this should be either moved in to match up with this logo or this up here should be moved out and this suitably being moved out as well another issue somebody said font size i agree it's a little bit too small in this sub headline right here this is pretty good but this should be probably beefed up a little bit more in terms of font size same thing with the get started caption for the call to action also i would make instead of being it being outlined i would make this filled in uh to be something that's well this is interesting why is the okay where's the background background color there we go the background should be you know something more like that and then the color should be white and then font way could be bold um is there a stroke on that it kind of looks like there's a stroke either way that way it stands out so much it stands out a lot more also i probably move it down uh because this is all a little bit cluttered in its own section and there's a lot of white space another thing people said is the white space too much white space so i would fix those issues the learn more button unusually too big i would scale that down i like the the illustration the illustration here is pretty solid i like this one a lot this one's a little bit on the generic side cards here with a ton of white space too much white space at the bottom as opposed to the top so when we're adding white space we want to try to make it especially in the card format you want to make it uniform top bottom right left same white space so probably a little bit too much white space here um coming down all right uh this section is not too bad here we have a small call to action looks really small again when people scroll down you want to give them access to you know wherever it is you're trying to direct them to every page should have a purpose the get cream button down here seems like an afterthought style it like this but make it white so it really has a good contrast down here and it'll stand out much more so let's do a final rating one being the worst 10 being the best let me know what you think and we'll see if we agree and then we will conclude what am i going to give this one let me think here things going right about it the illustrations are pretty nice for the most part good usage of color i like the color scheme for the most part i think a little bit heavy on some of the the linear gradients i like the logo a lot topography is pretty good yeah so i'm going to give this one a flat out let me see here i'm going to give it like a 7 or like a 6.9 or so um and i'll probably be one of our kind of a better ones but i still didn't see anything that really knocked it out of the park in my opinion today but nonetheless thank you all for you know those of you who submitted now i know hundreds of you submitted designs and i was only able to get through like 10 or 15. uh but there's good news first of all i'm going to be doing this again i on free code camp's channel here next wednesday at the same time and also the wednesday after that so this is a three stream session this is the first of three so you guys you can all come back we'll probably have a new hashtag i'm not sure about that for you to submit but i'll talk with uh the people at free code camp about that and you'll have all the details they usually announce the uh the live stream and they they they set it there that their youtube channel so you'll see the details um and also i also i do this show on my own youtube channel over at uh design course so youtube user design course you can i in fact i'm going to be doing this in two or three days either this friday or this saturday on my own youtube channel and it pretty much follow the same format except i use my discord server for you to submit if you wish so go ahead and check that out also designcourse.com that's going to be my new relaunch site i where if you want to master ui ux it's going to be the most comprehensive course i that you can imagine there's going to be video courses there's going to be interactive ui design challenges there's going to be live ui ux workshops i'm really excited for it uh and so it's going to be releasing in several months time i'm not exactly sure when we're working on it now so check that out as well and yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed and girls you all enjoyed everything that i i was able to help with and hopefully it was helpful so i will see everybody soon all right goodbye
