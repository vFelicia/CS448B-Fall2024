hey everybody welcome to live streaming with live coding with jesse and i'm jesse sorry i was a few minutes late thanks for your patience so today before i start anything we've got important business so star wars came out if anybody has seen star wars do not say anything about it to me in this chat or at all i'm gonna go see it tomorrow so if anyone says anything about star wars about the new movie or anything that happened in it then you will be permanently banned from the live chat so no spoilers alright so now that that that's out of the way um we have um we have some data coming in now so i've um i've got some stuff working i'm going to show you it's not working exactly how i want it to uh so we'll have to work on that but i'll show you what we have harshit's done a regular expression that achieves everything that we wanted to achieve from what we were talking about yesterday we'll have a nice slug that matches the current site so that the urls are not broken uh for the new site uh also uh just a little update i have been promising for a while to do a video uh review of the udacity react nanodegree so i did one yesterday and unfortunately when i went to look at the recording my face was cut off like from here from here up it was cut off so you could only see my mouth so i did what it i mean i it came out pretty nice in terms of content uh but i can't use it so uh hopefully it maybe i'll try to rerecord that soon while it's still fresh in my mind and uh and get that up on my own channel but i know a few people had asked about that so i just wanted to give you all an update um okay let me check the live chat quickly before we start let's see okay um it looks like somebody mentioned net neutrality rook did yeah so i'm sure you all have been hearing about the net neutrality thing yeah i guess i don't really have that much of a comment on it because it happened it got repealed i really can't do anything about it uh i mean i know it's good to you know sign petitions and call and all that but at the end of the day they didn't really listen to people that did that so i don't i just don't know what to think about that um so it still might it might be mitigated depending on what else happens with the government but my opinion on this is personally for me is trying to figure out ways to work around it if the worst happens of what is possible with this so um yeah because ultimately if the government says it like that's how it's going to go businesses can do what they're going to do so we just got to figure out some way to deal with it so anyway that's where i'm at now with that so i don't know uh we'll just have to see how it how everything goes i i only have one internet provider where i'm at uh so i don't really have a choice so whatever they do i'm gonna have to deal with unless i can figure something else out so i'm kind of hoping that my internet providers behind the times on everything like way behind the times like you couldn't even they didn't even accept credit card payments for a really long time so i'm hoping that they're still so behind and they just don't even change anything so that's that's my hope now anyway i just uh i'm no expert on that so i just don't want to say too much because i'm sure i'll say something wrong all right so let me i can't forget to switch my screen huh um all right so i guess i could show the regular expression first let me show you that uh because it's pretty cool oops i got it over here okay so i've pushed this up to github so this is that fcc db migrate uh repository on github and now i've added i've just copy and pasted this right from what harshit gave me uh basically we're taking the post content title which if you remember from yesterday we'll have like titles in it like doctor or uh tlr or father so we don't want those in the slug because the original urls don't have those we just want last name hyphen first name all lower case so we take it first thing we do is we make it all lower case then here's the regular expression that checks you can see we're checking for doctor we're checking for father we're checking for t o r and then if we find anything else as we go along that shouldn't be in there we can add it in right with the same pattern so i don't know enough about regular expressions to read everything that's going on but generally this part is pretty easy to understand okay and then we're replacing a space with a dash heart also included commented outs some stuff that just in case we need to reverse the name so right now all the names are in good order but if we come on some that aren't in the right order we could also correct that here so now as this is what we pass in to create the post in wordpress so now we pass in the slug and it's the name so now we have a custom slug and what it ends up looking like let me move some stuff over to another screen uh when i was working on it earlier so let me move it back so what it ends up looking like is this so you can see the slug in this case is haney eric and you can see the title that we originally had was haney comma doctor period eric right so we went from that and then with that few lines that horseshit gave us there it turned it into this so it's perfect exactly what we wanted so now we have the proper slugs and what i've done with that now is so as a test here's what i've done so it's not ready yet so i took i don't know if if you all have looked at the latest updates to the franciscan site repo on github but harshit added this test page to test out graphql and uh and he was doing some other things with that just as a test and it worked but i've gone in now and i've replaced the the test url with the url for our actual wordpress installation into our init apollo file and then in our our test graphql page right so it's in the pages folder here so in our our test file i've added a little bit so i was getting an error that uh it was returning null so i did add this this little bit in here so uh if loading is true it returns loading and then i added this div so there was an h1 there that was displaying some data like a title so i changed and added this also i added this down here so i passed in to sample query as an option i passed in the variable's name all right and that's basically slug right so and i just manually put in haney eric but eventually what i'll do is i'll replace this with the slug that we're going to grab from the url so right now as a test it's hard coded our next step will be to actually use a variable here and you can see in our post.js we have sample query and it has we're passing in name as a string so this then this variable name this dollar sign name goes here so we're looking up the faculty so the the faculty member the faculty post where name is this variable which will end up being in this case haney hyphen eric okay and then i'm just grabbing some data id title slug content and then some data about the departments right which was our category our custom taxonomy if i'm not using all this data right now but eventually i'll probably use it all so i just just added that in and now here's the weird part of what happened so when i did this i was getting a 403 error let me double check that and confirm that it was a 403 uh i've had this open for a while and now i can't get back here we go not the fourth okay so four or three let's see yeah that's all maybe i'll um let's get rid of all this and let me refresh so i'll show you what i got so here's what that page looks like um you don't get the image by default because it's using relative urls so you can see we got that loading first and then the data came in so the images right now are pointing to a folder on localhost that doesn't exist so we'll need to figure out what we're going to do with those but we get all the data that was here right so on this page right the images work we have this data but it's all visible by default and so we we have all of this but it's just you have to click it to actually see it and instead of being in in multiple columns it's all just in one column which is fine uh so that's what we got but if we see we're getting some errors here uh so we're getting a 403 and i'm not exactly sure what the problem is or what's going on but to be honest i haven't really taken very much time at all to look at it what i've done is simply check where the data is coming in because we are actually getting the data so you could see obviously we got the data but here's how it went we've got this props data error network error result data faculty edges and it's an array so we went with the first of that array and then node content that's how we get to it all so that's that first of all that's a long way to go and a lot to write but also we should not have to go into the error section right so something's wrong uh so we'll have to we'll have to figure that out at some point i mean realistically we can still continue on with trying to style this page but at some point i think we need to figure out you know what's going on here i mean realistically though it works right so it's not really the end of the world uh let me check the live chat because i see a lot going on over there uh see if you all have any thoughts on this okay control you i want to see it uh server side render oh okay so all right you want to see open wordpress all right so what do you want to see in wordpress um harsh it all right while i'm waiting uh for harsha to respond i'll answer questions some questions that i saw uh christopher asks what exactly does net net neutrality mean and um all right so like i'm not an expert on this so please correct me if i'm wrong and don't take this as being like for sure you know 100 accurate but it's my understanding that net neutralities were some rules put in place a few years ago i don't remember exactly when um that were supposed to guarantee equal access to the internet and it restricted internet service providers from like throttling um or blocking different um uh different areas of the internet uh from from doing things like charging more for certain places in the internet um making we're doing things like making websites uh pay for like i mean there's a lot of weird things that could happen in terms of like segmenting out the internet and uh charging different amounts essentially they could block some parts of the internet you know really so my my understanding that's my understanding so now because that's been repealed uh there may be some other legal things that have to happen before corporations could take advantage i'm not really sure but now corporations could potentially segment parts of the internet and make you pay more like if you just want to access your email it's so much a month but if you want to look at facebook you have to pay more if you want to look at you know um youtube you have to pay more netflix is more i mean it could be weird too i mean think of an internet service provider got into the business of um i don't know for instance let's say uh like comcast somehow bought out netflix right it's probably not gonna happen but what if it did happen comcast bought out netflix comcast then allows everybody access to netflix but you have to pay extra or it completely blocks amazon prime video and hulu and youtube right so i mean you could have weird things like that happening it's not unheard of that big um you know companies like internet providers have partnerships or parent companies or something with you know going on with this kind of stuff so that could happen uh one of the arguments i think against net neutrality was okay well if you introduce competition everything will work itself out on the market but my opinion like i said this is my unqualified opinion um is that uh normally i'm i'm okay with the fact that market forces work pretty well um with some exceptions right so sorry i'm gonna go off on a tangent here i apologize um so there's some exceptions to that right and one exception being if you have a monopoly already in place with high barriers to entry okay so basically meaning you have a sorry for explaining this at a real low level but i'm sure most you already know some of this stuff but i want to make sure i don't leave anybody out who's who's not familiar with this so you have an industry for example like let's say the automotive industry right there's only a few big companies that control the automotive industry and it was even worse before you know back when you just had like ford uh was the huge company what was it ford and was it chevrolet were those the big ones i can't even remember now but back in the day those were like the huge companies and the barrier to entry to get into making automobiles was huge because it cost so much for all the machinery and everything like it's a big barrier entry there's still a big barrier to entry to get in but not as bad as it was so in that case it may it would make sense for the government to step in and regulate that a bit so that it would make it easier for competition to come in right and it would protect consumers from let's say like the price is being jacked up because they had no no options right so with the internet the same thing is happening i think right so for me i don't have any options for the internet right so for me what will happen is if there's no regulations i'll have to accept whatever my internet service provider gives me because i can't go anywhere else okay it would be more reasonable to repeal net neutrality if people legitimately had options you know if everybody everywhere had let's say 10 different companies that they could go with that gave equivalent service then you could reasonably think okay well if one company does this people just go elsewhere and the company that ends up not doing this is going to get all the business that makes sense right you can't jack up your prices or give somebody a worse product if you know your competition is just going to take all your customers but the problem is there's no competition in a lot of places so for some areas i think they'll be okay even with net neutrality repealed as long as there's enough internet service providers that there is still competition but for a lot of people particularly in rural areas it's going to be bad because they have nowhere else to go if the choice is not between two inter interservice providers it's between having an internet and not having the internet so that's the way that's the way i feel about it so um anyway probably i don't know what's going to happen with it but realistically uh i think the longterm solution to the problem is there has to be more companies that are providing internet something has to happen and whether the government facilitates that a bit you know so be it if it has to happen like that uh generally um and i i studied economics in college so maybe this is some of that coming out but generally i'm against government being too heavyhanded in business because usually they're by the time they actually do anything they're a day late a dollar short so it's like they they're trying to correct problems that really have already worked themselves out in terms of economic stuff and usually their correction ends up causing more problems a few years down the road so i think sometimes it would be better because they're always so reactive right like the problems there by the time they do something the problem's already in the process of working itself out right and in a lot of cases not in every case but in a lot of cases so uh i i think it's a lot of fuss about nothing and they really don't have as much control as they think over economics but in the case of monopoly that is the proper place when the government should step in so in this case i think it would be very reasonable for the government to step in and do something about what's happening and not allow these companies to just do what they want anyway sorry that's my economic uh stream for the day so i'm gonna stop now um all right so back to um a hardship wanted to see the source for wp graphql uh so let's check that out and wp graphql sorry i made you wait for so long harshit uh you could probably see the source code for this as well on their github repo if you didn't want to wait for me i am running version 0.0.22 let's see okay christopher said thanks for sharing it uh no problem no problem yeah sorry for anybody who wasn't really interested in hearing that but uh to give a full answer to that question i had to explain myself christopher says will the validity of information be protected still uh yeah that's another issue as well if you have any info that you really don't want other people to know i suggest using a vpn a vpn that you can trust it's a virtual uh private network and you know ad blocking block your block was tracking you things like that um i mean if you don't really have anything that's that interesting that you don't care if people know then don't worry about it but uh potentially you know if you're in a country that um you could get in trouble for the things you do on the internet um then i would maybe definitely think about doing using a vpn yeah and uh yeah my political views i didn't really get political to be honest with you it was more of my my economic perspective which um i actually don't really identify with any of the current political parties in the united states so i have my views on different issues uh that have nothing to do with whatever people from different parties talk about so anyway but i'm not going to talk politics here but yeah my views are my own they do not reflect the views of free code camp or franciscan university of steubenville all right so let's i'm still waiting search four or three in there okay sorry harsh i didn't see that you um that you put that in there it was my fault so i'm gonna search oh no ax thank goodness that um undo and redo work uh in in the browser in chrome uh okay there we go what was it four or three no all right hmm let me go to get him i don't know i really hate using the wordpress code editor so it's just going to be easier i'll find it on github and then i'll look it up in there hmm no 403s huh interesting oh actually that first one looked their error on object clone is that the air i got it looks familiar could not be cloned no that's all right let me look back change default status to 200 all right so harsha says i should change my default status to um change the full status of 200. all right so let's figure out where i should do this didn't think i'd be looking through php files today all right well this is no that wasn't it uh that error had to do with the dom um hmm let's see all right so i should where i'm trying to find where to put this default status to 200 i'm not sure where hmm yeah so i'm not finding let's see if status i'm not finding anything in here let's see what other so i wonder what else if there are other files maybe actually let me check let me check what i downloaded here okay yeah so it does have all this stuff all right cool our has a link for me here uh let's check this out thank you harshit public status code 4 3. okay router.php all right let's try to find that then so okay set the default code to 403 to represent unauthenticated requests authenticated request should be set to the status of code to 200. all right so i just need to set this then to 200. all right oh that's a lot of caps i saw it maybe there's just a delay um there must be a delay i think uh hardship between between you and i um but anyway it's it's cool i'm getting i'm getting it all right so let's copy that and change it over so what i'm assuming then is potentially if we use authenticated requests this would have worked without a change right uh but yeah harsha you're right we're only getting data so we don't really need authentication anyway uh so this should be okay to change this we just have to remember if we ever update this plugin and things don't work we we need to change that again or start authenticating okay i'm not going to copy all that since it's right here update that and now let's see yeah so now we need to change where we're getting the data right so let's see where the data is supposed to be um i guess this will do first um and i saw somebody in a video and they had some command that displayed the json like in a really nice readable way but i can't remember what it was uh so data faculty edges node okay let's do this let's try this there we go oh it was working what's going on now there we go i just had it zoomed in okay cool so now it is working um oh okay cool so uh harshit has um it says json stringify data comma null comma two formats with two spaces uh and then put that in a pretag awesome i have to remember that i don't often have to output json you know right to the dom like that uh but that's that's really convenient if you can output it in something that is um uh more readable it it worked out well and even in our case because it wasn't nested that far in the data we needed so it was it was okay all right cool so now let's double check our console just to see to verify that we're not getting errors we should still get errors let me clear that and then refresh we should still be getting errors for the images yeah 404 is for the images and yeah and what else okay this is all fine great all right so now we have this let's think what our nuts oh our next step then is to uh instead of passing just this test string we're actually going to pass uh the variable uh so actually let's go back i'm gonna do this uh let's go in now in our console and let's check react and here let's go with our data variables and then no that's not it that's not what i want um what do we need i should be passing url oh okay i know why this isn't working um what i need to do now is let's grab all this and paste it into faculty and let's see paste that into faculty we're going to change this well let's change every instance of test to faculty and what we should be getting i should have paid more attention to this uh is this id let me see if i can find it um let me just save this for now and then let's go to a page faculty and we're going to go i don't remember how this was ershennni eric okay cool okay so that's what we should have gotten the same data but but the url is different now now here's what we should be getting as well is some extra data here um about props but i can't remember where we get it is it the query there it is okay so router yeah router query id okay so let's try to pass that in then uh oops where's our i had how we did this on the bulletin open on my other screen as well just for reference see let's see if this will work um okay not sure if this will work or not looks like it did not cannot read props of undefined i was wondering if i had access to props there i lost my live chat window here it is okay let me let me check the live chat here okay cool so harsh is saying get into props return query all right so let's put put this in here all right this props query see if that works almost dang it what error am i getting doesn't tell me much okay oh i shouldn't have to return off of that right reproperty props of undefined exactly all right where am i trying to get props at all right what am i doing all right so static okay so i lost my um my window again all right so yeah we have static guess get initial prop so harsh just let me know um to do static get initial props all right so i've done static get initial props and then okay so we've already done queries scroll to the bottom okay okay i'm trying to uh i'm not sure how much of a delay there is between horizon and i um okay down and then pass and id and then pass it oh okay all right how should let me know i i just realized from your earlier messages um it said destructure id change match to id okay okay probably edges why okay now i'm not getting if you all uh if you can't see the live chat uh harshit's directions to me now are like scroll down scroll up dude i'm just trying to keep up and then there's a delay between us so this might be a good uh application of the um like the pair programming thing where you can both uh like live code together uh like google doc style i know harsha said vs code has that i know i know they have it it's really hot in my office so i'm gonna take off my sweater so okay harsha's saying we got to do something in get initial props uh then i'm not sure what so all right i want to see all right property edges undefined all right i want to see what data we're getting again query id and get an extra browse okay is that where you met harsher that we're going to return query.id are we gonna grab it like here like query id dang there are probably edges hmm okay harsh it's saying return an object he also said come to uh twitter um i'm on my twitter's always open so if you put anything in there i will see it um all right let's let me show you all what we had done previously so preview in the in project one now we weren't using graphql we were using the rest api but when we got get initial props uh we did something like this where we had query and then id and then we were able to use id uh in here and then eventually would we return the data um let's see and the data ended up we you could access it as this props data so if we did that you should be able to access id as this props id right oh goodness who was that rook okay so rook has noticed that our capitalization is off and get initial props so let's see if that has anything to do with it all right so we're actually still we're still getting the same error which is crazy because it certainly should have made a difference um harsh is saying change id to id like this i don't i'm getting the red line so i think that's not gonna still same error what how um is it still type oak i'll get initiao props all right there we go all right that looks better now no g e t i n i t i a l p r o p s all right so that's that's fine now all right harsh it's saying still return this object id which i don't think i'm going to try to write this exactly how i have it written in the catechetical institute site and it worked static async get initial props let's just go turn it instead all right i'm just spacing this out so i can see why am i getting so many errors so that's weird it's just it's weird that i keep getting the same error no matter what i do up here all right let me see this again so all right i'm going to paste in exactly what i have here and then instead of all this i'm going to return id no all right but then all right let me um oh can i do it like this hmm what did i do messed up some from projects and graphql see twitter alright oh okay closing tag i never put in a closing tag for this h1 see okay type string was not provided okay and it didn't show me this props id what is this at least since we didn't error out we can see what we have here let's check out faculty data all right urls url query id i keep forgetting i already have this props destruction all right okay we got it there i wonder if i even need this i don't i don't even need that part okay all right so let's comment it out i have access to this props url query id all right let's see let's see what i can access here um let's see what i have that's not what i wanted james has is web development rewarding uh financially it can be it definitely can be um there are a lot of good jobs out there uh that that pay uh i mean i've seen jobs listed here in the united states that pay over a hundred thousand dollars uh a year plus you know benefits and all that uh for web development but it varies if you're in a small town you know you're not gonna make that much if you're freelancing it just depends on what clients you get you can make a lot less than that or you can make more than that but in general web development is is one of the it pays more than the average job i would say at least in this country i can't speak for what it's like in in other countries yeah okay so rook ass is get initial props not a vanilla react thing can't find it in the react docs it's yeah it's not a vanilla react thing so get initial props is a next js thing so it's used so for instance in this case we've used it here for our um to make our api calls in a way that will still be rendered server side so anything you we do within get initial props in terms of making these calls and getting the data this will be done on the server potentially it could be done on the client as well it works it works both ways and then that data from this call gets added to props here so this props data is now available so it's very useful in to use with next uh in in this case we're not doing you know we're not putting api calls in every component though like that yeah uh wrote notice we were using async await yeah so we're using async await here which did i when i copied it over did i leave the async i think i did we don't really need to um oh you know it doesn't even matter because i i commented this out all right yeah so i didn't need to keep the async and i just didn't realize i didn't realize that i had left it in when i copied it over all right so we're still trying to figure out let's see let's see all right harsh it's asking for this that sample query all right yeah let me or is it let me paste this sample query in there uh in twitter to harsh it it might let me put paste code i wonder if it'll let me paste code in uh the live chat i've never tried it let's see it's gonna look oh no it's too many characters actually it's not bad in in twitter in the direct message if you paste code it actually keeps all your spacing and indentation really nice bruce says your visual studio code looks so amazing with with layouts yeah this i haven't done really that much you know custom with my visual studio code except i switched to the seti theme that's scti so i switched to that theme and i do have a custom you know custom colors uh for my terminal here um that's about it i have the plugins that i have here are just from uh from the react food truck plugin so you install react food truck and then it installs a bunch of plugins that help you out with react i don't even remember what they all are sorry let's keep yawning okay let's go back to our faculty all right so we now have we know we can get the this props query id um we can pass in wait can we pass it in here um this perhaps queen i don't know if this will work maybe this is silly but i thought it was worth a shot no it didn't work um let's see if i can oh i won't have access to that now will i props yeah i didn't think so um so oh no rookie on two it's contagious i have everybody watching yawn all right so let me think why can't i feel like my brain is just stuck here like i've had this problem before and i've solved it before why can't i think of how i've done this before so query wonderful all right so i need to get sure oops all right so let me bring this over that we worked on before which is very similar and it works so in this case uh this is from the bulletin post detail page which plays you know pretty much this it operates in the same way that this page that we're trying to make operates now we have here we're using react router and it makes available this match um slug we're not i don't know that we're doing anything that do i mean other than using next instead of create react app uh irish it's can you paste the the name what do you want me to pay starship all right let's i would have access to query no i don't i don't have access to query id like that nope still not working all right oh the name okay so um here's the name that we've been using and this is the url that assuming you're you're hosting this locally that's the url that we're trying to get to work do not expect this step to take as long as it is especially since we've done something similar in streams before all right um if anybody is just joining just a quick recap we're using graphql with react so we've used next js to create our react app and we're using apollo with graphql and what we're doing here is we're pulling in some data and we've been able to successfully get this data and display it if we hard code in uh the slug of the post that we want and we're pulling this data from wordpress we've installed a plugin to set up graphql in wordpress but what we're trying to do now is get a variable based on the url and then use part of the url to tell apollo you know what we want what data we want and get that back so that's where we're at and that's where we're kind of stuck right now uh we can get that data successfully if we get this props url query id we get exactly the data we want just having trouble getting that data to get passed along uh the closest we got i think was we got something passed along but what was passed along was not what was expected so they expected a string and we did not give a string so that's where we're at right now uh so we have one of our our viewers and contributors here on the live stream uh harshit is working uh on his machine locally to try to solve this and we're also trying some things here on the on the stream uh to try to try to fix this problem let's see hmm let me think about this okay uh bruce asks would you recommend visual studio code or sublime text 3 or a tool from jet print jet brains like webstorm or similar i have not used sublime text i've heard good things about it i have used visual studio code and i like it i have not used jetbrains or webstorms but it's my understanding that those are actual ides and that for most web development work uh you don't need all those extra features um that i don't know that from experience that's just what i've heard so if you're just gonna be doing web development then i think you'd be fine with visual studio code or sublime text i was under the impression that sublime text uh was not free to use so if that's an issue and you're looking for something that's free then i'd go with visual studio code i've heard good things about you know jetbrains and webstorm though but i'm just not sure that um that it's necessary to have something that fullfeatured and you know potentially heavy uh for web development okay let's see i um i'm going to look some stuff up here on my other screen all right all right harsh it says i'm not getting any data from the server it is returning a null array it is making the request though that's interesting uh let's refresh the page all right so the back end's still working let's oops okay so i am able to get the data still in graphic ul uh dimitar says jesse can you explain more about graphql particularly in this project okay so um the so if you're familiar with uh rest apis that was that's a good way to get data it's a lot of sites use rest apis now but uh in a rest api sometimes you have the problem where you need um you need data from multiple endpoints right so the way a rest ipi is set up normally is you know you hit that end point and you get back the data that that endpoint always gives back whether or not you need it so there may be one piece of data you need from there and you get all this other stuff and then there may be some other data at a different endpoint that you need to hit so to render one page you may need to hit multiple endpoints right that's not very efficient what if instead you could send one request tell the api exactly what you need and then it gives you back what you need and only what you need that's graphql so in graphql you get to say what you need so i'll show you here an example so right now in this we're telling it exactly what we want we want to get a faculty member and we want to get a faculty member of a certain name we want the id the title the slug and the content we also want to know what faculty department they're from and we want the id of the department the name and the count meaning how many members of that department are it do we have so what we're going to get back from that is exactly this data nothing more nothing less if we were to try to do something with the rest api we would probably you know we would want to get the faculty member we could narrow it down to a single faculty member but we would get a lot more data you know instead of just id title slug content we would get the date published the date modified we would get lots of info about we would get an excerpt whether or not we even had one we would get a lot of data i wonder if i still have it i don't think i still have it up no i don't i had an example what we get but basically that's what the benefit of using graphql as opposed to you know the normal rest api which we've used in the past we use rest apis with wordpress and react in the past on projects okay uh harsh it says is asking it says name in the query but you're using slug yeah it does do that but um that's how i got it to work i was reading the documentation and for some reason it was working with name and not with slug and in the documentation it was using name as well so i just stuck with that um it looks like harshit has a pull request that might fix this so we will check that out oh all right bruce says need to go but we'll be back thanks appreciate the input uh no problem thanks for uh thanks for watching and uh for joining in uh in the live chat okay so harsh it's pushing a pull request right now uh so um let's uh let me bring this up and then i'll move it over to this screen and we can check out um some of harshit's code and and how he's um tackled this problem uh dimitar says thanks for the explanation yeah no problem hopefully that was you know an okay explanation of uh why we're using graphql okay let's go back here to faculty.js and let's see hmm probably won't work but why not may as well try some things while we're waiting unexpected error has occurred here we go is it yeah did not work this is a reserved word okay yep not working all right let's check get um all right so harshit's pull request has showed up now on github oh and i see in the live chat he has notified me of that as well alright so let's check this out all right har here's what since there's only a few things that have changed i'm gonna do it here i'm just gonna type it in but uh if it works i will merge that pull request so you'll still get credit for the for the pr um but i think it might be a little bit faster for me to just change some of this so let's go whoa that was really weird that's super weird uh if for some reason when i try to copy and paste from github it's giving me way more than i expected okay um yeah that's fine i'll just remove some of this that's weird i can just get this right okay query id return id all right that's what i had anyway i don't know why i tried to um try to mess with that okay so we're going to switch up here a bit and we're going to make let's see if i can copy this properly there we go and then down here we're going to change this to just be id and you don't need two sets of brackets and then in here this is perfect okay so let's see what we get now okay so i'm getting let's see what we're getting okay this is where we were at before if you remember um probably a half hour ago now we this is the error we were getting here is that we required a type of string but that was not provided so let's see let's see why let's see what's happening here so we should be able to see in um in our react dev tools with this data is yeah faculty and um query id huh that's uh all right let's see i should be able to say hmm all right i'm i'm using the react dev tools extension for chrome dev tools so if you if you don't have this on your dev tools it's uh it's an addon so it doesn't come automatically all right hmm all right let's um bring this back a bit hmm all right so we're still not getting what we need hmm oops let me check i haven't checked the chat in a while um um what this h rook is asking what does hmr stand for uh in devtools um let me see here i don't remember that was oops are we seeing that in oops here we go and the console hmr i don't know what it stands for uh to be honest with you but it's what i always figured it had something to do with yeah it looks like it's it's something to do with webpack hot module reloading that's it the hmr is hot module reloading so that's why when we hit save we can see everything update that's that's what does that i don't know how but that's that's what it's it's doing okay all right so hmm let me try this uh let's see if we're getting uh whoa did it work this time yes i don't know why i do not know why but it worked the only thing that i changed was like console logged id and i hit refresh twice i don't understand that uh now what was is this so yeah here you did a little close yeah all right okay then so let's see what we need uh faculty edges will be this props faculty edges node so the edges zero node content okay so let's get rid of these comments and data faculty edges node content yeah that'll work wonderful let's take this out and see if we can still get the data yay it works all right harshit said uh it probably has something to do with the cache uh i think you're you're right on with that horseshoe we just we kept hitting the cash and who knows who knows how many times we had it right before because i'm sure there's multiple ways to do this yeah martinez is visual studio code available for mac yeah it is it's uh so i'm using it on a mac uh right now um so it's available i think for linux as well so um linux windows of course and mac yay we got it to work okay well we can get rid of this now we don't need that don't need that either wonderful wonderful okay all right just trying to clean things up i think it's pretty clean yep awesome all right good status and let me push this to github actually yeah hold on let me push this to github i'm trying to figure out how i can do this and still merge harshet's pr i'll still merge it and just fix the conflicts um i don't know um so yeah all our tests rain wonderful okay great all right so anyway horseshit i'll pull your i'll merge your pull request and then just fix the conflicts uh since um i ended up pacing a lot of it over anyway oh you're just going to close the pr that's cool too if that's what you want to do okay um hush it says i'm having trouble with your wordpress install what's up with the wordpress install is it not you're not getting data back or what all right so now now what we need to do is style this a bit so we had made the decision i don't know last week at some point i think that we were just gonna pull in all this data uh and then keep it like keep all the html and everything and it's it's pretty messy uh you can see what it looks like here and you know it has all these custom tags that mean something in the old cms but not here so we need to use these tags and style things the way we want eventually we're going to have custom fields for all this data but we're we're not gonna i think it'll take more time to do that than it will to just style what we have so that's what we're gonna do first it'll be a pain at first to get it styled but once it's styled for one it'll be we use the same style for all the faculty all the faculty members so i think it'll work out we may not be able to get exactly the style that we want but we can probably get close and then we can deal with with doing it properly later on you know after the website has to launch and this will help us keep our deadline so not you know ideally i wouldn't want to do it this way but sometimes you just have to you have to think of creative ways to make the deadline and this is one way where i think we can definitely cut a corner without having too much of a negative impact on the end result all right so let's check this out where are we at all right i don't even know how long i've been streaming let me check okay we're coming up on about two hours um okay harshad says the the ip is giving him problems using the ip address instead of wordpress so uh yeah i can link that to a domain uh i'll do that i'm not going to do it right now but maybe i'll try to do it before i leave what time is it okay actually you know what maybe we should save the styles for a different stream um i just checked the time here and i i am there's a christmas party for the university that starts at six so that means i have to make sure that i get home and i i get everything ready and then have enough time to go drop the kids off somewhere uh probably at my inlaws house and then make it to the party so that means i'm actually gonna have to leave work somewhat soon uh so i had hoped we would get to the styling at this stream but actually i'm it makes more sense to do it another stream because the title of this stream really had nothing to do with styling a react component with in this case it's going to be plain css uh in a separate file but so it would probably be better if i just put this did this in the next stream under a different title um let's see is that a spam account yeah probably uh so whoever just asked what is search engine optimization if you're a legit account log on with a different username or something and then ask a question so i'm gonna block this account for now and um because i'm pretty sure it's a spam account if it's not a spam account i'm sorry but you you'll have to come back in with something more reasonable uh as as the name that's not so spammy rook said well the question was related yeah that's why i i kind of said like come back in because the question was about search engine optimization so that's not entirely unrelated what we're doing here but um yeah but you all in the chat can see what the name was i'm not going to repeat it but that's not that's not what we're about here on uh free code camp so okay all right so anyway just to recap uh since we had a long stream and worked through a lot of issues we we did we are now able to pull data based on the url so anytime we go to in this case we're in localhost so localhost 3000 faculty slash and then the faculty's last name and first name uh it will pull up the data for that faculty member so we've transferred that data from sql server through the wordpress api into a mysql database and then we're pulling it back out of the mysql database using graphql from the wp graphql plugin that we've we've installed we're pulling that into with the help of apollo into our react app which was built with next js and it gets put into that page that's where we're at right now we just have a bunch of kind of raw html that's unstyled so in the next stream we're going to style this we also need to figure out how we're going to get these images working we'll probably need some kind of like automated way to add in the url that we want or we're going to have to match the file structure within our project and just pull over all the images i don't know that that's the best way to go because there are quite a few images and i don't want to um i don't want to bloat our repo with all of that so probably most what we'll do is we'll find somewhere else to store the images and then we'll just um automatically put in the first part you know that we'll change the url basically either at some point in the process the url will get transformed i think that will be the best way uh that will require the least amount of manual kind of copy and paste work all right so that's where we're at right now thank you so much everyone for watching and helping i know some of you have been watching this for almost two hours now and i really appreciate uh all your your patience uh and your help uh along the way um let's see there is one more question uh martin asks what's the keyboard combination uh in vs code if you want to use the terminal i don't actually don't know martin i want to know as well what the keyboard combination is i never remember i always just go up to the top to view here and go down toggle integrated terminal it's i don't know what these symbols mean on a mac what let's try it out uh um nope nope okay it's option control t there we go option control t uh brings up your terminal at least it does for me harsha's saying command plus control plus martin says that's my problem it has instructions but i don't know the symbols i'm the same way i need to um like draw the symbols on my keyboard or something uh otherwise i i never know so what what the symbols are okay so let's see yeah that's all i have for today so um today's friday so i'll see you all next week uh should be able to stream on monday probably be a little bit early stream because i have my normal 3 pm eastern time meeting so try to get stream in early um so until then have a great weekend
