hey what's up my name is matt woods and i'm going to talk a little bit today about how i landed my dream software job in about 12 months you see i'm relatively new to development and all this kind of stuff and but i've always loved computers i've always kind of nerded out over technology and was big into video games and always was kind of the goto tech person with computers and everything but it wasn't until uh like a couple years ago that i really bear down and got serious about software got involved in like a coding boot camp and like really started to run with it and learn javascript and learn some php and different things um and it eventually uh getting involved in the community all these crazy things and so i'm gonna i'm gonna talk a little bit about um basically my journey um from about a year ago when i went to my first software development conference with thunderplanes and how the people i met there and the habits i built along the way helped me actually get a fulltime job there we're actually the ship code to production where i work on an awesome marketing team and get to use the best parts of marketing that i love and in development and get to bring those two skills together and uh some skills that like whether you're you're more on the technical side or whether you want to work in a software business just some stuff that anyone can pick up and use but it's mainly going to focus on kind of the development side of that um and so i remember uh man when i started this journey you know like 12 18 months ago i had never really touched javascript before i was always someone who had like poked around with html and css it kind of stayed in my lane uh and kind of done some fun and stuff i'd like messed around with like bootstraps and some styling things uh like made some quick tweaks on websites maybe messed around with some wordpress themes but i never really like dug and built something from the ground up or built something that i can say like uh that was original that i'd made it i had an idea in my head and i wrote some code and i made it work um and then i i think back and compare that to the past a few weeks and things i've been working on where i've actually gotten to to pair on real like code that's going to go production with like uh the cofounder of the startup that i'm working at that has you know 28 people in oklahoma city and new york and we have you know thousands and thousands of people that use our app we're tackling real code and i'm getting to actually see work that i do go out into the real world and be seen by more people than i ever thought possible which totally just blows my mind and i couldn't know that the things that i was i'd hope that the things i was learning would be that applicable but it's a whole different thing to actually see it in action um some other crazy things that have happened recently is just being able to build my network and meet other people in software and be able to like really advance my career by leaps and bounds to the point where like uh i wanted to get to know other people in this area that i'm looking to grow in this growth professional area where you're kind of combining engineering and marketing and the best parts of both and so i decided to go on kind of this connection spree and reach out to a bunch of people who knew this better than i did so i reached out to people from facebook and spotify and airbnb and pinterest and google and all like the companies that i could the best companies i could think of that actually have these growth teams that combined engineering and marketing and i was able to connect with 25 really qualified people in less than 24 hours because of the connections i've been able to make um habitually with some of the stuff i'm going to talk about in a little bit uh and that's been a huge game changer for my career and just even going beyond oklahoma city with some of the connections i've been able to make as well as just like getting involved with events and different uh being able to share my work out in public and it's open doors to meet founders ceos and excellent engineers and marketers from all kinds of awesome companies uh in oklahoma city but also uh in boston and san francisco and other places and i've actually gotten to meet some of them face to face and that's been a total uh gamechanging experience um and i've made lots of valuable connections that i treasure this day and i'm hoping it's just the beginning um so i'm going to talk about how that happened too but really if i had to like narrow down uh the three things that i want to talk about these three key habits that kind of opened the door to me being able to step into my dream job and software uh i'd say that there were these three things i'm going to go more in depth on each of these the first habit is becoming an automatic learning machine and i'm going to talk about what that means and kind of how you can build that up yourself the second thing is building a three circle network and i'll explain what those three circles are and why each of them matter and you have to do them in sequence and then the last step is sharing your byproducts basically as you're learning the stuff how you can put it on the world to not only help other people but to help yourself get the job and the and the do the work that you want to do and live the life you want to live uh because that's why we're doing this stuff so uh anyways i'll have to say hi my name is matt uh i'm a marketer and developer at tailwind right now you can check me out on twitter at matafur tweet me with any questions or followup stuff you have after this uh or you can check out my website at mattwoods.io and we are always hiring at tailwind so if you're interested in kickstarting your development career or making a change always let me know happy to chat about that too but i want to dive into this first habit this becoming an automatic learning machine i think more than anything this is the thing that enabled me to make the jump from what i was doing before which is like working at a marketing agency and hop into a a software startup at tailwind where i'm actually shipping code and doing these things and so i was at the marketing agency when i was like starting to kind of jump into this coding journey but i wasn't really sure where to start and i think like a lot of people i i kind of had this feeling i was talking to a buddy uh earlier this week who's just getting started in coding and one of his number one questions was basically why am i feeling so apprehensive towards getting involved in new projects and getting started in coding um and it's a really good question and i think it's one that pretty much everyone feels when they're getting started uh and my answer is like you know to fight that apprehension that everyone feels that you need to give yourself more wins you need things that you're going to feel good about that you can like plant a flag in the ground and say hey i built this i did this i feel good about this coding is exciting it's not easy but i did it and i want to do more of it so how do you get those wins well it doesn't just happen it doesn't just fall on your lap this stuff is hard but the way that you get better to get those wins is you have to ship more and when i say ship you know it's not like you know carnival cruise lines type of thing we're talking about um taking a piece of code a project something and putting it out in the world to where it's you know it may not be quote unquote finished and perfect but it is done and you are getting it out in front of real people real users real uh getting real feedback in the real world um i saw this tweet the other day by one of my buddies ezra who also started kind of learning to code around the same time that i did and i thought it was really insightful what he said was the biggest challenge i feel as a new or fresh developer is always comparing myself to other developers and i always get stuck wondering how they got there versus just learning how to work on stuff myself and just talk about this discipline of like putting your head down and building code is just something we all have to learn we all have to get better at because it's the only way that you get better i think one of the mistakes when when you get started with this habit of learning to code too is that you wanna you wanna start really big you wanna make the full app with like the the billing and the cool feature and this crazy marketing side it looks slick and it like gives slack a run for their money but i think actually the best way to go around this is to start small and consistent i read this book about how to basically create a habit of learning that really transformed the way i think about this and i i still reference it to this day it's called the one thing by gary keller and he the way he talks about it is like if you want the best chance to succeed at anything you want your approach should always be the same you have to go small because if you go too big uh you're not going to build up this feedback loop of getting a you know doing something hard but rewarding getting the win learning from it doing something a little bigger getting the win right if you if you start too big you're never going to get that feedback you're never going to get that win and you're not going to stay with it and so many people drop off and i came close at times like it can be really discouraging when you're getting started but sticking it out can make such a big difference um i think really building this coding habit to comes down to these two things healthy inputs and healthy output just like you know any any good system is going to understand its inputs and outputs you are a system when you're learning to code and you have to understand what you're putting into your learning environment to succeed and what's what what you're out putting into the world to make it an ultimate success and so in terms of input what are you putting in uh so this can look different for different people uh but some examples are like tutorials of like following different classes these are more accessible than they've ever been online uh you can join classes which is one of the things i did you can listen to podcast things like syntax and full stack radio and different uh great podcast by developers that can supplement things in uh in your learning journey you can go to events these can be virtual events these can be real events i recommend both uh even checking out blog posts basically there's anywhere you can get information that will put new ideas that will show you how to do things that will reinforce things you already know you need to be putting the right things in to fuel your learning engine but then one of the most common traps that i've definitely felt myself starting to slip towards at times is you can get in kind of this like um it's kind of like groundhog day but with tutorials where you're just watching someone else build something and then you're parroting them and just like typing out the same stuff and then you're not doing anything yourself you're not actually internalizing any of it you're just copying a bunch of tutorials you're reading a bunch of blog posts but you're not actually you're not actually producing anything if someone asked you to sit down and code even a simple todo app you would freeze or you get stuck or you'd have to go find someone else's finished work which isn't what you want you want to be able to understand and internalize the fundamentals enough to do great work yourself and so you need outputs right you need to create a forcing function uh for yourself to ship and when i say forcing function this is something that is like an external pressure or something that that helps motivate you to actually get something done it can be like a mentor who holds you accountable it can be a small group it can be like a deadline that you give yourself to make sure that you actually follow through otherwise when things get hard you'll just stop you'll put it aside you'll think maybe i'll get to this later i'll learn this the right way to do something later uh but the reality is you don't always get there and then you're stuck so we don't want uh that situation either so this can look different for for every person it will look different for every person but for me um some of the inputs that really helped me uh first one was uh okay coders if and this is a phenomenal program if you're in the oklahoma city area okay coders is is like a a boot camp kind of so it starts out at like html and css and goes into javascript and you have some projects that you work towards at the end and you work with the team and you're taught by real developers in the community and so it was great just for me as kind of like it was actually a little bit of both i got to learn some of the fundamentals i got to practice them and i was motivated and excited enough from that input of being in that class a couple times a week to go on home and practice every single night and reinforce that learning habit which makes a huge difference i can't tell you how many of my teammates were so excited um but they just didn't do the practice at home and so some of it just didn't stick which is so frustrating uh because i know like before the last couple years i started and stopped a few times because it just hadn't stuck so it's super easy to slip into but if you can get excited enough and then have that forcing function of hey we got this big project hey i get out gotta show this this new thing i'm working on at next week's class it'll force you to ship it'll force you to get stuff done and that can be invaluable tutorials can be great i learn really well by like watching videos and then putting it aside and like doing it on my own and that's my learning style but it's going to be different for every person so figure out what works well for you if it works to like go through and just read the documentation and just freestyle it great awesome um if videos work well for you too cool do that but just experiment with a few and figure out what works for you uh as an input podcast can be great i just enjoy podcast anyways and so i'm going to listen to them and they might as well be helping me learn different things get exposed to new ideas um and so it it's just one of those things that doesn't really hurt it's not going to like teach me how to write uh a good function or uh or like organize my code well but it'll expose me to new ideas and keep me excited and motivated which in itself is really valuable and then events i'm going to talk more about events in a little bit but super valuable and there's a lot of stuff that goes along with events that you really can't get anywhere else in my opinion and so i highly highly recommend local and and online events in communities if you're able to get involved with that as far as output the two things that really made a big difference for me is number one uh like mentors i'll talk a little bit about this in a little bit but having mentors who are at the next step ahead of you who have actually done this stuff and can give you feedback and give you some tough love can help you ship stuff is super valuable when you're learning to actually ship this stuff and get it out the door as well as like actual work projects when i was able to take some of the advanced like css stuff i was learning implement little bits of javascript like even at my last job before i joined tailwind getting able to put that to work on projects that the the company was getting paid for was super valuable and so um that the sooner you can get to that and actually work it into your daytoday work uh the better the sooner you can actually create projects that people use or use yourself that is a huge win so whenever possible i highly recommend aiming for that all right other things uh that help with shipping i'm focusing a lot on shipping um because this is like really the transformational thing that will separate you from like a hey i want to do code i want to be a programmer but just kind of that want to be wishful thinking stage to actually doing it actually achieving it actually being ready for the job or the opportunity when it comes along because reality is like the opportunity can come along but the right opportunity if you're not ready for it will like totally crush you or totally disappoint you because you're not ready for it you haven't put in the hard work of actually i'm actually doing this stuff but if you have it's gonna feel so good um and it's actually easier if you keep doing smaller projects all along the way rather than just trying to cram it in or like just force feed yourself documentation or something like that so some of the stuff that i actually shipped that got me ready for the stuff i do today uh all kinds of stuff but um some of the more original stuff is like i built like a habit tracking app in okay coders which was fun we did like we used like phonegap and cordova um like basically built this like website that would load on your phone and like you could load it in ios and android and that was like super fun and we built this app called like 21 that would help you build a habit over 21 days it's super exciting another one that we did actually for tailwind before i joined as kind of like an okay coders project was like this search tool where we took in a bunch of data and we were able to to organize it by categories and make these different pages um for like these certain types like pinterest pins then we could search through it and only return certain pins based on the search query to the user and we used react for that and so is a great way to like cut our teeth on javascript and actually build something that was like really useful um and as an example of the kind of thing that we like might actually build someday tailwind and so that was really exciting there were also some things i did that just kind of scratched my own itch i decided that i wanted to learn to build an api so i just did it um i met with my mentor he gave me some some tips on how to actually do this stuff and i would build some of it show him the code he would show me how to make it better show me the next thing to do okay great you wrote the you wrote it let's write some tests for it let's actually add on to it let's uh create something to seed some data into it and work with the file system doing all these things so i learned a lot on that project i was also just doing these like quick uh projects of like creating a blog or redoing my personal website or making like a random quote generator um and so just these quick and easy like front uh kind of front end stuff that were fun that were interactive that keep you motivated and uh are not that bad to create once you get in the habit of it some other ways to get ideas for things that you can be shipping so you can just ship more because really the more you ship the more you'll come up with ideas the more you'll understand what to learn like this really is like the linchpin habit that helps you that helps make everything after it easier to the 20 you can focus on that'll make the other 80 that people normally worry about when they're learning to code so much easier trust me i wish i'd done this more when i was getting started but a few ideas that that i highly recommend uh to my friends when they're learning to code uh one is like pair with someone who actually shipped so if you know a developer if you know someone who actually works on this kind of stuff who is shipping code regularly uh and it's being used by people or or who always comes up with great side project ideas just like get with them and say hey can i just watch you code or hey can we work on this small part of this idea i have together or hey can we grab copy and like walk through this thing i mean actually the faster you can get into real code the better i think i've learned more from actually pairing over real code uh with like the developers i work with than than any other than any other thing that i've done it is insanely productive um if you can it can be kind of scary because you know you're you're like oh i'm gonna have to look stuff up in real time or what if i make a mistake with this person is no way more than me i'll feel really dumb but it's really just something you have to get over because the learning is worth it um it's so worth it another thing that you can do that i i like to try is sort of copying on easy mode so what i mean by this is uh there are tons of apps out there that you probably use every day you know like slack like your todo list like like yet another email tool um that you know people use these you know people need these um and so it's not really a question of like if this is a good idea or not it's just a question of um can you build this or not like the the mailchimp or slack or like these these super popular apps everyone knows that they want them or even like uber uh what if you could take that app and just make a super simple easy version of that super simplified down or maybe you focus on the design you just break up a small piece what if you just made like a really simplistic version of mailchimp what if you just made a like a clone of uber's like home page what if you just you know you can pull some of these ideas and it can make it sort of easy for you to get started because you're just copying someone else's idea and and putting your own spin on it they're actually holding whole tutorial sites that just focus on sort of this thing of making an easy clone so it's a really fun way uh to do this and it can feel good too because you feel like oh i understand why this company did it this way it's really motivating another thing that i really like is this airbnb 10 to 1 exercise so this is an exercise that airbnb is one of their founders kind of goes through when he's thinking of like a new experience or product to create so he will think of like okay if i'm trying to create like a vacation for someone what is the absolute best vacation they could create like on a 10 out of 10 scale like what is the or like i think he actually goes from one to ten so he'll be like what's the worst experience okay you go to like your airbnb and and nobody's there right and you just leave and you're super frustrated you want your money back okay what's like a good experience like a five out of ten okay they go in there they show your room it's fine it's clean it's a reasonable price good location cool awesome what about like uh like a nine or ten out of ten though there's like a parade when you get in they know your favorite candy like everyone welcomes you in it's like the beatles like rolling into town uh like you get exclusive reservations the finest restaurant kind of the ultimate experience you can do this and then like he will take the like the ultimate one with this crazy like overthetop uh like experience and he'll pair it down step by step until he gets to something that's between like terrible or very achievable and like exceptional and that's like what he builds um you can do the same thing with your app so if you think like okay i'm gonna make uh you know a um you know a recipe app what is the ultimate recipe app okay it like reads my mind and it like understands like all my dietary habits and what grocery stores are closest to me when it's building my list and it just it integrates with here you can think of all these crazy features you could have and you can strip those away one by one by one and bring it down a level bring it down a level and that can somewhere in there you may find a really unique approach you wouldn't normally think of um that you can still actually build or build a copy of that or build a mock of that or build something and that can be a creative way to get a cool idea that you might not normally think of some other places that you can find great quoting exercises to ship more stuff are our free code camp they have awesome exercises along the way and they also have lots of lessons as i'm sure you guys know if you're checking out this video but if you don't like free code camp projects are awesome that's where i got some ideas like the random quote generator um and there's also if you once you get done you can compare it to other people have done the same project which is also super helpful for javascript 30 by west boss this is one of my absolute favorite courses that i always recommend to people and it's totally free you can go in and he gives you like 30 bitesized sort of project that you can actually ship and make things on over about 30 days and this is insanely cool because it's you don't have to mess around with your development environment or a framework or something crazy it's all vanilla javascript there's some really cool like styling already baked in so you feel good about it and it feels like you're getting some quick wins so highly recommend that course um as like a quick one to get off the ground after you've uh brushed up on some of the basics of javascript the next thing uh it's just like if you were excited about learning something cool if you're excited about learning react or react native if you just really want to understand how databases work and how to work with them come up with an idea that just helps you learn that thing right come up with an idea that works really cool that works really well with react and you're excited about maybe it's totally useless or silly or whatever who cares like just make it and just focus on learning that technology and that's a great way to build your skill set and then the last one one of my favorite ones in the world is like just get paid to actually make things just get paid um i've gotten paid uh to do like freelance projects just web design and baking a little bit of javascript or try out some new css things or whenever i get to to put these things to practice uh at work um it's even better because i you know i'm spending maybe a few days of like you know my nine to five or squeezing a little time on a weekend and like i get recognition for it at work or i can get work resources or i get a chunk of my day that i get to focus on that so and this is especially good if you uh are like really busy or it's hard for you to carve out time on nights and weekends at home sometimes that happens sometimes you have kids sometimes you have a crazy schedule but if you can find a way like work with your boss work with the people um at your company to to get paid to actually learn this stuff and and make something that's valuable for the company to use uh or the client to use do that every time the sooner you can get to that even if it's just you know html and css even if it's just a little bit of simple javascript um that's a huge win because you're getting paid you're growing your skills and then you can level up and start doing more stuff making your own stuff getting paid more to do cool stuff for the same company you never know what opportunities that could unlock but it's been super powerful for me and then uh what to actually learn so yeah i've been focusing more on like on all this obviously on how you learn and the habits you build to learn because i really do believe that's more important than like a specific tech stack once you understand the fundamentals once you learn understand how to do this stuff once it's habitual and automatic and you don't even think about it switching from ruby to php or from javascript to you know whatever the next great thing is isn't going to be such a big deal but that being said it does kind of help to understand the lay of the land and so uh there's this great uh sort of like web developer road map flowchart that's super helpful at least when i was getting started to understand what's out there kind of where am i out of my journey on the front end of the back end and what things can i keep an eye out for or learn about um so that's super helpful highly recommend that you check it out i'm not going gonna walk you through it now but definitely an excellent excellent resource if you haven't checked it out before all right the second habit that i think is super crucial um when you're if you're gonna get your dream job in software uh is i recommend building a threecircle network so what i mean by that is normally when people think about networking they jump straight to like terrible networking events with like platters of food and people are like throwing their business cards at you and just like it's kind of like a i don't know this whole like sleazy used car salesman schtick and you just feel like people are talking at each other but not really connecting yeah nobody wants that um but what i think good networking is is just helping people and being part of the community and giving back and this starts with what i call like your inner circle so i think of it in like these three terms your inner circle uh your professional network and what i call the crowd and so we're going to start with the inner circle what is the inner circle your inner circle when you're starting out networking is like your mentors your peers and the people that you are helping immediately it's like a small core group of people these are people that you can like learn from and lean on for like these 10x big growth decisions uh or trajectory that you're on and like these tough decisions that you're making these are people that can help keep you accountable for your side projects that can help you get introductions for your first job that can um basically you can turn to for honest and helpful and real feedback um got this idea kind of from like a like a fivestar general i think i heard about uh and his habit at all times was to have three people in his life one who was a step ahead of him in his career for someone who had done the things that he wants to do who has experience who was wiser older and had value to pass down to him that he didn't know to ask for or and he can turn to that person when when he needs advice when he needs help also someone you respect that is like at your level but it's like best in class it is doing good work that can can keep like kind of light a fire onto you and keep you moving forward and show you what's possible at your level and you can get honest and real feedback that maybe isn't it doesn't make sense to get from a mentor and then of course like you've if you once you get your the next step that you want to take once you get that job that opportunity you get to ship that project it's i really think you have an obligation or an opportunity to turn around and help other people who were who were in your shoes a few months ago or a few years ago and so always being willing to help lend a hand to people and and pass that on pay that forward is i think so critically important and and i think everyone should take the chance to do that uh then there's also your professional network i think this is what most people think of when they think of networking um i tend to think of this just in terms of like who can i ask a favor from with a quick message this is i like people uh from like professional groups people from teclahoma probably or like free code camp would often fall into this i think uh another really critical thing to define in this stage is like a super connector so if you know there's like i have this friend when i was in college named maggie i and whenever we were working on a group project where we had to go like uh we're working on a project we had to go like interview professors or go find other students who knew uh who had specialties with different things i just asked her hey who do you know and she just send me over like a list of like all these people to get in touch with like immediately oh i know brad over here oh i know this professor over here oh i can call them a favor over here they just know all these people you want to know people like that in your industry and be building those connections so that when uh you know if something horrible happens and you lose your job like great you can reach out to that person they can connect you to the right people it's like hey i really need help with the side project i need help with this volunteer thing i'm doing who i don't know who to ask for who do you know you want those people who are super deeply connected especially if that's not your thing you want to know those people it's so helpful classmates family friends relatives former coworkers you know the point here is like you know more people than you think you do a lot of times you tend to discount oh i don't know any people in software oh i don't know any people with the kinds of jobs i want to have but you have friends you have family you have relatives and they might know people like that so feel free to like reach out and and connect with those people and look for the second and third degree connections who can get you in the door who can connect you with a super connector who can show you a professional group that you didn't know about um this is super key to positioning yourself to be able to get that job in 6 9 12 24 months whatever that is and then the crowd this is like who can i meaningfully help today i'm going to talk in a little bit about like sharing your byproducts and sharing what you're learning but the point is this is like social media email subscribers people who visit your website or blog or watch your videos or uh listen to your podcast whatever that thing is but um i i believe that once you like have your mentors and your peers and that close knit inner circle in place and once you have a professional network of of people that you can connect with and and be a part of that you should be like putting stuff out in the world like in your space so if you're like really into react like awesome uh how can you go help the react community how can you build a following how can you you know whether that's on twitter that's on youtube videos or whether that's teaching other people how to do something in your framework like find ways that you can help other people because that is going to come back around when you need it most especially when it comes to to landing a job and a lot of times it's it's hard to see what that'll look like but i've it's pretty people who build that habit of helping people and building a crowd and building an audience it usually comes back around in a good way to help them out and it's a huge advantage uh and this has just like totally been a key factor in like my journey like there's no way i'd be diving as deeply into marketing or software development if it weren't for like this huge crowd of passionate talented people who have like introduced me to new tech uh got me like involved in communities and got me excited about it uh like introduce new strategies uh for projects and code and doing exciting things uh giving me feedback and like blog posts and podcasts and courses and side project ideas and everything uh and like we talked about like actually keeping me accountable the ship work whether it's you know just like a blog post or a video or like putting together an api or whatever it is like having people around you at each of those levels the inner circle your professional network the crowd is going to be a huge help to actually getting stuff done um and there are like lots of other things that i learned in this sort of like networking journey but i think one of the main ones that that's helpful for everyone is just that don't get discouraged when people don't get back to you right away with your followup endless followup needs to be your new default i think so many times when i was reaching out um about jobs and when i'd meet a great connection for someone i wanted to to learn from uh sometimes they they wouldn't give back to me right away and it was so easy for me at first to attribute that to like oh they don't like me they don't think i'm any good or maybe they're they're just like hostile towards me but usually it's just busyness people are so crazy busy and i know i'm busy so many times uh and and so sometimes i won't get back to people as quickly as i should but it's you know that person might think i'm i'm mad at them but i'm not i'm not i'm just like super busy and if they keep following up i want to help them i want to connect with them i want to get to know them i'm so just making endless followup your new default is so critical um to making that happen i got encouraged by this story one time by this the ceo who once followed up with an investor 48 times in a row without a response and then on you know 47 times he you know he'd reach out every few days every few weeks whatever and and he would leave an email leave a message and just didn't get back to him on the 48th time that investor got back to him and said oh sorry i've just had a lot of fires burning i've been super busy uh can you meet tomorrow morning and they met and he invested in his company a lot of times you know people who you want to work with or who are doing great stuff are just super busy and so the more you can do follow up well have that endless followup that continual followup go the distance with that um to help them out um a lot of times as long as you're not doing that in an obnoxious way as long as you're doing that from a good place um and you're doing it and like doing the hard work of having something to show having something to bring to that meeting um making that worthwhile for both of you um that can actually be a great great experience for everyone involved um and so like this is like a general fault that i scheduled that i've used before um for jobs or getting coffee or just like finding mentors or things like that i'm just like reaching out and then making sure that i follow up like after two days after four days after a week after a few weeks and on and on and on to make sure that i don't let that slip through the cracks and that if uh something doesn't work out it's not because i was too lazy or forgetful um to do them the courtesy of like actually following through all right last habit number three sharing your byproducts this is a super key idea i believe and the reason why why does it matter of like sharing your byproducts and also what does this mean um let me share what this means first so if you're following all the stuff i've talked about you're connecting with people you're you're learning building first you're becoming a learning machine by creating these quick wins by creating the right inputs and the right forcing functions to force you to put stuff out in the world you're going to be learning cool stuff you'll be like you know messing around in javascript you'll be building websites you'll be creating apps you have these great side project ideas you'll you'll learn new things so you'll be creating stuff um and it's tempting to just just let that out and just let that sit you know i shift that thing great awesome move on to the next thing but what i believe you should do and i learned this from like uh this this article from the basecamp folks who are who makes this awesome app um and they put a lot of great blog posts out into the world but about like selling your byproducts um and about like if you are learning these things in real time if you are you the byproduct of that is like hey you have like a cool learning that went along with it uh as you were learning this as you were navigating it as you were encountering new problems and finding new ways to solve it other people would benefit from that if they just knew what you knew if you just documented the things that you learned the things you worked on and put it out in the world in a blog post and a video and a social media post anyway um even a lightning talk and a real person event speaking um that would help someone else and so often people feel like they need to to be a guru right to have it all together to have it figured out so they like put on their creator cap and they feel like they have to be some social media influencer or have to have done this for 30 years and know everything inside and out and write the book on it but that's actually not true you can help people by just documenting your honest experience of what you've been learning and just share that in a quick lightning talk share that in a quick social media post and a tweet another quick screencast and that can help people that is the byproduct of the hard work and the learning that you've already been doing so why not so the reason why sharing your byproduct is so impactful is because it helps others first off um which is so fulfilling and you've been helped by other people's you get to help them too that feels really good it is worthwhile to deal just for that but beyond that when you help other people you end up helping yourself too when you when you help people out in your community they're going to want to help you out too if you help them learn anything they want to hook you up with a new job they'll want to help you on your side project they'll want to help you fix that bug send people your way when you're hiring whatever that is you want to always be helping um and giving back to the community and then it just creates opportunities by showing your work putting it out on github sharing the process of why you built something a certain way that shows people how you think and people will be attracted to that people notice that stuff and then people who some people who might have overlooked you before realize wow okay this person actually knows what they're doing i really want to work with them i really want to hear them speak i really want to to hop on a side project with them or invite them in you never know what's going to happen but people can't discover the cool stuff you're doing if you don't tell them about it it's simple but it's so easy to overlook some practical um ways that this has looked for me uh it's just like whenever i get a chance to public speak i always say yes i it's so it was really like intimidating to jump into it first before i started public speaking it was my number one fear but once i hopped in once i muscled through it like it has been so rewarding and even though it's been scary um i've never regretted saying yes to a public speaking opportunity last year at teclahoma thunderplanes at this conference um i had never done a lightning talk before which is a line attack is like a five minute presentation in front of people kind of impromptu on just one simple idea that you want to share so i gave one on like how to market your side project and how to find great ideas and i gave that talk and one of the people in the audience was a developer at tailwind and so afterwards like he came up to me and said like hey man great talk um and we got to talking about his lightning talk about react and he introduced me to his coworker and we all chatted uh and then they just introduced me to the ceo of tailwind that went really well and they got me connected with the director of marketing and that got the whole interview process started and i eventually ended up hopping on board their team so it's if you actually connect the dots like me stepping out and giving a lightning talk actually opened the door to me getting like my dream job at a tech startup in oklahoma city um it's kind of crazy to think about like if i would have like sat down and had been too timid to do that that might not have happened or it might not have happened as fast which is is crazy um so again when when it came up my second year thunder planes of course i did a lightning talk and i didn't you never feel as ready as you want to you don't you never feel like those butterflies are like that it gets totally easy or not scary but it's always worth it and i always recommend doing that the other thing when it comes to documenting this stuff is just like keep it simple pick one primary channel and just stick to it if you love being on video just do videos um if you're on instagram all the time give it a shot just do a quick instagram post when you're coding and share what you're working on if you like writing stuff out in blog posts cool awesome that's great uh write a blog post after you finish like learning something or shipping some code do you have some friends and you just like talking about the latest and greatest like uh things in you know python that you're working on cool awesome sort of python podcast and and just document this stuff every week and just have a fun time doing it if you pick that one thing and you stick to it it gets way easier to build a crowd because you're talking about what you already know you have this forcing function of hey i'm going to make a blog post every week i'm going to put a podcast out every week it can be so so helpful another thing that i found is really helpful when you're figuring out well like what can i really talk about i feel like i'm rehashing the same stuff that everyone is talking about we don't need another you know uh todo list tutorial in javascript okay fine like i get that too like you want stuff that's going to stand out and it's something that only you can create um so at first i say just go back to row one you know always be shipping but beyond that once you get in the habit to or if you need something a little bit different i find this trick of like you're finding your superpower really helpful so this is an idea from like scott adams the creator of bilbert and his his idea is basically that you can could take two skills so for me like i started growing my marketing skills like early on and so i feel really confident that uh like that skills and then i also started like learning the code and software development and building apps and great okay cool so if i take the overlap between those two contrasting specialties that i have those two skills uh i have like marketing and development and so i can combine those and be like a marketing developer and find things okay cool marketing apis and okay cool how can we build a bot that helps people on your homepage and does these cool marketing things cool how can i automate my emails in this cool way that's like a cool marketing thing and you can find things that most developers aren't talking about and most marketers don't know how to do and that can be super valuable so yours will look different than this but you can find uh other things that are in addition to software development and layer them on top and that overlap is what you can talk about that's unique to you and really valuable and showcases uh what you're passionate about and what you're good at which can be make it a lot easier to get started just documenting this stuff another great thing about sharing your byproducts is it makes it so much easier to come up with ideas for things to actually make which goes back to one of the other problems and barriers that you you run into when you're trying to get started creating um and so i found it really helpful if you're putting stuff out in the world it becomes and you have people that are paying attention on twitter on your email list or at meetups it gets easier to like tap your community for these insights as you're ongoing so you can discover pain points right if you're like really involved in the javascript community and you have javascript friends and you're talking about this you can maybe discover a need for like a new package that you could write or a new open source thing you could start if you have an idea if you're starting a following uh for uh like marketers and you're coding things for them uh you can put out a quick tweet and be like hey would it be helpful if i coded this kind of things and you can validate ideas quickly and get feedback from the stuff you're working on uh which can be really really helpful it can help you validate ideas really quickly this is something that i've actually done as well um it's just like i had an idea for a site app that i wanted to work on to uh just like brush up on some coding skills like and so i was like okay what if i can make an app that'll help people meet up for coffee and like sink their calendars and find a free time for both of them so i just put up a quick thing on linkedin because i'm pretty active on linkedin and i get like 41 likes and 18 comments i got like a list of i followed up with each and every one of those people oneonone you can see even some of these people i don't know these people they're seconddegree connections and so i was still able to connect with them grab their emails and follow up with them and i didn't actually end up getting as far with that app as i wanted yet um but when i have something to show on my next side project i'm going to plan on like repeating this process and like reaching out making a list and reaching out to people and that way i can i can develop it faster come up with more ideas avoid that block and get more of those quick ones and always be shipping um so and this just came from like documenting the the stuff i was going to work on i didn't i wasn't even planning to post about this side project that i was working on i was like oh it's small it's silly who really cares but more people cared than i thought and so giving this a chance just documenting it and putting it out there in the world uh was a huge advantage and i'm super glad that i did so those are really like the three ideas um in a nutshell that took me from like not really knowing how to code or feeling like i want to be a lot of ways who started to stop so many times to actually getting my foot in the door meeting the right people having the skills built up and and sharing what i was doing to where like i was able to to join this awesome job at tillwind and i love going to work every day i work with some of the best people on the planet and and i'm so happy that i get to do it it's exciting it's fresh it's fun and like i i'm even more excited for like my side projects because the things i'm learning at work like feed into the things i'm doing outside of work in coding and marketing in in the people that i'm meeting and so and and the things the people i'm meeting outside like feed right back into work and make me more excited and it's such a cool place to be and so i'm so glad i started those habits you know like 12 to 18 months ago of just like putting my learning on autopilot building those those networks and hopping in the oklahoma city community uh starting to document my work these things make such a big difference over the long run and so that's my experience um again uh hit me up on linkedin twitter email me whatever i'm happy to talk more about um these ideas and what they're like yeah cool thanks guys so much for listening appreciate it take care
