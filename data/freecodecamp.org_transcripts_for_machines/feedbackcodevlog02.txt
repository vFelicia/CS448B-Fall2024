feedback feedback it's Monday and uh I'm looking for a portfolio remarks that other people did about my project about this portfolio page I asked for the feedback on Reddit critique I also posted my project in fre Cod Camp Forum it's not easy to give and get the feedback on designs because it's very subjective however it's really worth doing worth getting it makes you better not just only as the designer but also as the developer because you have to finally Implement all of the new Solutions I will look for some inspiration uh on Pinterest dribble and in difficult come Forum how others did their portfolio maybe something uh maybe there will be something that will really inspire me to redesign M portfolio I'm not sure uh what should I change exactly um because uh the comments are like you know it's too big too small uh about the same thing it's too bright too dark so it's always very subjective you have to be careful with that yeah yeah it's Tuesday one of the co campers just uh surprised me with the answer because uh the person wrote that it's it's a pleasure to work and to learn to learn sorry it's pleasure to learn from experienced people like you and if he knew how beginning level I am maybe he wouldn't write so he continues as we beginners as we beginners so I'm not I'm rather too um can go so deeply into the code thank you so it was the response for uh for my project review so I did uh the code review of the project and try to help a bit we beginners very often underestimate ourselves I got to the same problem you know practice makes perfect and also practice helps you to get rid of this impostor syndrome and whatever it's called so everybody's starting some from somewhere and the thing is to keep on doing keep on learning and getting better developers who have years of practice but stay in the same language and they do not develop they are also beginners in other stuff they know more uh they can connect the adults and learn the new Frameworks and languages faster but still they are beginners so everybody is a beginner and the awesome thing about code Society is that we share the knowledge we help each other and that's great so keep on learning practice and we will be all experiencing something as a result we can share our knowledge help ourselves and develop as a community keep on doing I could be learning you could be to see what's behind these Clos doors but I promise you baby baby oh it's Wednesday yesterday I've been revising all of the projects for frontend certificate from free code Camp I've been changing a bit the colors in some projects correcting accessibility or changing a bit the layout majority of the changes uh were the results of the feedback that I got sure in the beginning you think okay they are not right I did a lot of work you know everybody who is a Creator loves the work more than the audience the problem is that we don't see many things that other people see because they see the project for the first time whatever it is concerning the application it's worth asking the more you ask the better you know the better your app can look 76 5 4 3 2 1 you'll never have the sacred stone oh this you crazy mother I could be learning you could be to see what's behind the doors but I promise you I you baby I be you baby I've gained my frontend certificate the first bigger frontend certificate in my career Joy of reaching the Milestone is really great it also brings um fear and excitement of the next steps and also new challenges and another bux that that I will probably meet on my way time to celebrate orang it's Thursday after the celebration day comes the day where you have to focus once again on what's next uh on what's next because it's just the beginning of the way I know that I achieved something that was impossible 5 months ago the more you know the more you know that you don't know I also know how much is in front of me and I'm more and more aware of that which is great which is great because uh you don't learn if you don't set yourself the challenges to sum up I came with the story that I want to tell starting from who I am going through what I do later how I do it showing how I do it and finishing on the option to contact me Friday I'm reading the documentation for the new project it's Friday in the afternoon and soon I will be finishing this week of work and I still haven't reached 500 points I mean the brownie points from fod camp but I don't worry about that because still I helped a lot of people and I promised to reach these points uh before starting react challenges today I haven't done much uh on learning new stuff I was analyzing the documentation for the project I want to get but it was also kind of lesson to analyze the documentation once again uh write the questions to our client so it's also a lesson the week is almost finished this week I've been mostly iterating over the projects I've done before and I've been giving and receiving feedback the problems that I met this week was was not enough time for unexpected things happening and the next week will be quite busy because we have F Malaga in Malaga here so the whole city will be having por and I will also have guests from Poland with kids so I think that I have to plan it wisely next week I'm going to learn SAS and flx box I'm going to sum up my way to frontend certificate on medium I will keep on giving feedback and Browning keep on doing see you next week
