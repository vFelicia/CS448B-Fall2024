hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're gonna do some css uh so not sass or css and js or anything like that just regular css this should be a great stream for beginners because usually if you want to get into web development you start out with html and css so i hope that we have no technical issues with the stream i can see my mic is working today and so far i've not dropped any frames so this might be the first successful stream uh from my my home office which is actually just a corner of my laundry room in my basement right now but don't not going to do a lengthy introduction i think you know we'll just get started i do want to show off my my tshirt so this is the november tshirt from the conference at the 2017 november conference so i thought it was pretty cool they had cool stuff there i know uh you've seen i think i've worn other stuff before or put it on instagram or something there's a tshirt a hoodie a november hat uh i can get socks from that conference the socks were from heroku but anyway just wanted to show that off uh before we get started if you're new to the stream let me just give you a very quick rundown of how things go this stream is not exactly a tutorial uh instead this is my daytoday work as a frontend developer for a small university so whatever i need to work on that day i just pick whatever i think will be the most interesting thing and then i stream it for about an hour or so but i take breaks to answer questions and i try to narrate what i'm doing so that you know hopefully it's beneficial to you all that watch and then you can give me you know your your feedback and and your help and ideas as i go along so it ends up being very collaborative i time these with a pomodoro timer which means for 25 minutes i i mostly code and don't really look too much at the live chat then i take a little break and i answer questions to live chat then i go back and do another 25 minute session and then after that i go back and and the final part of the stream is just all question and answer and sometimes that takes a long time sometimes it doesn't it entirely depends on you and and your questions this is definitely beginner friendly feel free to ask any questions don't worry about you know if you think your question is is a silly question don't worry about it uh you know we're all trying to learn here and get better and we're always trying to be very helpful if somebody is being uh not very nice in the chat then i will talk to them about that i i've only had to ban somebody once uh so you know we've been doing these streams for almost a year now and so we have a pretty good track record of having you know kind of a positive uh experience here so having said that uh let's get started so i'm going to start my pomodoro clock and i'm going to start out by just showing you what's uh what we're going to work on so i want to go to the major.js page if you all want to follow along uh where you know at home you can go to the github repository that's linked in the description to this video and check out this major.js component that's in the pages folder that's where we're going to spend most of our time well i take that back we're probably going to create a css file and that's where we're going to spend most of our time so it's probably not a bad idea to see if we already have one style that would be under static styles no we don't so we we actually don't have a css file for this component so that's kind of nice we'll start from a blank one and now i'm going to let you see what we need to style it's it's a little bit tricky so we have a lot of freedom with what we're going to turn this into oops let me switch the scene so you all can see and oops there we go okay all right so this is what we currently have this is the the current site that we're redoing so there's this thing here where user can click and get you know potentially what their schedule could be if they decided to come to the university and uh take uh be a classics major right so i got some feedback from some current students and they said that they really liked this and this helped them a lot when they were deciding so i do want to make this nicer this is what it looks like currently so we brought over all the markup and none of the styles so it's just a list so our goal today is to take this list and turn it into something that basically does this it does not have to look like this at all we can completely change how this looks the but it just needs to in a reasonable way that would be nice for a user it needs to be able to display the classes that would be taken during you know during their different years and semesters and we have to work with the existing markup so potentially i could change the markup but there's a lot and we're running out of time before you know launch time so i'm thinking so this probably needs to be launched sometime in maybe this month let me think hold on a second let me when's the first day of summer is it june yeah it's june right so let's let's figure the launch date is going to be sometime in early june uh kind of at the latest so anyway i would like to just work with the markup as is at a later date we can go back and if we want to change markup and organize the data in a better way that's fine but otherwise i've just brought this over as is and that's what we're gonna work with all right michael says june 21st okay i thought it was june i just realized i haven't looked at all at the uh chat since we started so i am going to go back and read this i just want to scan quickly to make sure there's nothing wrong with my stream that you are telling me about okay all right looks like everything's good with the stream so first thing we're going to do is just check out what we have in devtools let's inspect it now i know on some streams i i have a tool running called ngrok that allows you to inspect things on your own computer i don't have ngrok running right now for two reasons one i don't even have it installed or set up on this computer but also i don't think this computer could handle running ngrok and doing a live stream at the same time i would like to test it out at some point it would have been good for this type of stream but uh now it's kind of too late to try it out anyway i didn't really think about it until we already started all right so i'm gonna make this a bit bigger let's see so right now what i'm just looking for is like what markup are we are we dealing with here what does this look like uh so let's see it looks like classics all right so we have an h2 at the top this is good oh and then okay so these are also h2s not really happy about that i mean this is obviously the header for the whole thing so i would have liked it if these were maybe h3s or something but that's what we have and then these are in left title tags so what we've noticed previously that when we're bringing over data from this older content management system called ektron we have a lot of custom elements so this is one of those a left title all right we have break tags we have left interesting we have tags that are just left tags and then wow even all the courses are h2s with a class of title and then a link we have a link tag that has nothing in it it looks like we have display none set on a link which i mean that that obviously makes sense right um okay so i'm assuming we're gonna have some right tags here so let's check it out okay right title and we have some right tags okay this is not this is not terrible let's see if you are okay and then this is a link and i already set up this route so this link actually works so that's what i was doing earlier today i was just going through cleaning up data setting up routes which is what i've been doing pretty much every day the last couple weeks there's a lot to go through all right and then each one of these is in a tab okay uh i think this markup is something we can work with this doesn't look it doesn't look it could have been a lot worse right based on what we were seeing before it could have been worse so i think this will work we should be able to do what we need to do so right off the bat i'm going to tell you what i'm thinking about doing and then you all can give me your feedback and and see if um if you have any you know any input maybe i'm missing something so i mean obviously i'm i'm going to use these left tags and left title for that's where i'm going to attach the positioning to so in our cr css we're going to target these and position them to the left or to the right since there's no like containers i'm thinking this is going to be tough yeah there's no containers around all this which is going to make it a little bit tough maybe we'll just do like oldfashioned floats and see if that works for our right and our left i mean normally i would go with something else but that's going to be maybe my first try and then it looks like these br tags are just way too much space so we may end up just setting these to like display none or something like that let's take it out okay yeah if we set display none on those that's that's a lot nicer alright so just like that that automatically looks more reasonable we're also going to have to change some of the styles on like these titles for semesters and years so right now there's no visual hierarchy in terms of font size font weight color or indentation so all that's going to have to change and then the the link styling will change this is just default link styling uh so we'll we'll switch that up but other than that it's not it's not really terrible uh yeah i don't think that's too bad we'll get that all figured out and then we'll see what it looks like with just having first year first semester and then side by side and then doing the same thing here and then we'll see like do we want to go back to some sort of tabbed version is it okay to just have them all right there i'm not really sure i want to see it first all right so let me look at the live chat since i've been asking a few questions here and see see what you all think all right i see i see a lot of questions in the chat right now so i will get to the questions so um in about about 15 minutes i'll get to the questions so please be patient let's see uh how many says so we'll not modify the html at all if potentially we can modify the html but if we do it it's going to be using javascript in the react component because i have a lot of pages that have markup just like this so i don't want to have to manually go in and and modify it oh and it har should just explain that so sorry i didn't see that okay well it looks like we're good to start in on this so first thing i want to do is is try to get this positioning uh working so let's go you know what let's just try to do a little bit right here in dev tools if you're very new uh to using you know dev tools you know if you just right click on anything in the page and then go down to inspect dev tools will come up if you've never used it before it'll come up and it'll be white instead of a black background you can just go into the settings up here and you can change that to a dark background if you want right so all the changes we're going to do here are just going to be temporary they're only working our browser so you don't have to worry about actually changing or messing up the code and you could do this for any website that you go on uh to just kind of mess with it and see how it works so we're going to take our left tags and let's see actually let me go with the right ones first let's see no i don't with the left so let's try a float left see how weird it looks all right so what did we just we just took all nope that's not gonna work you know what i didn't even think about that okay uh so let's leave that alone for now let's take our right ones let's see what we can do oh harsha says there's 101 people watching which is more i well i haven't even looked at the analytics at all wow so we're we're at 85 right now based on my analytics but that's still a lot of people so um forever new people uh welcome thanks for thanks for watching feel free to put any questions you have in the chat and uh i'll answer them after a little while all right so let's go with our our right tags and let's see what we can do so let's see what we can do hmm so i'm obviously the float's not gonna work right so if we do float right right we're gonna get some weirdness again uh so float is out for what we're doing right now but we could maybe do let's mess with the position oops and that did not position uh absolute no this is not this is gonna be trickier than i thought so the lack of a container is really messing this up all right one thing we can do is see what they used here in the old site assuming that they have the uh the same elements on the page all right oh so this ended up getting interpreted as ul uh unordered list wow okay so it looks like the old content management system took those those custom tags and converted them to normal html tags and ended up wrapping these so think of think of these as like components in react so no actually that doesn't make any sense either i'm not exactly sure how that that worked out because you know there's really not any type of container interesting okay let's start with something easier while we think about how we can do uh how we can do this let's just get uh the headings fixed in terms of uh the size font weight and color i have some ideas for how to handle the positioning but it's going to involve some javascript so i'd rather stick to css for now since that's what i i made the title of this video so i imagine there's a lot of people here for the css so let's do some css then and where are we at sample programs this h2 is let's check we don't want it to be too much larger than this so let's look up what we have on this h1 okay so we don't have anything special it's just default so probably not not really a bad idea to just keep it as is for now since it's it's the appropriate size and weight in relation to this but these h2s that's why i have an extra title here it's really interesting okay um wow these do not stand out at all all right we're gonna do some weird css here for a second so i'm going to write this let's set up our css our file so we have our styles right now in fact we use are we pulling in any styles okay we're actually pulling in the styles from news.css so you may want to pull those styles over let's make a new file first and we'll call this major.css to match our component of major.css let's check out our news.css and you know what let me make some more space here let's move this over because we're not really using it right now and we'll move our our terminal stuff down and then i'm gonna make this a bit bigger so it'll be easier for you all to see okay hopefully that is uh easier to see so what i'm gonna do is take everything that's currently in news dot css and i'm going to move it over to major dot css because i'm not sure what in this file is really making a difference in our our major uh js component so i'm going to save that let's go over to our component of major dot js sorry that for the lag it's just you're trying to run the live stream and everything else makes it a little slow so we're right now we're bringing in if you don't know what's going on in this particular component don't worry about it if you're not familiar with react you know it's it's totally cool if you don't understand but we're basically just importing styles all right with a link tag so that should be you know familiar to you from just you know writing normal html so we're going to pull in this major dot css file so now anything that we change here will be reflected ah let's see so let's go through this just a bit i'm gonna say okay so right now anything that is displaying is uh root gets display none and we did have something that was roots or was it i thought we had something yeah so it's root tabbed all right um we have probably some of these will be we won't necessarily uh need to keep them but we'll sort that out later on right now let's add some more styles to the bottom so what i want to target are h2s with the class of title so h2s dot title and then i want to say not um what do you want to do this is it first first of type i might have to look up the syntax so what i want to select is all the h2s that have the class of title except not oh you know what i was mistaken this h2 is just stacked so this one doesn't have the class of title so we're gonna we're good then okay that makes this a lot easier so normally i'm not i don't like manipulating h2s uh we still want this title so for in css what we're doing is selecting an h2 and then we do dot title this right after that that means any h2s with the class of title if i had a space here this would mean any element with the class of title that exists inside of an h2 so you could see the little tooltip is displaying what it would be but now if we backspace it you can see we're looking for h2s with the class of title and only h2s okay so i know for most of you that's probably you know you're probably familiar with that but i i do want to try to explain as much as i can you know for anybody that's just just curious about web development uh just starting out so right now we're we're targeting these year titles so this first year you know second second year um so we want to make this so let's just test it out here font size 18 pixels okay so we're going to go up from there and let's see let's say 24 pixels i really don't want to go any more than 24 pixels on this one and we could do font weight and let's see 500 okay 500 looks good that definitely makes it thinner and then can we do color let's make our color be rgba and we're going to use 0 0 0 um 0.87 oops i need commas don't i zero zero okay so i wasn't sure if that was the color or not but that's what color i want okay so let's go with that for now and also we need to remember to make those those br tags work so major route 239 br all right so we're definitely gonna have to override this style where is it getting that from that's weird okay so we're copy and pasting that in here and let's just want to fix the indentation on that and then uh let's go with vr display i hate to use important but let's just do it just for time i don't really want to go through this and try to figure out what exactly is going on with this so just to see what it looks like we're gonna go with uh important in there so um let's do a refresh make sure it's working all right cool so now we have we have that and my timer went off so let me take a short break and answer as many questions as i can there's a lot of questions here so if i don't get to yours this time i'll get to it after the second pomodoro session i'll spend the the entire end of the stream just answering questions let's see so i'm not going to read out all the comments just because there's so much in here uh do want to get uh to the questions though although i'll probably read out comments that are either maybe funny or flattering to me personally so for instance klaus says i look way better with the stubble instead of the beard thanks my wife agrees world's asked if i'm in the basement i am i am coding from a corner of my basement uh nilish asks when i'll continue the react testing video uh maybe later this week i was doing i was reading a lot of documentation on testing and i still could not figure out what i have to do uh for the the click i i i don't i'll i have to talk about this for like 20 minutes or not at all so i will do another stream about it when i figure it out uh remy asks how many monitors i have uh right now i have a macbook pro so there's a screen with that and then two external monitors hooked up and that's my setup at my offices as well except it's an imac and then two external monitors the most i've ever used is four monitors that was a really cool setup i'd like to go back to that eventually and it says i look younger without the beard yeah i definitely everybody keeps saying that that i look younger and you probably can't see it on the live stream but i have gray hair in my beard so i definitely look younger because i don't i don't yet have any gray hair like on the top of my head so uh yeah definitely younger solely says shout out from south africa thanks for watching uh thanks for the shout out john says uh it is usually a good idea to draw out a plan what divs hold what headings and some sense of functional ui ux yeah for sure uh normally i'm like right now we're kind of stuck with this markup so normally i wouldn't start like this but many of you if you're actually going to work will probably find yourself in a situation where you don't have control over the markup but you need to style it as best you can and what we're doing now is kind of a good example of how you handle that uh how memory says pure css no bootstrap yep no no bootstrap or nothing yeah we so on the components themselves we have styles from material ui but what we're when we're doing this in terms of like styling the markup that's been imported from the other cms it's it's pretty much all from scratch uh how many asked what material ui is uh it's a um a ui framework for react that uses uh material design principles the lone wolf says can anyone explain what br and link does the br tags are html tags that are supposed to include a line break and potentially like some space in between lines but really it's better to use css for that like margins padding and things like that so uh i very rarely use a break tag uh you know now it correct me if i'm wrong but those were kind of really an older thing that you just you don't really do that much anymore and then the link tag i don't know what they're doing with the link tag in here in terms of what got imported from the old cms but link tags are supposed to be to pull in css files uh saatvik says what does the left tag do it really doesn't do anything right now until we assign it some sort of styles it was a custom tag that did have some meaning in the old content management system but doesn't currently in a new system uh javier says is this a semantic html horrible on purpose i don't know what the designers of that old cms were thinking if they wanted it to be like that on purpose or not uh i don't think i'll ever get a chance to ask him so we may never know all right so my timer went off i'm going to go back and start another pomodoro session and then i'm going to come back to the chat and keep going from where i left off which is i don't think i have a pen or anything here all right so the timestamp for me for where i left off is 2 45 p.m in the chat so let's try to remember 2 45 p.m i bet i can just write it here yeah let's just all right so in my terminal i write 245 to remember that that's there and then i'll remember where to go okay so we've got our h2s with the class of title style and we've gotten rid of those those break tags well i i shouldn't say we got rid of them they're still there we're just not displaying them okay so now here's what we have we definitely need to style these and these right we if we're going with a hierarchy here uh it's not it's not looking good so far so our left title and right title are going to get the same styles in terms of font and color so let's test out what we think will look good uh so we'll go with a font size of let's say 20 all right 20 pixels a little bit bigger and do we want a different font weight let's see what we want so the last one was what 500 let's try a 400 font weight which is going to be pretty light okay not bad and then let's take that color we want that same color of r g r g b a so this rgba that i'm putting in here if we just did the zero zero zero that would give us pure black but instead we're doing this 0.87 all right and that that last one is like the the opacity so what we're doing is essentially making a grayish color but we're not putting a gray hex value in text is actually more readable if you do solid black and you make it a little bit transparent to get your gray if you do a gray hex value it's less readable so i'm not going to do it right now like to demonstrate but you know try it out on your own and try them side by side you'll be amazed at the difference okay so that's not bad it still looks weird because we haven't styled these yet but you know i think we're on the right track so let's copy this and we'll go over to our our file here and let's do left what was that left title yeah left title and we're gonna do um right title so since we put this comma in here it's going to add the same styles for both of these so let's save that just to make sure that styles are applying across the board there we are okay so we have the same styles all the way down good now let's see what we're working with for for these each one of these all right oh goodness um all right this is not too bad so we want to target all h2s that have a class of title that live within a left tag or a right tag so uh we can we can definitely do that so let's let's do this over here it's going to be a little tricky to do it in dev tools not not impossible but let's just do it over here so let's do a left tag and let's say h2 title and then let's do a write tag and then we'll say h2 title so this will target what we wanted to target we could hover over that so any h2s with a class of title that are within a left tag or a right tag and that's what we're going to go with here and let's based on what we've seen with the other things we styled we can pretty much guess without even looking what's going to work so let's do a font size of 18 pixels and we'll do a font weight and we're going to keep it at that 400 pixels if you start to go below below 400 it gets a little bit difficult to read if you have a nice screen it's okay and it actually looks really good but for users that have older screens it's it's very hard to to read so although aesthetically i really like how it looks i mean from just out of respect for a lot of the users that may not have you know high definition screens i'm not i'm going to very rarely go below 400 unless we're talking about large font sizes and so finally uh we're going to make the color let's just copy and paste so we don't have to type that out again but i want to try it with a lighter gray color because we need i think we need some differentiation here because we have a lot of levels going on so let's try 54. usually the values i end up using are either 87 or 54. never pure black um and this will give us a lighter gray color that'll still be readable so let me refresh i do have like auto auto refresh set up here but since the uh there's a bit of lag here it's kind of running a little slow from the live stream i just keep doing this you know manually okay so let me zoom in here it's easy to see so right now we do have this font weight looks a little big left h2 title that's interesting why is this did i mess it up oops i put pixels in the font weight uh i'm sure some of you already caught that and put it in the uh in the live chat so sorry if i didn't glance over there but yeah that's can't put pixels in the font weight it's just a regular you know number okay that that looks nicer so this what we have right now uh not too bad well we forgot to style this i'm not that worried about styling that so i'm going to leave that alone for now and let's see so we'll come to the page i just kind of wanted like zoom out and just see the the big picture here so we come to the page we see the mission aims okay and now we go down sample program classics first year first semester second semesters okay it's it's a bit much it is a bit much you know what i wonder let's shrink this down and see what it would look like on a small screen like on a phone uh let's see it's not too bad i think there needs to be uh some some work with the padding and the margins here so we need you know better spacing so it doesn't all run together and i think we don't need links for each one of these so for this oh so for this one it has it here because this whole thing changes when you click it so that's why it keeps repeating that link so we don't need to do that i do want to see what what happens when this goes small okay interesting all right so it it it doesn't display them all but it still has this kind of uh stacked look within each one okay all right not it's not terrible i don't think we're gonna get into doing anything like this right now but i'm gonna keep that open as kind of a possibility here okay all right so let's go back to what we have here and all right let's see where this oops where this is let's inspect that and okay view all so this is within a view all tag and classics classes text that's really weird i don't want it to say that um i don't know why it says that okay so let's take these view all tags and which one are we going to i wonder if we could all right let me let me just get over what i'm kind of thinking now uh so i'm thinking we definitely don't need the same link four times on the page we really just need it one time oh excuse me we need to link one time and my thought was okay well let me hide all of them except for one but i also had a thought that you know the the url for this is going to be pretty predictable it's just going to be classics and classes so potentially we could just put into our indoor component another element there in our component to display it and it can just add in are our slug right for that particular uh page into here and just build the url like that the benefit of doing it that way is that we can use link prefetching so right now this is built in so if i click this we're going to get a page refresh so let's let's see see we get a page refresh which obviously takes longer so we don't really want that yeah so let's do it let's do it like that so first things first let's take view all and we're going to say let's just put it right here with this br all right so view all is gonna be display none and then we'll just put in and that's also gonna solve the problem of the uh the text here being weird like classics classes text doesn't really say to the user what's going to be on that page so i guess i'll have to refresh my auto refresh is just not happening all right there we go so we've gotten rid of that and just to add this in i guess we could add this in quickly let me see how much time i have 10 minutes okay that's enough time we can go back to our major.js and we could see what we're going to get is the id our id i believe is what we're going to want and that would be classics right all right so let's go down here our query is bringing in all this data so after that yeah we can put our other element after that so let's just add a link tag and make sure we've imported our link tag and we have not maybe we can just copy and paste it from an existing component so i know we have the drawer item.js is doing this so we're gonna import link from next link so this part here is getting a little bit more advanced uh we're using react so if you're not familiar with this uh don't worry about it this is definitely not css stuff but i'm just gonna copy and paste a few things just to save time and then we're gonna get back to our css so let's get our link okay and link there we go so all right this will get auto formatted i know it looks weird now but we don't need a key for this oops and we can put no we're going to put that in manually yeah let's do um so this is going to be uh template literal so template literal is when you want to put in a string but you want to also have some javascript in there as well it makes it a lot easier than having to do a normal string and then concatenate uh that together with plus signs with some some javascript so what we want to do is just put um oops let's do this first part is going to be our our id so this props id actually did we deconstruct yeah this props id okay uh so we have this props id and i forgot i forgot this so when we want to use javascript we put a dollar sign and some curly brackets and then after the next curly bracket we drop right back into stringland and we can just put the string which is which is classes all right so that's what works here uh and let's see let's look over here i'm glad we have this open uh so we did have some weirdness going on where uh we needed we needed to add some things and as page type academics and pages let's let's pull this in just to see okay so are we pulling this in pulling this in his page is it really paige are we doing this as i think we're doing these classes as a major type nope it's no major id classes uh id is gonna be this props id oops and then hyphen let's change this to template literal syntax oops i'm gonna explain what i'm doing here in just a second and hope that it works uh it's just gonna be course descriptions all right let's save that okay so assuming this is gonna work which i'm assuming here is that uh we're adding in uh the url that'll be seen in the in the browser but we're also adding in this as and this is going to send some data to our um to our router and enable this link to act as clientside routing so that's why we're we're kind of doing this uh if you want to know why we do it like this check out show me what issue or pull request you know what if anybody's interested in the why let me know in the live chat and i will take the time to look up where the you can get more info about this in the repository uh otherwise if nobody's really interested then i'm not going to look it up right now but let's let's see if this even works there we go course descriptions yeah not working i did the wrong thing maybe i should check the server to see if i'm using uh the correct correct words here so majors all right this could be a problem majors all right let's see if that makes a difference uh you know what i flipped them around that's what i was worried about okay so the as url needs to go is the href all right let's switch it i messed it up makes a lot more sense now all right so this needs to be as and this needs to be ahref all right okay now let me refresh make sure this actually went through so it shouldn't so what was happening is it was showing us all those parameters when we hovered over and that's not what it should show us it just shows something that looks like a normal url all right so this now is looking like a normal url and so i'm going to click this and see what happens yeah there we go all right so i don't know if you caught that but what happened was uh hopefully if you saw the last time we tried to load this page it took a while now it was very fast because we never refreshed the page it routed clientside so that's what we wanted to happen let's go back and click it one more time just to see very fast so it's using clientside routing it's using prefetching caching so this is going to make the speed just that much faster and because we did it like this where we we put in variables instead of hardcoding this this will now work for every major page so they'll all have this here uh now part of the problem let me see this is the we're gonna have this now at the bottom of here so we'll have to think about what we want to do with that you know maybe we don't have uh these type of things appear on a major page so we'll have to work that out but for now i it looks a lot better so this this is just such a huge improvement over what was there when we started remember we had these huge font sizes and font weights and the spacing was really weird so this is not perfect and it's not really how i want it to be ideally but let's say we ran out of time and didn't get to do anything else with this this is still readable it makes some kind of sense visually so that's i'm okay with that for you know for what it is for right now all right awesome so my timer went off and now for the rest of the stream i'm gonna do questions uh although i probably should commit this so that you all can see all the code i gotta remember 245 is where i left off so let's do a git status if you're not familiar with git this will be like a really really tiny uh basic tutorial so when we use git status is the command in our terminal it shows us that we've modified the major.js file and then we've added a major.css file that's exactly what we worked on so that's that's what i expected to see so that's good let's we need to add these files to the staging area now so we're going to do a git add and i want to add all the files so i'm just going to put a period there hit enter now if we do a git status you can see these are green now they're in the this they're staged right so they're ready to be committed and i'm gonna use this command called yarn cm this does not come with git by default this was in addition just to help us make uh nice commit messages so let's say uh we're gonna add a new feature and uh we're just gonna write a very short statement explaining what we did and we'll just say add styles for uh course for sample sample schedules sample class schedules so you want it to be short but descriptive enough that you'll be able or someone else will be able to go back and read it and say okay i know what that's about so think like one sentence sample class schedules great there we are and are there breaking changes no does it affect any open issues i believe it does let me see i don't think i have that open i do yes let's check out the issues here style sample program sections so that's issue 102. so let's uh say that yes it does affect an open issue and let's say it affects issue uh number 102. now it's going to run some tests and i actually uh i changed one thing in the repository and for those of you who are contributing this should help you out a long time ago just kind of for demonstration purposes i had set the endtoend testing to not use the headless version of chrome browser so it actually popped up with a browser and you could see it going through the pages and then that was taking longer than it needed to so i went back and i set that to actually use the headless version and it cut the times about in half so if you had a slower computer your end end test might be timing out as they time out after 30 seconds i think so it should be better now if you download the latest changes uh i just committed them right before the stream started so hopefully that will help with with the time so sorry about that i just i didn't realize that i never switched it back which i should have because i could see it happening every time all right so let me go back while that's doing its thing i'm going to scroll back up to is that the timestamp 245 and i'm going to answer as many questions as i can here i should be what time is it i should be able to get to all the questions let's see uh hermene says so we'll not modify the html at all uh no not if we can help it uh i'm not opposed to using javascript though to modify it uh so just like we did when we added in that that extra link tag if we do it in a way that could be used across the board on all components i'm okay with that alright so everything passed and now we can do a get push origin and that'll push all our changes right up to our master branch so if you want to check out what we've done you can see it now in our github repo everything is up to date all right so i am skipping over some of the questions because they were answered right away uh by other people in the chat so uh thank you uh for for answering so many questions you are being really helpful when and answering each other's questions well it is you know we did have a lot more people than normal today i don't know what it was uh for anybody who may be here that's not normally here uh could you let me know uh how did you hear about the stream and and what made you decide to watch it today i'm just i have no idea what's different today i mean i haven't checked any messages maybe i got retweeted by somebody with a lot of followers it doesn't even look like that though all right yeah so i'm not really sure uh yeah okay so him emmy is one of the new ones cool thanks for watching so i just heard one of my kids in the background all right he's talking to uh to my wife all right i missed it har [ __ ] had said uh he was gonna go to sleep so uh if you watch the end of this harsha thank you so much for all your help here and in the live chat answering questions and uh thank you for staying up so late in harsh it's time zone it's it's well after midnight um so what is it might be like yeah it's really late it's like the middle of the night i need to get some better lighting see my it's really dark in here all right uh lone wolf says i'm just done through css html bootstrap and the front end course is that enough for me to comprehend all of this um you could probably comprehend all the like the css stuff if you're not familiar with react it may be a little bit more difficult to get what's going on there but i try to do uh his best the best job that i can with explaining things along the way and you can ask you know feel free to ask questions so i'd say give it a shot uh if you find that it's really difficult to follow along then you know hey maybe maybe this stream at this point is not for you but i i do try to do a mix of things that are you know different types of things uh different levels so you know some of them might be good you know for you where you're at right now some of them you know maybe not oh yeah you know what phoenix has a good point um the uh the main benefit i could see to this stream is seeing what it's like for a frontend developer to actually work through issues on a project have things break uh problems come up and you know try to try to just work through it and fix it also the ability to ask questions with so many you know really knowledgeable developers here in the live chat is is good as well um so in the sense of this being like a tutorial for let's say react or anything it's not really that uh but it it can give some i i mean i think it gets some good experiences to you know what do you do when things don't work uh when you have deadlines you know what and you can't get everything done like what do you do how do you handle that um and i try to explain what happens like you know if i have a meeting and somebody wants something changed uh or i disagree with the change but we still have to do it you know things like that that you don't really get in any tutorials or online courses but you deal with you know in in the real world in jobs so we talk about stuff like that so i think that's really even if you don't necessarily understand the coding part of it you know things like that anybody can understand lone wolf asks where do i learn react or angular uh there's a lot of pl so the react documentation itself is really good uh udacity has a react course it's a paid course though i went i did the react nano degree through udacity and i i thought it was valuable uh but you don't have to spend money there's a lot of you know free react courses out there um i think i don't know i know some of you have used some react stuff so if you can think of any good react courses put in the live chat now please uh what else have i used i think codecademy has a react course so you know between some you know youtube videos and some of the documentation and the free courses out there you can you can get some good experience with react i am not as familiar with angular though so i can't help you you know quite as much there in terms of what where good resources are okay john says when you have no container for your markup you can use grid flex will work a bit but not easily all right you know what john i kind of wish i had seen that earlier but all right i'm i'm going to keep that in mind though and then maybe you know we'll try to use grid to um to display those and at least on desktop we can display them in in two columns instead of just one column um solely says uh which cms produced this markup uh it's an old uh dotnet framework based cms called ektron so it's ektron so i i almost never come across someone who even has heard of it i never heard of it until i got this job so uh it's i i think it's rare oh meyer says grid does require a parent component holding the children in his case he has none i believe yeah that's true we don't have any um john says it's easy enough to wrap the component in a grid div i yeah you know what maybe the solution is going to be that we may have to add some things with javascript off to see if that's going to be possible uh solely said the the current content is over 500 page in wordpress but it was brought over from an older cms that's correct and it's actually more than 500 pages it's uh i haven't really counted but i mean potentially like if we're looking at over a thousand uh so it's it's quite a lot i'm trying to condense it as much as i can and clean up the data i think there's there's a lot that does not need to be split out into different you know pages or posts in wordpress and there's some stuff that we can just completely delete uh so we'll see what the count is once i get it all cleaned up but as of right now we're looking at over a thousand things i don't even have all the data uh transferred over yet uh meyer says i'm getting noise oh okay i'm i'm sorry i didn't see that earlier uh let me know if it's if anybody else was getting noise if you're still getting any noise um let's see if you have questions help me please what javascript framework for css animation is the best or vanilla js is the best way um green sock a lot of people use something called green sock for um for animation or for javascript animation um trying for css animation i'm not sure i mean if you want to mix javascript in as well go try out green suck i'm not sure about a css animation framework though uh lone wolf says any suggestions about how many hours i should dedicate to the free code camp front end course per day uh honestly i would if you can spend an hour a day at it i think that's good as long as you can be consistent uh i mean like it depends on what you're doing like right now if you have another job shoot for an hour a day if you can if you don't have another job and you can dedicate more time to it then you know try to dedicate more time but if you could do an hour a half hour every day that'll keep it in your mind every day and you'll be much more likely to uh to retain the information that that you learn uh flo vest says my raspberry pi arrives in two days any ideas what what i could do with it okay if anyone has any ideas about what to do with a raspberry pi put it in the in the chat please or if you're watching later on you can put it in the comments um yeah you can do one of those smart mirrors with the raspberry pi right i've always wanted to do one of those those look really cool but i guess there's there's so much stuff i that i've seen people do that really cool i guess it kind of depends on how much work you want to do how much money you want to put into it uh solely says which extension adds that tool tip for the h2 title i actually have no idea what extension that is i was surprised when it showed up that's the first time i had ever used it uh let's see let's see what it is let's see if we can see let's check my extensions maybe we might be able to tell just by the titles of the extensions okay uh css to react i'm guessing not only island hmm okay it's not really obvious just for my the names of my extensions what what does that so i'm not sure i don't really want to take the time to go through all of them but i'll leave this on the screen so at least you can see some of the extensions i'm using and try them out so i'm listening to spotify in the background and right now uh a song came on and it's ed sheeran doing a cover of uh britney spears um uh hit me baby one more time it was just so weird to hear that uh all right then um bargov says i'm a beginner i don't know anything but i have a craze about programming please help me to learn uh yeah i mean just stick around the streams and ask a lot of questions if you have any specific questions let me know i'm happy to help and there's a lot of other people here that are you know very helpful lone wolf asked if there's any implementation of jquery here no in this project we're not using any jquery uh bargov says how can i learn this programming um i mean we did a lot of css today so i mean just you do basic css tutorials um phoenix says start free code camp yet actually that's a great place to start go to freecodecamp.org and you know sign up and just do some of the exercises that will get you started you know you'll start out you know with some really basic stuff and work your way up in in difficulty and complexity and that'll give you a really good idea too of uh if this is for you if you know if you really like the work uh vlad asks if there will be training projects on angular i don't plan on doing anything with angular uh for my live streams but we did have um angular video recently on free code camp so if you check back you know through the last maybe just scroll back it's somewhere in the last like 10 videos or so that were released there was one about angular so check that out um i haven't watched it yet but you know that may be a good place to start uh sathvik says which what is good to learn flask i don't really know anything about flask so i wouldn't be able to help help you if anybody knows about flask uh please um let uh saatvik uh know uh here in the uh in the live chat or in the comments of the video uh let's see bargov says why don't you start your own company uh to be honest with you um for my um doing your own company involves a lot of work that's not coding work and i'm just not interested in that work so i don't know if if there was if i had a partner that was interested in all that work meaning like the work of uh doing taxes doing payroll collecting payments from clients uh marketing the company if there are people that were interested in that and i could just do the code i would be okay with that but i was freelance i had to do all that stuff before i just don't enjoy it i'd rather just spend my time doing coding and let somebody else worry about that so that's one of the reasons why i don't start my own company uh hammy says shout out from tunisia happy to be with you uh awesome awesome thank you i'm glad you're with us too john says i know this is a nudge to installing style components but you can then append all the incoming markup tags with styled uh ie cons style left title equals your css here okay i didn't realize we could do that off maybe we'll have to look into that more uh ash ashwini says need help and documentation uh ashwini i'm not sure if you're asking if i need help with documentation or if you're saying that you need help and documentation so um let me know which is which uh we always need help with everything so if you'd like to uh check out the repository for this project or some of the other projects that we've been knowing uh links in the description and uh submit a pull request working on some of the documentation that would be awesome uh it's definitely it's not expected or required of anyone but it's definitely appreciated uh scrub is says uh how did you set up react on salesforce actually i didn't do when we did stuff with salesforce we didn't set up react with salesforce that would be awesome but i never did it we just use like plain css and javascript uh hamami says isn't it better to use uh rem instead of pixels um yeah meyer says yes it's better uh yeah you know what that's something that keeps coming up as well i just use pixels because in my mind uh i ca i know what size in terms of pixels i need and what will work i i haven't used uh em or rem enough to be able to visualize that yet so that's why i just fall back on pixels so i would really have to make an effort to try to use um rem more uh when i could get to that point so especially for streams when i'm trying to talk and do this at the same time and try to do it quickly i just default back to pixels so um and that's just i started out with pixels and that's you know what i use 90 of the time at least so that's that's just kind of where my my mind is let's see oops it it scrolled me down to the bottom and i lost my place let me scroll back uh uh okay john says i guess i'm shocked that those tags are being accepted as html markup the w3 consortium validator would never pass that yeah i i don't worry about that the validator but i mean they're just it probably just reads it as you know custom elements uh which which are okay uh me says if you want uh jesse tell us about some keyboard shortcuts you use um generally what do i use i don't know what i use that's like beyond just the normal stuff um i mean in the terminal obviously you know you use your up and down arrow keys to go through past commands uh use tab for autocomplete a lot so both in the terminal and you know in my my editor other than that i'm not really it would probably help if i did learn more uh more hotkeys but you know right now i you know just use some really basic ones i wish i used more i wish i had a a cooler answer for that but i just used pro you know basic ones that most people know about uh raul says hi nice to see you back um remember me wish me luck sunday is my entrance my my last chance oh okay well good yeah definitely good luck with that and uh let us know if you can let us know how everything goes you know next next week okay so uh ro sharma says i was going through youtube and the title got me okay cool so the title uh so i guess a lot of people you know maybe maybe it was the title of basic css that you know people responded to uh eddie says are you still in school or are you working for a company um yeah so i'm i'm working for uh for a university so i'm a fulltime frontend developer uh working for a company uh slowly says i'm i'm new but since i follow free code camp i got a notification from youtube that there will be a basic css styling live stream never done react though but i think i will go back and do it okay cool yeah yeah i didn't really want this to be like about react i wanted to try to stick to the css as much as possible but we ended up having to do a little react stuff at the end uh but you know hopefully it was there was enough css in there that it was maybe useful to some people uh chat play says i subscribe to this channel since i don't know react well i watch recorded episodes from project one okay cool cool uh how many just activated notifications on your channel i'm currently doing the free code camp algorithms flowvest the same cool there was a github link today uh darshan asked where the github link is for the code we developed today it should be in the description to this video so there should be a link to the github repo says is there a standard free code camp link or is the same as airbnb repo that yesterday you posted uh enzyme and just stuff on yeah it should be the link should be in the description so it'll be like uh fus dash marcom slash franciscan uh hyphen reacts uh that'll be the that'll be part of the link it'll be a github link and that'll be the end of it hard knock muscle says if you started your own company what would it be um i guess it would be cool to have a company like based around like a product like let's say i don't know i had a good idea and you could just dedicate time to that i mean i don't know what it would be but you know some sort of webbased you know service or something otherwise you know maybe some sort of agency uh that we did work for i just i don't know i don't know how i really feel about about an agency i've done some work with agencies before and i there there's good and bad to it right i mean it's kind of cool that you get to work on different things uh but yeah i don't know i mean you're always having to look for new clients and so there's not a lot of stability necessarily um yeah so i don't know i'm not really sure but something along those lines i guess would be you know what i'd want to do uh alicia asks are you doing css styling right now um no i mean right we're just kind of doing question and answer stuff right now so if you want to see the css part you can watch the recording so you can go back and watch the beginning and we did that like the the end here we're just doing question answers so if you have any questions uh please you know feel free to put them in the in the live chat uh nino says what would you consider yourself a web designer a web developer um i consider myself a developer that does design occasionally when when i need to so we don't really have where i work at we don't have a dedicated web designer so i do have to do some of that work but it's it's i think a small part of of what i do so i've with a lot of help from google's material design i've developed a style guide for university websites and then i basically follow that style guide so i don't have to come up with brand new designs every time i just i i use you know basic framework that is that i've developed and then you know design some elements as needed if something new comes up uh john says it's usually the people here on chat who let jesse know about the cool keyboard shortcuts yeah that's for sure you all give me so many uh really awesome uh tips about stuff like that i learned so much from you all um how many says is it possible to work as a developer for free like for donation uh like a donation yeah okay so i'm not i'm not 100 sure how you mean that like you could donate your services to someone else that's definitely possible um i i do that for uh some organizations around here like some nonprofits um or are you saying like people would donate to you for your work that's also possible um so the um uh was it henry's henry zhu uh he's at leftpad on twitter um he recently uh quit his fulltime job to volunteer to maintain the babble repository fulltime and he right now he's living off of donations so the last time i heard i think it was up to like um on his patreon uh they've donated it's like three thousand dollars a month for him to work uh full time on um on this open source project on babel so i think that's really cool that that would actually be pretty awesome to do okay oh and darshan says volunteermatch.org has some coding positions okay cool i've never been to volunteermuch.org but that might be you know cool to check out all right wow i've finally gotten to the bottom of the chat today was uh we had a lot in the chat which is awesome i always loved that a lot of new people so thank you all for watching um and especially for the new people thank you so much and thanks for letting me know how you how you got here and how you found this and you know i'd love to see you back at some point and if any of y'all have any um any advice for how this stream could be better you know what you liked or disliked about it you know please let me know uh i won't get upset if you have any criticism uh i really do want to make this stream better for you all so you know i welcome any any type of criticism or or advice you have uh so i should be back tomorrow trying to think about my schedule tomorrow all right i don't remember when my schedule is tomorrow i definitely have meetings in the morning so the stream won't be in the morning it'll more than likely be sometime in the afternoon uh eastern time uh but i'll try to schedule stream as early as i can i'll post on twitter i'll post on instagram uh so if you're interested uh and you you want to get notifications definitely um subscribe to freecodecam's channel turn on notifications if you'd like you can also follow me on twitter and or instagram and i'll i'll post something about that too just to let you know streams gonna happen um yeah and i thank you all so much again uh and until tomorrow have a wonderful day
