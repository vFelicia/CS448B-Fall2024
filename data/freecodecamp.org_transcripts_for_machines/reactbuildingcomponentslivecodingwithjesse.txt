hey everybody is Jessie today we're going to build some reactive components let's see what we have so far since yesterday haven't really added that much I think I added a few more pages and some component names about it in some components I'll show you what's going on this is the reacts and if this is the react side so we have a component now for this hero section and we have a component for this this nav which is actually separate and for this sticky nav we also have a component for the footer so now we need to fill in some of the other stuff but you can see it looks nearly identical the only big change I want I want your opinion on this had a meeting this morning so I see I didn't get that much done between yesterday and today because today was filled mostly with meetings and paperwork and reviewing applications and we're hiring we're actually going to hire a web developer so if anybody's interested in that position you have web development experience let me know I guess send me send me a message on Twitter or I guess you put in the comments below if you're interested but I changed so in a meeting today it was mentioned that you know we wanted more of like a cursive type font so the font on the right is what we had and that's this same font that we're using for the that most of the H tags and then this is the font that I'm trying out I'm not really sure and at this point I'm ready to move on and not mess with fonts anymore so if you guys have an opinion about fonts let me know comment put in the live chat if you think there's another font that would be better let me know I'm I'm trying to stick you know with google fonts there's you know some free fonts they're widely available basically what I'm looking for is something similar to this like a handwriting font that's very let's say kind of formal and thin so if you have a font in mind the one on the rights more legible right okay so I was reading from the from the live chat we have some comments at the one on the right is more legible yeah I I like the one on the right but I think I'm gonna I don't know I might lose this one here and have to go with the font that looks more like this so we'll see maybe I'll try out a couple of fonts present them all at the next meeting and see you know see what people think so I mean I I do kind of like this one but sometimes you know you got to go you can't always make all the decisions on a site and other other people involved usually so thanks for the input yeah it looks like a lot of people like the one on the right we have some people who do like the one on the left okay all right I'm going to move these over so you can show you more what's going on if if you weren't watching yesterday I'll give you a quick recap we had a static website that we built and you just saw some of it on the screen when I show you the different fonts we're converting that website into a react website we install a react yesterday locally using next Jas which helps us install it very quickly we got everything installed and we actually had you know a page up and running in less than a half an hour so super quick I have links to all that in the show description so now the task is just to convert everything so next I'll show you what we have here next has a folder for pages and it handles all the routing for you if you put files in the pages folder so let me show you in this pages folder each one of these is going to be a different page and if I just if I go to that page and the address in the address bar it will just automatically route to that page very convenient and then your components can go in whatever folder you want I have an in folder named components and that's pretty much it next also handles serverside rendering which is awesome it does a lot of other cool stuff too and we'll probably get into more that as we build things out all right it seems like from the live chat everybody likes the one on the right all right at the next meeting I'm going to try really hard to convince everybody that we should go with the one on the right I think readability is probably the best reason I do think it looks better in general also it's one less font we have to load since we're already loading it so maybe I'll come in with some tangerine from hey that's awesome you know what that font was that is the tangerine fun that's crazy I don't know that I could just bought a font and know what it was right off the bat so that's you have a really good eye somebody in the last room knew exactly what this font was oh yeah they're saying less less font defend dependencies better performance that's that's what I'm thinking so okay I think I have some good reasons to make a case for the font that was on the right so I'm going to try that my next meeting actually I'm going to let you guys know next week I have meetings during my normal livestream time on Monday and Tuesday so Tuesday will be the next meeting we'll discuss this website then on Wednesday Thursday and Friday I'll be gone the syntax con conference in South Carolina is going to be that at the end of next week so I will be there I'm thinking about doing some live streams from the conference Oh we'll see how it goes I'm not really sure how the WiFi is going to be so I may just do some recordings and then upload them when I get a chance to get somewhere with with good WiFi but it might be cool to do some live streams so next week is going to be kind of a weird week I'm going at Monday and Tuesday I'll just reschedule the live streams for maybe earlier in the day and stuff like so many meetings coming up next week I don't know about you guys but I could code all day but you put me in a meeting for an hour and it just drains me so I don't know what it is about meetings all right let's get let's get back to this so I want to build some components so let's just pick out something to build so I already have some components built and I have other ones that I I don't have build at all so let's check out this team card so this one's blank this will be a nice one to build up so let me show you what we're going to build first and then we'll build it and you see it's it's super easy to convert existing HTML into a component depending on the amount of act you know interactivity that component has it could be a little bit more complicated but in this case what we're going to do is not going to be that complicated so let me bring this over okay so if you remember I don't know if I made these a lot I don't think I made these live but I'm pretty sure I at least showed this section okay I did do a video where we we made this little hide and show section so we have these cards at the meeting this morning these were big hit and the way this section works so I was happy about that because this was kind of the design of this was one of the most kind of made up parts I say that is I try to follow material design mostly but this kind of thing was not it's kind of off the path it's not really spelled out in material design so when I go out and get a little creative on my own like that it's always I don't know it's always a little stressful for me to see you know whether it's going to work or not but in this case it worked out we're actually going to convert another part of the site to use a similar system won't do that in this video but this is what we're going to take so let me find the code for this and we'll copy it over if someone's asked saying they need help with react native so yeah I haven't worked with react native yet I watch some videos on it and read about it and I'm super interested in it but I haven't had an opportunity to work with it and I should say this as well I am no expert on react I haven't built very many things with react I have built sites that are that are live that have launched that are working with react but I'm still very much learning a lot of the you know kind of the react way to do things so if you have used react I'm sure you'll spot some things that that I could be doing better and go ahead and let me know in the comments so let me know in the live chat if if you see something that could be done better I'll try to incorporate your suggestions I will have a repo up for this react site soon right now it just exists locally I'm actually not even tracking it with it at this point since I just started it but I will soon and as soon as I put that up I'll put the link to the new repo in the description for the video the repo for the static site that were we're converting is is up it is on github and you can check that up so on my other screen which you can't see I'm just finding the code that we wrote the the markup for those little cards for some reason my it's going a little slow so I apologize I'm like trying to scroll when it's just not it's not scrolling fast so I don't know I'm going to I actually went through today and closed a lot of the windows that I wasn't using but it's still giving me a little bit of trouble alright so we're going to grab I'll grab some of those code and actually let me paste just to help us out we'll copy this section over so you don't have to type all this up and we'll change the name so he says class you're going to use the name of your component two places up here at the top and then down here where you export it to name it here and then you export it here so we'll type in the name of team cards and now we'll copy in the markup now I'll show you there's just a few things that you absolutely have to change or you're going to get an error so you have some weird spacing things well I have a weird spacing things alright that looks better okay so when you copy over something in Iraq you can't use class you have to use class name so I'll go through everywhere where I've used class and just put class name at the end and also we have to have closing tags for everything so I'm glad this is in here this is a good example this image tag let me make this bigger I think I shrunk this down after the video yesterday to give me more space so they make this bigger there we go okay I'm kind of ignoring a live chat a little bit so I can get through this so I apologize for that I'll try to check back in a minute and see if there's any questions okay I just had this helmet it's as nice pasting by the way class name yet if you're not familiar with Adam it Adams not the only editor that can do this a lot other editors can but it has this cool feature which you know multiple cursors so I highlight the and an atom on Mac I press commandd and then it just keeps going down and and now I have all these cursors so I can type backspace you could even if if I had copied something I could paste it in there but I think the last thing I copy it was all that code if I tried to pay so now be a mess but it really comes in handy it saves a lot of time from having the you know edit those by hand you can accomplish a similar thing by you know find and replace but that just is a lot quicker at least for me if I had like hundreds of things I would I would do find a replace but if it's like 10 or or fewer then I use the multiple cursors so anyway this image tag will this will give me an error so actually let's let's just make it give the error first just to show you what it looks like again error and react and then we'll fix it so first I need to link this up right now this component exists but it's not linked up to any page so we need to put it in a page so the only page right now that I really have built out at all is this index page so if we'll see here at the top we're importing all the components that we need I don't know if there's an easier way to import these than one on each line if there is let me know because I would rather not have a separate line for every component but you can see all I'm doing is saying here what the name of the component is and then I'm saying where their component lives at in our file structure so we named our component team cards why don't I name it cards it should be singular what was I thinking this is going to bug lis so I'm just going to change it real quick because this is not going to be more than one card this is just one card so I'm going to say that I'm going to rename this okay now there we go okay so now that we've imported it here we're free to use it down here so inside of this this render function that's where we put our HTML so let's go ahead and throw this down below that sticky enough and all we're going to do is just put it in HTML tag team code and remember we have to close that up but in this case we are we're trying to get an error so I'm going to save this and then I'm going to bring over I'm going to bring this over okay let me let me make this Biggs you can see it's super small right now error messages in react are awesome they're very descriptive they tell you exactly where the error is so it says we have a syntax error they expected a closing tag for image and it tells you exactly where it is and then it actually shows you the code so it says you know basically it got to here and was confused because it didn't see what it expected to see so we can look back right before that we say okay we have this image tag and we never close that image tag so a lot of the times when you get an error in react it will be pretty easy to fix it so let's go back over here we'll go to our team card and let's just close this up all we have to do is just add that slash in and I'm going to save it and go back there we go okay so we see the team card right now we're not seeing the image because I need to change the image path okay but it's basically a team card the reason it looks all huge like this is because I didn't put it inside our container that's going to constrain its its width so I have to make a decision I guess whether I want the team card to come built in with that container or whether I want to put in that container in the page or maybe in another component I guess I don't have to make that decision right now the only reason I don't want to put the container here is I would rather have the freedom to use these cards in different sized containers so a half with container full with a third width of the page okay I'm saying Fabian in the live stream is putting in some stuff I'm not I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to say if Fabian so maybe leave a comment for me and explain it more okay so we have about 10 minutes left so let's fix this Wow okay I don't know why that image didn't work actually I had I just thought that I gave it the wrong path but this should work because it's not pointing to a local image it's pointing to this other website hmm all right I'm just going to inspect this quickly just to see and this is this is kind of the point of the the livestream is to show the times where things go wrong because I mean that's what realistic usually in my daytoday work you know thinks things don't work like I want them to the first time you know sometimes that happens often and you gotta figure out what's going on hmm yeah I'm not exactly sure I'll show you what I'm what I'm seeing here I can make this a little bigger okay so maybe you see something that I don't see but this looks this looks like it should work maybe I could check okay I have crazy stuff going on now and the console I'll show you this error is coming from that sticky nerve I think this is because I keep resizing the screen and it's it it thinks the stickeen app should be there and it keeps looking for it so let me refresh to get rid of some of that and then we can look so you see I have all kinds of weird stuff happening if you guys know I mean some of these errors are obvious I'm just not loading in fonts where I should be right now which which is okay I'm not worried about that at this point I'm getting this error here this SW so like serviceworker I guess I'm not exactly sure what's going on with that error if anybody knows let me know in the comments and that would be helpful otherwise you know I'm going to look it up if this just happens in development and then on production it's not a big deal then I'm not that worried about it oh okay when we were trying to get this thing it resulted trying at that image resulted in a error the promise was rejected okay I'll figure that out later on yeah that's it this is fetch event network your response okay yeah you guys you guys saw it before I did so someone else named Jesse in the live stream saw that before I did okay somebody asked about the dark theme in the Google Chrome console as well and somebody mentioned react dev tools yeah I do have the react dev tools installed they are very helpful the dark theme you just go under the settings for dev tools there's a setting you can either pick the the light theme of the dark theme yes hello Jessie it's kind of weird to see my name in the in the stream but that's cool thanks for watching welcome alright so let's see if we can get in about five minutes if we can get another component built and maybe it might be cool to maybe make a component that imports another component so let me see if I have one zero four I might just have to make a new one let me go back here components let's uh let's make a not sure if I want this to be a component I need something like this at some point so let's try it out so we're going to make section did I not make yeah it showed up here okay it's going to make section a component first I'm going to copy this you see this is this is pretty much how I do components it's a lot of copying of just the boilerplate stuff so we don't have to retype it alright so the section component and what I want this to do I guess I could be faster from your copy I'm going to copy it from the other code okay so I'm gonna copy a lot of stuff and we're going to take some out so I just want the section you can see listen to anyone more okay um this will work and I just want it this is I'm going to be kind of more like a test section I'll probably use this at some point but I'll have to modify it to use it in the actual site but what I'm going to do is import that team card into this section and let's let's shrink it down a little bit let's let's do m6 so this will make it you know 50% of the width of a container and let's put in team card and then we need to import the team card so I'm going to copy the import from index 3 next page okay this I think this should work alright so we say that now let's go into our index page and let's bring in let's import this section and we'll just we'll add this in right above the regular team card okay so I'm going to say that it's going to refresh and we'll see if we have any errors where's my oh it's over here okay so it definitely worked I'm not exactly sure why the column thing didn't work I'm checking out and dev tools here so the section ah you guys probably caught what just happened I'll show you I left in these classes I'm actually really surprised that I didn't get any any error message popping up I probably did my console though so I need to put class name there lesson is it action is everything too big I can shrink it down a little bit let me know if you think the the font is too big and my editor I think that's what early you guys are talking about in the live chat ok let's see if this makes a difference yes there we go okay so you can see now we've actually put a component into another component and then added that component into a page and it's basically the same process all the way through you just have to make sure you import it you have to say where you're importing it from and then you include it down here make sure you have class maintenance at a class and make sure you close out all your tags name your component export your component and then when you go to put it on page make sure you import it again and then just put it where you want on the page now this is really simple what's going to end up happening though is at some point we're not just going to say teen card we're going to take this team card and we're going to put it like in a loop let's say so up here we'll actually import data from from an API we're going to use the WordPress API at some point so all our content is going to live in you know in WordPress we're going to call that and it's actually going to call it on the server render it on the server and it's just going to loop through and fill that data into the team cards as as much data as we have so we're going to end up with you know probably 100 cards we're going to sort them out by section you know by category but we only have to make the team card one time so whereas before let me see if I can show you let me show you the markup it's crazy long so the markup I just switched over this is the static site so you can see for that that same page where we have all those cards this is what it looks like that's a lot to keep track of we don't want to have to edit that so now to go back to react all that has turned into this just one time and then all this data is just going to be added in from the API and repeated so we're still going to get all the cards we need that you know the on the clientside and dev tools we would see all those but we don't have to mess with it all on our n so that's kind of the one one of the awesome things about react it's not like other things can't do this I mean this is basic templating stuff here but it is a nice thing a nice advantage if you're going to use react or some other templating system over just having everything you know static and and hand coded it's alright for maybe a one page or a small site but if you start getting a lot of repetitive elements on the page templating is the way to go all right I'm going to check the live chat real quick before we end just see if I can answer some questions you guys might have had so I'm going to scroll through alright somebody has a question any advice for landing a job after graduating from fullstack coding boot camp my advice would be apply for lots of jobs even if you don't think you meet all the requirements sometimes job descriptions are written by people in human resources who don't really know that much about the technology so they're just given a list of all the different things that a person might need they put them all on that list not realizing how crazy it sounds and really they don't need somebody who's an expert in all those things so I would recommend you know just just apply apply to places and always keep doing do side projects if you can get some freelance work that would be great but keep building up your portfolio and for your own website for your github profile and you know you'll you'll get a job there's a lot of you know developer jobs out there so if you just keep keep it up keep getting better and keep applying you'll get a job I just scroll down a little bit and I saw that somebody else said kind of the same thing try to pick up freelance works and contribute to project so I should have scrolled down a little bit more alright I'm getting almost to the end of the live chat okay you clarify it and said lesson on Chrome I'll remember that for the next live stream yeah to live streams ago everybody said make it bigger so now I made it too big somebody's asking about the time it takes to make a website that's entirely dependent on what kind of website it is how much content you know what it needs to do it's entirely possible to make a one page website in a day depends on what you're starting with why there's so many coming soon challenges in free code camp I don't actually make the challenge I don't work on those challenges so I'm not exactly sure I know you know they want to test them thoroughly and make sure that they're ready to go before they release them but here as somebody also said you can test the challenges on the beta site if you want to someone else had a question about Java on free code camp there is no Java on free code camp not not that I know of and I'm not sure somebody just asked why don't they offer it I'm not sure why it free code camp they focus on kind of a small set of things so no there's a lot of other places out there where you you kind of similar to the style free code can being able to do most of it in your browser and things like that they do offer it Java courses ok I think I got through everything and all the questions if I missed your question put it in the comments and I'll get to it later on let me know if there's anything I need to explain more in the video if you have any suggestions for me or you do anything to improve my live streams and I will be on again tomorrow same time 200 p.m. Eastern Time thanks for watching I'll see you then
