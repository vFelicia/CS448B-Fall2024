let's talk a little bit more about how the internet works we've already established that every device and every other thing along the way in the internet has its own IP address now these IP addresses are assigned based on location using these IP addresses your device can talk to your modem which you probably have in your home then to a router which is set up by your web service the router would go to the domain name server this is still just sending a request now that domain name server would send back the information that was asked for and it would go right back to your device now you might think this is pretty fallible if one of these steps goes out the whole process is done but really there's so many more connections with so many routers and so many servers that if one huge chunk of the internet goes out that still won't really affect the functionality of anything else there are just infinite connections it's amazing now what I want you to take away from this video is that your device since it has its own IP address can send out a request for information that information is sent back to your device the way it gets to your device is because of the IP address and the way it gets there is through all the lines of the modems and routers and servers that make up the internet now that explanation of the internet is really really basic if you're interested in more check out some of these links that we're providing for some more information
