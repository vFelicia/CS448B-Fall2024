hey everybody welcome to livestreaming with Jessie today we're gonna continue on with what we've been doing the last two streams and that's working on this homepage yesterday we we got some cards put in like a masonry layout but we were having some trouble getting some of the cards to take up the full width of the columns that we wanted them to be in so I actually found a fix for that that was really simple and I don't know I'm gonna lie didn't think of it yesterday or you know maybe one of you thought of it were trying to tell me in the chat and I just was not getting it but I'm gonna show you what that fixes and then we're gonna get started and and finished this page and it was so simple I just I'm almost embarrassed now how simple it was but let me get started oh there's a lot in the live chat already okay there were some questions about whether or not beginners can watch this stream I would say beginners will probably get something out of this stream they may not understand everything some streams are more beginner friendly than others this stream maybe it's like middle of the road the the whole point of me doing these videos when I first thought thought up you know the idea of doing these was just to see what it's like for me to do my job as a frontend developer and especially to help those people who are beginners or maybe people who are freelance and always work alone I know I I still don't know what it's like for developers you know who like work on a team at a big company you know what their dayin dayout job is like so I thought I'd be cool people to see that but not just seeing me but specifically see me mess up and how I work that and I thought maybe it would give beginners more confidence that you know seeing somebody who's getting paid to do this mess up so much maybe they would think hey like I'm way better than this guy I definitely can get it tough so anyway because of that I think beginners could get something from any of these shows but if you're looking for a tutorial this is not the right stream there are a lot of other great tutorials on the free code camp Channel and on other channels on YouTube but you sometimes it's somewhat like a tutorial but I I there's no way I could in good conscience call this a tutorial we just we mess up way too much and it's not really that structured so anyway if you are a beginner and you're watching feel free to stick around love to have you here and feel free to ask questions I don't answer questions right away I split it up into Pomodoro sessions or 25minute periods of coding and then I'd do five minutes of questionandanswer and then at the very end if there's any questions left over I get to all those questions so just be patient if you ask a question occasionally someone will ask a question and they'll keep asking it over and over and wondering if I'm going to answer their question well I don't even see it because I'm doing the coding so just be patient I'll get to it let's see Michael McCrea says it's usually tutorial for you Jesse that's it that's right these videos are a tutorial for me because you all helped me out so much I learned how I should say truth yeah Irish it has contributed significantly to my learning into my project so yeah glad you're here today are you sure I miss you yesterday I was trying to do it a little bit earlier so you wouldn't have to stay up so late okay all right one more thing before we start I made a video and I I posted it on my youtube channel so there's a link to that I think in the description to this video so this is the free code camp channel I do most of my live streams here but if I come out with videos on other topics or a tutorial I put that on my own personal channel so check that out if you want the video is on getting motivated after the holidays so it's just I I think I mentioned this yesterday to you all but just a really short it's like three minutes of how I got through my sluggishness after the holidays and getting back into it so maybe it'll help somebody else out if you're trying to get back in the you know in decoding after taking a little break okay let's see someone asks about languages frameworks we're using mostly JavaScript and react how Michael said up there there's no bird in the background here my I had I actually went and consulted I did some consulting work and so I just came in from outside and there's snow everywhere so the snow is melting on the bottom of my shoes and it's my shoes are squeaking on the floor as I kind of shift it out in my chair so I apologize for the weird sound that's just the squeaking of my shoes all right so that's all let me let me show you are the screen there we go okay so here's what we've got so far so not a whole lot also I forgot to push the changes to the github repo from yesterday so I apologize to anyone who tried to check out the code it wasn't up to date I pushed them this morning so it is up to date now so you can see we have these cart these three cards here were really thin now they're they're taking up the full width like they should we still need to get this gutter sorted out and we'll do that probably the first thing we work on but I want to show you how I did this so all I added to each one of these grid items here not to the Container grid which I think we removed anyway but today these great items that we were putting that we wanted to take up a certain amount of space so full width quarter with things like that we added this grid item fix class and I'll show you what it was really easy grid item fix gives it a width of 100% that's it so if you I don't know if you all remember from yesterday when we checked in dev tools on the classes that were being applied to that that div it was applying a max width based on you know what was supposed to be so if we wanted it to be fourth of the screen it was saying max width 25% but it had no width property so all I did was say okay well let's put with 100% it'll still be limited by that max width property right and that's it worth so it's a simple fix now it's not universe right so if we wanted to use this grid system on other pages we would have to make sure we keep carrying that over so depending on what we want to do with it we may want to come up with a different way to implement this kind of like globally but for right now this works fine for what we're gonna be doing today so ended up being just very simple and yeah sometimes that happens you know sometimes you gotta sleep on it and it's it worked out okay let's see let me start this Pomodoro timer and let's get that this gutter worked out to about you know the way that we want it so I do want to work within material UI here's the docks so if you want to follow on with the documentation it's material UI next comm and actually I'm just gonna paste this in right now so I can just go right to it and you know what let me sorry let me run and rock as well I forgot to do that yesterday I think I have it up here I do nope I think we're running this on for 3,000 yep we are alright so I'm gonna have a link for you all to view this on your machine as well the link doesn't wasn't working huh that's crazy it's the same length okay I don't know why the link isn't working but that that's exactly the that's really weird all right so maybe it is working for some people I mean if you go to the main site and navigate to there hopefully it will now it works okay all right seems like it's working now maybe it's YouTube redirects oh okay all right so here's what I want to check out see if there is some sort of gutter kind of built into the API maybe space space between I haven't components that contain anything five minutes okay this you can only use this on the container component and we got rid of our container component so that may not work all right maybe we'll all right so I don't think we can put the container grid back no that's not the right one yeah we did get rid of it down here I don't think we're gonna be able to put the container back without messing things up so let's try this see if it works let's just throw margin on this element we'll just give it this goes 16 pixels for now so just 16 pixels all around and let's see if this actually works I'm skeptical that this will work well with what we have going on huh Wow not bad okay but one thing it did do is it messed up our our column see so move this over so if we change it to padding maybe maybe it will have better results there we go okay so actually this is a really good kind of beginners lesson with CSS so the reason why it didn't work with margin but it does work with padding is because actually let me open up dev tools it'll be easier to explain this with with this here okay so you can see this this displays an element and I'm I'm actually going to get the card here so it's displaying okay so this is actually what we just did we just added a padding of 16 on to this so what it does here when it calculates the width of this item any padding is actually counted as the item with so when we're saying elsewhere that we only want this this container to take up 50% of this space it's going to include the padding in there when we put it as margin it doesn't include margin in the width as the width of the container so it was saying okay we're gonna have this take up just this component alone plus whatever padding we had which happened to me nothing but we're gonna take all this and make this the full 50% width but then when you add the margin in it ends up being a little bit more so maybe 52 percent with right so then if we add it up all the three elements which should be 25 25 and 50% we ended up instead of getting 100% which we should have we would end up getting something like I don't know 110 percent that's why this other one got pushed down to here because we gone over the percentage right so really you know there's it's not always obvious on when's the right time to use margin and when's the right time to use padding but in this case it's clear padding is giving us what we want here and margin did not there's price of other cases we can think of where you want to use one over the other for sure and there are some cases where you could use one or the other and it won't really make a difference Jony eight says is that still the case in borderbox that's a good point let's let's mess around a little bit with that just you know since we started let's switch this and use okay so it is it's already using border box let's have it use content box this is going to and we'll use content box and then we'll switch the margin we'll switch this to a margin okay so now this is using margin and they're also using content box so let's move this back to border box and see what happens all right so we're getting this and I'm just confirming that this is we're actually getting the behavior we didn't want let's see if it changes with content bugs okay it isn't changing with content bugs and let's see what happens if we keep content box with our padding and let's switch it up okay all right that's where the difference is all right so just to verify before I explain this because I don't explain the wrong wrong thing I'm gonna switch this back to border and there we go okay so let me go back to here so we could see so here's what happens when we use border box which border box is usually the default correct I'm I'm almost positive that normally it's most sites I work on his border box so a border box works normally as I explained before when you switch to content box then what happens is the the actual width of the content is taken as the width right padding then acts like margin did in our first example so now the padding is actually in addition so the full 50% in the case of this code dear the full 50% is taking up just by this part this content and then in addition to that there is padding and that is gonna add you know 52 percent or something right it's gonna be 52 percent somewhere around there so if you're still having trouble you know with something like this make sure you check your box sizing as well I tend to stick with border box for pretty much everything I rarely even think about this it's not it's not an issue normally but thanks for bringing that up Johnny that definitely could have been confusing if someone was working with something that was set to content box instead of border box all right so let me know if you all appreciate some of those that little kind of side side bar there to explain things I'll try to do that more if if you think it's helpful if you'd rather me just get to the point and start coding that that's cool too Wow my network I apologize if the video quality was bad I just glanced at my network and it was terrible it seems like it's back now at normal so let's see I just wanna make sure I did answer that question adequately okay Johnny says thank you for explaining that it's just like you Arjun yeah yes okay cool so let's let's move on then well let's let's make sure this width is actually what we want I I think that was okay oh and we still we need to make sure we we have our items take up the proper space on smaller screens now that's interesting it shifts over this way I would think that it would shift it would go this way from left to right it's good to know for a layout though all right actually Harsha's saying use materialized you're using many selectors on those divs the necessary okay so hardship thinks we should just use the materialized column classes okay so hard prefers using the materialized grid maybe we'll switch to that I'm not gonna switch to it on the stream right now because it's mostly just copy and paste way but that might not be a bad idea to switch to we already talked about yesterday wolf why we might switch to that so I'm still open to that there was just a part of me that really wanted to see if I could get this to work and and we have a a solution so we'll see if the solution continues to work if we run into too many bugs we'll see how that how leg goes okay so we do have extra small/small actually we we already have we already have the right the right columns on here so that it should be full width let's see what's going on there so we may have found our first bug oh there we go now it is working it was just set to extra small so I think yeah let's let's set this a bit differently yeah so let's see for a small screens right now we have small I mean okay for all our smalls where we have it set to three we're gonna change things up a bit and we're gonna go let's let's try first let's try six for small and then medium I assume medium is MD we'll find out in a second if that works for mediums then we'll go with our three with our quarter so that should be a nicer transition on small screens and okay I made sure to see how this how this works okay so here's our large screen it's like normal see what break point is ok so around 930 pixels somewhere on there 9 950 we have our small break point and that's when it goes down to 2 now we go down to 1 okay so it looks like it's still these are still too thin even on our medium size so I think we're gonna have to we're gonna we're gonna have to bump that up another screen size another screen width so let's take our mediums we'll take our mediums and change them to large and I think that'll work okay so now we should get there we go we get to split a lot earlier we get it up there around 1200 pixels and that that's nicer now we don't have content extending out over that card so these are still you know a bit narrow here once you get down to 1200 pixels but you know we'll see what happens with the with the content when we get real content in there then I think we can do more adjustments for now that's only adjust when I really want to do no sense and really you know getting too detailed with this when we're still just kind of experimenting okay is everybody cool was that it was that somewhat straightforward let me know in the live chat I'll check back in a minute and see if anyone needs me to explain that a bit more and see all right cool so let's add a few more cards in I definitely want to add in a card for video and yeah I'm not sure if I want to keep this cards are right with the image and then like text potentially down here but it might not be a bad idea to just have one you know just with an image in it maybe we could try one out with an image and a text overlay that might not be a bad idea okay alright let's try that out so let's grab down here we're only using up on the large you're really using up 25% because we didn't put another card down here so let's grab another card actually let's grab this wow that's too much I don't want to get that all that let's grab this card here and I'm gonna put another one right in here on top of this and let's make this let's take away this large here so this is going to end up being 50% of the screen for most screen sizes and for the card content this is what I want to do I I don't think I saw anything specifically for a video let me see where we have our image so we have card media let's check out the API for the card media and see if we can't add a video if not then we'll just do our thing the only I was worried about is there's padding built in here to this card content I think there's padding built in the card content so we would want our video to go completely like endtoend let's see where's my okay here it is so let's check out our cards API and card frog Wow it seriously it that's all we have we can also just use paper to make kind of our own video component if we want to I was just kind of hoping that they already had something builtin to the cards but it won't be too much extra work if they don't okay so here's our media okay so it's just showing an image our media API yes okay so it looks like we can do something with with video and the shoes for you that's it back right yeah all right so I all right it's not as straightforward as I thought let me check the live chat and see if anybody is reading this kind of differently than me it seems like from from this part it says in that you know a video would be possible to put in here but I don't know it's it's not 100% clear to me let's see ok hard says if you set the component as video and the source to video but this will give you html5 player ok we'll probably want to end up using the YouTube player so maybe it'll be better if ok harsh it says you can't add the iframe yeah ok maybe we'll try it out with a YouTube embed ok cool so let me grab the YouTube embed code I have I have the video that I just did up here so let's grab the code on my other screen it's got the code from here so you don't want to share we want to embed okay all right so let's see how we're gonna do this I should said shameless plug yellow yeah yes it's by the way check out my video um alright which one are we just coffee I should have coffee the one that had card media was I thinking alright Media and we gonna do what was that source see so do we put so I keep flying back and forth hear me do I need to put source iframe here or what I generally like the documentation they have for this but this is a little big for me maybe I'm just not getting it maybe it's more obvious to you all whoa that's not what I wanted to do what else do we need to put in an image a shrinkies a Dom element or a component okay let's do two years working on it okay so I guess within component that's where I would put this is it gonna let me just in suscribe let's see oh okay so hard should say in the source put the URL in the component put the iframe all right Thank You hard so let me let me just paste this in here quickly so I can grab the source and now I will say iframe okay see what we get uhoh I'm not bad it's not great but it's not bad so we need we need that is something right yeah I think it says the props will useful to extend the style applied to components okay alright let's see how this this would look but there's something it's going off the page because I just changed it in dev tools and I didn't give see what if I adjust it see now the masonry has a chance to lay it out properly but yeah cool play right in there all right not bad it still has some weird stuff going on around the edges some space down here that we don't want so I need some work but it's not it's mostly what we want okay all right let's see my timer went off let's do a short break here and let me go to the live chat okay goog GI o or GI so correct me if I'm pronouncing that wrong but gog asks have a question float vs. inlineblock using floats is not too old comparing to the inlineblock same can be achieved with inlineblock as using floats but less code no need of clear fixes thanks yeah so is there are a lot of different ways to position things in CSS so yeah some things are considered older to use than others I'm of the opinion generally that if it works it works right it's fine to use the issue gets in some cases what about performance you know does it cut down on on your speed most sites don't need to worry about it that much you know but some sites you know even shaving milliseconds is is important right so you generally do want to know about what the best ways are to use and some of the newer ways to do things instead of using floats or inline block is to use flexbox we're now the new CSS grid and so it's good to know flexbox and grid for instance you know if you're gonna do anything with react native all the positioning is through flexbox right so it would be a good idea to just you know start learning that and start positioning with that but if you're not good with that kind of stuff yet and you got to do something then you know the older ways will work it's it's okay but as kind of people start using flexbox and grid more and more it's going to be harder to understand what's going on and other projects if you're still kind of using the older stuff off the top of my head I don't really know with the differences in terms of you know speed right but that would be what I would look at when I would if I was really trying to decide okay which one's best which one I need to use if it was going to be a big deal I would check that out also you had mentioned you could use less code with one or the other no need for clear fixes that that is another thing to take into consideration how difficult is it to implement one versus the other can you save lines of code so anyway hopefully that kind of answered your question a bit but I mean if you're using something that out that is considered somewhat older you hear that don't feel too bad about it right I mean you know to build stuff we're all doing things the best way we know how the idea is that we keep learning things but you can't learn all the new stuff all at once right you just keep adding on every project you try to learn some different and use newer stuff right so you may only learn one new thing on the next project but you know eventually you know you'll keep up and you'll keep learning new things let's see Vinnie ak asked how did you MIT how did you fix image with in masonry I just added I'll show you right now I just added to our grid items I just added a width of 100% and then I added some padding one on top of that that was all it took it ended up being so simple let's see Harshit says I consider this doing work to achieve nothing you are a programmer use the shortest and bugfree way possible I'm telling you this with my previous experience in the bulletin project okay so you're talking to honey that you're talking about using the grid system that comes with masonry or I'm sorry Latino UI versus just using the column classes from materialize that's a good point I do remember that that it ended up being a real pain to try to get that to work with that bulletin project so we may end up switching to that then so I'm gonna have to take a look I'll take a look at the bulletin project to see how it was done there I am way more comfortable with the materialized column classes really so it will be easier for me in the long run to just use materialized so but anyway like I said I'm not gonna switch it right now on the stream I think we're still we are still doing some valuable stuff because we've explained like we got to explain all about padding and margins and stuff right and to be honest with you the purpose of what we're doing right now and in heart should I explain this yesterday so you might not have caught it already I'm just trying to get my boss something to look at so it's intended now it's intended that everything's gonna be refactored significantly once we decide on something so everything we're doing right now may end up getting scrapped and we don't use any of it okay so at this point that's why it may not actually be worth it for me to switch to materialise called classes right now because we may not even use this at all hopefully I'm sure this to my boss soon get some feedback and then we'll know at that point that's probably the better time to make the decision but at least we have you know I and and I know you already know cuz you try them both but now you know we have got along the stream a nice comparison of you know you can go back and watch the old stream see how we did it with the column classes for materialized and now we could see how we deal with the grid I don't know you know how I am I always like to try two different ways and see which one works out can't always do that sometimes there's just not enough time but in this case I think it's worthwhile the process of going through it I think is worthwhile it may take a little longer but I usually learn a lot in the process so let me my fiveminute timer did go off I spent a lot of time on just a few questions sorry I still have a call from when I was sick over the break let's see so I'm trying to figure out where I just left off in the live chat so I can go right back to it after the Mex break 128 okay oh yeah all right I'm gonna go offtopic for just a second like I have this bag of Sour neon gummy worms like sitting right next to me I just want to eat him so bad I don't want to be rude and be like chewing right when I'm trying to do this video so it's taking a lot of willpower for me not I'm just gonna throw him in a drawer I can't look at him anymore they had him on sale when I went to the store earlier this week and I just I wanted them out and now they're like I'm addicted to these gummy worms I'm sure my dentist loves that okay all right so let's do one more moment of a session we do at least one more and so what we're gonna do oh I'm gonna leave this like this for now like I said since I'm just gonna show my boss how this looks it doesn't have to be perfect so I'm okay with this looking a little off I would never want to actually launch a site with it looking like that but I think it's fine just just to give them an idea but it's actually this is really throwing me off that things are getting put in place like this let's see and it's just okay maybe it's an option within masonry as to whether things get displayed right to left or left to right off look into that I'm okay with it now but eventually I'm thinking my boss will probably want to be able to have more control over thing where things are so I'll look into the options I know you can do there's a lot of options if you use just the straightup JavaScript plugin I'm assuming that at least some of those options can be used with the react component version of masonry so we'll look into that later if we end up going with this all right what did I say I needed oh let's do a card that has just an image and we get rid of this yeah let's actually just get rid of this right now this is hype ah graphy yeah yeah card action it's typography we'll get rid of that I just want to give kind of an assortment of potential options for my boss to look at okay cool so this is just a straight image card I'm gonna copy this and just put a different title in here in different names just maybe like latest posts like latest blog post or something and then what do we do another one maybe it'll say like oh actually let's do one let's do a card it's like a spotlight right spotlight on a faculty member or on a student or maybe on a graduate already we'll throw some of those in there as well so I think for our purposes now we may just be able to modify what we're doing here for a lot of that alright but first let's get this this grid it's so this component is starting to get huge and it's just like it just doesn't feel right but it's gonna have to be like this for now okay okay so we're gonna head this one and let's change events to latest posts I think that's yeah that'll be what we need oops let me define them into some multiple cursors oh I do not work and there you go all right let's check it out it should work we just done it but just to verify ok cool latest pose pose one two three four we may want to show this with some more text so let's throw that in one thing that we aren't having that I wanted to avoid is we still are having some space which I guess we really we can't avoid that if we're gonna have so many different widths and Heights there's gonna be some space so yeah I just there's not there's not really a way to avoid all the space so we're gonna have to live with that or yeah I mean I just don't see how how I could get around that without really being strict about card Heights oh well it's fine for now it is really is gonna depend on the screen as well so here we you know that it's changed obviously on a small smaller screen we're gonna have right we have none here and for sure we're gonna have none when it's all stacked like this okay let's see if I can add some some more text on here see if this will work for us we have what is this so list item list item text primary so since there's already a primary let's just try secondary and see if that works if this doesn't work I'll look it up in the documentation yeah hey it works why there we go okay so cool we have some secondary texts awesome tool that's good I know my boss will want to see that because he definitely won't want just titles of stuff so so that's good this font size is way too small so we'll probably have to work on the font size at some point but for now this is okay suppose okay let's work on a card that's just going to have let's say like an image and someone's name maybe their title and then some some info about them I just saw coding and caffeine said hello everyone I'm here for the coffee I didn't have any coffee today I really I did have some G fuel I chug some right before the stream so G fuel if you're watching give me a sponsorship anyway but also whoever Kroger made those gummy worms and sold them so I could get a sponsorship from Kroger if anybody's got connections right I've using opinions on my own and they do not reflect those a freak okay all right it's the first thing I want to try to do is just grab this great component and let's copy it and then remove some of these lists let's remove all but one of these list items okay I don't think this is gonna work cuz it'll be too small yeah it's too small but let's see if we can change some of the options here so we're we AG was our list okay this what we had let's check out the API for list item and let's check it out for list item avatar as well and let's see this is interesting list item we have a list item text as well okay so we may have some other options for how to how to create this let's see what we have the avatar is not much seized you okay that doesn't look like anything that helpful for what I wanted to do which I guess I haven't explained I just want this to be bigger so let's uh I'm gonna actually I'm gonna leave this let's make this bigger this is checkout in dev tools first just to see what we may want in terms of size yeah so I was assuming that this was set to 100% which it is for the image so we need to do then is change our width and height for this avatar div so let's go with one hundred one hundred and see what that gives us okay I want it to be bigger for the feature so let's try two hundred and two hundred okay that's not bad just for this and then we'll also want to increase this font size all right we'll just set that for that right now okay so list item avatar we're gonna make a class for this because we're gonna have more than one of these so give it a class name of habits which are Avatara big that's that's pretty straightforward and then this list item text we're gonna give that a class name as well classes let's talk about let's say list.txt big oh yeah one of the hardest parts about doing this live is just coming up with names it's hard enough coming up with names for your stuff but like when you're right on the spot it is hard who's that hey Brian sighs was in here Brian works in the office right next to me he's a developer you want one of these gummy worms right come in and get one if you own one you want to be on the show just knock on the door I'll open it okay you see how much time I have I do want to okay cool I have enough time to get this done all right so let's go back up here to where we're adding in our CSS so I think we went over this yesterday but if you didn't if you weren't with us yesterday notice this is a normal CSS this is actually a JavaScript object so some of it looks familiar some of it doesn't we are camel casing all of our class names and we're using you normally with CSS or you type it like this and then we have our semicolons but we're using commas now like a JavaScript object okay so this is one of the ways we can do it within a react component we'll use some some different ways as the string continues and in previous streams we've used some different ways but this what we're using right now so what did I say avatar big happen to our big and we wanted to make the width what do we say 200 oops pixels and the height 200 pixels whoops type 102 and now let's do the item list item text big and then we're gonna say font size font size we got a 34 yeah 34 pixels there we go okay let's see if this works it should only apply to that last one yep all right cool awesome all right so let's say you know what I'm gonna put this one end because this is probably not going to make it on the actual site so I'm just gonna put this one in for fun and let me grab we got a picture alright let's see this works and primate X so this yes all right cool this is my boss Michael just said this will make it on this final site so I'll do it for fun equals famous last words one time I made a whole site and everything was really sarcastic like the images were all funny and the captions and all the images were all sarcastic and all the text was and some of it actually I had to change it so it wasn't so sarcastic but some of it did make it on the final site but it was just really fun to show everybody who was testing the site maybe this will be an easter egg on the site somewhere I gotta put some sort of Easter Egg in it like if you open dev tools like there'll be something in the console and you know something that most people won't see okay let's see what I owe him on time but anyway I actually I was thinking that this list wouldn't work but it really wasn't hard to adjust so this is not bad so we would have features we're not gonna feature staff member all the staff members are like in the background right the student and the faculty or the stars of the show but we would probably have a faculty member that we would feature and a student and probably a graduate as well and those would probably change so that there would either be arrows so that you could flip through them or every time you loaded the page it would change and we'd have it some something set up so that maybe like every day it changed you know sorry somehow we'd be able to show show more of them Michael said he does have a good beard yet yeah his beer is actually shorter than normal in this picture I think this is an older picture I tried to find a better but is this like the only one that came up on a Google search there's a lot of people named Thomas crow so I didn't realize food I mean I scrolled down for like three seconds and I didn't see any other pictures anyway all right so let's see let's add in ladies pose pose let's add in one more of this style and we'll call it news and let's add in two or three more of these style things and then we'll see how it plays out maybe we'll put in like another video on another image one another one of these to be honest with you that's really kind of boring let's see I am on time because we're not doing anything new we're just gonna lay out some some things so I guess I could just copy and paste a few just so we can get an idea I don't know that it's worth it to do it all on the stream though oh you're gonna grab the image one and if I want to know a list let's grab another list see this will be so nice when these are all separated out into their own components it'll make it so much shorter this is starting to get a little out of hand list and let's grab the the video and the image one see I can't even find what I want anymore all right here's a video on just throw one of these in here and just one more I'll find an image and I'll throw it in there area but you can see hopefully like even if you're not that familiar to react you can start to see already which pieces of this page would be good to separate out into their own components and make them more reusable like imagine if we could condense all this down into just one line that's easily readable you know and it would say image image card or something like that and we just be able to pass in a few a few props a few things that we would wanted to have and it would it would shorten this up significantly all right so I'm gonna say that and let's just whoa what did I do okay whoops looks like I grabbed the end of a masonry tag did I wait a second yeah I added the masonry say in the wrong place there we go and I'm assuming then I have another tag in the wrong place somewhere as well this is that where it needs to go whoops so let's see where the other air is the div seat okay oh hey cool did it work yeah it works oh we forgot to actually add a height in it for this mm not perfect but we can see what would what I need to make sure of is maybe giving more thought to like what we have lined up next to each other so you know making sure that we we always are equaling a hundred percent with with all them you know each section we equal 100% so that we don't have you know a lot of gaps here but otherwise this should give my boss I know this does to me this looks terrible right now all right but this should just give my boss something to look at so that in his mind he can say all cool like we could definitely use that or put that there you know it it really helps I mean you all probably have the same experience but sometimes it really helps to be able to see something with some content in there to really convey like what you're thinking you know I could sketch something on a piece of paper or just explain something but it doesn't click with other people you know you just don't get it until they can see it like this so that's why I do things like this and I think it's really helpful at first just spend a little bit of time build this out even if we know that most of it might not make it into the final site you end up saving a lot of time in the long run if you don't do something like this either building it out as a site or using not only like sketch or Photoshop or something then you could end up doing a lot of work and then finding out way too late that the client or your boss or whoever wants it different right so better to waste a little bit of work at the beginning than to have to redo everything at the end all right so my timer did go off so I'm gonna go back and try to answer as much as I can and let's see what time it is oh yeah definitely I'm gonna answer all the questions it doesn't matter how long it takes and let's 28th okay let me scroll up okay a hearse that says will you be making a pull request using materialized Oh Hardison says we'll be making a portable crushed use materialized if I get time I'm busy right now it is alright cool hard totally understand if you're busy you've been a great help and I really appreciate all the work you do so do not feel obligated at all to do anything if you have time and you want to do it that's awesome you know otherwise I could I could try to do it at some point or someone else could take a shot at it if anybody wants to check out what harsh it did with masonry and materialized in the bulletin project and then try to apply that to this project but anyway you know I always appreciate your work on this but if you're busy you know get done which you need to get done for school or for you know whatever else you're working on okay okay John Hanson says iframe is a bit tricky I found in react as it's difficult for me to figure out if mounted or any onload listener as it would make sense to have an Network offline or error image placeholder okay yeah I've never I haven't worked that much with iframes in react either I guess we will know how it will work more with them and I actually need to change I don't know if who remembers working on project 1 that catechetical Institute site but on the home page there's this really large video and we were using JW player to embed that but it's not working after I upgraded all the packages we got so recently we tried to to upgrade everything to the latest version and everything worked out fine seemingly except the video so I had no luck working on it for way longer than I should have and I think we're just gonna switch it up and use YouTube which is what I want to do originally months ago but anyway we're gonna use YouTube now I think and so I'll be dealing with YouTube embeds and react on that project as well Josh Modine says hello hey hey Josh how's it going thanks for joining us haha world said in your motivation video you start with it's a little after New Year its July I know it's tough i yeah if you haven't seen the video about getting motivated it's on my channel check it out if you like it's only like three minutes but I did mess up right off the beginning I I said that it was July it's obviously not July recorded the video yesterday it's January I corrected myself right after yeah I can't believe I said July okay Oh Michaels says by the way Jessie thanks for the words yesterday when I was at the hospital oh yeah no problem I hope everything's all right so I understand if you want to talk about it on the live stream or anything like that but I just want to let you know that everything's cool and you know whatever whatever's going on is is getting handled properly with the doctors and everything Harshit was getting a ton of questions about his sleeping routine so these for his timezone these streams are on you know very late he's clarified for everyone for the record he sleeps about six hours so from 2 to 8 so it's 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. and 100 to 230 during the day so it's an adequate amount of sleep yeah that's like you know what is that 7 and a half hours yeah almost 8 hours I went through periods when I was a teenager where I like would not sleep very much at all and just stay up and hang out with my friends which is way less productive than coding hard is actually doing some cool stuff with coding yeah so I understand then I went through periods where I slept all the time michael says that iframe above your head is kind of freaky are you talking about this iframe or is this a joke about the video I don't know Harshit says Jessie this will all be fixed if you materialize as it uses flexbox with welldefined widths okay Vinnie Vinnie axis fixing image with was such a problem yesterday yeah I know was it was such a problem and it was so easy to fix John Henson says LOL neon worms just don't eat too many though you'll find you won't need to turn the light on in the bathroom we needed to go yeah I did the neon the the gummy worm things here definitely are probably not that healthy let's see if I eat nine of these worms it's 140 calories and 24 grams of sugar but it has 2 grams of protein so that's definitely gonna help me in the gym right so I if I ate this whole bag that would be 10 grams of protein I mean you can't beat that right I should definitely one of these before I work out every day I'm not a doctor and nutritionist so don't take any of my advice okay he says actually spar wheel says what is the average time you have to complete a website for a client I don't know it really varies a lot the last time I did a website for a client it was like a year or something crazy it was can usually what happened this is what happened with a client normally at first they want a website like as soon as possible right they're like you can stay up for three days straight and give me this website but then what happens you say okay fine I can do the website I can do it by this day but I need this content and then when it's on them to produce content give to you then it keeps pushing back the date right so it always just takes a long time it seems like when I get clients because of that so I made sure I put my contract that all the dates that I have where I'm gonna complete things by a certain date are all dependent on when I get the material so if they're late by a day my deadline gets pushed back a day right so I'm not on one of my previous projects things got pushed back like I think the site was gonna be completing like two months and end up taking almost a year because I didn't have the the materials and during that period that was when my wife had a baby and had a ton of problems and had to have surgeries and things so the client also like basically let me put the project on hold during that time period so I can take care of her and the kids which was really awesome and very nice of them but then also a lot of it the time was because we're still waiting on on content and things so I don't even know that I could give an average at this point it's just totally it just really really depends on whether or not the material is ready for the client I mean in terms of what I could do and that I mean it would have to be a large site for me not to be able to do it and you know like two months assuming I could really dedicate hours every day to it I mean I'm talking like normal stuff you need for small businesses and stuff right it should never take longer than that for me to do it if they wanted something like it's a really special maybe longer I don't know I would I don't know if I per for a longer a shorter time if it's shorter than its kind of cool because you get to work on new things but then you have to worry about billing and contracts more often but if you get like a big client where you're working on it for months you only have to deal with the contract stuff once and the billing well maybe once I would usually make them pay some upfront and maybe some like in the middle of project two but and then you have guaranteed income anyway that was a really long answer for a simple question and I didn't answer the question so I'm sorry about that but maybe it gave a little insight in into what things are like at least for me when I do freelance work okay what sighs okay John Hanson saying that you you can change the direction so where I was saying I wanted it to go left to right and set it right to left so so we definitely can't change that so I'll be working on that maybe today or all today's I was gonna say tomorrow with tomorrow Saturday so it won't work on a Saturday Michael Creole says it might be only one who seeing the iframe clipped vertically yeah yeah that it's it is cliff okay hard said he had to go at some point but then he came back alright can you set a grid the the fill in the cards yeah maybe there's something that I could do remember I didn't want a bunch of whitespace in the cards though I just have to think see like what would look better to have some white space in the card or to have this gap here it may honestly look better to have white space in a card I mean I think we've done everything we can to eliminate most of that but even so when we have gaps like this I can't just fill that in with this card the image would be all distorted so I have to think more about that Aleksey s are you using material UI yes I am using material UI I've added in a JavaScript plugin called masonry and I've used the react masonry component package to bring that in so that's what's kind of doing all this layout with these cards but it is using material UI as well on a site t's AG says is asked is it a good idea to restart from challenge one if it's been a while since I've coded yeah it's not bad if it's been a long time and you really don't remember a lot then you could start with challenge one again you'd probably like go really fast through some of them I would check that if you find yourself going to challenge one and like remembering everything then maybe skip ahead so start with one see how it goes if you don't remember a lot of it then just keep going if you do remember a lot then skip skip ahead that's what I usually do if I like quit a tutorial in the middle and then don't come back to it for a while I usually start over tea Zach says does anyone have a few pages of code for a website home page or something similar I could look at for reference tea Zach check out my github profile and also the fu s Markham organization on github we do have some well we have a lot of different websites so you can check out the home page or the index either the index J or the index dot HTML pages is the home page almost always so you can check that code out and most of those projects are live as well so you could see the site and you can see the code behind it Alexander says I like to know what the images from Austria are about the hills look alive okay cool yeah the images from Austria let's zoom in on this so I wish I had a higher resolution right now but I guess this'll work the images from Austria are of our campus and Austria so we have two campuses for this University one here in the United States in Steubenville Ohio this is the main campus it's where the school was was founded then we also have a campus in Austria and students can go over for is either a semester or a year I can't remember which and live and study in Austria and the program set up in such a way that basically every weekend you have enough time to go and travel to different places in Europe so it's it's in a small town called gamma in Austria and it's in an old monastery I think they called the cart ousa and okay so it needs to submit my wife's in the live chat and she corrected me and said it is a semester so hay bag yeah so I've never been over there I really wanted to go over there but there's really no need for a web developer to go to the Austria campus I don't think they'll send me over there any time soon but the students get to see a lot of awesome things over in Europe so it's a good time and in our professors go over there so the professors that teach here on this campus will take you know some time go over there and teach and then come back so and you can see the sceneries beautiful right I mean I don't know it looks cool I've never been over to Europe I've never even been out of my own country so that just kind of fascinates me but that's kind of a cool program a lot of students are interested in it so we kind of like to feature pictures of this because it's just so beautiful over there it's kind of a big selling point for students who want to come to school here because not only when they come to school here and get an education but they also get a chance to go over to Europe and travel at the same time so prospective students really like that okay so Alexander is actually from Austria okay cool oh yeah well like I said I haven't been over there but from what I've seen of what the students do over there it's a very beautiful country so I'd love to visit sometime alright let's see Harshad says any good admin dashboard themes that can pair up well with material UI and next similar to admin LTE I could I really thought that I saw something but this was probably like a year or so ago so I don't remember what what it was but I'm pretty sure there are some material design style admin dashboard themes out there so I'm really sorry I just I have no idea where I saw it but a pretty sure they exist michael creo says real worms have more protein but I wouldn't eat them either yeah actually I don't know if I otherwise would say this on youtube for everybody but I did actually eat a real worm once it was I was really I think I was maybe an early teenager so maybe like 13 or something and one of my older cousins told me to do it kind of like dared me to do it and I did it so it wasn't that tasty though so I haven't done it since the the neon gummy worms are way better our should said should I do free code camp I literally never open the site hard I mean I think it's cool to do the exercises sometime I just do a free code camp like algorithm challenge in the morning just to get my brain working but I kind of think you're you're probably advanced enough that you could just fly through the backend section of it I know your backend person there may be some stuff in the frontend that may be helpful to you since you don't have as much experience with frontend but the first part of it is is pretty I mean it's for absolute beginners so I think the first percent part of it would be really easy for you but there definitely is some cool stuff in there so you may want to check it out and maybe just skip ahead to some of the harder stuff Oh tease I asked what my github account name was let me see github you think I would know already what my own github thing was I'll just I'll paste the link in oh okay it's Jesse or waggle I kind of thought it with that okay so there's mine and then the other one that has I think all everything that we were going on this channel is this one there we go Michael Chris's your wife is keeping track of you on here my life is actually learning to code so she's doing free code camp and Flatiron school and she's involved with moms can code so she's learning all kind of coding stuff so that's probably why she's watching me and sometimes she has the kids watch me and they like yell at me thinking that I could hear them on youtubes anyway it's cool it that she watches she's probably starting to get good enough that she can understand what we're doing she's actually ahead of me she has more points than me on free code camp now okay John I had some more advice about how to handle the the Rose here okay so said I might have to put an item flex column in a flex row inside a flex row flex container alright if I had all that in then I may definitely switch over to materialise if that will fix the problem because that will be a lot a lot to add into the markup our harshad says most of the free templates out there a bootstrap and jquery heavy yeah for sure harsh ed was asking earlier about a an admin panel kind of template or theme that would would match up with material UI yeah that's true you definitely don't want to go with one of those if you don't react yeah I don't know there's got to be something out there with with react that's that's going to be at least some sort of boilerplate to help you get started I wish I knew something offhand I could tell you about but if I come across something soon maybe I'll mention it in an upcoming live chat then Michael crow says there's there's no way that that's you in that picture T Zac said the Lynx didn't work that I just paste it in you know for some reason the links aren't working right when I first paste them in you could probably just copy and paste in their browser and it might work like that but it's something about the YouTube redirects that is messing these up when I paste them in the live chat so anyway so that those URLs will work but the link itself may not work if you click on it in the live chat what was Michael saying there's no way that's me in the picture this is me yeah that's me so my man Brian Sizemore took that picture of me right outside my building obviously it was not recently because there's no snow everywhere but that was like two and a half years ago that's me Johnny Anson said not a little markup once you go smaller components out of this large per minute yeah you're right if I just put it in separate components it won't look that big you just spread it out it'll look smaller right it's all right I'll have to think about it okay all right cool I've gotten to the end of the live chat so I think I'm gonna wrap things up now and eat some more gummy worms I'm going to check the kitchen and see if there's coffee coffee and gummy worms that's a good combo right our hard says why do that extra work I know her is hard you I I'm probably gonna end up going with materialise so don't I would you worry about it you've made a very good case for using materialize and I kind of wanted to do it anyway but like I said a part of me really wanted to just see like how hard would it be to make this work so we figure it out we've got it working to a point so maybe we'll switch over you already did the work to figure out how the hell that would work and react so really I just need to copy what you had done in the bulletin project but so that that's likely going to happen all right anyway thank you so much for for watching and for all the help and the live chat and had a lot of good questions and a lot of good answers from you all as well and if you haven't already check out my and watch the video that I posted and I don't have ads or anything I don't get any money for that but it may help some of you out if you ever need help with getting some motivation oh okay Brook said remember to do a git push all right let's tease exes I can't log into github because I have a new phone number and they're sending verification numbers to my old phone can you help me um you may want to contact github support I'm not sure yeah I'm not sure if if you can change that without being able to log in yeah so I'll contact the support I mean you should be able to see my repos without having to log in that's that's not a problem but if you actually want to start like you know forking them to your own your own account you will need to be able to log in but yeah your fastest way or your surest way to fix that resolve that is I think just contacting github support all right all right let me get push right now so I don't forget like I normally do get status and we're gonna say they got it recently there I'm just gonna move it at that I know we added a bunch more cards but I really didn't do that much that was new we just kind of duplicated what was already there the only kind of new thing we did was had that gutter we didn't fix the image thing but I'll leave it off for now No hey she won she must be skates what am I not escaping there we go I was that I knew that that was hiding in there someone and I forgot about it all right that was that little end of that masonry component they got left in there all right looks good going through our tests nice okay there we go all the latest is now on github okay great all right so I'm going to go for real this time thanks again for watching and have a great weekend I will be back on Monday all right so see y'all then
