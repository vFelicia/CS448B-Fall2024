hi it's brianna from free code camp today we're going to be talking about data size the smallest size of data you can possibly have is called a bit now that is i wrote a one here that's an example of a bit it can really either only be a one or a zero it really goes back to that binary that we were talking about one meaning on zero meaning off it can either be a one or a zero that's a bit bigger than that we've got a nibble which is four bits it's not very commonly used but it's adorable um bigger than that we've got a byte now this is common referring to something in a byte it is eight bits put together now a lot of binary things are expressed with eight bits like letters and symbols and well most numbers really can be expressed that way until you get to really big ones so our most basic data sizes we've got a bit and a byte but as you can guess it gets much bigger than that alright so after we get past the regular small bit and the first little bite which is eight bits we get bigger really fast the next step up is a kilobyte which is 1024 bytes which times eight is a whole lot more bits after the kilobyte we've got megabyte which is 1024 to the power of two which is the same thing as one million forty eight thousand five hundred and seventy six bytes so since we're growing exponentially that is a big big increase after megabyte we've got gigabyte also known as gb which is 1024 to the power of three then tb terabyte 1024 to the power 4 and pd not peanut butter it is petabyte 1024 to the power of five just to give you an idea of how big this number is if you can't see it i almost ran out of room writing this on my whiteboard these are some pretty big numbers we're dealing with here you probably recognize megabyte gigabyte terabyte from regular storage that you've dealt with before on your ipad your ipod your computer anything like that all right just a quick review bit tiny little either one or zero bite eight bits kilobyte 1024 bytes after that everything is an exponent off of 1024 going from kilobyte to megabyte to gigabyte to terabyte all the way up to a petabyte
