everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're gonna move some data yesterday we spent some time looking at the database we saw the structure we started to write some JavaScript code with node to be able to pull that data out of the database and we ended up just pulling out a static JSON file and then we were gonna put it into wordpress with the wordpress api well since that time Harshit who's frequently in the live chat and also a frequent contributor Harshit wrote there kind of the rest of what we were planning on writing but he did it a little bit differently so the way harsha did it is we can pull data out directly out so basically we skip the step of exporting it as a JSON file first so we can pull the data directly out of the database using sequel queries right there in our node file we just put the query in as a string we'll check out the code in a minute I just wanted to give harsh that is proper thanks for this so basically pulls it out as a query and then it authenticates with WordPress so you can get data from the WordPress API without logging in but you can't put data in right that makes sense so we authenticate and add the data into WordPress and it's it actually worked so let me pull this over this test so I did access just with one piece of information I didn't want to go through all you know 9,000 plus rows but here we see this is that test WordPress installation that we made yesterday and the first piece of data that we had here's the correct title now here's the issue this is the HTML oh goodness I'm sorry and then change my screen alright now I've changed my screen so this is the correct title in our WordPress installation and then this is HTML and there's actually I don't even think there's content in here it's all just I guess these tags that are specifying what components are supposed to go in here so we're gonna have to look through some of these and see I guess like what where are we supposed to get this content from obviously we don't want to pull this in so we're gonna have to take a closer look at the data now so I've already started to do that and that's why I apologize are starting to scream a few minutes late but I got really into this and I just didn't realize how late it was so let's take a look at some of the data we have and we make it bigger so I can see so one thing that I found and this is what I was going right before it stream started is that the content type of 3 corresponds to I guess news yeah I think these are all news the content type for our current system Extron I think this would be categorized as news so we don't think we need news I guess we'll have to verify yeah all these seem like announcements just some of these now that I look at it potentially wouldn't be news hmm this might end up being a little bit tougher it seems as if there's not really separate post types mmm yeah this is still content type 3 I was I was afraid this would happen so let me explain a little bit about what what was done and this was before I even started working here from what I understand when this was was delivered from the company that built it meaning you know the Ektron content management system and the website there were pieces of it that were supposed to work a certain way and they didn't so what they ended up doing was using some let's say like some content types some post types for a lot of different things that they weren't originally meant for which worked at the time but the problem that we're gonna have to deal with now is that now when we have a content type that maybe this was originally supposed to just be from news or announcements but now it seems like they've used it also for employees like this is a faculty member so potentially this could be a faculty profile so we we need to find some way to figure that out or seize folder IDs 152 maybe the folder IDs would help us alright let's search for that right now we're inside 3 let's search by folder ID what was that 152 is that the one that I have found 152 all right where folder ID equals 150 all right let's see what we get here whoa why are you making me log in again should I get disconnected well disconnected me pretty quickly all right yes yes yes yes this is much better okay so this is this is better let's cut this doing you notice for now I just I want to look at all this data so eventually we won't cut out the columns that we need but right now I'm looking for identifiers so that could help us group these together otherwise somebody's gonna have to go through it by hand so all of these look like they're faculty profiles these are all professors associate professors so that's good probably won't use the teaser because I want the full content so we don't need that row but the text you could figure out the text might be useful there so we have that content text we're not getting anything for the image we have the template oh yes that's unfortunate because these usually do have images attached so I mean that's not it'd be nice if the images came through as well but it's not the end of the world I don't want to doublecheck what the content hTML is here let's see what we get so I know this is probably too small for y'all to see I mean it's really really small for me I get my face really close if the HTML structure looks good then that's probably what I'll bring in is this content HTML call them if not then I'll try to bring in just the the text the plain text and we can always wrap it in a tag but this actually looks pretty good when it actually comes with an image tag with the image source in it so that's that's nice yeah that's really nice great and these also have some YouTube embeds attached as well and that's in there wonderful all right cool I think we have our first piece of data right so you know what let me go to live chat I see a lot of activity in here and I haven't looked at it yet so I'm gonna live chat maybe things will change if depending on what's happening in the chat but basically my my first idea here is let's make a custom post type and try a custom post type called faculty and we'll try to pull all these in and we will we'll cut down on the query here only pooling what we really need but we'll try to pull those in put them in WordPress and then see what we get all right so hey everybody everybody saying hi here at the beginning let's see ok cool Brian who works with me here is in the live chat so that's awesome because he actually put in a lot of this content himself or was in charge of directing other people to put the content in so he knows a lot more about this content how its structured some glad he's able to join ok so brian says originally what we are looking at those are those were events looks like some of them were also job postings he said look some of those were expired events which it's kind of what I thought because they're referencing you know things that happen you know two years ago deadlines for things let's see yes harness asking about what Ektron is based on Brian says duh it is it's dotnet so do you I don't know [ __ ] do you remember when we were editing some of those csharp templates you know a while back if I don't know if you're in those dreams or not but that's what would we were working with Ektron and the database is sequel server database let's see okay so hard [ __ ] stalking about the rose yeah yeah I will get rid of the rose but I needed them well before the stream started I needed them because I was trying to find that some type of identifier that would give consistent categories and I think that identified a might be folder ID I thought it would be content type but that's not that's not the case but folder ID metric might be a better way for us to go so now that I found that I can get rid of the rest of the columns that I don't need Harshit says remove all of the HTML using a regular expression or something yeah that's what I was thinking we should well potentially some of them the HTML is a mess but other ones like this the HTML is actually structured fairly well so I think we it might not be a bad idea to just keep it as is especially for some of these you know for instance for this one I know the tags are weird but it makes sense the name right and then we have an image and then below there's like a body and thing so that's how we would want to organize that anyway so I wouldn't probably wouldn't make these tags called name they'd just be spans or something but if it'll save us a lot of time I'm okay with bringing things in like this we could always change the names of those tags at some point if we really needed to okay so Brian says these are all philosophy faculty profiles that that makes sense now yeah okay actually that's great that's really great so do you all from one department this is awesome so what we can do then is we can have our faculty custom post type but then within that we'll have categories for the different departments so we can actually input those with the categories for the department which should save a lot of time of you know having to go in and have someone do that manually later on so that's great we'll just have to figure out which folder IDs correspond to which department and that then we'll be able to do it we may even be able to you know make some sort of a Oh in an array you know maybe some key value pairs that we can just check once we import it and then depending on what what ID we get you know would automatically assign that corresponding category I'll think about best way to do that but I this is good good news okay okay Brian saying the images also probably won't be very usable because they're very small yeah maybe it might still not be a bad idea to try at least see what those images are like I'm thinking like if it comes down to it right and we need to launch it we don't have that much time small images are better than no images we can make the UI and in such a way that maybe those small images will look okay and then after we launch we could certainly go back in and you know find higher quality images but the process of going through and finding good images for every faculty member you know it that may not be doable in the amount of time that we have so I I agree that those images will probably want to replace them but let's try to keep them for as long as we can and I do have access to all these files where these images are so I could very easily take all of those images put them into WordPress or wherever we want to host our images and then just go through and in bulk change all those image source URLs so that's what I'm thinking wound up doing right because obviously we're you know we're not gonna leave this server up where these images are now okay I should ask thief's equalised work efficiently with MS sequel yes it did it definitely did I had a little bit of trouble so the only trouble I had and so harsh its harsh it made a repo with all this and I forked it so it's now on the fus mark on github organization so you can check that out this is the newest repo I only had to change a few things so let's show let's get to the code now I am going to exit out of my config because I want everybody to see that but basically what I had to change is we were defining a port and in the config it was set as some other port I just got rid of it because the default port worked so since the default port work that was fine with me and that port would be it's not showing it enough anyway so figure you know what may as well save a line if it's going to give us a default that works we probably don't can take out now I don't remember what variable was there oh yeah I don't remember what variable was in the config I I assumed it was just DB port but anyway we don't need that so that's pretty much it that's all I had to change I'll go it through here there's nothing there's nothing else and I didn't really have to remove that line I could have just manually typed in the port in the config but like I said you know might as well you know take a line out if we can okay Brook says hi everyone bit late just got done eating a lot of fries that sounds good right now actually I could give her some fries okay all right I should shed his uh visual studio could set up yes so if you notice I'm using Visual Studio code partially for some reason that links not working for me I don't understand anyway so I have switched over to visual studio code I'm gonna try to work with this more I have noticed the the speed is better for visual studio code it is I know in the past I've been against the integrated terminal but for at least for the stream it's very nice to have this right here and not have to switch so I like it there's still times when I'll I still have my other terminal windows open on my other screen so and I think I'll continue to use both but this is nice it is pretty nice let me make this a bit bigger goodness alright and I don't need that there we go okay so just very quickly I'm gonna run through this before we start pulling stuff over so if maybe you're not that familiar with node you know maybe you wouldn't be able to just read this and know what's going on we'll go through it so we are using some packages here know to fetch which we talked about yesterday sequel eyes so sequel eyes is pretty obvious I think from the name right that it helps no talk to the sequel database right so you can see that we're this is just connecting to the database but down here we can actually use the sequel syntax which is kind of cool I mean I'm not that familiar with it but it is pretty cool that you can just you know send in you know a sequel query just like you would put it in normally and then we'll get you know we'll get the data back once we get the data back we loop through it right and then so in this for for posts of posts then we could do whatever we want to manipulate that data in here like we talked about yesterday and then now this part well this part is building the data that we're going to send to WordPress and then this is actually sending the data so we're authenticating and sending Harshit also added a counter that'll give us a console log for how many posts have been added so really nice and I wonder if we could have or when I ran this earlier I'm gonna give you an example of let's see before I guess I didn't get a count last time oh all right so that's what's going on let's try to pull in some data now so we need we're gonna pull this in as faculty and we're gonna try to give it a category of philosophy so let's see what we want do we need an ID I don't think we need the ID the language we need the title we need content HTML then we need the status Brian what's the status mean we talked about this yesterday right a is active but I thought we were it was going to be a and I like active inactive but we're getting in oh no we don't need this edit history I don't think I'm gonna mess with bring in they created it's okay so the the o means it's been submitted and it's waiting for approval alright Brian's gonna check on that yeah I don't see any it unless you all think of something I don't really see any reason to keep the created date or the names of the people that put this in now keep in mind we are going to have a copy of all this so if we really needed to look look at this we could go back through I think I'm going to export it in basically all three formats that we can export it and save it and that way we still have access to this data but just in terms of what we ought to bring into WordPress I don't think we need any of this let's see you let's say we don't need that we don't a user ID so we'll need folder ID we don't need a content teaser do we need published so the publish we just have zeros and ones does the zero mean it's not published yet let's go over and see me yeah you know what maybe the zero means it's not it's not published it'd be published at some point or has it been unpublished you know purposely and let's see the other fields here all right so we don't need any of that private I don't even see anything marked as private anyway all right I'm not gonna worry about template ID we have a ton of them are just no okay whoa what's going on here oh there we go it's just that was that was odd actually this is odd as well so these are all the same but then once we get down here the titles are odd and there's no content I'm gonna scroll over and see if there's any content anywhere maybe we can put in a check that says you know if there's no content this is where it kept the teaser field I think maybe we could say if there is no content we're not gonna pull it in either for your CV maybe are these just references to maybe PDFs Brian wants to see that teaser section let's bring that up if I hover yeah it just a gives basic info phone number email address title yeah but it's only for the for those last two at the bottom and I think we have the more data up here all right well I say for now at least we'll say if there's nothing here for content HTML then we don't put it in WordPress let's see what's in it for row 36 is that's one small chunk of an overall piece of the smart form which creates the faculty page okay so Brown are you saying that the data that we're getting here is not it's not everything we need on the faculty page then tell me this is showing us you know name image a little email link to a CV a video and then there's details so there's some text so these ones up here seem more like a complete you know this is complete you know information on okay good that's everything all right then that seems like it's definitely doable ideally let me think if we could do this differently I'm much all right let me let me just show you what you what I'm thinking and you all let me know whether or not is reasonable so if I were making these post types from scratch in WordPress I wouldn't just have the the content in you know because this went up glowing which shows up in that big content editing area for a wordpress post i wouldn't put all this stuff in there with HTML right i would have different fields custom fields so there'd be a custom field for name title you know all that stuff the image wouldn't just be a link to an image that would be the featured image for that post type so it'd be a different spot where you put it in so if possible with the wordpress api would it be better if we could find a way to separate these out based on the names of the tags where this info is supposed to be and then add them as these these extra fields the only reason I mean I think that's it would be the best way but I'm wondering is that gonna make it just too much to transfer all this data over you know we'd have to go in some of them hopefully we'll have the same you know structure so I'm hoping all faculty have the same structure so we really only have to build it out once to be able to pull that data out and put it in I don't know a little old thing I'm gonna one does it even make sense what I'm saying is it clear number two assuming that it's clear what I'm talking about should we try to do it that way I'm swimming about the time here it's already December so really there's only like two weeks that I'm gonna be working on this in December and then we'll have the whole month of January and then at that point so we're really talking like six more weeks of working on this before we need to have something that's reasonably finished so that people can test you know what I think I I've talked myself into the answer here okay sorry if this is hard to follow I'm thinking out loud so that you all can understand what's going through my head here okay here's the plan we're gonna just pull the data in as these big chunks keep the HTML there we'll get all the data put in we can always go in after the fact and change it right so let's say we pull all the faculty in it wouldn't be ideal but we'd still up we'd have all the data in there and then we can just go in with some CSS later on you know grab these tags as is and then then you can style it however we want right at that point we'd have something that would look good and it would work to launch after that we could have let's say some student workers go in and we would make the real custom post type with the fields necessary or better yet we could just add the fields in to the custom post type that already has all the data have student workers go in separate out that data and then once we have that all separated out we can just go in chunks and go back and change or we could change our components or react components to pick out that data separately did you know what that makes sense so essentially we're doing a good enough solution for launch since it's so quick but we're still leaving it open so that it's entirely possible albeit somewhat time consuming to grow it out and separate it by hand or even we wouldn't have separate by hand but or even try to build out a somewhat automated way of pulling that data in and then we can give it the attention it deserves in small chunks as the year goes on let me look back at the live shots you think about it okay Uncle Pat's is separating out the different data fields this better longterm answer from an architecture standpoint it may not be the quickest solution for your timeline that is also right in line with agile iterations okay cool all right thank you okay all right I think that's a good plan for now if we run into issues in the HTML that we're bringing in is just too crazy to work with we can always you know switch that up that's not you know that's something that'll be easily changeable as we're pulling that data in and we'll try to pull the data in per category so we'll make it smaller chunks that way we don't end up pulling in you know nine thousand rows of data and then realizing after that oh we messed it up all right we'll do it in small chunks check it out make sure it works all right and then we'll move on it'll be a little bit slower than just bringing it all in at once but it could prevent big mistakes okay so let's bring that in now so what we want to grab is how did that go I'm gonna have to keep checking my syntax here because I'm not okay I'm not great with sequel so we want I'm gonna bring in Content ID that way if we ever need to go back and reference the original content it'll be really easy for us to do that with the ID so we don't really need that and WordPress but it could be helpful oh it's an ID there we go are we separating by commas yeah it's a Content ID and we need content title content HTML it should be you know I thought I'd misspelled it since I wasn't getting the autocomplete but looks alright now the content HTML I think there is only one other thing did we want to bring this in or I'm sorry the folder ID I don't think we need to bring the folder ID in right if we're gonna pull these in small chunks then that shouldn't be an issue so this is all that we'll need to bring in we are and then we're gonna pull it in by folder ID so we'll only get these is there a way put a tick between the column names on select it looks a lot cleaner okay her should sing use limit keyword okay limit 500 okay I don't I shouldn't need to use it for this one because there's definitely not we have 36 rows that match this but we should we probably should use it for some of our bigger chunks trying to catch up here on a live chat these between concentrating okay so drum long the saying put put back ticks between these is that how we did it I'm gonna even write that for now like it is for now you write a live look cleaner but just for for time purposes I'm gonna leave it like this oh I know what I wanted to ask is there a way that I could put let's say a keyword like not not and it would be HTML content and then like blank would that work I may as well try it oops consonants HTML equals nothing let's try it now syntax a keyword in odds all right so I guess I don't know how to use not if exists all right great thank you hush it so if Diggs is 22 it's not showing up or and okay I could use end can I use content HTML can I do is not equal to is that a thing in in sequel I'll try it nope incompatible and not equal to operator where column name is not null okay thank you Erland I appreciate that is no or just not know is that how it is interact syntax I just put is no I need to remove the site content HTML if not select a show all right all right well I got rid of the red line so this is a promising awesome thank you who's that Erland well several of you were trying to tell me what to do here Berlin ended up having the the syntax that I ended up using all right so let's double check and that did not work what did I mess up so we still got these we can always just pull this in and I mean I I know how to check for this in JavaScript but I think it would be better to to not pull them in at all if we know for sure we're not going to need them see it is it's uh our [ __ ] was the last thing that you're you're trying to say there it is not null with she's trying to say the syntax is supposed to be just not null are you saying the syntax is not supposed to be null I'm not I'm not sure I can try like this nope okay it's so not content all right let's try this all right let's do oh well I've been going for quite a long time and I haven't stopped I noticed there were some questions I haven't stopped to answer any questions let me let me take just a 5minute break here and answer some questions because normally I don't go this long without answering anything so let me try let me answer some questions here well it looks like heart's just trying to find the correct syntax for me I know I saw a question okay so our Pez says how do you motivate motivate yourself to code daily I failed every day I don't know why help me okay arpeggio you're still there because you did ask that you know a few minutes ago so I mean my motivation to code well number one is I get paid to code and if I didn't come in and code I wouldn't have a job so that's a great motivation when I was let's say freelance right the motivation still somewhat had to do with money but to be honest with you I enjoy coding so I enjoy building stuff and I enjoy getting better so I'd say it's a combination and you know leave aside the whole I have to make money to pay bills and take care of my family which I mean that's significant motivator but leaving that aside I would say it's a mixture of I don't know competitiveness wanting to be better at what I do you know personal pride in that and trying to do good things in just fun in enjoyment so yes so there's some times when I just I have fun coding so I want to code because I like building things and there's some times when I force myself to code because or to learn something new and try it out because I want to be good so I'd say that's you know those are the motivating factors for me now on like a really short term scale you can help yourself you know to get motivated there have been times when you know you know I always break up my work with Pomodoro sessions I think that helps with motivations because you have all these really small chunks that don't seem intimidating and then when you finish one it feels like a victory even if it was something small you can actually move it you know to a different column in my case I usually use a Trello board but I've done it before where you know I'll have let's say like a piece of candy or a chocolate bar something you know sitting on my desk and also okay if I get through this Pomodoro session or if I get through this task then I'm going to eat that candy bar right it's kind of silly but if you need a little bit of motivation there it is or I'll say you know after I finish this task then I'm gonna go I'm gonna then all eat lunch or then I'll do something that can be just a like a shortterm motivator just to get you through you know something really tough so that would kind of be my my advice if you have a really hard time getting yourself motivated you could look into some other things like you know are you getting enough exercise are you eating right did you get enough sleep if you're doing all those things and it's still there you might want to think about talking to your doctor seeing do you have any health issues there's all kind of stuff that could cause that you know maybe some mild depression thyroid problems I mean there's so many things but first I try you know try to get yourself motivated with some of the things I mentioned first and and then you know try with exercise and diet I'm not a doctor at all so you know don't take my advice is if I was but just for me I've you know that also seems to help so hopefully that some of that was at least useful to you or someone else and then ultimately if you try everything and you're still not motivated it could may be coding is not your thing you know maybe you should try to find something that does excite you to work or maybe just a different area of coding you know think there's so many different things you could go into you in the area of like coding programming you know engineering you know just maybe try out some new things do you find something that you really do get excited about one more question here in our last minute of our break and then we'll go back and get this data transferred over Oh more says hi hey Jesse I've been following you for a while I've noticed that you work on several types of projects run in back and mobile I was wondering what is your role in this company my official title is frontend developer but realistically I'm I'm like the project manager as well for all these projects so my I have full freedom to use whatever tools that I need whatever technologies that I think is best as long as the projects get done so if I meet the project requirements on time no one worries about what I'm using also I mean cost is if I came in and said I want to use this certain type of technology it's gonna cost us $100,000 then they care but I usually use opensource you know that doesn't cost anything so now I mean if you are using opensource a lot and relying on it you should really consider giving back and certainly I'm open to that if assuming that my code is up to quality to be able to be merged then I'll definitely do that but you know even if I can't do that I for sure at least try to give credit to those technologies that I use on you know posting about it on Twitter featuring it talking about it on the stream so I don't want to give people the impression that opensource means free with no responsibility right if we want those opensource products to keep going and getting better you know we ought to contribute something you know donate you know financially or with your time and your abilities so anyway so my role is a little bit more than my title you know would would have you believe but basically I I do whatever needs done to get the project done if that means working with databases you know that's it if I need to set up servers if I need to develop stuff backend stuff you know I do that but at least usually what I do is frontend it would be considered frontend although lately I've been into all different kinds of things so that's a good question of all right so let's go back I guess I'll set the Pomodoro clock haven't really been using it that yet this dream but it'll be a reminder I guess so let me check the live chat see what we have in terms of syntax to try to get this where we want okay okay so we just need oops we're not content HTML okay let's run it whoops oh I think I forgot I feed that so not gonna work still need and hi that's is that exactly no I think it's something okay all right now I'm getting a lot in the chat here uh okay it's wrong were not showing the prices and before it's two single quotes okay all right parentheses Michael saying parentheses around the criteria all right Michael where am I gonna put these parentheses I mean I'm I'm sorry I betrayed me like I'm someone who knows nothing about about sequel queries because that's not really that far from the truth okay so in the where you put parentheses around that okay and then put this think so Michaels saying think of your whereas an if statement in JavaScript with multiple criteria how do you keep them together okay all right that makes so much sense what about what's going on over here why am I getting a line okay no all right all right it's not working what am I doing here knots okay use all right harsh it's in use double quotes Mike what is the data type of the ID column the folder ID probably I don't know maybe it's not a string it worked before let me just remove this quickly to check so oops I didn't put it in to be honest I don't know what the data type is or how to find that I mean it it obviously looks like it's a number but there's not closer on anything so you know I know this is a string so I'm not sure but it is working like like this okay news how saying does not matter what data type it is okay we'll just pop this back in and let's I don't wanna keep working with it concentration oh yeah it's not still give the red stuff invalid column name contents text okay I know and Connie it's not no okay all right hmm okay let's try okay so there may be Erland says there may be some space in there which is detected as content so let's try hard s another idea remove not before consummation okay oops hmm yeah this is still detecting something in here all right usually comes in these miracles all right let's try let's try this this is from Harshit he's saying we could do not so we're gonna do at the end for length equals zero shadows nope I got it says invalid let's make sure I got that right I mean content you know rooks asking if spaces increase length I don't know it's like lengths I greater than one all right let's see if getting some more stuff here okay so we have something else here all right let's try this and I'm gonna paste this in because it was a lot okay so now we're saying I gots to get some weird character there all right so coalesce character length content HTML all right let's see what this does the character character length is not recognized builtin function name all right let me check out that I didn't miss anything I think I've tried everything that's been suggested so far let me know if I haven't all right let's see a Mayan continuity as lengthier selects at length continuity okay all right select content a day like I was lying throughout another call and be a query okay let's see that's not gonna work from now this okay hmm all right let me let me read what else is in here now Javier says Chavez content HTML less than symbol greater than symbol type the actual symbols without spaces I think that's the way you say not equal for Strings you can't type this symbols in chat interesting all right let me try I'm gonna try a hardship put some in I can just copy and paste I'll try that first because obviously it's easy to copy and paste oops nope it's not so and Vincents and and content asean is not no I think we did that one already yeah we tried that so Vincent we tried that one already and for some reason it's it's not recognizing those as as not enough alright Michael I get the the length column ID thing which it did it worked but why why do we want the length of the column ID wouldn't wouldn't be better to get the length of the HD content HTML yes what I was thinking all right actually this will be useful just to see what this returns invalid argument for one of my function yeah this is not working maybe because it's a string and the Content ID was an integer yeah it's an integer just text okay Michael I you keep typing in length but it won't let me it won't let me use length they keep saying use Len no Anna alright let's let me think about this man I wish I had my interns there's a possibility I might get three interns and two of the three are supposed to be good with databases and they probably would remember a lot of this syntax all right let's how about I don't worry about this now all right late the the whipping post and content show less than equal in all right we'll try it we'll try one more and C Mon us and what is it less than equal and less than equal to is that what you mean less than greater than hmm okay I think our problem is that we can't use this kind of stuff on that data type so we need to use things that work on it's calling it @n text which I'm assuming is the sequel equivalent of string all right let's see all right so Umberto has pasted something in there so let's try that whoa all right yeah I was is wrong with this it's not working all right I'm not sure what's wrong with that I'm Berto but I mean it's giving me it's giving me an error all right let's try this day length all right Vincent is saying since its text we have to use data length so let's try that day length is greater than zero okay we didn't get an error but we also didn't have anything return see alright so hard [ __ ] has put in a Stack Overflow link let's check that out all right I guess we could try this it's sorry everybody I've messed up my my sign I didn't see you all type in that either cuz I was looking at that Stack Overflow yes yes all right okay excellent who was that Vincent Vincent all right great job that was though that did it thank you very much let's import this data all right yeah let's bring that in actually let's just bring this in all right so for this here we go and content titles that was publish I wonder if we could give it an ID just shut up oops post I still have the API Doc's up here I guess I could see those I want to get posting when I post hmm I guess I can't set the ad did all right we'll leave it off for now yeah I'm not really seeing in a category let's just just try to pull this in and see how that's works especially with a category so let's add a category in right now we want it to be faculty yeah okay we'll save that and let's run it no no no I agree the hardship is asking how will you insert folder ID and WordPress how hurts it does not like a sequel server yeah I'm not using it by choice this is just what we have the data on right now so the last time I ran this it didn't actually give me any indication that this worked so let's just check out what we have here in our or posts see if we got it hmm we refresh okay still nothing all right so that didn't work that's interesting so we haven't gotten an error but I'm not seeing the data use all right so let's see nothing good somewhere else go back no you know what I wonder if what's this I think probably what I need is the slug for this and knots I'm maybe it wasn't adding it because it wasn't that category so I'm gonna save this and try it again mmmhmm nope I wasn't it hard saying console of the data okay let's do that alright let's go Arsen change the log frequency okay yeah let's just take this up and then just console look okay it's saying that it's inserted but we're seeing it is not inserted let's see what did we add up here let's take this out oh you know what it wasn't that it was because I tried to add this ID in and you can't add an ID and I forgot to take it out so remember we checked the docs realize the Canadian they never never anything about it so that's most likely why try it now there we go that's why interesting the category thing did not work though so we had category faculty let me check the docs and see category oh okay because I messed it up it's supposed to be categories and it's supposed to be an array all right oh well that was kind of a test anyway so ones have to remember that for next time kids categories and needs to be an array I would like to see what it's what the update process is for updating a post okay that's not that's not as good here so when you go to update you actually have to put in the post ID I was hoping that you could just do a post request now that the yeah this makes more sense you have the ID all right good to know I mean I wasn't gonna update right now but it's good to know that if we ever need to that's how we got to do it okay so like I said this is a test so I don't want to leave these in posts but I did want to see ok can we add multiple things and we'll come in and let's check all right cool we have this in here it looks weird now but we can check the HTML and it looks a little bit nicer now when it actually is pulled in HTML that's interesting that's X that's really interesting it did not pull in all the tags or maybe WordPress stripped a lot of them out so if you remember what we should have oops is something more like this alright let's set this with WordPress for a second it strips them automatically I don't know if you saw it was really small but I tried to put a nonstandard HTML tag in here and it stripped it out I'm really glad we tested this so I'm gonna have to look up how to turn that functionality off for our editor at least for when we're pulling stuff in that might not be a bad idea to turn it off later on to keep people from putting invalid HTML in here but for now I'd rather keep that structure okay all right so we got a lot of done today I'm pretty amazed that in two days we pretty much figured out how we're gonna do this migration I haven't done it but having migrated everything but we've tested it enough that we know it's gonna work still have a few things to work out like getting it to keep the tags that we send it but other than that not bad is definitely a successful stream today so let me check the live chat quickly to see if there are any questions that I missed I think I was able to catch everything as we were going along and then I think we'll wrap things up okay Harshit saying let's change the tags using regular expression yeah we could do that I'm just I'm worried that you know would it be too much so harsh is saying like try to replace the content with replace name with div well that's good but I wouldn't want to replace it with div it would have to be like div and then class name right because I want to I want to be able to still grab those so would it be worth it knowing that we would have to go through and figure out you know for the faculty it's fine because they're all going to be pretty standard I hope but then for each different post type we'll have to figure out what we want to change the stuff to maybe it would be easier just to figure out how to turn off all right well here's it I'm gonna try to figure out how to make WordPress accept the tags that we send it if that's not possible or if it's really hard to do then we'll try to just change the the tags because the tags at the very least I mean there it makes it obvious what the thing is so I don't dislike that those tags and as far as I know html5 it's it's totally definitely okay maro is a feast day catholic holy day of obligation so I'm off tomorrow since I work at Catholic University so I will see you all on Monday and I'll try to work on figuring out what's what's going on with WordPress and we may or may not do more streams on the transferring this data because we pretty much figured how it's gonna work it'll probably be just somewhat time consuming so I'll work on it or I'll find you know someone else to work on it yeah all right so anyway to anybody who's anybody who's Catholic have a happy Feast of the Immaculate Conception tomorrow it's cool if you don't have to work that's awesome if you do have to work that's kind of usual nobody really gets off for that but make it to Mass if you can and I think that's it thank you so much everyone for helping it's really obvious that I needed the help and I very much appreciate it so have a have a great weekend since I won't see y'all tomorrow and I'll be back on Monday
