array iteration i'm going to go through eight methods to iterate through an array to iterate means that you're going through the array and you're doing something with each item of the array some some methods don't necessarily go through each item but we'll get to that most do the first one is for each let me show you an example here so you can see in the example i'm passing in the array one two three four each and for each is pretty straightforward it just does something for each item in the array so we pass in we can pass on the item and we pass in the index of the item in the array and then for each in this example for each item we're just going to console the log and the index so if i run that we can look in the console one zero two one three two that's just the item in the index the next way to iterate is map in map it takes the item that's from the array it does something to it and then puts a new thing back in that same place in the array so if we have this array called three and it just says one two three and now we are going to assign it to doubled three dot map that's how we're gonna iterate and we're going to return the item times two it's just going to double each item so instead of the rating one two three there's gonna be a new thing in place of each item in the array if i run that you can see at the bottom two four six it's all been doubled next up is filter filter is going to take an array and it's gonna check each item in the array it gets again some kind of condition to see if it's true or false if it's true it's going to put the item back in the array if it's false it's not going to put the item in the array and each of these makes a brand new array so we're going to pass in the numbers one two three and filter and the condition is item modulus two equals equals equals zero and for each of these items it's going to check to see if if that's true and this is just a way to find out even numbers so if we run this you can see the bottom of the console here the only item is going to put back into the array or into the returned array is 2. it doesn't actually put it back into the array it's because ins still is one two three but evens is now two reduce and reduce we're going to take an array and we're going to do something and then pass the result to the next iteration along with the next item in the array so that's why we're going to put result and an item in here so the first time it goes to the array it's going to have a result and it's going to send that result to the next item to the next iteration and then add an item the number at the end is what the initial result is going to be if you don't put a number at the end like this the initial result will be the first item in the array so when it goes through this it's the result is going to be zero then we're going to add the first item that's one and then it's going to go through the item the array again and the result is now one and it's going to i add the item two so one plus two is three and this goes gonna go through again there's all this three it's gonna add three and that's gonna be six and before we run that i'm gonna put console.log sum and let's see at the very end we get six next up is sum sum you just check if any item in the array so here's here's all the items in the array he has negative numbers sum means does any item in the entire array meet this condition so if any item in the entire array meets the condition is less than zero it's going to be true if no items meet the condition then it's going to be false so you can see this is true because one of the items in the array is negative the next one is every and this is kind of similar to sum but now every number has to meet the condition so we have the const all positive numbers we pass in one two and three every you know here's the callback function we're going to run this function we're going to pass in each item if each item is more than zero then we're gonna put true but also if we make just one item negative when we run that we're gonna have false so it's either all or nothing with this one okay next one we're going to look at is find find goes through every item in the array and checks it against the condition and if that's true it returns that item so it's searching for a specific item in the in the array if we pass in this array and in this array we have a list of key value pairs id is a id is b ids c objects dot fine we're gonna pass in this function with the item so it's gonna go through each item and check to see if the id equals equals equals b and then if it finds that it's going to return it so it returned the whole thing id b if it doesn't find your item then it will return undefined and the last one is find index find index is pretty much just like find everything in this code is the same except we just add the word index here and instead of find it's find index and then we're consoling find index so instead of returning the actual item it's going to return the index of the item so this is index 0 index 1 and x 2 and you can see that we're looking for b and that's index 1. so if i run that and you look at the bottom of the console you will see a 1. if it does not find the index anywhere it will return negative one well thanks for watching and special thanks to jordan harband i use something that he wrote as inspiration
