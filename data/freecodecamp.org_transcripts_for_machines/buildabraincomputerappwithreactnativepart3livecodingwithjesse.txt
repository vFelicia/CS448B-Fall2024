hey everybody welcome to live coding with jessie i'm jesse and with me is gemma hi i'm drinking gatorade ambrose in the background and cordelia you know say hi cordelia yeah all right so anyway my kids are all here well not all of them there's another one upstairs i have four but uh today we're gonna continue to work on this uh expo react native uh app uh so right now we're running it as a um as a web app so uh evan bacon's in the channel who uh works at expo and does some awesome stuff with uh expo web we are gonna see some expo web stuff that's let me bring this up on the screen uh let's see where it went live stream there we go my computer went into sleep mode uh and so all my all my screens got rearranged so i had it all set up and then i lost it there we go all right so this is the app running actually it's not it's not really running uh it's just whatever is left over from what we ran last uh last evening what are you holding up amber did you make a sign and i'm holding up hey all right so anyway i'm running uh react native with uh expo and let's see if the chat sums up with my chat if um somebody tried to type something in the chat because i think my chat got disconnected and i'll see if i can see it because right now i am not able to see the messages in the chat i could try to open it in a new window oh okay i opened my chat in a new window and now i can see the messages so hopefully this will work okay yeah so i think i lost some of the first messages so if you ask me something right off the bat then i probably can't see it anymore but i can see the chat now so hey everybody i guess it was really weird there were only like three messages in the chat and that's very uh uncommon um so i def i just lost the first few messages or whatever uh so sorry about that but uh anyway um i am i built this uh like built the app with expo which is a tool that helps you build with react native so i'm using yarn so i just typed in yarn start and now once expo runs and does its thing if i hit w it'll open up the expo app in a web browser uh so you can see here having the web browser i can refresh it's it's running here uh which is pretty sweet and it actually makes it way easier cordial you don't hit that button but you can't sit with me all right go hitting buttons um i'll sit with you so it's it's actually really awesome i kind of prefer working like this unless there's something i really need to test uh on a mobile phone i prefer to do most of the development with the web uh version of uh of expo which is using react native web um it's just so much easier to be able to do all your debugging with um like in a web app right the um the feedback loop is tighter right so it's there's less time uh you know the uh there's a little bit of lag if you're developing like on a mobile device that connected your computer between when you make a change and when it actually updates on the device i find like uh i just have way less issues doing it like this i do have to frequently kind of keep the mobile version open though just to make sure i haven't messed anything up but it definitely helps me develop faster this is i've i've used this professionally and on side projects like i'm doing here so i definitely i like that that aspect of it and let's see trying to get my there we go i want to get my chat all uh situated with the uh stream data on my other screen here okay cool so this is the third stream uh that we've done with this particular app real quick i'm going to go over the goal of this app we are trying to take data from a brain computer interface which i'll i'll put on in just a minute and i'll show you but there's a company called nerosity that makes a brain computer interface that's called the notion it's it reads your brain waves and then it has an interface uh javascript interface that you can use to get that data into your app so that's what we're gonna do and for this particular app for phase one of the app all i want to do is measure my level of focus and then display a warning whenever my focus is dropped too low just to kind of remind me to stay focused what do you put in your mouth cordially what is that it's a great gift card all right and i'm in the background pretending to sing with your microphone um so um that's the goal now in this particular stream what we want to do is we pretty much did most of the work we needed to persist user data from one session to another and we want to keep basically we want to just uh finish that uh we're almost finished we had kind of a little bug with it at the end so i want to finish that and then uh actually put in our threshold for the um uh the focus so like we're gonna figure out like at what level of focus should we show a warning and what should that warning be uh and it's probably gonna be a different warning on the web as opposed to on uh on mobile hey kids you can't all sit on my lap so why don't you go play uh that's for um oh yeah don't press those buttons it links up to my phone via bluetooth but if you're going to be down here you can't interrupt me okay uh so all right let's see so here's how we're going to do this in the stream i'm going to start a timer a pomodoro timer it's going to go for 25 minutes during that time that 25 minutes i'm not really going to look at the chat too much i'm going to try to focus on coding and explaining what i'm coding and then after the timer goes up i'm going to take a break i'm going to go to the chat and i'm going to answer all your questions uh i want to try to keep this stream to just about an hour long uh and because i want to try to get the kids to bed help get the kids to bed so can i say something you want to say something gemma would like to say so try not to get the corona virus yeah that's very good yeah gemma gemma doesn't want anyone to get the coronavirus so be safe all right all right you want to say something too yeah all right everybody gets to say one thing and then you gotta let me code all right everybody play don't die or else don't die or else don't die all right gemma says don't get the coronavirus ambrose says don't die cordelia would you like to say anything i think that's just bro i can do tools all by myself oh she can do twirls all by herself all right cool all right now you all had your chance to say something now you got to be quiet let me do the coding okay all the people all the people want to see the coding part okay when you get older you can have a youtube channel too all right all right and actually so gemma has been working on free code camp lessons to learn how to code and uh ambrose has been working on coding too and i've been working on um kindergarten math kindergarten math yeah he's working i told him he had to learn how to read and he had to learn his math um all right so see you later thanks for being on the show i'll see you in about i'll see you in about an hour be good okay all right so anyway uh i hope i hope you're all right with that that's how it is when you uh um you work with kids i don't really have an office i'm just in my basement so the kids can just come down whenever uh so let's get started i'm gonna start my timer make sure it's actually working on yesterday's show i started a timer and then somehow i stopped it and um uh so it looks like it's running successfully this time all right cool let me make this bigger i'll make sure everybody can see all right i'm going to make this as small as i can i'm going to get rid of these files on the side i did put this on github so if you check the description for this video there's a link to the github repo so you can see all this code and um i guess it's not going to be that useful to you unless you have an ocean headset but you can at least check out see what we're doing get a kind of a closer look at the code but what we want to do is the next step i guess we want to do is like the user can put in their id email and password and that links them up to the brain computer interface and it gets us data but as soon as we refresh the page they lose their their subscription to the device as soon as you put the id in we can get it again but what i want to do is save the id in local storage so that they don't even have to put the id in again it'll just check local storage okay so we already have the code for that in here so we have this um this get item for and we're going to get the device id right but the problem is um the part where we actually save is not working right now so we want to figure out where we can make this save so the reason it's not working is i i think i think that this function is actually running first and we're going to test that let's test that because i don't think we really have i'm just gonna do a console log here and just console.log some some nonsense just to see if that is in fact what's happening and let's make let's inspect we'll bring up the console and uh i want to see if that's really the issue that's happening here because i'm not convinced that it is and let me get my data um yep this is it uh let me turn my device on so this is the neurocity notion headset if you want to know more about this headset and how it works uh you can go to um you can check out a video i did on my youtube channel the link to my youtube channel is in the description below i talk a lot more about what this headset can do and give you a like a demo so all right that's going to start up it's just going to take a few seconds to start and then we should be able to connect in the meantime let me type in our data okay so this is actually running every time something changes which is what i thought it was that was happening uh so what's gonna happen now is if i put a password in this is gonna run and i believe it's gonna try to log us in uh so what i'm gonna do is let's just remove password from here so this doesn't run when a password is entered it's going to erase my stuff but i'll just copy it again and let's verify yeah see so password is not running here so this is going to test my theory to see if it was actually this function that was logging us in uh early it was basically we're getting logged in too early like before we press the the button to log in which i should probably change that to log in instead of press me but remember to do that in a minute okay so grab the password all right sweet so it was this function that was automatically logging us in uh so just by removing password i think we've solved that issue and now when i hit this this button should call this init function which should first save our device id to async storage so let's let's go to our application and go to local storage and see right now we don't have the device id saved when i hit this button the device id should be saved and we should get logged in which yep all right so the notions online i just wanted to double check so sweet so we have our device id and now uh let me make this bigger so i could see all right so we can see we have our device id now saved um and we are connected so we're just we're getting some random data since this isn't actually on my my head so we're not getting real data uh yet but sweet so i think that's going to be an easy fix then so we have the data so what should happen now is if i log out no that's not if i refresh the page what should happen is that it should check as soon as this this component which is our app component mounts it should check to see if we have device id and async storage and if it does it'll set the device id when the device id gets set it should trigger this function right which should set in motion everything we need to stay logged in so let's see if that is really the case let's refresh hey all right cool so we saw like briefly a little flash of the uh the login panel until everything actually ran uh which is fine and now we're still focused so awesome so that was actually like uh that was really easy um i ended the stream without having fixed that and it was literally what like a five minute fix so that's really cool so since we we kind of fixed that issue i'm going to go ahead and commit this before we move on the next step is going to be figuring out how to display a notification uh i'm just always used to doing a git status just to make sure of what's changed even though we really only are editing one file here so um let's do git commit and i'm gonna do an am flag that means it's gonna add so it's a git ad plus a commit with a message and so whatever i put in this message um is will be our commit message so i'm gonna say uh feed for feature and we're gonna say um let's see login login persist through page refresh okay cool so that's the new feature that we've added and i'm going to do a git push since it's pretty much just me working on this project right now i'm just pushing straight to master it's still a test project if this was really in production and there were more people working on it i would probably set up different branches and then do a pull request but i think that's a little bit of overkill for uh a side project right now all right so now that we have that set up not only did we really want that set up uh but also it's gonna help us develop this a lot more quickly because we won't have to keep logging in which is a little bit of a pain in the last two streams so now we need to i guess we need to keep track of our our focus the number of our focus so let's see how we're doing that right now uh yeah so we have our focus here in our uh on our state so since every time our focus changes it changes state we're going to be able to pretty much track that right and we can come down here and say within this uh let's let's go to our styles should we do styles yeah yeah i think that would be a good way to do it um right now our background color let me do this i'm going to move my styles into my function because that's gonna allow me to have access to the state right and then now for background color we can make it determine based on on the focus level so let's say focus if focus is less than and uh let's say less than i don't know 0.3 then we want the background color to be let's just say red for now so that'll be easy to see otherwise we want the background color to be white let's see if that works there we go as you can see every time the focus falls below 0.3 it's red and then we go above it it's it's white now like i said right now i don't even have the headset on so it's just kind of giving us like just random numbers because there's not real data coming in uh i could try to put this on so we could get some real data i don't know how well i'm going to be able to focus while i'm kind of working on uh whoops well i'm doing the stream and everything but i'm gonna try try my best to make sure okay um i might have to drop the focus level if i ever want to get out of the red here um let's drop it down to a point two and then that way we'll get there we go so um right now this is like a decent indicator what i would really like though is uh maybe something a little bit this uh oops it doesn't like that i was using styles before i declared it so let's let's put this up here a little bit i don't think i'm actually even using using this uh loading this is maybe left over from yeah i think that's left over from the kind of boilerplate stuff i brought in at first all right so sweet now what i'd like to do is have uh i guess some type of notification pop up and maybe have it like vibrate uh really ultimately it would be nice if the user could pick their choice of how to be alerted like what type of alarm they would want uh but you know for now this at least gives us some indication of our our focus level that's that's very bright and obvious but we would have to kind of be looking at our phone so it's not not really ideal right if you're trying to focus on something then you don't really want to be looking at your phone right so we need some sort of notification that is going to get your attention even if you're focused on something else so i think some type of audible uh or like vibration would be best now we can't really do a vibration on um you know on our web version of this but we can at least put in some of the code for it and then test it out right okay so let's go into either we're going to look either in the expo documentation or react native so first i'm going to look at react native and see if we have something for vibrate vibration cool so we do have an api for vibration sweet vibration dot vibrate so all right cool um you can see that we can also check and see what expo has i think it's expo.io yeah here's i have the docs in here vibration i just want to see if expo has anything different but it looks like they have the same the same docks here so that's good occasionally expo will have uh like some extra things uh extra extra components that make it a little bit easier to work with these device things but uh for now uh this is gonna work so let's just see if we can set it up so that we have this you know vibration happen based on a state change so first let's pull in vibration from react native and it looks like we need to add something to our android manifest dot xml so let's do that let's add this in and this looks like a permission thing so uh looks like we need to get permission to um to use the vibrate feature i need to see if we even have i don't know that we even have this because we haven't attempted to run this yeah we've only done the web so we may have to attempt to run this first so let's see i believe we can try to do an android build if we just type a yep there we go let's see what we have it may not work i don't have android studio installed so i may have to get that installed and then try it on a different stream android air no android device found oh okay i can i need to connect my android device which i can do unless i left my cord did i leave my cord i left my cord in my bag that's in the closet upstairs so it's cool i'm going to drop into my amazon alexa device that's upstairs in my house and have one of my kids bring me my bag and then we can connect my device up uh to the computer so let's do a dropin this is probably the most useful thing on on amazon so it's hello hello can you hear me hey is anybody up there hey i need i need a favor can somebody go in the closet and get my backpack and bring it down to me please hello hi daddy hey there can can you go in my uh backpack and get or my closet and get my backpack and bring it down to me please all right thank you all right cool so when i get my cord to hook up my android phone i should be able to run this on my android phone and um we should be able to test out the vibration uh on my phone uh which would be pretty cool i'll just like hold it up to the camera i guess so you could see it running which is not ideal but um i don't know that we can test the vibration with the simulator i i said to come down with my backpack you came down emptyhanded oh you just came to get my my drone all right all right i'm looking in your backpack for what you have if you have gum i would have it i don't have any gum in here i don't think i do okay i just need the score actually i do have gum here here's your reward you can have my pack of gum i shut the door on your way up please thanks okay so i've got the cord and i made sure i brought this i normally use this when i'm at work but i made sure to bring it home because i i figured i might need it this is like the longest um normal usb to usb c cord that i have i need to find a port for it i don't know if it's like this for you all but like all my usb ports are always taken up i didn't realize this but i actually have a usbc port on that computer that's awesome i can uh connect it just through usbc so that's pretty sweet so now i am connected and let's try this again i'm gonna run this yeah sweet we're running the application on the pixel xl and this should be i might have to scan this barcode if i can find it let's go over here see if i can find it here so if i scan this barcode i should be able to oops to run this on the phone i need to find my expo app and scan this qr code it's still it's running the last application that i built on here not the new one so need to see what is why is it doing this all right usually if you shake the phone you can come up with a screen like a screen will come up but it's not working there we go ah no that didn't work hmm all right let me see this is really weird i don't know if i could do anything from here so like just you can see it is uh it's gonna be really hard for you to see but it's running in application right now but this is the last application that i worked on in expo so it's definitely not what i what i want um let's see how all right i'm gonna check my timer because i may be out of time for yeah okay so it's almost time for me to stop and get to the questions uh but then also i need to know uh enable rivalry the area get the developer menu so i might i can just hit command m or do adb shell input key event in my terminal window shake device vertically a bit yeah my shaking of my device is just not working i could try to reload yeah reloading is still coming up with the old one all right it says i can run this i've never tried this one before um i don't know where let's see if i run it here nope hmm hmm oh yeah so an android device can run it here but it's not i might actually need to get the android emulator going if this if i can't get it to work all right i'm gonna take a little break though anyway uh and answer some questions so maybe i'll uh i'll figure some way out my subconscious will work on this problem while i'm uh while i'm reading questions so i'm scrolling up as far as i can remember i i missed a few um a few questions that got cut off from the chat at the beginning so apologies if i missed your question but let's see so nds this brain computer app what is its function the function of this particular app is to give me an alert give the user an alert whenever their level of focus has dropped below a certain threshold um uh null stock says what technology is he using for the actual brain computer interface uh it is this device that i'm wearing it is called the notion headset by nerosity uh it's a a brain computer so inside here there there is actually a small computer very similar similar to what you would have in your cell phone it's an internet of things device um and it's uh really like very lightweight and just fits fits right on your head it's adjustable so it can fit you know variety of different head sizes so that's the device i'm using uh if you want to know more about that check out my youtube channel links in the description i do a demo video where i talk a lot more about the the device in particular you also if you do a search for neurocity um i'm trying to think what the what the website is i got the website up it's it's neurocity.co um neurosity dot co uh and you can sign up to i believe right now you can preorder the headset but check check out the site you'll be able to see how how you can maybe get the uh the brain computer interface uh er errored uh sorry for mispronouncing your name says uh you are my favorite uh i believe it's just trying to say channel uh thank you i appreciate that and i assume you mean free code camp's channel which has a lot more than just me on it and so it's not like i'm just your favorite but i appreciate it uh free code camp does a lot of good good stuff um let's see see a lot of you just saying hi so hey everybody let's see uh yusuf says the best channel with best lecturer oh thank you i appreciate that uh we got greetings from all over the world here looks like someone's saying hi from ghana someone from panama um awesome leonard asks where do you live do your kids also have school uh so i actually live in ohio but i'm very close to pittsburgh pennsylvania and that's where i work i'm right on the border um and my kids they don't have school so they never have school on a sunday like a saturday or sunday but they actually have school off because of the coronavirus school has been canceled in uh in the whole state of ohio for the next three weeks so i've actually shut down quite a few things so there's no there's a limit on i think like any gatherings above 100 people are now banned uh they they i think they just said they're gonna shut down all restaurants and bars although they're allowing like drivethroughs and um delivery and like take out food uh so there's a lot of restrictions now in ohio which is probably for the best right uh from what i understand you know if we can uh try to do as much as we can as early as we can to stop the virus then you know more people will be healthy um but yeah we'll be uh we'll all be here together in the house for for a long time let's see uh sergey says are they your web team yeah not yet but i'm training them one day i'm gonna train them up i have a whole team of uh of programmers um that valdarg says this seems like something that might be useful for not quite selfdriving cars considering the only deaths so far been from people thinking the car was fully selfdriving yeah actually what i'd like to do with this is run it as an android auto app so that could remind the driver to stay focused and so whenever the driver loses focus it would give them some sort of notification that wouldn't be too distracting but would remind them to like focus on driving so that's going to be like one of the next steps after we get the basics of this app working is i really want to try to use it with um with android auto and i'm i'm because i have an android phone i can test it out with android auto but you know ideally i know um you know there are other so like apple i think has their version uh i've never used it but i think it could potentially help prevent accidents uh in in cars if if i can get it to work let's see leonard says here in germany we have three weeks free of school due to coronavirus uh plus two weeks easter holiday so five weeks no school okay so there's a yeah i imagine there's probably uh quite a few uh people out there that are in a similar situation where school has been cancelled or uh you know you're working from home or you know some something like that i i hear um that italy is pretty much on lockdown i don't know if anybody's from italy watching the stream uh you know let us know how it is at least from what i can get here it's just you know online uh so i prefer to try to get information from people who are actually there as opposed to like the news um i feel like it's kind of more authentic information and not filtered through you know whatever news uh source but um anyway i'm gonna go my timer went up for uh for the chat so i'm gonna go back do a little bit of code and then i'll come back to the chat uh in a little bit and um uh see what's uh see what's going on in the chat answer some questions looks like he's from china somebody in here said that hello from china hey how's it going um so we were just talking about the coronavirus with being from china like how is it there uh in terms of like you know are you uh is it at this point do you feel like it's pretty contained uh or is there still a lot um i guess that you can't do it it's it's starting it feels kind of like odd over here um at this point i think it'll get worse than it is now in the united states uh in china do you feel like it's going to get worse or does it seem like it's getting better anyway oh wait i i may not see your message for a while because i'm going to go back to the chat but i just uh kind of would would love to get like a firsthand account of kind of what feeling you get about it i realize china is a very big country so different areas of china are going to have have different um effects from from the virus but it's still good to get somebody you know somebody that's there uh get kind of their account of it but let's see let's go back to all right here so i'm gonna give what i'm gonna do i'm gonna completely quit at the expo app and go back in and see if i can get the new app to load and so let's scan this let me go in here uh okay unfortunately it's still the old app i am gonna try to do a little shake i guess this is supposed to work i don't know why it's not working do i not have i don't yeah i don't understand why it's not working okay um so unfortunately i can't get the developer menu to load so i may have to check out android studio like i'm not going to try to do the install for android studio right now so we may just have to um hmm i'm gonna try to run this i mean i really don't think yeah i didn't think that would work okay and this it looks like these directions are assuming that we're running on a mac so it may be that i just can't use these instructions for um a windows machine let me see i'm just going to check the chat really quick to see if anybody put the um if anybody had any idea how i could get this to refresh looks like oh my god okay um let's see all right so i guess we just do a quick google search right because if we can't test the uh the features on a mobile device then we're gonna be a little bit stuck here so uh let me say android all right let's just open up a few of them uh open up your simulator so that i can press ctrl m let's see about that all right looks like that is not working i wonder if i can if i change the mode that doesn't really do anything oh yeah do you have some messages here hmm no i don't think that works okay the only thing i can think of if i do a save will that trigger looks like it's only triggering a web refresh okay um let me go back to here all right so controlm did not work development node enabled i believe we do but let's double check make sure we have dev mode enabled yep we did make sure i double check yep we turned off production mode so it is dev mode hmm i just hit r to restart metro bundler just to see if that would do anything which it did not okay all right let's try this one this will refresh all right let's see this one too all right i don't think that's gonna help sorry i'm just trying i'm not reading this out loud i'm trying to skim through first to see if these are even um like close to what what we're experiencing this looks like android studio so that's not what we what we want okay um let's see i'm gonna try to change something in here and see if a uh if saving it would would do anything so i guess probably the easiest thing to change would be some text so let's add in an extra space see if we get an update looks like nothing i didn't see anything on the screen uh you know this this is still updating you know we could try to do i could try to just completely uh quit and then start it up again see if we can get a difference with the you know total restart and we can press a to run the android emulator let's see what we have see what other commands we have so all right current mode is development mode which is good that's what it needs to be uh let's do shift r because that should restart and clear the uh cache maybe that would help shift r maybe this will help all right while that's running i'm going to go to the chat and see what's what's going on in the chat here oh cool so uh alex is in the chat and he's uh one of the founders of neurosci that's the company that makes this this headset and he said that the the gamma brain waves are what determines your focus so the higher your gamma brain wave the higher your focus so uh that's pretty cool um william says i'm learning python are apis the equivalent to modules um i i think api is pretty standard no matter what the language is so i'm not exactly sure in python what module means but i don't think it would be the equivalent of an api if anybody is more knowledgeable about python though please please let us know uh mr own said i love this awesome thank you uh jp games says is your job stressful um i wouldn't really say my job is stressful um it right now um the project that i'm working on is still like in development so we're not really there's not a lot that's dependent on our project yet that's going to change once we start like releasing uh to more locations so it will get a little bit more stressful but right now it's it's not it's not too bad programming i'd say in general in itself is not stressful but depending on what project you're working on and what's at stake with the project it could be stressed like there are external factors that could be stressful all right so this thing's still still doing its thing which is fine because it gives me time to catch up on the chat uh ssdu if i could explain what i'm doing uh looks like somebody else answered in the chat though so um so thank you for uh for answering that um jpgames asks what's your favorite musical actor group uh i don't know if i could do a favorite i like a lot of different kinds of music i don't really know if i have like a favorite um yeah i don't know i'd have to think about it that's crazy that i never thought about that yeah i don't know what my favorite would be um mustafa asked if i stream about react.js yeah i do uh streams with react.js so um right now i'm more focusing on react native that's what i work with uh more frequently uh but i have done streams that are just normal react and i'll probably end up doing some normal react stuff as well daniel says i'm from brazil but i have a cousin that lives in ohio uh around avon oh okay that's awesome cool kevin's from california okay daniel says avon lake okay i'm not really sure where yvonne lake is so tell you truth i'm not originally from ohio i'm from west virginia uh so i don't like i've lived in oh i started to get a little bit of lag i don't know if it's from this running or the internet is messed up it looks like the stream is still okay so let me know if there's anything wrong with the stream i think we're good uh but my my mouse rose up for a minute there hey progress selim is uh from israel welcome someone else from cali too somewhere from vancouver canada that's great i love when we have people from all over for these streams uh vail valedark says how much have you researched about brain computer interfaces uh i haven't done a ton of research um myself i'm interested in it and you know i'll read articles when i see them but i haven't um i wouldn't say that i'm an expert you know at all my main work is in you know using javascript uh mostly react uh to build you know apps so uh i'm not really a brain computer interface researcher but i'm more of just kind of like uh do i'm into it as a hobby yeah like i i see it as something that could be really awesome and helpful for a lot of people that you know i'd like to do more with uh whenever i can kind of like just on the side uh bulat says my school is closed for a month gym is closed as well trying to learn react native with jessie awesome well uh hopefully you learned something um that stinks i know a lot of the gyms are closed i i like to go to the gym and work out that's going to be kind of hard i was uh i told my kids earlier that i'm gonna start uh using them as weights and doing squats with them or something because uh i can't go to the gym i think i don't know if all the gems around where i am are closed yet or not i don't know for sure uh but probably probably not a great idea to go to the gym although there are some gyms that are open 24 hours a day and i kind of wonder like if i went there like very very early in the morning you know could i get in and be like the only person in there you know that might work let's see has there been any progress on this thing let's i'm going to close out some of these screens here i'm gonna stop that and maybe try it again i probably should do an update on this when i can uh all right let's see what was it shift i think was shift r was that it see if it goes any faster this time we'll give it one more shot if that doesn't work then uh i don't know then maybe we'll um maybe we'll take a break from trying to get the mobile version running uh on this stream and and see if we can do something else i kind of want to wrap up soon anyway though so i think i've hit my hour my hour limit of what i wanted to do so we did get a little bit accomplished today let's see oh uh valvedark says you could try running it in the emulator first then on the phone i really i want to but i don't have the um uh the android emulator installed and i don't since i'm on a pc i can't i don't think i can run the ios i guess i could try but i'm pretty sure i can't yeah i need to have xcode um installed which i'm almost positive you can't run xcode on on windows hey did it work that time nice all right let's give this one more shot let's reopen expo oh i think it's working all right clearing the cash oh he's a good strategy [Laughter] let's see almost we're 99 99.4 [Laughter] sweet all right check it out if you can see this that's our our red background so i'm not um i'm not focused right now so i would need to actually log in on this device which oh my gosh that's going to be a pain let's see all right so we have it on this device let's just test out the uh the vibration feature just to see if we can get it working on a device now that we're actually hooked up so what i want to do is uh we've imported vibrate and what i think i'll do is say uh like when we press this button so the button right now runs in it so let's just use vibration dot vibrate and then we could just do a pattern number uh we can do a what's the pattern i'm gonna have to look again i don't remember exactly what it what it was oh there we go um oh i remember what what got us to this anyway is we had uh we needed to put something in our android file didn't we need to but i don't think we have it so this is our web package and what was it our android manifest.xml which i don't think we even have so let's see if we can get it to work without that and okay it looks like we can just put a a duration in just as a number and what is that i'm assuming that's milliseconds so we got like 10 seconds here so i'm going to save that okay cool i think that worked so i'm gonna press it cool i don't know if you can hear that but the phone is vibrating so our vibration works now unfortunately we got an error come up which i i think we got the error because we didn't actually fill in any of the fields so uh i have that ad name so we've got we got some sort of error but our vibration works that's really cool so we can get the device to vibrate so now it's just a matter of getting the device to vibrate when the state dips below a certain uh a certain amount right so that's what we want to happen now i'm assuming if if we actually built something for android like to release on you know the app store then we would probably get that android manifest file since we're running it through the expo app i think we don't have to bother with that right now so we'll just have to remember this when we go to bundle list i'd love to actually build this and put it on the app store for anybody else who has this headset um to uh to be able to use so that would be really cool also uh youtube analytics is telling me the the signal for my stream is not really good right now so let me know if you can still see what's happening on the stream all cool that's really cool now what we need to do though is let's see we need to figure out how to set that off based on let's see hmm let's get rid of that console log that keeps coming up in my my console so you don't want that so right now it's it's all based on the state what we could do is say maybe make a use effect let's make one down here so let's use use effect okay so use effect is a react hook that will allow us to do something anytime a piece of of data changes and in this case we're going to track that focus right so anytime focus changes we're going to do a check and we're going to say if focus keep doing this to me if focus um is greater than whoops i'm gonna say less than um we say 0.2 yeah you know i was gonna do this as a ternary but yeah actually we could do it as a we're using this statement it's a little bit more clear so focus is great less than point 0.2 then we're going to do vibrate or vibration dot vibrate and we'll just do we'll do 10 seconds else we're going to do vibration dot cancel and cancel looks like doesn't take anything um as an argument and it returns void so what this will do is uh it'll automatically cancel the vibration when we regain focus so right now we have nothing because i didn't log in so it's just continuing to vibrate for 10 seconds right so we got the vibration so basically we know that works now which is awesome uh what we should do though probably is is say um maybe we want to wrap this entire thing in another if statement that says uh if if we're actually you know logged in so i guess if notion is that what we want or do you want to say use it probably user is better so if we have a user then we want to you want to do this right so we don't want to do this we're logged in so let's save it and make sure okay so we save that now we're not getting a vibration this time that way that's good so we won't vibrate let's take out this vibrate on the on that button press okay cool and also let's say for the background color at least for the first screen i don't know that i really want it to start out as red i want it to be white so we may need to switch that up as well and maybe say um uh if focus is less than two or uh where's my or at why can't i find this oh or we have a or we don't have user there we go let's see if that fixes that i should say no i don't want if focus is and we have a user that's what we need all right so if the focus is less than 0.2 and we have a user which means like we're actually logged in then we want it to be red cool so that changes so you can see now like uh the screen is white so we're not logged in and the screen stays white so now only if you're logged in and the focus is less than 0.2 then it'll be red that's cool the red wasn't really a good look for the entire background to be read not that the uh you know the application is not like super good looking right now uh but functionally this is this is basically a complete application at this point which is pretty insane so uh that it only took us three three live streams to do this uh so i i have let me let me look this up on my other screen i um um i outlined what i wanted for the basic nvp uh meaning uh minimum viable product for this project i made a little outline for myself and i'm gonna try to i'm going to bring it up on the other screen to make sure we've met all the requirements so the requirements were um an android app that links to notion and alerts when focus falls below a certain level so that was it those are the base requirements so at this point if i could get this bundled for android then that will meet the the mvp and i think we can uh we can release that on the app store so i think on our next stream i'd love to actually do the the release to the app store if i can so what i'll need to do beforehand though is probably do a little bit of research to make sure i have everything good on my end i already have an account uh with the app store so i'm good there so before the next time i stream i'll do the research for that and then maybe if if you all think it would be you know good to do i'll try to do like the build and release to the app store um on the next stream so i don't know how long it takes to get approved to go in the app store but at least we can do the release there and just a heads up like the improvements that i have here in stages where the step two would be um release an ios version of the app which should be not that hard because the same version should work for ios the only thing i'll need to do is get an app developer account for ios and i may need to do that release on my on my mac that build and release or do some testing on my mac not on my pc uh the next step after that would be give users the ability to set the level of focus they want the alert to come in at which that should be a pretty easy um improvement to add after that i want to give options for the type of alert a user wants so i'm thinking maybe you know do you want vibration do you want the color to change do you want maybe some sort of sound after that make it available for android auto okay and that's kind of cool i think that'll that will actually be very useful to people uh and maybe preventing accidents um but i've never done anything with android auto before in terms of developing so we'll see how that goes after that i want to release the web app version uh which i get that's not going to be hard like we already have it running as a web app so i could maybe move that up and uh and do that a little bit sooner um yeah so i could probably change the order on that because that's not going to be very difficult especially with with how expo lets you run it as a web app and you know get that all up and running i could probably just release it uh at like github pages maybe um and and have that working uh and then the last step i had was see if we can make it into an alexa app which that's a big step right so that'll be um you know totally different code but i thought that might be kind of cool if you could do an alexa app uh that you could just have that running and connect up uh so that's that's my uh kind of my game plan for in my goals for uh for the focus it's been a long time since i've done an alex alexa app so a lot has probably changed since then since then i may have to do a little research on that uh before we do it but anyway uh that's cool i definitely want to get android studio running so i can um demo this in the uh the android emulator so you all can see i know it's it's just super hard to see it i wonder if i i think the light's messing it up if it's easy i think that actually makes it harder but like here's the app running on my phone i know it's it's very hard to see so like just so you can see it it actually is running i just need to log in the password and device id are super long so that's why i didn't try to log in yet but i am making an assumption that that actually works on the device um i'm assuming it does at this point but um all right cool so i'm gonna let's see i'm gonna take the device off and i'm gonna turn my device off for now i'm gonna finish answering some questions and then finish up i gotta i gotta help get the kids to bed they're probably waiting on me so uh i don't know if i'll be able to answer all the questions but i'll do my best and actually let's let's uh make this um let's send what we have up to github so you all can check out the code if you want so we're going to do a git add give it the am flag and feed feature let's see what did we add um vibrate on mobile it'll be ile when uh focus falls below 0.2 oh did i mess it up what did i do oh i didn't get get out it needs to be get commit there we go okay you push sweet all right so that code should be on github now the link to the github repo is in the description uh so you can check out that code if you want i saw a few you already looked like you checked you you checked it out and like forked it and started and stuff so um you know definitely feel free to open any issues or anything with that code or a pull request if you see something that's like um that you would like to contribute or some obvious problem with the code definitely i'm always open to uh to new suggestions uh and open to collaborate on things all right i'm gonna try to find where i left off in the chat all right so uh ty corty says uh what's the interface between your brain and the device how do you control it um the um it's uh i'm assuming it's the you're talking about this notion headset uh for now for what we're doing we um it just tracks the gamma waves that your brain is is putting off uh and that tells you your level of focus there's a lot of other cool stuff we can do with it which we will do uh i hope to make other apps that will allow you to think of doing an action and then make things happen in the app or on other internet of things devices so uh i hope to make that happen this is kind of my first idea for an app if i can get this working i'm gonna move on to more challenging things maybe some some more fun stuff let's see okay uh beverly says we had a question earlier about a python question about whether an api and a module were like python modules beverly says uh that modules in python are more equivalent to libraries so uh that's what i thought uh but i wasn't you know obviously i don't have enough experience with python to really say for sure so i didn't want to say anything um but yeah that's so um in in python lingo i guess we would modules are what we would call libraries in javascript okay ty corty is like i would like to learn more about your project like papers etc i would like to make a thesis on brain computer interfaces could you help okay um i would check out check out the uh neurosci website um it's neurocity dot let me let me put the link in the chat it's neurocity.co and see if you can get like the contact info or you know twitter or something i'm putting that in the chat right now uh contact the people at nerocity and see if they have any more data for you because you know they're the ones that are really working on the brain computer interface side of things and we'll have way more knowledge than i will about it they might be able to help you out with more of the technical info ruben says react native or flutter we had a question like this on the last stream i have not used flutter so i don't think i can give a good um a good answer to that question okay so i mean i use react native it works for what what i do um but maybe for you know for other teams with different skill sets uh you know maybe maybe flutter would be the better choice i'm just not sure well we've got everybody's kind of calling out where they're from so we got baltimore cali indianapolis hungary we were talking about gyms earlier um and uh mr coldwater canyon says gyms aren't all that sanitary yeah i imagine they're not you know you got a bunch of people sweating and stuff on the machine so um yeah probably not the best place to be you know during a virus outbreak uh that valdarg says how do you narrow down what you're meant to be focusing on just focus in general seems a bit vague to be useful yeah i'm like i said i'm not sure what the science is in terms of how the brain operates but um alex who was one of the creators of the generosity uh notion headset said the uh the gamma waves are an indicator of the level of focus your brain has so i don't know that it's a specific focus like you could tell exactly what you were focusing on but it's more a general level of focus uh so yeah i i mean i'd love to see when you know get this up and running and really test it out on a variety of different things that i'm doing and see you know how it works if it is specific enough to be useful you know or not and someone says i need to learn this i'm using cordova to build web apps and run them on android yeah i i i messed around with cordovia a little bit back in the day i do find react native to be a bit easier but i i do use react a lot so it is easier for me uh if if you didn't know that much about react then cordova might be a little easier to go but in general i think um like i haven't used any of the newer versions of cordova but in general i believe that uh react native um is kind of a better way to go for most use cases let's see uh valedor says okay this is a good point basically the point is you know if you're driving and you're trying to measure focus so you should be driving on the road what if you have a lot of focus on something else instead of driving the app would still you know would the app still register that as focus and not warn you i don't know i really need to test that uh so a lot of this stuff i i kind of wondered about as well like will this really provide a you know good thing in terms of focus so i um in terms of like measuring what you really want to focus on so i just need to test it out and see how useful it is i had a question what should this app do after it is finished it should warn you whenever your levels of focus have dropped below a certain threshold let's see scott says vs code update available i know there's there's an update available i usually stay updated um you know like every time it comes up but the last two days i've opened up vs code right before the live stream and i didn't want to do the update then because i needed to stream so i just put it off till later uh we got hi from australia uh hi from india awesome um carlos says is there any way to develop django web applications with a 32bit architecture system i i have no idea i've never done anything with django so so i don't know if anybody knows anything about django please let us know in the chat it says hello from bangladesh awesome welcome kev kevin has said hello from so many different places in the chat i'm not sure where kevin is really from at this point uh greetings from poland how's it going all right cool i um oh carla says hi from venezuela awesome hey i'm gonna um wrap this up so i've gone over by 30 minutes what i wanted to go over so i definitely got to get help the kids get ready for bed uh at this point thank you all so much for watching i'm really excited you know we pretty much we we have this working the next step is just to build it and release it to the app store probably want to make it look a little bit nicer first the ui is not not great at this point so maybe we'll work on that as well for the next stream but uh it was a good stream i um a lot of troubleshooting just remember uh if if your um metro bundler is not working correctly try clearing the cache and that should work that that worked uh for us and it's worked for me in the past as well uh now that i think about it that's always a good thing to try um so uh i don't know when i'll stream again tomorrow be a little bit busier i'll be back to work uh but i i want to try to at the very least maybe stream you know at the latest some point you know next week uh next weekend hopefully i can get a stream in there before then though because i'm getting really excited because we're really close to actually launching uh this app uh which that'll be fun it would be my first app that i've actually decided to put on the app store i usually never get to that point i just build something and play with it a little bit and then just don't do anything with it so um anyway everyone you know everybody be safe out there uh don't take any uh unnecessary risks you know uh try to help each other out i know you know some depending on where you're from you know things are pretty rough right now but uh thanks for joining me and uh stay safe i know a lot of people at home so i'm gonna do my best to try to stream a little bit more and maybe uh it'll make things a little bit easier for everybody that's that's stuck at home um yeah but until next time uh have a great rest of your weekend have a great week and i'll see you later
