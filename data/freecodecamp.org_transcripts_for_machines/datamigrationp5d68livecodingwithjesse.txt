hey everyone welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to migrate some more data so a little while ago we had a similar stream uh so the plan is i have a spreadsheet and each row in the spreadsheet represents a piece of data that we'd like to migrate from a sql server database to a mysql database and to get from one database to the other we're using two tools to help us out a little node script so node.js is it's a way to run javascript server side and then we're also using the wordpress rest api to get the data the rest of the way so node pulls the data out of the sql server database and then the wordpress api puts the data into the my sql database i might mess that up so sql server to my sequel but um that's the plan i'm i'm gonna win you ahead of time it's not the most exciting thing in the world but uh i think it's a an okay example of some things that may have to happen when you're migrating from an old system to a new system and you can't just write one script and have everything come over it just doesn't work like that all the time so we're gonna have to kind of pick through the data try to bring it over and in as big a chunks as we possibly can but we still need to bring it over in a way that we're going to be able to make sense of it all and and use it so we're going to switch back and forth between the the data table we're gonna modify our our node script uh and run it and then we're also gonna check on this is a website uh that we're ultimately building here so we're going to check on the old version of the website to try to figure out like is this data even live do we need it um and if it's still there in the website like what's the context of this data to give us a better idea of where we should put it in the new database so that's the plan my wife is messaging me uh on my other screen and um she's doing some coding she's doing the udacity frontend nanodegree so she's messed she's sending me screenshots of her code and messaging me she must not know i'm streaming all right so let me switch over to my screen here you can see this is what i was working on right before i started let me adjust this a little bit okay um i'm gonna check the live chat and then we'll get started hey everyone um all right cool looks like you're talking about a race that happened uh this weekend um oh matthew asked if she started the memory project yet she's on the memory project right now that's the one she's working on so um she's working on some some click handlers for the cards and that was it actually works for her in codepen but not locally on her machine so anyway uh i think she'll probably be able to figure it out and uh she's been doing a pretty good job of getting getting through it okay so i brought over here let me start my pomodoro session i'm gonna do 25 minutes of coding in this case data migration and then five minutes a question and answer and we're going to go back and forth i do have a meeting in less than an hour and a half now so if we get a ton of questions i may not be able to answer them all but we're well within our normal time range here of around an hour for a stream uh someone asked for the website for this pomodoro timer so i'm going to copy and paste it into the chat here if you click it and it doesn't work then please try copying and pasting it all right so i i found some data here's the data that i found here i did this is really small i kind of need to keep it small to be able to see the range but i'm i'm just going to explain a little bit about what's going on here i found some data here that has to do with um residence life so like the dorm rooms on campus where students live and things like that so i assume you know this may be able to be like its own section its own post type in the in the wordpress and in the database or maybe we can just tag it in with with something else but i need to know what category this goes in so that's why i i just searched for it here and i could see hey this is residence life so let's click it and see all right what section does this fall under so it actually looks like uh this is kind of its own section it it's uh like a top level here so it's dot edu slash residence life so um it we may be able to put this in its own section uh just want to see if we have it if it's even a kind of a top level link here because i'm not sure where it's linked from um i'm guessing it would be student life where it's linked from so i'm clicking in here if you know i might be able to put it under the student life like in the section with all that data that we brought over residence life does that guy take us to the same spot oh it does it does interesting maybe we'll do that then this would be a little bit easier uh than making a completely new new post type uh so what we'll do is we already have a section for stuff like this under student life and let me let me pull up the wordpress did i make this yeah i think this is it all right so we have a wordpress installation we've been putting all this data into and we can see i will make this a bit bigger for you all to see so we have all these different data types to keep things straight for us here and we need to find the one that's student life now the users who are going to be in charge of editing this very few users are going to see all of this it's it's a bit much right so most people only see maybe one or two types so it'll be much cleaner easier to edit i thought i had student life stuff student profile pages where we had student life pages there we are okay so we already have a bunch of student life pages and wow we we have quite a few we have three pages of student life pages looks like these are a lot of the student organizations okay wonderful i think this will fit well in there so here's what we need to do we need a few pieces of of information in order to make this script work so we need to know what the folder id is that this data lives in and we also need to know what the post type the slug is right for so it's like a unique identifier for that post type in this case it's going to be i student life page i believe it will be student life pages i think that's it we'll find out if i run it and it doesn't work then i'll know that's the wrong one and uh we need this id is 486. so let's plug in 486 we're going to save that uh quickly i'll just go over this uh basically we're using uh the sqlize to all right this doesn't we're all importing the stuff right so this doesn't come with um node.js by default right uh so we're using sqlize to help us interact with a sql database a little bit easier right and then we have our our sql query if it's a little bit different than you're used to uh sql has kind of different flavors depending on the type of sql database so a query for my sql may look slightly different than sql server but you can kind of figure out what's going on if you are familiar with sql basically we're just getting a little bit of we're specifying um what data we want from from where we want it so from what section of the database we wanted and this data length greater than zero just means i don't even want to bother pulling in any data that is is empty right it doesn't have any content at all right and in our case our contents html markup if it doesn't have markup i don't really want it and that's pretty much it then down here we're basically taking that data we're getting and we are creating posts in wordpress and then having them put into my sql database um and we're taking the the data that has a certain name in the mysql database and we're giving it a name that is more appropriate or i'm sorry in our sql server database we're giving it a name that's more appropriate for wordpress and my sequel and in fact i do want to get rid of this that was uh for a previous thing we were working on all right great that that looks uh oops accidentally hit a key that looks perfect let's now run this so we need to run um migrate.js all right it's doing something and let's stop that and we're going to check to to make sure that these got inserted so right now we have 50 items if i refresh and it's more than 50 then it works nope it didn't work all right so why did it not work probably because i put in the wrong post type so student life pages what did i put in wrong all right let's check what the post type is you know actually it may tell it may tell me here in the slug student life pages hmm that looks right so what did i do studnt live pages oh you know what i don't think it's plural anything it needs to be singular student life page right because each one of these is a post so i'm creating a new student life page that's that's the problem all right now let's check there we go now we have 67 items so we went from 50 to 67 that's our extra 17 items that we just added okay and so here we go these uh this it's it's supposed to be short for assisi heights so definitely gonna change that title before it shows up in uh anyone's search but uh that's uh that's basically the process that we go through now i can go in here i have all these selected and i'm going to remove it from the table don't worry though i have a copy of this this spreadsheet in case i accidentally remove stuff that i shouldn't but for this one trying to get rid of everything as soon as we pull it over and that way just visually it'll be very easy for me to see the progress uh and the rows go down and down and down okay i do i see a few questions in the chat so um if if any of you are new uh please be patient i'll i have a timer on right now when the timer goes off then i will go back to the chat and answer your questions okay here we we have some more things here i'm going to try to find something that doesn't require me to create a custom post type ah let's see these look like people lots of people and they don't work here are they alumni are they speakers yeah i don't think i think these may have been speakers distinguished speakers series okay i'm not sure where i want to put that right now and i know you probably can't see how small this is so i'm trying to read it out a bit um i can delete this some of these are just tiny they're just such tiny fragments of pieces of data we just don't need them let's see okay these look like residence halls residence life staff okay um is this what contact information or just general information so i think this can go in the same spot that we wanted in let's just verify uh and see here do we have information about residence halls here residence life residence halls yep so that's where these are each one of these residence halls will have its own page and some info and i believe that's where this is coming from okay great uh yeah so let's take this and grab this data and since we're going to send it to the same place all we need to do is change that folder id so this will be 537 so let's go up in here five three seven we'll save it nothing else needs to change and we'll run this again oh 20 of them the more i can get in per query the better once i did a query and we got like i don't know around 500 at once and that was that was awesome i think that was the biggest one that i've done so far all right great so we have those uh we should i know this will work but it's always good to verify uh not great to just you know get ahead of it yep now we're up to 87 items wonderful and so now we can remove these let's see yeah we can remove these from here i um i was not employed here at this university whenever uh the old site was built so i'm learning so much about the website now as i go through and get all this content there were like whole sections that i didn't even know existed uh let's see it looks like these are some more uh this these are more information are these guys all right these are just image galleries i'm gonna bring these over i'm not exactly sure we'll keep them i know some of the older images aren't great quality so we may want to replace them but uh better just to bring it over uh and this is three 539 is the section 539 so let's let's change that over here um 537. i brought 537 530 it looks like 536 could come over too i think i'll bring over 536 as well so let's do 539 save that run it and i'll do 536 as well save that run it wonderful we'll verify 97 items great now we can just delete all of this wonderful okay so this is the pattern this is what i i do when i'm on campus uh so usually i'm on campus two days a week in my office my pattern of working for the last few weeks has been try to squeeze in all my meetings into those two days a week so that takes up a lot of my time uh and then when i'm not doing that or taking care of like other tasks like paperwork and things that i usually only do in the office i'm doing this over and over again so i'm almost through i'm getting pretty happy about that so it probably doesn't really make for a great live stream to do this i hope you know i don't know maybe you get just kind of an appreciation for a way that you could handle something like this um but i'll do let me see what time it is all right so i'll do this for a few more minutes uh and then i'll see what kind of questions we have and then we'll go from there and you all let me know if you really want to see any more of this or you'd rather me get kind of go to questions keep it a shorter stream uh i would love i'd like right now to find some more student life things and just try to like chunk it together so we don't have to change every uh you know both pieces of data but uh i'm also not going to spend a bunch of time scrolling through here to try to find some data so let's see we have a baccalaureate 2015 image gallery i don't think we need that these are old 2015 and uh 2017 2015. so it looks like we have some things in here that we just we don't need to uh bring over these are all old so let's get rid of them this is 2016 2016 2014. actually let me yeah these are all together here for sure commencement general info yeah let's get rid of that commencement information yeah i don't need that because that's oops there we go yeah let's delete that um these conferences i'm not sure if they if they want these conferences like the details from past conferences or not maybe i'll just leave them for now and i'll ask my boss about it okay these all right so i recognize some of these names as people that work here okay i don't really want to try to sort out where all these people work and get them in the right spots so let's just keep on going oh conspiracy theories that sounds like a cool course that's crazy that's actually a course um let me see uh it's possible that these courses what happened i lost it um it's possible that those courses might be old and we can get rid of them oh you know what these are a bunch of old events as well i i don't know if the theater department would want to keep some old events uh just for students prospective students to see so maybe we'll i'll ask about those as well let's see all right looks like i can remove some of these two this makes me happy when i can just get rid of stuff because we're not going to bring it over uh let's see four six seven yeah all of these looks like they are uh listings for events that have happened at least a year ago get rid of it all i'm sure it doesn't matter to you and it seems boring but it feels amazing when i can just get rid of those because that means i don't even i don't have to do anything i don't have to create post types i don't have to migrate the data like it's just like hey it's it's done uh okay great you know maybe i might make this just a bit bigger because i know it's going to be hard for you all to see and it's most definitely um difficult for me to see let's see if i can just make this bigger in bulk come on let's get a 16. yay that's so much bigger and let me get a font that i like better you know what we we use roboto for everything we may as well use it for our spreadsheets right uh okay cool a little bit better i can still see all the data that i need so this is fine um so here we are academic organizations student clubs pilgrimage so this 469 looks like this could also go in that student life so let's let's pull that in uh six nine so 469 we're going to save that run it and verify so we're going to from 97 it should say 99 yep 99 awesome and this isn't the end of it like after i would do this i would then have to go in and make sure like are the titles okay you know a lot of the titles contain abbreviations and things that nobody's gonna understand so i gotta clean up the titles gotta make sure the slugs for the post types are uh are something that we can actually work with uh and fit nicely in a url uh sometimes one there'll be multiple posts and really we could condense it down into one so there's a lot of cleanup that happens as well afterwards this is just kind of the first step and let's see all right counseling looks like we got a nice chunk of data here for counseling health center all right let's do that i do you know what i i want to see counseling service i want to see what part of the website this is on so let's check the website again um i gotta go to the search i can never remember how to spell accounts cou and sel counseling service i just i don't want to get the wrong info because we have a counseling program where we teach people about counseling but we also have counseling services there we go wellness center my motherinlaw is actually a counselor here at the same university as i am counseling service is under wellness center okay and i bet the wellness center pages are under student life let's see is like health services counseling services yeah it's under student life so let's throw it let's throw it in there with student life 481 is what we want 481 and let's migrate it down the road if we ever you know end up seeing like wow this this post type has way too many posts in it it's huge we can always break it out into into separate ones but right we don't want to optimize too much early right it's it can be at you know kind of a waste of time to do it too early and it may not even be necessary at all you know ever so we want to try to avoid that if we can so let's double check we'll verify and my timer is almost up so we'll do some question and answer here in just a few seconds all right awesome so that worked and the last thing we want to do before we forget is remove all of these posts that were um in that folder with the id of 481 all right delete great okay so i'm gonna set a five minute timer uh but i'm not sure i'm gonna go back and do another pomodoro session of just data migration you all let me know like how valuable this is to you i kind of i have to do this it's getting down like i can't put this off any longer i got to get the rest of the data in so i really need to make sure i get this done otherwise i would probably be streaming me doing something else maybe a little bit more fun uh so if you have a question please put it in the live chat now i just want to mention everyone uh i'm gonna go to the revolution conference in virginia beach uh later this week so i'll stream probably tomorrow if i can but then i i most likely will not be able to stream the rest of the week so wednesday thursday friday no streams if for some reason like maybe i can find some really good internet when i'm there then maybe i can do a stream but i i don't know beforehand so i can't really guarantee anything if anybody is in the virginia beach area and uh is either going to the conference that you know come come find me let me know that'd be awesome or if you're just in the area even if you're not going to the conference uh if you if you'd like to hang out or something let me know uh all right so i started i'm starting right at the top of the live chat i'm just going to scroll down try to answer the questions as they came in phoenix says hey hey how's it going phoenix good to see you see ezekiel says everyone something is going on with me okay ezekiel what's up what's going on all right teresa says thanks was it theresa that asks yeah all right theresa asked for the website though is it teresa am i pronouncing that right if not please let me know but anyway teresa you're welcome abdul aziz is here how's it going thanks for watching let's see her mommy says hi how's it going uh not bad no i'm i'm starting to get a little nervous and um like like i don't know nervous slash excited about launching the site so um that's how it's going for me how are you doing hey ann is here hey anna how's it going uh chris asked if i've tried out css grid yet i've done really minimal work with css grid so i don't honestly at this point my knowledge of css grade is so little like i i don't even want to try to explain anything about it to anyone yet because i i would probably mess it up but it's something i really do want to learn more about um there's so many tutorials and things that i'd like to do right now i just like since it's getting close to launch time for the site i'm everything is focused on that so i've i haven't even been like doing my usual i usually try to learn new things as i'm working like even if it's just a half hour a day but i've even cut that out so uh hopefully afterwards uh after it launches uh on june 4th hopefully i'll have a little bit more time for learning uh christian says jesse it is nice to see the real work you do also all right cool yeah i mean pretty much everything i stream is i mean it is things that i'm doing but i try to save the things that i think will be most exciting or uh like informative or helpful for you all uh so but i guess there's value in showing kind of like the tedious boring stuff sometimes too all right john's here he says hail uh of the finer repetitive details the doing is not so pretty the end product is the gem yeah i hope uh swadisi says good luck for that i i guess you're talking about my trip so thanks austin says i live in virginia beach come use my internet oh awesome awesome uh austin like if if you want i mean i you don't have to let me use your internet but if you're going to be in virginia beach if you're interested in trying like meeting up getting a coffee or something at some point um let me know uh you can i think my link to my twitter is in the description you know you can dm me if you want or whatever um you know so that that might be kind of cool if we could find a coffee shop that has decent wifi we might be able to do a little stream or something i don't know sometimes coffee shops aren't great for a stream if there's a lot of people the background noise is insane but um anyway i i'm down to hang out i don't know how much time i'll have because it will be conference stuff all the time but uh i'll i will try to work it out all right we have greetings from ukraine and you know let me grab uh that's in um cyrillic but i'm gonna use google translate to figure out what that is ivan okay so ivan says greetings from ukraine greetings ivan thank you and thanks for watching uh and it says any news um i guess if i'm assuming you were here when i talked about the conference i'm going to so i won't repeat that but other than that i don't think any news not really i i mentioned before i've been on a diet and i've been trying to exercise and that's going well i'm continuing to lose weight so i'm happy about that i have a lot more energy yeah so that's that's pretty good all right how many says i'm doing fine thanks i have started learning es6 uh or is it still early um i'm not i'm not here are you asking me if i started learning es6 or if you should start learning es6 uh i guess i can answer both so i do know quite a bit of es6 uh i don't i don't really use all of es6 all the time so i you forget what you don't use right but um you know there are some parts of es6 that i use like every day like arrow functions oh how memes is both of us okay cool yeah like i mean even especially when we're doing react like we're using arrow functions all the time uh i believe like map filter sort those things i think are es6 uh template literals love template literal syntax use that a lot let cons those are es6 uh so yeah so i mean there is a good chunk of es6 that you know i we use all the time um but there are certainly some things that you know we don't use trying what else um object destructuring so i mean there's their thing i think it's getting to the point now where people could potentially be using es6 and not even realize that it's es6 because it's just getting so um kind of blended in with what people are doing tutorials are using it so which is good right i mean we're already on es8 es6 been around for a while like i i think it will start to get even more and more like normal browser support a lot of it now so um anyway i i love uh all the parts of es6 that i use frequently are just there's just very helpful if you're not sure what es6 is it's also called es2015 there are some new features that were added to the javascript language um way back in uh like 2015 i don't know exactly when they were added but around there and uh you know with with transpilers you know people started using them before they were even official um so anyway that's what we talked about when we're saying yes es6 and yes 2015. so if you want to know what those what exactly was added you know try searching es6 uh i you should be able to find something probably on that first page of results that'll go through it uh let's see phoenix says hey jesse just wanted to ask what average salary can a guy in india expect for remote work in u.s let's consider a fulltime frontend developer job all right well that's it's going to be a little bit hard for me to answer that because you know certainly i would think like a com companies here in the united states uh when they look at how to to compensate a remote worker what they usually do at least here in the united states is they say okay what is a fair wage for where that person lives so for instance uh in the united states in san francisco cost of living is really really high like amazingly high it's just astounding to me how much you know uh for instance like houses cost out there so let's just say i'm i'm just kind of making these numbers up let's just say the average frontend developer in san francisco makes 150 000 a year if i were to get a job with a company but stay where i'm at and work remotely even if that company's headquartered in san francisco they're going to look at my market and they're going to say wow um that's a really economically depressed area you can make a living off you know much les excuse me much it takes much less to you know raise a family and get a house and everything where i'm at so they made say like okay we're going to pay you 80 000 a year um so you got to take that into consideration so i don't know what they would do they might take into account your standard of living i would imagine you could probably end up getting a little bit more um you know a company i think that's headquartered in an expensive area is still most likely going to be a bit more willing to pay more because they're used to paying more for you know their employees where they're at but in terms of giving a number i don't really know i know um like in in pittsburgh the closest big city to me is pittsburgh and i know in pittsburgh for um like uh the front end full stack um engineer you're looking at like minimum basically like i i would never take a job for less than like 75 000 a year in pittsburgh anything below that it's kind of like i just wonder if the company is really willing to put forth resources to make a good product if that's what they're willing they either one like have no idea what developers are worth um or which is bad or two they they don't care enough or don't have enough money to really put into a project to make it succeed so either way i don't really want to be working there uh so i my bare minimum would be like 75 000 a year and um then i would consider something like in the 90s would be a good offer uh you know so anything over 90 000 would what i would consider to be a really good offer and so the kind of the midrange would be between 75 and 90. uh and that's u.s dollars per year and if we're talking so that's pittsburgh if we're talking san francisco i don't know add like 30 000 on to those figures because it's it's much more expensive new york's pretty expensive uh san francisco as far as i know is the most expensive place in the u.s um new york's also up there as being pretty expensive as well i'm not sure how to pronounce that please correct me uh if i'm pronouncing it wrong but anyway they say hey i'm learning i'm new to learning node i want to show data from the console to web page using body parser but i can't hmm all right so let me check my time see how i can answer this let's tell you truth i'm not sure right off the bat with the answer the only time i use body parser is uh when i'm grabbing data from um an html form and i want to do things with that data in node um so i've never dealt with that specific use case i'm trying to uh i'm trying to get some resources i could uh maybe point you to i'm not sure if anybody in here has worked with something similar a node please let us know in the live chat uh otherwise i'm gonna try to keep thinking of it if i could think of something before the stream's over i would definitely mention it but like i said i i haven't dealt with a specific situation so i'm not i'm not exactly sure okay how many says i'm doing a course on udemy that focuses a lot on es6 okay so that was why the the other question with the es6 uh it says it's called mobile web specialists and focuses also on service workers all right cool service workers are amazing um we're working with service workers in this project as well but a lot of it is set up behind the scenes already by uh by next js which we're using so we don't have to directly deal with them but it it a service worker can sit between the client and the server and intercept network data and do things with it so it could essentially it could cache data and then the client uh client's network call goes out like normal but it doesn't go any further because the service worker will say oh they want this data we already have a cache just send it back and then you have like zero second load times because the data is right there because the service worker actually lives in the browser right so it doesn't have to go anywhere it doesn't even have to leave the browser so really cool um really cool things you can also do things like um calculations that would normally like crush uh your uh performance like in the dom you know scrolling and if you make everything all janky you could offload it to a service worker do all the calculations there and not uh mess up uh you know your flow um basically it wouldn't render block at all it wouldn't block the normal stuff that needs to happen on the page so that would that'd be pretty cool if you were going to do like i don't know like image processing somebody uploads an image you want to do some really like uh intense intent uh resource intensive things to it uh handle that in a service worker and then the user can still scroll around your page while that's doing its thing okay nikki says es6 is the language itself now meaning javascript it's in the official spec when learning javascript you also learn es6 now automatically unless you're learning old material okay that's that's pretty cool i didn't even think about that but yeah i mean when i went through the basic tutorials of javascript es6 was still um well early on it wasn't out yet and then later on it was still really kind of new so you didn't it just wasn't there uh but that's cool that it's a part of the tutorials now i mean that's i think as it should be right because there are some things that were a lot harder to do before es6 uh and i i don't see that much value in making a new uh you know learner do it the harder way when you know not even the advanced people are doing it like that anymore uh so yeah i i think that's good that they're teaching it like that um ivan says asks if i'm using something else other than react in the front end or if i now i mean i've been using react for most of the projects uh it's it's not that i have anything against the other stuff it's just um i'm kind of taking the approach right now that i'd rather get really good at one thing than try to know a little bit about all the things um so i i have to give up on some things that i think are really cool but it's it's for the sake of trying to make ultimately a better product so i've chosen react and so for the time being i'm pretty much just building things in react and if i'm not using react that means it's simple enough that i can just build it with just plain javascript um yeah so that's where i'm at right now we do have some other videos on the free code camp channel using things like vue and angular so you could check the the backlog of videos and uh and see some other things as well so we're not we're not like just just react but for me personally i'm using a lot of react i've been asked if i'm the creator of free code camp no uh so quincy uh i y'all know i don't know if you all know quincy um so quincy created uh free code camp he is the founder and he is um the i don't know what is his title president i'm not let me look him up on twitter to see what his title is because i'm not sure quincy's so humble his twitter says teacher at free code cam he's in charge of it all so um anyway quincy larson uh is who you want so if you want to follow him on twitter it's at aussia ossia uh anyway he's very very awesome guy um so yeah he's the one that started i my involvement with free code camp is pretty limited to these live streams on youtube i've talked with some of the other people from free code camp and had some like video chats and things but uh there are a ton of other people that work on various areas of free code camp so uh there's a lot of people behind the scenes that nobody even knows about that are making this happen and uh working for free too i mean almost all the stuff that gets done on free code camp is is from volunteer time let's see um ed edison so edi cson says hi there i'm 28 am i too old to be a programmer what do you think uh no definitely not too old uh not so you're never too old to be a programmer i've seen stories of people a lot older switching careers learning how to become a programmer and get having successful programming careers so i am 32 years old uh i taught high school for for a little while in my mid20s and um then i switched into programming in my late 20s so i had i learned a little bit before that but i really kind of got serious about it and switched into it late 20s and i'm employed now as a fulltime frontend developer uh i i don't know how successful you would consider me but i make enough money to support my family and pay my bills uh so um i mean i have four kids i have a wife so i i'd say that's uh you know it's pretty successful right i mean i'm not um not making millions or anything but i certainly can support myself and my family so yeah 28 definitely not too old let's see uh mert says hi says i love free code cam awesome awesome thank you i love it too that's why i do this stuff uh so i mean i do have my own youtube channel i do some videos on there but as you all know like the the majority of my hours spent doing youtube software are spent with free code camp um so i think it's i think it's something special i think it helps people uh edison says i studied three years in my country but then i came to the us and i had been working uh as a barber uh i love these two professions oh cool i have a lot of family members that are are barbers and hairdressers actually so i've got one uncle two great uncles and two cousins first cousins that are all barbers or and or hairdressers so uh definitely appreciate uh what it takes to do that job all right uh francis says have you tried php what can you say about it i have tried php uh and for this project in particular i've done a little php so all those custom post types you saw in in wordpress i created a plugin in php that creates those and some custom taxonomies as well so i i don't have a lot to say about php i can do a little bit when i need to in php it's not my preferred language but i mean like any language i think whatever language you work with the most is usually the one you're most comfortable with so i'm not that comfortable with it because i don't do that much um and i think you know from most languages can do most things right uh most your major languages so um it seems like the strengths and weaknesses of those languages are mostly felt kind of at the extremes uh where like you really need performance uh and then you you could start to see some differences um but for most things i think you know php is is as good as you know as good as anything else for me personally if i was getting into web development which i am in it now but you know if i was trying to pick you know as a beginner and trying to pick what to learn i personally would go with full stack javascript because my view on it is you only have so many you know hours in the day to learn um why not learn one language and be able to do two things with it right front end and back end then learn two different languages and since you got to know javascript for web development anyway why not just stick with it so and that's nothing against php uh it's just kind of a being really practical about it and trying to be as efficient as possible with my learning but if you do want to work with anything like wordpress which a ton of websites run on wordpress so there's definitely a market there then you're probably going to want to know php because that's what it's built on uh also if you want to work on drupal or joomla which are not as popular as wordpress but you still see them a lot uh those also run off php so it's definitely still valuable to learn let's see lawrence says uh do you know scratch and is it good oh yeah scratch um for those who don't know scratches it's like a visual programming language i believe it was developed at mit uh mainly to help teach kids programming so you have these tiny little colored blocks that represent different actions you can take in code so you have one for like a for loop um you have ones that represent variables um like iterators like you know different basic things uh while loops and you just click and drag the blocks over to where your code lives and um so you build the code like that instead of typing it out you click and drag these different colors so it's it's kind of easier for kids with little fingers you know and not quite uh don't really have the dexterity yet for a lot of typing um or the spelling skills really can still make some cool things in scratch and um there have been some people to do some pretty advanced things in scratch like usually like games and things so it's um i mean i i wouldn't do like a real project in scratch for a client or anything it's not a programming language like that but it's it's just another layer of abstraction uh geared towards making programming easier for uh for children so uh if you're just starting out starting with scratch is not a bad idea even if you're older i know harvard's computer science 50 course starts you out in scratch the first assignment for that course is scratch and that course is geared towards people who are 18 19 20 like around that age range so um scratch is just a cool place to start to get an understanding of what are loops what are if statements and things like that without having to get having to get bogged down by all this syntax right so definitely awesome for kids but also awesome for adults who are just starting out in programming and it's just kind of fun right it's like if you just want to mess around and do something scratch is fun hammy says it's really good to see these people with different cultures gathered together by enthusiasm for coding um yeah definitely definitely i i know i'm i've talked about this before i'm sure but uh i think i think that there's really something special going on here with free code camp and with these live streams um in that like there's there's a community that's grown so like not everybody attends every live stream and that's fine because everybody has their own lives and priorities and i you know that's that's totally fine but like you know in general there's quite there are quite a few people who are regulars you know who you see you know from time to time in here that start to know each other that even start to work on projects together outside of this live stream that help each other out and that's awesome you know people have come into the chat and watched the streams and just been learning and then they've gone on interviews and then they've gotten job offers and started working and have kind of checked in throughout this whole process and updated us in in the chat so um i think that's cool people have shared like i i know i share a lot of my struggles with um uh with mental health and you know even physical health and things uh and i know some of you have shared as well so i and i know there are people from everywhere um a lot of different countries different cultures different uh religions different you know everything that you can be that's different from each other i i think we've seen it here and we all get along i mean i i almost never have to block someone or delete a comment or anything i i think it's i think it's amazing right there's a lot of haters on the internet and a lot of trolls but they don't they're not here they're not here they're good people here you are good people so um i appreciate that and it makes me want to keep doing this uh it makes me want to learn more so that this is useful for you all uh and and i can keep doing this so anyway anyway i'll keep going i'm not gonna dwell on it too much i just i i really appreciate this this community let's see um leandro says hi i'm uh from brazil i love free code cam awesome awesome uh that's cool they said free code camp is a huge thing we're doing a lot of stuff i'm just a very small part of that santiago says greetings from venezuela awesome thanks for watching my mommy says in the field of coding the journey of knowledge just never ends so true that's what i love about it uh phoenix says also uh you know right that hayley jones uh on twitter will put up her portfolio tomorrow oh okay awesome yeah i do i follow haley jones on twitter so really cool uh lauren says thanks for the answer but scratch is a good way to begin uh but is scratch a good way to begin javascript because uh i do it for two years now i don't really know two years i'm not sure if that's years or not but i don't really know how to go from scratch to java i did download grasshopper the new learn app i haven't had a chance to try grasshopper yet and by grasshopper that is the new app from google that helps you learn javascript correct um somebody let me know if i'm wrong on that uh i haven't tried it yet like i mentioned earlier i've just been kind of um in in rush mode here for this website launch so i haven't done anything on the side but i'd love to try it i think i've heard a lot of good things about it though so i think that may be a good way to go to get into javascript also you go through the free code camp curriculum so if you go to freecodecamp.org and you start it on that it'll start you out with html and css but then it'll ease you into javascript so that's a great way to learn as well it's not the only resource there are a lot of other resources out there but it's one that i myself went through i didn't finish all the free code camp but i did go through a bit of it and it definitely helped um lauren says uh i'm from belgium awesome awesome nikki's in belgium too uh great i love it i love having people from all over now mimi says have to go now happy coding hey see ya mommy have a great day glad you could join us all right and i believe that that's it that's uh that's the end of the live chat so uh unless someone sneaks another question in there in the next uh you know 30 seconds or so i think we're going to wrap things up uh thank you all so much for watching i know it was a little bit uh maybe boring with the data stuff so uh hopefully i won't need to do any more streams with that and i'll get all this finished soon uh but anyway um like i mentioned earlier i will try my best to stream tomorrow but then the rest of the week after that i will be at a conference probably won't be able to stream and um let me know if you're in virginia beach uh and so maybe we could you know hang out or something uh wednesday thursday friday of this week i'll be i'll be in virginia beach so at the revolution conference so um i guess i'll see y'all tomorrow and until then have a great day
