this week i'm working on the top layer of logic in the recipe box i started with routine in order to do it i installed react router and history later i imported router route index route and hash history appropriately to the files next i named the path and the components and that will be loaded in a given path the index route in my case is home page so component called home the next step this week was learning more about local storage i used it a few times for example in pomodoro clock but i had to come back to json stringify or jason pars because i didn't remember that the next step is uh the most tricky for me because it's the top level logic so the logic on the level of pages and connecting everything with local storage i want to start it with the free functions so saving the recipe to data storage loading a given recipe from data storage and retrieving all recipes getting all the recipes from data storage let's get back to work foreign so this week was difficult the project is quite hard because it's got a lot of components and i added also extra functionality but i don't manage however there are the moments where you are fed up that something doesn't go as you want and you have to consult it many times online check the stuff and stack overflow back free code asking questions to the stack overflow that really solve your problems knowing a lot learning fast but life isn't so easy and said that it's hard you develop so if it's too easy you don't develop that's why i think that it's all worth doing but but sometimes it's annoying that you don't know that something doesn't work again and you even don't get what's written in stack overflow life me this week in malaga snow and for malaga area this is a kind of money when it snows in spain in andalusia so in the south of spain it's really a problem because there's no central heating in the houses and floods and generally you have just some air conditioning or extra radiators that you have to buy fortunately i have air conditioning nice blanket and we bought some a theater however snow in malaga is something rare it wasn't snowing here for decades climate changes are real and global warming doesn't mean that it should be really hotter technology without clear thinking and global sustainable solutions wouldn't save the world it's the end of the week this is how it looks now this is the home page and with react i'm right now going to create a recipe view so on create page i can add tags i can add a photo and create right now ingredients instructions and i can save the recipe when the recipe is saved it's already in the local storage with the name tags image instructions and ingredients in code it looks like that so i created additional file logic.js in which i get at these free functions save recipe low recipe and recipe list which i use later in addition importing the function that i need from logic ds and i created the constructor uh and in the state i got an object with the key of name tags image ingredients and instructions i added the methods on title change on text change on image change and ingredients and an instruction change where where i catch the changes and save them to local storage it says that i introduced routine and thanks to this routine i can come from one page the other so for example this add button here goes to adding the recipe in home js i have used link that's the redirecting to edition and in main.js i added paths that is index route addition and details when i go to edition i go to edition.js and i'm here so i can see the addition mode which means that i'm here and this is the example how i connected everything with routine next week i will continue with the rest of the app because still it needs much much more wag keep on doing remember that we have one planet and one life see you next week you
