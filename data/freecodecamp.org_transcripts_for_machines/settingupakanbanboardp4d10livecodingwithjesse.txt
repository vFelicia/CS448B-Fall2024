hey everybody and welcome to live coding with Jesse sorry I started a few minutes later than scheduled I forgot to open up OBS which is my streaming software and so I went to start the stream and realized I didn't even have it open so I had to open it and put in the youtube code and at the same time I was having a debate on slack about Star Wars with a coworker so if anybody's a Star Wars fan you know how important that is so anyway I have we had a lot of news today so we've had a lot of pull requests I've set up what I think will be a helpful way to track our progress on this project and plan things out and then also I had a meeting this morning kind of a long meeting but the result was was pretty cool so I'm gonna share that with you because it's gonna be a big deal when it in terms of what we're gonna be working on on this dream you know really for the next year or more in developing so I don't think we'll be working on it every day for the next year or more but we're gonna it's going to be probably the most important project for at least the next year so let me let me get to it so I guess I'll just share with the project is first I don't want to keep you all in suspense and I'm pretty excited about it so I don't know exactly when we're gonna start on this but if you remember in projects was it maybe project 3 so we were working on the main website so let me hear that and so you all remember that we were working well those of you who watch the stream out a few weeks or so ago we were working on this probably remember there we go I'll bring this up so you remember one how slow the main website is that took forever all right and how outdated it is really cluttered a lot of stuff going on here so this is the main website for the university that workout it gets by far more traffic than all our other websites combined so it's it's the most important site this is where most people see the online presence of University at this site and probably never see any of our other sites this is part of the the redesign that we are working on together they didn't get very far with it but definitely an improvement you know just in terms of the things we have they're already a big improvement for some reason that's interesting the side nav hasn't been working unless you hard refresh the page anyway not really the point so here's the point one of the issues that we had in making a little bit difficult to develop this site is that the backend for it is a content management system called Ektron that's based on asp.net and we don't have direct control or direct access to the database and I'm not that familiar with dotnet things so basically what I what's I'm pretty sure this is gonna happen I don't want to say a hundred percent sure because we've been talking about it for a long time so I'm still a little bit careful as to whether or not this is gonna happen but I think it will we're gonna do away with the Eckstrom system we're gonna rebuild it completely from the ground up back and front end database everything and as we've discussed in previous streams the is to tie this into probably a wordpress for the content manager WordPress backend for content management system we're going to use graph QL to grab the data from wordpress like we're doing with this current project project 4 and then we're going to have multiple multiple droplets chris will probably be on this relation so multiple droplets running node that are low balanced to handle all the traffic and then the front end of it is going to be built with react and so it'll be very similar to what we're doing here for this site but on a much larger scale because the main website has i think it's over 3000 pages the biggest challenges we're going to have though are getting all the content out of the current database and into a wordpress database in the format that it needs to be in for wordpress or if we decide to go with some other system you know we could do it but basically we need to get the data out we've talked about this before on the stream and i think we decided that the best way to go about this would be to make some sort of an api to get that data out so that needs to happen and whether that be we do that on the stream or try to figure it out or have to hire someone else to work on that because that's databases aren't really my my strong suit so obviously we have a long time to work on it so it's possible that i can learn enough to make that happen we'll see how it goes otherwise everything else is are things that we've already worked on another project so this will be just kind of combining everything on a much larger scale and doing a lot of testing there's gonna be a lot of different you know there's gonna be a lot of users so the I guess there's more pressure on this project more people were gonna see it it's going to be more obvious I guess if we mess something up so I guess there's pressure on me you all there's no pressure on you because it's all my responsibility but I'm excited I'm really excited like I said not sure when we're gonna start it but in terms of design you know we've already have some of the design finished I mean this this header is is nice I mean probably the link structure is going to change that's not really up to me I'll be in the meetings about that but it's not going to be entirely up to me what links are there but hey I just checked the live chat and my uncle is in the live chat hey Uncle fat also glad you could that you could watch okay so enough about that project you're definitely hearing more about it and in the upcoming weeks and so I'm excited so today we're gonna do two things the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how I've set up using a Kanban board and using github projects a layout so that we can all track this project together so that you know what still needs to be done and they're all going to be linked up to github issues so that it's easy for us to discuss them and to track them because until now you all just been kind of going by what we discussed in the live streams so I think this will be much more clear you know what we still have left to do it'll be nice to track everything and I think it's night I use this kind of thing for all my projects it it helps me organize everything so I know I've shown you a little bit of how I do this on Trello but I'm gonna try to do this within github and then that way there's not so many different places to go to keep track of the same project the second thing we're going to do is go over some pull requests because we've gotten a lot of pull requests over the last weekend and I didn't it was a long weekend for me so I wasn't in Monday or Tuesday so I didn't stream so I'm gonna save that for the second part of it so let me start my timer I'm gonna start this 25minute Pomodoro timer and then that will reminding me that after 25 minutes I need to take a break and answer some questions in the live chat this probably will end up being a shorter stream than normal because we're not going to do a lot of actual coding this is going to be more of like project planning and review code review so we'll see how much time it takes but I'm thinking maybe around an hour for the stream length so let me show you let me bring this over on this screen so you can see I'll bring this up you can see let's see I see there are some questions in the lab chat I will get to those on my first break so don't think I'm am ignoring them okay so here's what we have now on the project I'm gonna make this a bit bigger so you can see so this is our bulletin reactive current project that we were working on and I just went to the repository and then I clicked on this projects tab I just made you know one project called bulletin you can add a description of these if you want but this is the only one so I mean they make it a bit smaller just you can see kind of the big picture here so for a Kanban board this is the kind of an old way of a visual way to look at a project flow you don't even need to do this online you can do it with sticky notes on a wall or something basically all you need is three columns so you need you know your todo column you're in progress and then your your done column I like to expand it out a little bit when I first learned how to do this this was the setup that I learned with and for me I like this because I usually try to put in there ready for development column everything that I think I can complete in one week and then it's nice to have a testing column not everything goes in there the testing column sometimes things are really minor changes that are so straightforward that you test as soon as you do it you see that it works doesn't really require a lot of testing and those usually can go right to the completed because you kind of do the testing step right there and then I also like to add this wish list and these are things that would be really awesome to add to a project but it's probably not going to happen for launch and not a project requirement so these are if you want to challenge these are probably where the most challenging things would be but probably the coolest things to work on as well so I've added some things I've added some things and you can see from setting this up earlier today just a few hours ago we've already had something moved from the todo list to the completed list and so these when I when I add these in I just add them as a note and then you can click the drop down and you know it doesn't show it now because I already did it you can click the drop down and convert it to an issue and then it automatically goes into the issues then you can put more information and if you want code snippets or images you know whatever you want and there can be discussions so several of these issues have discussions back and forth with those of you who are you know contributing to the project so it's it's nice but I have done this with Trello before but it is really nice to be able to have it all in one place so I'm gonna try to make this work the only thing that I don't have with this that I had with Trello that I really liked was being able to track how long each one of these took using Pomodoro sessions so I was checking out some Chrome extensions that could maybe do that but I haven't found one that works exactly you know how it did with Trello so I'm thinking about I'm gonna keep looking for one if you know of anything like that then let me know otherwise I may attempt to create one myself I don't know when I'll have time to do that but it it would be cool to have something where you could attach time estimates to each one of these that would be that would be nice and then if it could also produce some sort of burn down chart automatically that would be that useful as well me that's actually pretty straightforward if anybody has questions about this put in a live chat I'm gonna keep looking over so that I can answer questions you see kinda think I'm missing something this seems to easy to explain I actually I think I think that's it con bonds really straightforward and it's simple which is why I like it so much you know you just you move the cards over okay cool so so Pat says JIRA does both estimates and multiple reports I was I was actually checking out JIRA before the stream started does anybody else use JIRA you know of that so JIRA seemed like it had the most features out of anything else I checked out in terms of tracking this and doing there's a lot of charts and reports there's so many cool things that could do so I might have to check into that more I didn't really have time to check into it before the stream as much as I think I needed to to do a stream on it but I'm assuming that there's also integrations with github I know there is you can link up Trello with github issues so I'm assuming you could do the same thing with JIRA or maybe use something like like zapier to link it up but that that seems like it would be pretty pretty powerful let's see okay world says this is more for agile type workflows yes so I've the Connie the context of agile was where I actually learned this I was taking a course on agile for for one so I was not working on a team it was more me working by myself but I wanted to incorporate as much of you agile project management as I could so that's where I learned this so anyway I think this will help so I may or may not stick with doing this and get up if I can find if I find that it doesn't have everything that I need or there's something better out there that I could work with that's great the only thing I would want is for you all to be able to have access to this to at least see it you don't necessarily need to be able to edit it I mean I could certainly take care of moving these cards over every time one of these issues is either you know it's solved so if we can find something like that I'm certainly open to it otherwise I'll maybe try to find a plug in all right so let me let me quickly go over one other thing with the Trello board before we actually get into some code so you'll notice I have some labels here if you're already familiar with how github issues work I'm sure you know what's going on with these labels but if you're not then I'm gonna try to label the issues as accurately as possible but the important labels for people who I guess are new is this good first issued label so if you don't have a lot of pull requests or you're looking for your first pull request for your github profile check these out I'm gonna try to put this tag on everything that is that I think will be easy for beginners so sometimes it may be something as simple as adding a little bit of documentation even potentially correcting a typo so I'm gonna make sure I do this I'm gonna purposely not complete some of the easier tasks and make them issues and then that way you know it can help you get that that first pull request I know it can be intimidating sometimes a lot of projects are really complex and not quite so easy to get into so this would be good for for some of the newer people and then also I'm gonna have some more some more complicated issues this I would say is a bit more complicated and let's see so I want to actually take a look at this especially if you're not familiar with without github works and we're just going to take a look at one of these issues the only other label I want to point out is this hack hack Tober fest issue if you search for hack Tober fest this is basically an opportunity for you to get a free tshirt so if you sign up for this and link your github account and you you have four pool requests that get merged in the open source projects then you'll get a free tshirt so check that out and I think it's all the way through October I forget what the end date is but it's kind of a cool a cool thing so that's why I added this label here just to let everybody know that this is you know this is open for issues let's see pad has a question says do you keep a backlog of items to complete right now I don't have a backlog well I should at least for this project I haven't set up anything I didn't I didn't even start to do anything on this project till a while an hour or two ago so I don't have anything yet for my some of the other projects that I had a more developed board for I did have quite a large backlog for some of them yeah I guess the to do you to do it works kind of like a backlog and the way I have this set up so I don't have a separate backlog so I saw with with JIRA there is a way to do have a separate backlog so basically this ends up the backlog my projects because it's usually just me working on them they're not really largescale so it doesn't usually get too big it's pretty easy to handle but if you had a much larger project you might even want multiple multiple boards so I would I would say this setup does work well for me if it's for a small project a really small team but larger ones would probably need something more and actually so uncle Pat if we get a chance to talk I would really love to see how how you handle because I know you work on some some much larger projects I'd love to see how you handle the workflow because you know I just I'm just trying to figure this out on my own I've never had like a team or you know someone else to work with and learn from and how to do this so let's see if you all don't know I am so my uncle was here in the live stream and he is a software developer and has been for for a long time and I'm not gonna give like details about company or anything because I'm not sure if you want me to or not but works with I believe csharp and yeah so definitely has been a great help and to me and kind of my path to becoming a developer and so anyway I'm really excited that he's he's watching so oh okay I said I was gonna click this and then I get sidetracked all right so here's the issue right so if you go to look at a github repository you can check out you can get straight to the issues or if you're in the project view you can click on the issue and so this is basically what it isn't you can submit issues as well so it doesn't have to be me as the manager of this repository you can submit issues as you see them and you can even put in you know screenshots links whatever you need to so in this particular case I guess there's no discussion for this one I'll click another one where you add discussion but in this particular case you could ask questions you know we could go back and forth on you know what we think we could assign this to someone like I said since we don't really have it's just me working on it I usually don't assign but you can see how useful it is in being able to have a place to discuss each issue and then when you submit a pull request to complete this issue the issue then would get closed and we have a record of all the issues so in particular for this one let's see so one of the things that was done in a pull request over the weekend Harshit submitted a bunch of pull requests is that he got that grid working in terms of switching back and forth between the list layout and the grid layout but the way it's working there's a gap between our cards so in for this issue we just want to get rid of that gap so I have offered some suggestions to repurpose some code from a previous project and I've linked to that that code here I think that will solve the problem but it'll take some adjustment of the way the code is set up currently let's see let me just to show you an example let me show you this once we so we can have discussion back and forth and talk about it so anyway for those of you that are used to get hub I know this is pretty basic but I I do know there's a lot of you that watch that may not have a gate profile yet or you just started out so it can be somewhat confusing if you're not used to it okay I see a dual ask is there any chance you could share the link about this agile course yeah if I remember I can find the link if you want to try to look for it it's I think it's called agile for one and it's on Pluralsight so Pluralsight is has a lot of online courses there are a couple of different ways to get a free trial of fluoro sites you can test it out without having to pay for it but normally you have to pay for it so I think the Microsoft developer programmers there's some sort of Microsoft developer program that you can sign up for it it's free and it comes with I think a three month free trial to Pluralsight that's what I did and I just try to do as many classes as I could before my trial ran out so check that out if you want to otherwise after I'm done with the stream maybe I'll try to find the link and I'll put it in the video or the fire remember I'll put it in the live chat tomorrow okay one more thing I want to tell you about that change before we get to some more the code is if you're using this project now if you want to download this and run it on your own machine you need to be running node so nodejs version 7.6 or higher so we're using some newer JavaScript syntax and it's not supported in older versions so if you're getting an error about the async okay good eric says it's microsoft dev essentials so that's that's what it is check out the microsoft dev essentials there's other cool stuff you get for free with that as well so definitely check it out so let me show you what I'm talking about we have the so we now have a try to find a server folder and within the server folder we have app dot J s and this is harsh it did all the work for this but one of the things it does is it uses on this line line 11 it does use async so you'll get in you'll see that there's an error on line 11 if you don't have the the correct node version so that kind of got me at first when I try to run this it took me a little while to figure out what the problem was luckily I had remembered reading about newer node versions supporting this and then I finally realized what the problem was but other than that everything should work just make sure when you download the latest version of the repository if you already had it on your machine that you run npm install or yarn to get all the newest dependencies so let me go through it's probably going to it would take a while to go through everything on the pool request that happened so I'm just going to quickly go over each one and of course you can check out you know line by line what happened with each one in the repository so let's look at our close pull requests and let me go from ok so from 11 on these are things that are new so in this one our should added that grid layout that I just showed you all recently there are also some other minor changes that I'm kind of skipping over so but this was a significant amount of code it took me quite a while to go through everything and test it all before I merged it in an error handler so basically what happens now is when you go let's see if we can find it here so if there's no network connection you'll get an error instead of the the loading spinner just continually running forever you will actually get an error that says there's something wrong with the network and you can test it out I'll do it here briefly you can test it out by turning off the network so let me switch to offline and let's click I have to do this in the right order so let's get with your first all right now let's try to go offline and see if it'll let us do this there we go so it says Network error failed to fetch so they did already have this saved so that's why I displayed it but otherwise we'll get that I'll probably change this I don't really want to show the user you know the read error message I think it'll be nicer I want to do something I want to make it seem like it's not really that big of a deal just hey check your internet connection or something like that so I'm not sure how I want to word that or display that but really good idea at least to give the user some feedback instead of just the spinning thing because we'll know immediately whether or not there's a network connection so why make the user wait if if we're already sure that it's not going to look so that was a great idea thanks for that our should also and this is to me the biggest thing the server for the API and authentication so this is really cool so we're actually are going to look at this code for a minute because this is this significant this kind of goes beyond a lot of the basic stuff that we had been working on previous to this so here's what we're doing we're actually routing the the data that we're getting from graph QL and in WordPress and instead of bringing it straight into our component it's like clientside right we're gonna bring it in serverside so you can see I believe it's at the bottom here I think where we actually go here we go so you can see here's that URL that we were heading clientside before and now we're getting that data server side and then where we we would have gotten things see if I have it up here I don't think I do okay let's bring up graph QL Apollo client so whereas before we were hitting that wordpress site directly now we're calling that that backend that server and grabbing the data from there and I think this will be important for us for for a couple of reasons number one it's going to help us to protect that that WordPress installation right because we want it to be password protected or I should rather not have passwords I'd rather have it be a pass with this login but I'm still working with the IT department to see how exactly we're gonna integrate this with our single signon system so now what it allows us to do is check for whatever kind of authorization we're gonna have here server side and only then be able to load that data also when we do it like this just kind of thinking of the possibilities I think this gives us a nice opportunity for some caching here like a serverside cache right because so I like you know clientside caching right and we already have because we use create react app to set this up we have a serviceworker running that's going to do a lot of caching so in it is a progressive web app in that sense that you can turn on and we saw this with a previous project when I showed you like on my phone right we could turn off the network we put it on airplane mode and clicked around and everything still worked with the exception of the forms you know obviously but here we'll still gonna have that which is awesome but if we had a cash that was on the server then it didn't matter who clicked right so with a clientside that's great but it only helps out to cut down on requests for that one person when you have this serverside cash here anybody that tries to to go to our site the request is going to stop here it's not set up yet but when we set it up the request will stop here and then press a request will never get sent back to our WordPress installation so that's going to significantly cut down on the amount of traffic that's going from our react site to WordPress so I really like that idea it's gonna allow us to set up WordPress on a much smaller server and less powerful server than we would need to otherwise now this site granted it doesn't get that much traffic it's an internal site you know it'll be less than you know 500 users so I'm not super worried about it but this is going to be really important to test and make sure it works for the next project that we will be working on for the main site because that's going to get a significant amount of traffic so I'd love to test this out and get it working here on a small scale so that maybe it could help later on because WordPress can sometimes be notorious for for taking a lot of resources so if we can cut down on the load that's gonna come you know back to WordPress then that's that's going to be a huge help so those are like the main the main two reasons why I think this is going to be really important and really helpful so if you want to you know kind of go through this line by line on your own then you know go right ahead and we'll be working with this more in streams so we'll have to go through it and add to it and modify it a bit but right now really awesome works well so really happy about that thank you harsh it I'm gonna go ahead and do a short fiveminute break I'm gonna check out the live chat answer any questions and then we're going to come back and briefly go over the rest of these pull requests okay cool so I'm gonna see actually just saw so Pat says set up multiple caches one for the server for generics cool logos pictures etc then set up a clientside cache for student admin oriented cache data actually yeah that's a good idea I forget to mention this but right now right now the way we're using WordPress on our sites where we're pulling from the WordPress API or graph QL is that we're still serving all the pictures from WordPress so obviously that's no good right because it still sends a lot of requests back to WordPress but what I'd like to do is serve those images elsewhere so I like the idea that users can upload an image into WordPress right there when they're making a post that makes it easy for people who aren't familiar with code to edit things but what I would like to happen is that the images themselves are sent from maybe some sort of content delivery network so I have some ideas for how to implement that I need to test some things out but I think it can be done and it won't it shouldn't be too difficult and we should be able to load the images much more quickly and completely take the the strain off of WordPress from having to serve those to everyone so I think it's a great idea let's see okay let me scroll up and see if there's any questions hey everybody I see everybody saying hi at the beginning cool we have good day from Zimbabwe hey welcome ding ding Ghana says good day from Zimbabwe okay cool Todd says awesome I've been working on one for a past couple weeks use jQuery at first now I'm trying it with do you can't wait to compare with this yeah definitely let me know when you're done with with trying it out with you I would I would love to see the comparison I haven't worked with you yet but I've read about it and definitely interested in it so I'd be really interested to compare compare the code for those worlds asked when did you learn to code or how long ago I would say I've been doing I've been getting back into frontend development for about five years only the last three of those five years what I'd say I've been like seriously working on JavaScript development before that it was more HTML CSS a little bit of jQuery here and there when I needed it so but I started learning how to build websites when I was in high school so probably around 2003 maybe around there I still did a little bit with it later on in college so maybe like 2005 I worked on it took a class in C++ so I did a little bit with it here and there but I didn't really keep up with it too much but then I did some freelance stuff for a few years and then about two years ago I started working as a fulltime frontend developer here at Franciscan University so that's about it I do have a video on my youtube channel I think it's linked in the description I have a video where I talk more about my journey to becoming a frontend developer so if you're interested check that out and you get some more some more info about that cool Sebastian says we're here to back you up awesome I really appreciate that you all actually have helped so much with making these projects awesome but also making me a much better coder by going through all your pull requests and you know getting all this advice that you give me in the live chat I just I've learned more in the last few months that I've been live streaming then probably in the last year before that so it's definitely awesome that's actually what I'm going to give a talk at the November conference at the end of November in Nashville Tennessee and my whole talk is going to be about how live streaming has been such an amazing experience for me and has helped me so much as a developer and so yeah it's it's really been awesome I appreciate you all okay Michele says I like WordPress PHP is my first language awesome awesome that's that's good maybe you can help out when if we have to edit some things in WordPress it's good to have a PHP person watching okay miss nero says oktoberfest may have something to do with all this pull request huh yeah I thought that I there's a lot of people trying to get that free tshirt and get this pull requests in so it's nice to use that label all right so my five minutes is up I'm going to come back and finish up the questions but I do want to go through the rest of these pull requests at least just a nice outline of them so let's I tell you what I'm going to set this timer but I don't think we're going to need all this time so I expect to finish up before the twenty five minutes and let me know what you think about this kind of stream right we're not doing very much coding but we are kind of going over a lot that I think we need to go over for everyone try having to everyone being able to be on the same page with where this project at since it's changed so much since Friday so let me know if you're not interested in this we'll try to figure out some other way to keep everybody in the loop in terms of the changes and I'll just stick to trying to do coding but otherwise I think I would only do this if there's a lot of changes like we have today I'm I don't think I would do this frequently but there's a lot to change its kind of needed all right so the next the next thing that we're going to do actually I do want to say this if anybody has worked with different types of authentication especially with node let me know I'm very interested in you know what your thoughts are or if there's anything I should look into more like I said I still am not sure how things are going to work out with my IT department and trying to integrate everything with what they're doing that's the bestcase scenario but I I'm definitely open to trying to figure out something else with authentication if we need to so anyway we do have some unit testing now so this is I actually I am going to show you a bit about what was done here so we have let me I always just want to show you some of the tests so I mean you can check out all the packages that were installed here but let me show you the tests I get stung further down whereas there we go here's some of the tests so a lot of these tests right now are just saying you know hey did it render did it actually render which is fine that's that's a good test so these run when you commit your code so you're not you won't be able to commit unless the code passes these tests which is awesome so basically you can see it's pretty straightforward even if you don't know anything about testing in this particular way it's not hard to see what's going on so we see at bar renders without crashing right that's that's it that's that's the test so so we just want to see if things render some of them we got a little bit more so we're actually seeing like does it render a category right I think we're doing another one where it's rendering something else but basically you can see the test could be a little bit more indepth and maybe we'll get to that once we build things out a little bit more but for now at the very least it checks to make sure any changes hasn't caused part of the app to to not render so anyway so really useful so if you want to write some tests feel free especially if anybody's more experienced at writing tests as you all may know I've mentioned before I'm still pretty inexperienced with testing so I'm gonna be trying to understand testing and write some more tests I did some with our previous project that we had some testing on but that's what that's what we mean by by testing at least for right now this isn't the only way to do testing we certainly could add you know some different types of tests but this will we have for now and it's awesome that we just have you know some testing in there we also have this announcement form so show you so now we have a way to submit announcements so users can submit now this is not tied in at all to the backend so we still need this data to be sent to our server and then from the server to be sent by email to someone here in my department and then also an email back to actually we don't have a spot for email hmm oh you know what we're currently getting the users email so we already have the email of someone who's logged in so we are sending the email back to the user we don't have to get the email here in the forum because we already have it so assuming that we can still get the email address of the user which we should be able to do because I think the login will still be based on email and not necessarily username so we'll grab the email we send two emails one to the person who submitted it and one to someone here in my department and they can also upload files so we're gonna need I actually had another modal that popped up when you click this with some further instructions so we'll see if we want to do that the same way or figure out a better way to do that but that's that's in place now which is great and we had so let's see key there may sir if I'm mispronouncing the name I don't know if gear may is here or not in the live chat but the air Mesa has added some information to the readme basically the readme file was referencing some stuff from an old project so it wasn't this current project so it was and then added some things about using yarn so that was good hopefully no one got too confused if they had read the readme recently and then also added some info about that node version that I was telling you about earlier that we need at least version 7.6 to be able to run the server so those are all the requests so quite a few requests a lot of code and let me share with you the contributors now so I haven't done this for a while but here's everyone that's contributed so far so awesome work to everyone that's contributed I really appreciate it and you can see based on commits I'm no longer the top contributor so I need to I need to get moving but anyway I really appreciate everything so if anyone has any questions about any of those commits about what was done or how it was done let me know I can certainly go back over them in more depth I'd like for us all to be able to understand you know what's going on so I mean I definitely took a lot more time to go through it on my own so I it may not be as clear in the brief overview that I've given but you'll see I'm going to be adding to these issues into our project so if you're interested in contributing but you're not sure what to do keep an eye on that on the issues and give it a shot I if you submit an issue and you didn't do it quite right I can always just give you some feedback and you can improve it so don't worry about submitting something wrong I'm the worst that could happen is I just say hey you need to change this or oh you know somebody already submitted something that fix that so no big deal don't be afraid to submit if you want to see and also if you notice something that's not working correctly with the app open up an issue I I certainly am NOT going to be able to catch everything it's always awesome to have you know other people fresh eyes looking at the project and you know I'm sure all of you use different operating systems devices browsers and you'll catch some things that that I just won't so all right I'm gonna go back to the live chat I'm gonna answer some more questions and it's okay yeah we're about right on track to have that our our time for this stream so tomorrow we'll definitely be doing some some coding so this stream is kind of just to catch up stream not really the norm okay let's go back let's see do you dilip I'm not sure I can't I says hey W DLC for the start I'm not sure what W DLC is somebody let me know what that means and then I'll answer the question okay Ronald says have you looked at Zen hub for github I actually I think that is what I looked at so I mentioned that I did see something that worked with github I think it was in hub so Ronald if you I know you you mentioned that a while ago so if you're still there let me know do you use Zen hub for github and if so how do you like it hey John Hansen's here he says hi all hey John thanks for joining us Oh Eric says bitbucket can use Trello boards now which is pretty cool that is cool I didn't realize that Blake says hey Jesse I'm watching the videos over and over watching the videos over again and copying the code over as there are a lot of PRS in there in the repo yeah definitely a lot of hearts Umberto's says yet yeah Alberto's my dotnet guy on the stream definitely very helpful whenever we were working on some dotnet stuff a few weeks back satya says yeah it's helping me awesome glad I could help thanks for watching Meriter says this first week is tough gonna have to watch your video later ciao for now okay see you later Umberto I'm sure you're gone already but thanks for watching Blake says if I'm building this myself do you think i need PRS 12 through 13 and 15 through 22 let me check with those PRS were again 12 yet not necessarily so if you don't need some of those features that we're being added then I don't think that you need them so for sure you can get kind of the basics down up to maybe around PR right right around PR 12 I guess would be a decent place I mean the air handling.i is is kind of nice but yeah anything beyond that in terms of the the server you may or may not want that a clientside API call would probably just fine if you had no need of authentication Sacha's has hi Jesse from India hey Satya glad you could join us from India it's pretty late there right it's definitely try think what time it would be in India was it like somewhere around 230 in the morning something like that I can't remember the exact time but thanks for staying up so late rook says hi everyone join late hey ro glad you could join Pat says is there a formal QA / testing process that you go through before you go live with work how formal a process does your school have the process is actually not it's not really formalized so I definitely think we need something more formalized but for now the testing process is depending on what the project is and and how necessary it is it will go through more rigorous testing than than other projects but there's no basically if I say it's ready to go then it goes so everybody trusts that all of you thorough testing so it's thing is pretty much all on me and I just do as much as I can and usually we have four projects in the past done had groups of people here at the University to get early access to things and let them test and give me feedback so we have done use some of the automated testing in previous projects and some like we're doing now and then otherwise just try to do as much user testing as we can honestly there have been some times when we we had a date things had to go live and I would have rather done more testing but it worked for most of the use cases that we had and and it launched and then later on we just tried to to improve things as much as we could I'm usually thinking more like browsers like older browsers making sure it works then those are the things that usually kind of get pushed the side you know we try to test with the main the browsers that we know people are most likely to use and and then just wait you know that when we have more time for the other ones so I definitely have to read up more on testing process I'd like to have I'd love to have more automated testing that happens and and then perhaps some sort of formal process you know right now right now with it just being me mostly who makes that decision I I just have been putting off doing something like that but if we end up having more people working on things it's going to be necessary to have some sort of established process so if anybody has experience with that I'm definitely open to hearing your thoughts on it and I do run I use I forget what it's called but there's some sort of service that checks your github repositories to see if any of the JavaScript libraries are using have security issues so I do some testing like that as well okay all right rook says passport J s is a is great for authentication and node use it recently to implement a login with Facebook o auth to button it makes it really straightforward okay cool I'll I'll check that out I think I've heard about that before I think someone else mentioned a livestream to I know I looked at it before I actually I think I looked at it when I was originally building this bulletin last year and at the time I I was not gonna run a note back and I just didn't know enough about it at the time so I just kind of passed the passed it by but at this point I think I and we definitely have the skills to implement that so I'm gonna check into that thank you for the suggestion oh cool Blake says I like the break gives me some time to catch up on other videos okay cool Ronald says just to notice it's a commercial project just nope just ran across it okay cool thanks for for them you know about it and that was in response to what was it called I forgot already the github Zen hub Zen hub forget up alright Pat says web development lifecycle okay cool check okay cool I'm checking that out on my other screen the web development lifecycle cool yeah I definitely need I need a better process oh okay cool thanks uncle Pat so that was the W DLC comment from earlier okay let me go back and look at that comment now that I understand what it is okay so a W DLC for the start okay so obviously no I didn't I didn't use W DLC but now that I'm looking at it here on my other screen this is awesome I need to I need to look more into this so I mean obviously let me just pull this on this screen just to give you an overview in case I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with this already but it's assuming that this is an accurate representation it seems like these are just the steps for web development to gather information planning do with wireframe mockup design content then coding testing review launch and then maintenance so these are things that usually happen but they don't these usually happen for my projects but not necessarily as distinct steps like this or mapped out and sometimes they're in a different order I think it wouldn't definitely be helpful to put this in a better order because I'm sure if you watch before a previous things sometimes we get out of order with this and we get stuck a bit in a loop where we're content isn't even decided on we're almost all the way finished with coding and the content in the design aren't even completely decided on yet some of this is out of my hands I don't write the content so sometimes we just get started and have to wait on the content otherwise we'd be waiting for a long time and never get it coded I do like this idea we should we should definitely follow this for the upcoming project because that's going to be a huge project in it it will require some some organization more so than we have been for these small projects we've been able to get away with it because the projects are such small scale but I think we definitely need something more formal ok it's 1 a.m. in India all right oh that's right I remember now so 2 p.m. or I'm sorry 4 p.m. here in the United States Eastern time is 200 a.m. in India all right I knew there was it was around that time okay Risha bass will there be a caste related to Jess so will I do a stream let's see I maybe I will I need to learn more about about just so it's a possibility I don't feel comfortable doing a stream on it right now because I know so so little about it so I think it would be great to do a stream on that and it's something that I should know more about anyway so I'm going to keep that in mind and try to do a stream on its in nears it says I just made my first pool request awesome congratulations did you do a pull request for this for this project and see where was it at I get up open let's see if it's for this one I don't see him for this one maybe it's for a different one but anyway congratulations on your first pull request let's see John B says Jessie on the topic of service that checks for JavaScript libraries that may have security vulnerabilities was the service you were thinking of called sync IO yeah I think it's sync is anybody else use sync dot IO I have it linked up to my github account and so it just checks all my repositories usually I get warnings sometimes about different versions of jQuery surprisingly a lot of different versions of jQuery show up as having some sort of security issue so I'm not sure I mean sites that that need to use jQuery I'm not sure what to do about it cuz sometimes you need to use certain versions to work with other things that you're using but yeah it's pretty useful it doesn't cover everything so it's not I wouldn't trust it a hundred percent but it's nice to have to have the warning there and I think I I'm pretty sure it comes up in my console I have some sort of plugin see if I I don't know if I have a site open that would give me an error right now but I also get a warning message in my console which is nice okay let's see all right well I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat and we're coming in at just over an hour so for once my estimate of how long something would take actually works I normally underestimate every time we do a stream so let's see okay John B just said I remember because the guy who made synced at a conference talk on JavaScript phone abilities that criminal hackers like to exploit okay cool that actually sounds really interesting talk on that I just I don't usually hear that much about JavaScript boner abilities so I would definitely interested in that okay cool so a little bit of a different stream today kind of it was kind of different it was kind of weird for me sitting I didn't write any code but I think hopefully we're all on the same page now we know we have some project planning in place and I'll be adding to that you feel free to add to that as well and we got a new project coming up that's going to be huge and exciting I've been I've been wanting to redo the main website here at the University since before I even got the job here so this is I'm really really excited and I'm glad now like everybody in my department the head of my department is on board and I think there there are people even higher up that are going to be on board with it so I think this is really gonna happen so I'm excited and I'll keep you uptodate on anything you know before we start I'll keep you uptodate on anything that happens that may delay it or different decisions about what it's going to look you know what exactly we're going to do but it'll be awesome it'll be it'll be a huge project and it'll be really cool and maybe I'm kind of thinking that maybe we could sneak somewhere in the site maybe in a console all the list of everybody that submitted pull requests just to thank you so we'll see I think that would be fun and then anybody that inspects uses the the dev tools will see everybody that contributed but all right cool so I guess that that's it for me today should be back tomorrow probably around 200 p.m. and until then thanks for watching and have a great day
