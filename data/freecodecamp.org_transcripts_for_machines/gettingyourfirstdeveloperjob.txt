hi everyone my name is christine and i'm a frontend web developer i actually just started programming six months ago and i found my first dev job about three months so now i've been a web developer for about three to four months now and i really love it so this talk i'm just gonna give a little background about myself and my interest in coding and also how what i did to land my first job so i graduated from the university of oklahoma about four years ago with the political science degree and i didn't really know what exactly to do with a political science degree i was confused and lost and so i decided that i wanted to be a lawyer or be a makeup artist be other different things i had so many different hobbies that i wanted to do and i contemplated thought about it and i realized that those are the type of jobs that i might not be interested in the long run and so i got into coding when i landed my first job in the marketing field and i worked with html templates in wysiwyg and a lot of the stuff that i did before was mainly just coding uh the tables inside the wysiwyg very simple stuff and i realized that i wanted to do more in life i didn't want to stay at my old job because you know i just feel like i would plateau quickly so i looked around for different types of classes i looked into getting a computer science degree but i realized that you don't really need a computer science degree to do web development and i really like web development because i like art and design so i feel like that would be something i'm good at so i looked around online for some classes and a lot of the classes were really expensive one class to learn javascript was about two grand that i saw and so i was like you know i feel like i could find something else you know maybe try different routes some other classes that may be cheaper and then i saw ok coders which is where i met carson he was one of my instructors at ok coders and had helped me a lot throughout my journey so i just want to say thank you carson very very much but uh so i found ok coders and it's basically a six month module or six modules six months long bootcamp class every saturday and you learn everything about web development starting with beginning with html css you learn how to use your command line you learn how to use your github where you push all your files and into github and then also javascript libraries which is really really important if you're looking to be a frontend developer so yeah i attended bootcamp for about six months and a lot of the work i had to code i have to practice coding every single day and get better the classes were only four hours long every week and i knew that you have to put extra work into um you have to put in the extra work outside of class so you know i studied a lot i read all my documentation that's probably the most important thing is reading your documentation starting out and that's what i did i use all my online resources i practice on codeacademy udemy lynda.com those are great if you want to get into coding those are great online resources to take and practice on i also asked a lot of help from people i joined teclahoma met a lot of the great developers in the community and just getting advice from people or people who have experience in this type of career really helped me love being a developer even more the excitement of you know seeing people creating so many cool uh things it's just sorry i got nervous but creating a lot of cool things is just amazing and and i think that's why we all want to be developers is that we want to create something and build something of our own and so um anyways i practice a lot and then i was also looking for a job at the same time knowing that i'm probably not qualified but i gave it a shot anyways i just kept trying and i attended job fairs and brushed up my resume i created a portfolio i created a lot of side projects and pushed everything to my github to show that i put in a lot of work even if i know my code wasn't that great i just pushed everything into my github and then finally got my first dev job at a marketing company who's willing to take this opportunity opportunity on me even though they know that i'm probably i'm still really new and not fully qualified um i got the job and i was really excited got a little content and about two weeks ago i actually almost lost my job because i wasn't practicing enough outside of work and that's the most important things that i want to tell you guys starting out as a developer if you have not much or no prior program experience you have to practice even when you get the job you have to practice outside work and i just i got to continue i was too happy and i relaxed and then you know i was in a very tough spot where they said that i need to improve or it just won't work out and i was given two weeks to show improvement at my job and i did it and it was very it was a lot of work um i just whatever i did at work i showed them and i had better communication with my senior developers that's also one important thing that you guys have to know is communication with your fellow developers that was one thing that i didn't do very well i i was the type of person that i wanted to learn everything my frontend skills weren't even that great and i wanted to learn to do php and sql and all the backend and i took in work that i don't even know what i was coding they gave me php and sql and i'm just sitting here trying to figure it out when i realized that sometimes you have to say no when you're not ready for something you have to say no and so i was honest to them and said hey i'm i'm not ready for this yet and i need to practice on my frontend skills and that's what i did so when you get your new job when you get your developer job make sure you are fluent with all your languages before jumping into something else for me i just i just wanted to learn everything i couldn't say no because i was scared to say no i wanted i wanted to learn everything and be good at everything and sometimes you know it's you have to take it one step at a time i thought being a developer means you have to know you know react you have to know angular even though at my job we use jquery like i wanted to learn react and angular i want to do all these things but i know i have to take it one step at a time and that's the important thing another thing is besides that is getting feedback from your senior devs and you know just your fellow developers that you're working with especially when you're new getting feedback is great knowing your work process like how you're doing always ask them like how am i doing do you think i'm doing okay because i know everyone has their own different techniques so it's best to just have a good communication and getting feedback from your peers and another one is never stop practicing always keep learning i'm still in the learning process right now i mean a couple weeks ago i was here trying to debug a bootstrap carousel and i felt embarrassed debugging a bootstrap carousel because i'm like well this is so simple like why can't i get it but i learned that it's still a learning process for me i'm still i'm still learning i'm still continuing to grow and sometimes it's okay to ask for help even something so simple like bootstrap carousel or learning how to use bootstrap it's never embarrassing to ask questions because you actually learn from asking questions just don't ask the same questions over and over ask and absorb that's the most important thing but yeah and then another thing is oh yeah this is probably important too but try to use the same ides as your fellow developers i know we all have you know a preference that we use like i like visual studio code um that's just my preference but i know like at my job and stuff we use php storm or like adam and stuff like that i just think it's you don't you don't have to do it but i think it helps with the workflow and the process when you use the same ide as your fellow peers that usually helps a lot and then another tip is when you get your first project it's always good to whiteboard it out draw a map of how you're going to build your website you know have an idea before you actually start coding that was my mistake too is i didn't really have an idea and so i kind of just start coding random things when you have to wipe word it out you have to talk to your boss don't try to take initiative with anything not well don't try to take initiative with everything beside and not letting your fellow developers know always always try to wipe board it out and then another thing is um biddle law side projects if you have anything you're interested in building do it after work hours you know take the weekend off don't go out with your friends like if you have to improve you have to just start practicing more and more build something cool like i want to eventually build an app but i don't know what happened yet but um another thing is don't be afraid to try new things um code something different don't code the same thing over and over right now since i'm still pretty new i am practicing on building my jquery maps i built a couple maps before and but i'm still practicing i'm not that great with the map i'm learning how to style maps with javascript so build something new try something new at least every single week and you'll get better and just learn that way let's see what else okay but yeah it's um so that's all i really have with the tips and advice and my story is just really practicing using your online resources talk to your peers also have good communication with your boss when finding a job push yourself out there join organizations that's what i did you know i joined teclahoma i joined free code camp i talked with my instructors that's the most important thing it's just communicating with fellow developers that could give you really good advice and also don't take criticism as an insult always take criticism as something you can prove and learn from and that's the most important thing is um and then yeah getting feedback positive side projects draw a map yeah that's really all that i have i know it's kind of short but if anyone has any questions or yeah well my interview was actually very short i didn't really take a test or anything i know some companies require you to take a test i actually took a test a couple weeks before that with an hr recruiter when i was trying to find a job just testing my javascript and i did alright on that but they didn't hire me on another company saw that i was very motivated to learn and try new things and also they liked the fact that at my previous job i wore many hats like i did all the digital content at my job and i was lucky enough because the company i work for really needed someone and so i got the job as a web developer yeah and that's i just told them my experience and everything gave him my portfolio and then yeah from there the most useful thing that i did was mainly reading my documentation in the beginning i can't i can't say this enough but reading your documentation is so so important that's what i spent my time doing outside of work now is just reading through everything carefully and even though i was in boot camp class i missed like the little things here and there because i was trying to code out my portfolio but even when i coded out it still wasn't it wasn't good i did a lot of what i did was i would always inspect right click inspect in my console and then just go in there in a debug but when you actually read your documentation clearly and thoroughly it really helps you to understand what you're doing a lot more so i can just code it out now fluently rather than having to inspect all the time and so i did that and then just practice a lot online outside of work that was probably the most useful things that i did as a developer yes well it's like so like on bootstrap saying you know it gives you all the elements and stuff so they have um your columns how to build bootstrap columns um how to do responsive media queries and stuff like that when you really read it through it helps you understand how to build your columns on your web page when i started out i didn't know that in every div container there are 12 columns and reading that part made me understand that now instead of having to inspect my element every time i know that if i were to build two comps it's just automatically column md6 column md6 and so forth so it's like reading your documentation really helps you understand that and also once you get your html css and those skills down it'll help you understand javascript more because you'll learn how to use dom elements and that's the key thing so yeah really read your documentation man anybody else yeah well now eight months because i've been in my job for about three and a half months now but i got actually got my first job at my last module coders bootcamp class so yeah yes you just have to show oh i'm sorry sorry can you say it oh okay sorry okay so he said that when you're a new developer what does your company expect out of you when you first started versus three months in so when you first started they want you to get to get familiar with their process of working and also how they you know just really focus on their software um i'm not sure how other jobs are but i know my company we use a software where we import all our code codes in and the software was built by our lead senior developer and so that's the main thing is when you first started out is learning how to use the software where to place your header code where to place the footer where do you place your link tags and everything in that where do you place your javascript that's the most important thing and then further down the line progress is you know they expect to see progress from you you know stop putting inline styles in your html start using css morse start writing multiple css to make the codes short and clean and so from it's just really building more and more experience seeing um not more experience i'm sorry uh just seeing progress yeah yes uh someone from twitch said what frameworks in javascript you would like to use um so i'm really into react um i want to get to learn react more that's something i want to eventually do but hopefully react in angular something i'm interested once i get my jquery down yeah thanks anybody else oh okay yes he said what skill set did i learn from star space 40 teclahoma star space 46 is the organization that i could apply to my job um honestly it's how to start out and find a job like how to connect i got a lot of advice from kimberly too she's great she's great i got a lot of advice from her on how to build my resume she gave me a lot of tips and then another person i like to mention is carmen she's helped me a lot too and building my resume always link your github you know your portfolio on top of your resume so that people can see that the first thing that was something i did that on my resume but i linked my portfolio in the back and you don't want to do that smart to do in the front so that everybody could see um and a lot is just like you know help like debug learning how to use my console that's what i learned and yeah anybody else yes uh currently i am building my friend's wedding website right now it's good i like it it's not the best but i like it and that and then i coded out a tictactoe game yeah nothing too advanced but hey i'll get there you know you'll get there i don't know if you're new but anyway anybody else no okay well thank you so much everyone thank you kimberly and teklahoma and everybody um having me here today i hope i could shed some light in anybody that who wants to be a developer make sure to practice practice a lot read your documentation yeah okay
