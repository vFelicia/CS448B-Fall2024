hello everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day number 20 and we are gonna be making some random animated pyramid let me show you what's going on here so i needed an idea for a project to make and i was starting to run out of inspiration and i thought what can we make that's interesting possibly practical and exercises some css3 chops and the best i could come up with in this particular moment was an animated triangle so here it is on your journey to css3 mastery spend at least 20 minutes learning how to code a triangle okay so let me show you before before you skip this video and go do something better with your time um we have a little triangle here and when you hover over the triangle watch what happens it's a lot more interesting than what you see on the screen so far here we go so check it out when you hover over this triangle it creates a bigger triangle with two other layers and then text appears and the colors change so it's actually kind of interesting and it's super easy to make and it is practical so it did check off all the boxes uh and the way i might think of how you might display this is if you were if you had a piece of text or maybe you offered a service let's say you're a web designer and you you're building a portfolio website and you wanted to display the services you offer this could say you know i'm hiding the text so this could say services and then when you hover over services it splits down and shows the services that you create they could be images as well if you wanted to display maybe like um you know different layers of a project if you had like the final final project in like the top part of the triangle and then like the wireframes and then you know then the sketch below i don't know just coming up with random ideas here but maybe you have some thoughts on how you might use this and it's simply three elements that that when you hover over them they just animate down and appear the interesting thing that's happening here is that they're actually these elements are actually three rectangles and i'm not using borders to create a triangle like we did in a previous lesson just a couple days ago i'm actually clipping the entire element so this whole thing is wrapped in an element called triangle and triangle is clipped to a custom shape that i created of the triangle now let me show you in the code editor what is going on so you know what i'm talking about so go ahead and download 20 animated pyramid and fire it up in your code editor and let's get started here in index i'm going to show you the markup looks simply like this dave with the class of triangle wrapping three individual divs with the class of top mid and bottom and then text within each of the divs that's it now what we're going to do in our sandbox is simply style those up clip it and transition it it's really quite simple so let's just get started here in the sandbox we're going to get started and we're just going to style up the triangle triangle is going to have a position of relative height of 320 pixels that is the total height of of the triangle when it's done and uh and i'm going to leave the clip path for now we're going to start with just rectangles and we'll do the shape after so you know what's going on triangle and then div so we're selecting the divs within the triangle and those are the three individual divs background red width 100 height 100 pixels we'll start with the bare bones here we're going to go margin zero auto and color white for the text uh just so you can see everything let's give them a little space just so you can see uh margin zero auto and then 10 pixels on the bottom just for now so you can see there we go we have three three red triangles now this shape is not only a rectangle but can sometimes be a triangle let's uh tighten up the text a little bit we're gonna say line height 100 line height 100 pixels so it's vertically centered text align center font size 0.8 m if we save that refresh it so now we have top mid and bottom so we have the three rectangles let me show you what happens when i mask the entire element with a clip path so now watch this is where the magic comes in so we're going to say up in triangle clip path we're going to do polygon and here's how it works we did have a lesson on creating custom shapes so if you want to unders if you forgot how this works go back to that lesson creating custom shapes using clip path uh and then you'll understand how these coordinates work but let's start here so we're going to have three comma separated couples of values so let me let me show you how this works so we have 50 and zero so if i leave it at that let's see what happens you can't see anything because we need other coordinates so comma separate the next two values 20 percent and 100 percent save that and see what happens still can't see anything okay and now we're gonna do one more eighty percent and one hundred percent save that let's see what happens now there's your triangle the end result of the shape you see how it's masked so you can only see what's within this window now if i change these values you can customize the shape so if i said like fifty percent there it looks like this uh you know ten percent it's actually got a longer left side so if i were to say zero this might help you understand so that's the zero percent mark on the x axis yes and then if i move that over twenty percent it's actually going in 20 percent and then 100 let me change that to like 80 percent it's actually now it's on the y axis so on the vertical axis the y axis if i'm if i'm not mistaken and so now it's 80 down from the top but if i want it 100 down from the top it's going to give me that perfect shape you can have it any shape you really want you can make it really wonky looking shape like that if you want it's kind of neat but i'm just going for a perfect triangle which is 50 in from the top left and zero so it's staying on the zero uh up here that on the y axis and then you got 20 in and then you got 100 down and then 80 in and 100 down creates the triangle beauty love it now let's hide those two the mid and bottom uh shapes rectangles you can call them polygons and hide them up at the top and then show them on hover so now what we're going to do is we're going to position absolute the triangle div we're going to say top 0 we're also going to hide the text so the color of the text is going to be red and we're going to remove that margin auto 10 it's just going to be margin 0 auto so there we go save that now you can only see that triangle so now we're in the right place but when we hover nothing happens because we're not telling it to do anything so what we're going to do now is we're going to say down here triangle hover so on hover of the triangle not the triange the word triangle is versatile and can also be pronounced triang div color white so all the colors of all the divs are gonna be white and now all the the mid and the bottom are gonna be separate positions so so all we need to do is move the position of the of those elements separately i don't wanna have them both be like you know top 100 pixels because what's going to happen is they're all just going to move down to there it's it's really really weird so we only want the middle and the bottom ones to move so now we're going to say triangle hover and then the class of mid so we're selecting mid we're going to move it down see if i move it 100 pixels let's see what happens and let's change the background while we're happening over here to green so let's see what happens so you see mid and still the top but it's actually the bottom one is hiding up there because the zed index so we're actually going to fix this really quickly so the reason why i'm what i'm going to do now is bottom is is is here we can see it within this clip path and mid is actually working there's no gap there we'll fix that but i want to fix the z index of the top so let's actually go here uh before the hovers so we're gonna say just top zindex one that should just put it in the front of everything so top is the one that you always see so that when it animates the top is always in the front when the other ones slide out behind it rather than the other one sliding out in front of it which would look just a little off okay and now let's see where was i let's go back to our triangle hover mid and move it down 110 pixels because i want that gap in between them like that cool okay and now the uh the other thing we need to do is i'm going to copy this and i'm going to paste it change it to bottom now we need to move it down 220 pixels because we're going down another 100 pixels change the color to blue save that refresh hover now your triangle appears but it doesn't look very exciting because it's just appearing and that's not actually doesn't have any meaning to the to the you know the functionality and it's just weird it's quite offputting so all we have to do now is actually under the triangle div style say transition so it's not a true animation it's actually just a transition we're going to transition all of the things that can be transitioned so position color background you know height anything that we change will transition with an ease at 0.6 seconds save that refresh now try so there we go that looks looks good and that's it now let me just show you actually why i did this top z index i'm gonna take that out and show you when i hover now without that you see how they're the color these ones are coming from the top they're coming from in front of the element if i did it really slow like six seconds you'd see it watch see how it's bottom and mid they're coming out from in front of top i don't actually want that i want it to slide out from see i want it to slide out from behind so by having that z index and let's do the six seconds again it looks more like this they slide out from an under like that that's a bit more of what i want and maybe what i want to do is actually give mid as that index in front of bottom so it doesn't so bottom doesn't slide out in front of mid okay so let's say mid we'll just go like this mid it gets a z index of one and top gets a zed index of two save that now watch there we go now bottom slides behind mid mid slides behind top that's exactly what we're looking for let's go back to our 0.6 second transition now try it that looks clean there we go and that's it that's uh that's it for today's animated pyramid project now the way you might use this is totally up to you depending on your project on your website maybe it's a portfolio thing and you're displaying information there's lots of interesting things you could do you can use different shapes you don't have to use a triangle you can use a circle you can have more elements that slide out there's lots of different ideas that you can do so maybe that gave you some ideas maybe that kind of made you think of a few different things either way you got to spend 10 or 15 minutes with me making an animated triangle so hope you're having a great day and i'll see you tomorrow in day number 21.
