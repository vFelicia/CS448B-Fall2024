hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i'm probably not going to accomplish what i've set out to accomplish because i don't even know if this is gonna work i've never done it before i've never even heard of anybody doing it before and i haven't found an example of someone else doing it so i look at today as an adventure as we're gonna try some stuff out i'm going to do my best to explain and make this even if we fail i'm going to try to make it you know somewhat useful to you all in terms of you know some of the stuff that we do hopefully will be uh applicable to to your work i'm probably only going to do one pomodoro session of code today because i have um a meeting and i got to get some some data ready for my meeting so i want to make sure i can answer all your questions so maybe i'll do one pomodoro session and then we'll spend the rest of the time answering questions and that should give me enough time to answer everything uh so we'll see how much code we can actually squeeze in i have a lot of comments already in the chat which is awesome so let me just take maybe just a minute no longer just to say hi and welcome any any new people right so looks like hey max i'm not gonna read all the hellos out i'm just gonna just gonna check uh i do read all of these so i'm not missing anybody but there's a lot so i'm gonna skip over a bit here all right awesome okay cool uh i did have somebody ask how i am uh so i'm doing uh pretty pretty well uh if you've been with with the stream for a while you know i'm still recovering from wrist surgery my wrist actually hurts a lot today so it's not that bad that i think it'll really affect my my typing so i think we'll be fine and this may end up being my only stream this week because i'm gonna go to the react rally conference in salt lake city and then i'm gonna go straight from there to uh to new york city to go to the um free code camp top contributor uh event uh that they're having out there so if anybody is in any of those areas and you know wants to hang out or something please let me know um but i'll try to um like give updates of what's going on on on instagram and twitter and stuff so i'm not sure if i can get a live stream in or anything when i'm there depends on the internet but if you if you follow me on those social media platforms uh then at least i'll be um i'll still be around you if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me okay okay looks like i'm getting all right what's going on here somebody says check the voice can everybody hear me my mic is showing that it's it's working or my uh my obs screen is showing it's working let me know also someone saying about the videos loading okay so i'm not sure what's up with that let me know if y'all can hear me and can see me uh i'm gonna go into the code now um so i see there's a lot of questions in there after i do some code for about 25 minutes i'm gonna come back and answer all your questions okay so uh just hang in there let's switch over so you can see the screen okay so here's some of the code i have uh made some updates and i'll explain more we're kind of going in a different direction with the home page layout so i can explain that later on if you want uh and you can also check out what i've done if you look at the commit log on the github repo the um the link to that's in the description to this video okay so today we'll mostly be working in this server.js file because we're gonna be dealing with uh the salesforce api so i'm gonna bring over some stuff onto the screen let me start my pomodoro timer okay i'm gonna pull over some of the stuff that i've been looking at so y'all can check it out and i will paste the links into the uh the live chat as well so i came across this uh on github and this repo i know you'll probably can't see it i'm gonna zoom in here actually let me put these together and make them a lot bigger here so it's easier for everybody to see okay so i came across across this repo it looks like a really old repo but it has been updated recently a lot of the files have been updated so i'm assuming that it it still works we'll find out uh but this is gonna allow us to more easily connect to uh the salesforce api okay so here's the documentation for that and right now i'm looking at how to connect right and so let's go back to our getting started because we're gonna start right right at the beginning okay we can install this right you know just with uh npm uh we're gonna use yarn because we've been been using yarn and i'll need to i'll need to do a little bit on another screen because i need to put in my credentials so um that's about the only thing you won't be able to see everything else i'll try to do here all right so first let's install js force and my goal now in this session is just to get a connection see if we can connect where's our codes whoops all right let's pull this over okay so i'm gonna do a yarn let me make this bigger i'll go one more size larger here all right so here's my terminal i'm going to say yarn um you know what let's do this on a separate branch because i don't want to mess anything up in the server file so let's create a let's do git checkout and we're going to do put a b flag on there and then we're going to say we're going to call this um let's say we'll call it salesforce okay so i like to do uh get checkout with a b flag because if i try to do a uh get branch create the branch and then check out i often forget to actually check out the branch so we're gonna do this in a branch if you're using git to do version control if you're going to put a new feature in especially if it's either like a major feature or you think you might be like break something uh while you're doing it you generally want to do it on a separate branch if you're committing to someone else's project you for sure want to do it on another branch so this will allow us to feel free to break things do anything we want and we can always switch back to the master branch and make updates and push that up to in this case the site's not live yet but we do have a development site that's that's out there so i definitely recommend doing that so now that we have it on this branch now we can do a yarn uh add js force i'm gonna double check that name js force yep that's it all right so that shouldn't take too long and while that's going we can see how we're going to bring this in so there is a way to do this in browser but i'm not going to do that we have node running we're going to use node we're going to send data from from the back end the goal of this is to be able to send data straight from our react application from a form on our react application straight into salesforce right now we are sending people prospective students if they want to inquire about to get more information about our university they have to click a link they're directed to another site that has a form on it it would be a lot more convenient if they never had to leave our site or even click away from a page if we just had the form right there on the home page as you scroll down you'll eventually see it and you could put in some info i think we'll get a much higher conversion rate let's say on our on our inquiry form okay all right great that's there that's that's in there now um so let me make some space here for our server.js our server.js file is is quite crowded right now so eventually if we get this to work we'll probably move it to its own separate file but for now i'm just going to do it here uh just to save some time okay so let's copy some of this stuff and paste it up here and i'm going to change these vars to const okay generally when you're using es6 right or they call es 2015 it's a newer version of javascript some some additions to it when you're using that you want to use const or let in place of vare if you're not sure why and you want to know you can ask me after this pomodoro sessions over i'll be happy to explain like why you would use one or the other but there's really no need to use there anymore okay could not find declaration for our module for js force hmm let's double check and make sure that this works i thought it did oh maybe it didn't okay let's see um all right got a lot of stuff not working here hmm maybe this isn't going to work let's check the uh the github repo again and we'll go to issues and see what's happening 195 issues is actually a lot maybe this is not really being maintained anymore okay i mean based on the issues that people are are posting here they've obviously got it to to install okay let's go back here i wonder if you have to have a certain version of node so i'm going to double check i don't remember seeing anything about that okay let's check releases see if there's any info there all right i'm alright they just came out with a new release 19 days ago all right let's i'm just going to run yarn again all right everything's up to date that's weird why can't we find js force i don't really want to open up my node modules um just gonna run this one more time it probably won't work but you never know like it does happen that you just try the same thing again and and now it works so um we'll give it another go okay didn't get all these i did not get all these errors this time and hmm all right i'm just gonna let that go for now because i don't think it's gonna matter so let's move on then it's good to know that that they have had a recent release though i do want to check my time all right about 15 minutes okay now that we've gone through the installation let's go to document let's go here and look at how we connect so i'm just gonna copy and paste this this part this seems like it's the simplest way to connect so we'll try this first there's a lot of other stuff about ways to connect not worried about it right now okay so we definitely need okay so it looks like all we need to put in here yeah all we need to put in here is a login url a username and a password okay cool so i can just put the login url right in here and that's not going to be a problem uh the username and password i'm going to save is environment variables and then pull them in and so i don't show my uh my password to everybody okay so first things first uh and this would be easy what is this extra speak uh let's get that that login url so here's salesforce let's see tesla says what should i call all right i'm not even sure where let's see where this is log out this should take me yep there we are um so i believe this would be the login url and then for username and password i am going to open up the environment variable file on another on another screen so i'm gonna pull this over to my other screen and okay it'll just take me a second to navigate there hmm it's not let me open this uh let's see all right i wonder if i can do i not have a dot m that's so weird i thought i had one that's so weird okay then i guess i will try to make one okay hold on a second for some reason visual studio code does not want to let me open this project twice all right let's just make an mfile and i will drag it over to my other window there we are okay now we'll go back here close this here and i'll say okay so on my other screen i'm gonna go to lastpass and find my username and password and my username okay all right and i should be able to bring these in in the same way that that these are being brought in so let's just copy this save a little bit of time here um and let's make this username and i call this uh username and then we'll copy and paste this and change it to password okay all right so let's see who we're doing all right so what we're looking for hopefully is that we will get some stuff logged to the console okay uh also we should probably check to make sure we haven't crashed anything so all right it looks like nothing is crashed on the side so that's good uh we can check okay oh you know what let's let's quit that and let's do a um yarn oops let's say sorry i gotta check out actu let's just run this like this let's do node server yes okay all right we're not getting anything in our console you know what let's check our documentation this is all right about five more minutes i'll get your questions so i see there's a ton of stuff in the live chat so uh i'm i'm gonna get to everything all right well let's see let's assume that we've made some sort of connection and let's go down and see if we can make a query now let's see hmm this is trying to find one that would work with what data we have i also don't want to get any data that i should not be showing on youtube oh how about let's just try to create something and then i don't have to actually show anything um all right let's try this i'm not sure if i'd need to put this inside of here or not we'll try it inside first all right yeah let's just show this as is why is it saying this oh indentation okay i do i want to see let me make sure i'm just going to go through kind of each step just to make sure things are getting picked up correctly oh you know what i'm not automatically restarting the server now since i i just did this okay all right so we're getting undefined here and now we're getting invalid using password security token okay all right that makes sense why it's not working all right so what's up with this then i don't know what i did all right you know what let me let me move this over to my other screen just quickly and i'm gonna i'm gonna hard code those values directly into the file i need to do it on my other screen obviously because i can't have anybody seeing that but i just want to make sure you know what the the real problem is here i mean if we've done all the salesforce stuff correctly and it's just something weird going on with the dot m file then i i want to know so i don't spend my time trying to troubleshoot the wrong thing so my 25 minute timer just ended so this would be the last thing that i try okay i'm going to save that and let's restart the server see what happened oh user must use security token okay all right so i need to get a security token from salesforce and then use add that to my password okay what do you all think let me know should we try that just see if we can get it to work or should i stop now and um go to the questions all right reset my security token oh i sent one to my email address okay so i just reset the security token and they are emailing it to me if it doesn't come in my email like immediately i'll just uh try this a different day oh nice it just got here okay and add it to my password so i'm assuming i can just paste this right at the end of my password so that's what i'm going to do all right we'll give this one more try what i'm pretty sure this just worked so we created these records nice i wonder if i can now search for these records by id um so let me go in i'm logged into salesforce on my other screen i'm gonna see if i can search for a record uh let's see i don't know what they have under normally it's leads um but i'm not sure if they use that that terminology so it obviously it looks like it worked i'm just not entirely sure where where it saved this to so maybe so normally in salesforce you'd use it for a business and then there would be um you would call them leads but we usually do students so i wonder if this got saved as a student so sorry i can't show you all this i don't want to accidentally show you student information so i'm just trying to do my best to describe what what i'm doing on my other screen if i get to a point where i can show you i will definitely do that let me see um let's see if i can search search students um record id yes all right so i don't think it's that so what i'll probably need to do is i'll need to do a little bit more reading to see like where by default does this stuff show up since i'm not seeing it oh wait a second i found it alright cool now i have something i can actually show you let me move this over here okay so check this out so evidently it by default goes to schools and it it made these schools okay so i'll have to figure out how to put it in the right spot ideally we'd want these to go into um students right but this works for now so you could see we gave it the name of my account one and my account two and um so obviously it didn't fill in these things right because um we didn't tell it to fill these in but you can see by the owner alias is it's me uh just the first part of my name jwig okay so awesome that worked we're able to connect and we could see like here's the the id right i have a server here uh cool really cool all right awesome so now i'm gonna go to i guess i'll just let me switch it up here uh and now i'm gonna go back to the chat i'm gonna start way up at the top and i'm just gonna work my way down here so um i'm going to try to get to all of the questions i think this was definitely a success um in terms of you know we were actually able to add a record that's awesome now it's just a matter of figuring out the details of being able to add it as a student and get the right match up the right values uh so i'm i'm feeling really really happy about that and i can't believe it only took me to me like less than an hour uh for people who have watched this stream before you know this is a rare occurrence that everything goes like how i wanted it to go and quickly okay steven says jesse thanks for looking at the landmark site that floor plan popup build was a huge speed boost for us build wise oh awesome yeah that site was amazing uh so it was like reid was really cool i'm really glad you shared it with me uh let's see nikki says uh just dropping by to say hi hey assagor sorry you couldn't stick can't stick around but thanks for dropping by um nagendra asks for an angular project um i don't know angular so i can't really do an angular project but we do have some videos of people doing angular projects i don't think they're live streams but check the the video list for free code camp maybe do a search for angular i know we we've had some people do angular before um let's see somebody asked what i what am i gonna do i'm not gonna answer that because obviously you saw what i was gonna do so um microscope says hi from turkey hey how's it going thanks for watching uh luis says hello from guadalajara mexico uh awesome lovely with people from all over the world john doses bonjour from france otsm says 81 says hello from a noob from colorado how's it going i'm a noob from ohio originally from west virginia let's see m alvey says you're looking awesome superb thank you i appreciate that not sure if you're talking about my code or my face but either way i appreciate it somebody commented on one of my recent videos i think on my last video something like react.js is so ugly and i thought react.js is probably not ugly it's probably just my code right i'm sure there are people out there that can make it look pretty all right uh dash says what about the ujs i don't know vue one it would be cool one day to drive you out but for right now um my projects are done to react and it would have to be a side project like i'm it doesn't make sense for me to do one project and view for work when like everything we're creating is all react so we can reuse components and things so but i'm open to doing a side project with you but it would have to be something really basic because i've never used it before we do have some videos about views so you know again if you go to free code camp videos do a search for for view you know you'll find some some view tutorial videos and things john cortez says i'm new to coding i may not get what you'll be talking about but i'm here to learn as i'm changing my career to become a coder awesome awesome congratulations uh on the on the career change and uh yeah feel free to ask any questions uh if i'm kind of skipping by things too fast just you know ask me i'm more than happy to explain you know anything uh morillo says is it worth it to learn about canvas uh it depends on what you want to do i mean there are some instances where canvas is the right thing to use um but there's a like i personally never use canvas i've never come across a use case where canvas made sense for me to use so and and i've been a developer for like over five years now so i would say don't just learn canvas if you don't have to use it that would be my advice if you come like fig learn what canvas is and what it's good for and then leave it at that so then that way if you ever have a situation where canvas would be good at least you'll know that you should use canvas and then at that point you can learn more about canvas i mean if you have a lot of free time and you really just want to learn canvas you know go ahead but i don't think it's it's necessary all right john cortez says is coding boot camp worth it uh it can be it so it kind of depends on what kind of learner you are for me i just i was always working and learning at the same time i never had a period of time where i could dedicate all my time to a coding bootcamp uh so i when i started when i shifted my career into being a developer i already had a wife and kids and a mortgage payment and i so i couldn't full time like learn i just learned what i needed to do to get the job done for my clients so a boot camp was kind of out of the question for me at least like an intense boot camp so i did more like online courses a lot of free stuff a lot of just learning on my own but some people they thrive in that boot camp setting and they learn a lot quickly so you have to know yourself there also not all boot camps are the same some boot camps aren't really that good so you gotta you know do your research and you know figure out like do you have the time for the boot camp the money for the boot camp is that your learning style and then is that particular boot camp good so it's not really a question that i could i could answer in general you know okay uh ash axe says sorry i misprint might be mispronouncing that uh it says teach us how to code using mobile please we did do some streams using react native to code things for android and ios i'd love to get back to that at some point i just need to get this project launched i'm going to be honest with you this is going to be even once we launch this it's not going to be finished you know there's always going to be more things to do and to update but i would love to shift it so that our main project moves to something else for this stream potentially maybe a react native project um and then i do a lot of the work for this project right now kind of off the stream and i only come back to it when we're gonna add like some cool feature that i think you all be interested in um mlv says how much do you code in 24 hours oh it just depends it depends on the 24 hours so um there have been times when i've i've worked for like 14 hours uh like if i have to launch a project and there's a lot of stuff to do sometimes it's i've coded for that long before uh that's pretty extreme um and obviously there are some 24hour periods where i don't code at all but trying to get an average i don't know maybe like an average would be like five hours a day or something i don't know because i don't spend all day coding um i answer emails i do paperwork i go to meetings so it's it kind of depends um mlv asked about the github dark theme yeah if you just type in github dark uh theme on google it'll be the first thing that'll come up just follow the instructions and um yeah it's not it's not difficult i think there's several options for getting it to work too also asks uh we want we wanted to know more about yourself um let me know what specifically do you want to know i mean i can tell you a lot about myself but i if there's anything in particular let me know um and then i'll i'll answer that once i get down to the bottom there um ma'am alvey says what's your skills front end or back end so my title is front end developer but realistically i'm more like full stack now to be honest i say i probably do more front end than back end but we don't have somebody that's a back end so like node stuff is backend stuff right i do that i set up servers right i set up linux servers i do the maintenance on those servers i set up databases right so all that stuff i i do as well so i'm definitely not purely front end it just worked out that that's the title that that i had uh because at you know at the time it was i was mostly doing front end stuff so alright let's just you know let's go with front end um john cortez asked about my application for coding and i was using visual studio code um mlb says does anyone have a slack workspace for coding help um i don't know do we have a slack channel i'm not sure we've had some channels like chat chat room things and um but i'm not they're not really that active but if anybody knows of some sort of like slack channel for coding help you know uh please let uh m alvi uh no let's see um john cortez says is what jesse is doing now something that can be learned within that threemonth boot camp um maybe i it depends so michael had a good answer says if you're starting from zero javascript knowledge it might take a while to build up if you have knowledge in javascript um you should be able to pick it up yeah i i totally agree with that answer um yeah if you're starting from zero it's gonna be hard to get here in in three months um i'm not saying what i'm doing is spectacular or anything but it just it takes time you know to get to there uh so yeah but if you're already good with javascript and it's just a matter of learning how to do things with react yeah three months is definitely reasonable and it's hard to say sometimes it depends on the person you know if you're like a genius who knows what you could do uh so john says should i uh john cortez says should i concentrate on learning html and javascript yeah for sure um if yeah start out if you go to the free code camp curriculum so if you go to freecodecamp.org and you start the curriculum that's a good place to start go through it'll teach you about html css and then it'll get you into javascript and it will ease you in you know so you you get you know that knowledge builds and then you work your way up into more difficult things you'll learn a little react so that's kind of a good path to go and then you can supplement your learning with with other materials um michael said this seems like it should be factored out yeah yeah for sure i think it should be too all right m4t says what is that program that you use i'm assuming you're talking about visual studio code okay all right michael asked what's the graphic on my mug okay so here's my my mug so this is uh it says fatherhood the best job uh you'll ever love okay so and then on the back here it has um st joseph uh holding baby jesus and mary uh taking a nap in the background so i don't remember who got me this mug but i work at a a catholic university so it's definitely appropriate i think i got this like when i first became a father so my oldest is nine years old so i've had it for a while here but in case you don't know i have four children uh jai jainam it's jainam please let me know if i'm pronouncing that wrong i i want to get it right but anyway it says what is the salesforce api uh salesforce api is just a way to get data from salesforce and put data into salesforce by making um well api calls right so you make like an http request and you can use the uh the api let me know if i need to explain that a little bit more so it may not depending on your level of understanding right now i may need to explain a little bit more so i'm happy to do that if you need me to kendo says hello from japan hey how's it going you know i i rarely get viewers from japan so that's really awesome thanks for letting me know um says what is codeigniter framework developer uh codeigniter is i believe codeigniter is php i think it's a php uh like framework or something so i from what i understand it's it's kind of old but i i haven't used it i a colleague of mine has used it before and that's the only i just remember him talking about it uh ivan says hi can you show how to hide and show content text in html with buttons thanks in advance uh congrats from uh bulgaria well hi and welcome um if you want to show and hide uh text in html with buttons uh you could it depends on what you want to do right you could use just overall like you would want to use javascript to tell when that button gets clicked and then when that button gets clicked uh you could change the css of that button to use um you know to show or hide so it would be like um display none or display block you could toggle that uh if you were using and you could use jquery for that you could use vanilla javascript if you were using react you would want to change the state uh on a button click um and then you could just render it based on like uh if the state for this equals true render it otherwise don't render it right so there's there's different ways you could do it it kind of depends on what what you want to use so i mean that's kind of a big overview for that uh if you want to know like specifically what code you would type um you know your best bet is probably like just doing check and stack overflow or something uh because it it does kind of depend on what you want to use stephen says every feature you do is cool hashtag hype thank you i appreciate that um bogdan says hi can i become in six months a junior developer oh yeah for sure i mean obviously it depends on how much you know now and uh you know how quickly you can learn things but i think it's definitely possible in six months michael says i didn't realize you set up servers too uh you really need to get a title change yeah yeah i guess i should it hasn't i don't even remember when i got this title to be honest with you so maybe it has been a while maybe i should try to get a change we'll see maybe i'll wait until they give me like employees that to work under me and then i'll then i'll go for the title chains uh microscope says i know how to learn programming but i don't know what to do i need an idea also i'm too used to visual studio code this program perfect in atom or sublime i'm not sure what you're asking uh you're saying you don't know what to do you need an idea so are you saying you you don't really have an idea of what to build or what's it what to make uh if you just google like app ideas there are websites out there that give you a ton of like ideas of things to build so those will give you some ideas um also i i do like visual studio code i never use sublime i did use adam and i switched to visual studio code i think visual studio code is a bit faster than that atom but atom is still good i i used it for years so i think either one would be a good choice i just i happen to prefer visual studio code at the moment oh michael has confirmed that cody knighter is php based okay so ivan says uh yes to to do the show hide thing in javascript um yeah if you wanted to do it in just plain vanilla javascript you have no jquery no react anything like that um then you're gonna be using um i mean i guess off the top of my head like you're gonna be selecting elements with document.getelementbyid you want to grab the ids and then say what the click is so you would need to get like a click handler right uh if i'm assuming you click the buttons and then like depending i think i can't remember what is vanilla javascript way for changing css but that's how that's how you would do it you would use javascript to change the css i mean potentially you could completely add or remove those elements from the page but i don't know that i would go to all that i would i would probably just use display display none or like michael says you could do visibility hidden too if you want that would also work the only thing about visibility hidden is if your your text takes up space and you do visibility hidden like that space will still be there uh you just won't see the text if you don't want that space there then you want to do display none because it'll totally you know take away any space that it'll take up correct me if i'm wrong about that but i i believe that's that's how that functions um gia says is this project nearly finished how do you think how long do you think it's going to take i hope we're nearly finished i mean we're very very close to being able to launch i'm talking like within a matter of weeks we can we can launch for sure maybe maybe sooner i mean i i just have other stuff going on that i can't launch it so if i had all my time to dedicate to it we could probably have a launch next week but i i don't um yeah so i mean in terms of launch pretty soon in terms of finished i'm it's never going to be finished this is going to be the thing that i'm constantly working on and updating uh so you know this is just like this project is basically going to be a big part of my job now from here on out i'm constantly going to be updating it uh kendo says what are you using for seo for react should i be using something like next.js yeah if you need to worry about seo which is search engine optimization i definitely recommend using something like next js it doesn't have to be you just need to server side render your code otherwise search engines are not going to be able to pick up any of the the stuff that you're trying to pull in from an api so um the api calls usually take too long if you're trying to do a client side and the search engines won't stick around long enough to actually see that that data come in so you you want a server side render so that when someone first goes to your site they get just regular html all the contents there and then when they start clicking around in its clientside routing happening then you know that's cool you can you can do stuff on client side uh so i personally i like doing both it's kind of like best of both worlds you get that speed of clientside routing you know but you also get that really quick initial load that's uh search engine friendly so next js takes care of a lot of the the background stuff of making that happen for you so i do i do like using uh next.js for that michael says how do you get free code cam projects on github you just have to you know make a github account and create a new repo and then do your your project so i'm not sure how familiar you are with git and github so you might need to maybe do a course or read up on that first sorry i think yawn i always yawned during the streams today hasn't been too bad i've been fighting holding back of the yawns um tushar says can you recommend some projects for intermediate programmers in php um i i don't really know i would recommend again like um just googling project ideas like php project ideas because there are a lot of them out there and you probably get a nice big list and just pick pick the ones that you like oh michael creole says on click uh so michael cruz says create a css class to do the uh dot add class on click cool thanks michael that's straightforward enough right uh m m ray it's emre so i'm not sure how to pronounce that it says i've been i've coding experience for two years and i know c and c plus so how much time uh to learn javascript css and html uh and i'm from turkey well hello this is the second person uh they said they're from turkey so uh welcome yeah if you already know c and c plus plus i don't think it's going to be that difficult to pick up a new language because you already have all those programming concepts down right uh you know your basic things are like like arrays loops um like the concepts of of what is a variable like all those things that seem really easy once you pick them up you know to a total beginner it's it's difficult to you know to wrap your mind around that so you're already starting at an advantage so i like it i can't really say it'll take this long because it just depends like how many hours a day do you have uh how quick can you pick things up like there's just a lot of factors but i think you'll have a much easier time than than you know someone else you know who's doesn't know about programming machine says is there some tool to transpile jquery into plain old javascript so your clients don't have to download an extra file i don't really know that would kind of be a pretty useful tool though but i don't i've never heard of anything like that existing i don't see why it couldn't though i mean if we can transpile um you know newer versions of javascript back to es5 i guess they could do the same thing for jquery but but to my knowledge it doesn't exist i've never heard of it uh john cortez says thanks for answering my questions looking forward to watching more your videos aloha and mahalo from los angeles cool i'm so glad that um i could be of some service to you and yeah definitely i hope you can join again for some some live and more live chats and stuff and yeah feel free to keep asking questions and let's see uh dante says i am i am dan from kenya enjoy the enjoying the live feed really learned a lot how can i improve my react skills uh really just practice right i mean it it doesn't hurt to read up on documentation and like watch tutorials and things but the thing that's going to help you to get better the the quickest route is just keep building try every day if you can um to just build a little bit work with it uh and then you know as like the little things in react and the syntax the way to do things become like natural and you just have it in your mind all the time then it'll free up that brain power to start thinking like higher level of i'm gonna do more advanced things right and you'll start to build up on that and and you'll get better like like that michael says after a year of watching you uh i think i finally started to feel like i know what i'm talking about maybe sooner or later i'll actually apply for a job well i'm glad that i could i could help in that way yeah and go for it go for for a job um you know to get a job in coding all you need to do is convince somebody that you can do it right that uh you know and then you're ready and you're always gonna learn on the job and anybody that's hiring a developer that knows what they're doing will know that they're not hiring you because of what you already know they're gonna hire you because of what you're gonna continue to learn because things just change too fast right you even if you find somebody that knows everything that you want them to know in a couple months it's going to be outdated already so that's the that's the key so don't worry if you don't know everything yet as long as you can prove that that you you know what you're doing and that you can learn quickly that's that's what people want or at least that's what they should want if they know what they're doing uh dante says plus how much do i need to have in my portfolio to get at least junior frontend position i don't know if there's really you know a number uh but you know i would say you know have a few prizes so it's better to have maybe like three good projects that you've actually finished and built than you know like a dozen projects that that aren't really great and that you never finished right it's way more impressive to show somebody something that actually works and looks nice okay so quality is i think more important than quantity here so that would be my advice i mean personally from having reviewed resumes to hire developers before you know i i wasn't looking for have you done a million projects you know i i wanted to see i i could look at one project and if it was a big project and it was good like that's that's proof right so um i would try you know like more than one would be good i'm thinking like at least three would be nice uh showcasing maybe some different skills but don't go crazy with a lot of projects unless you have time to really do them well let's see john hanson says when refactoring a function in react and reffing state uh written const a state equals this state uh returns all states and component returns only a say why i am not sure ah you know what we ran into some issue with this recently in a previous stream i'm not sure how to describe it and what language to use but that a similar thing just happened so i'm sorry i can't explain why it happens like that uh i just i got it to work and i never looked up why so if anybody else knows i guess how to explain why that happens uh please put it put it in the the live chat uh kendo says uh how do we know when these live streams start uh probably well number one subscribe to free code cams youtube channel and um make sure you turn on notifications occasionally i do stream on my personal channel there's a link in the description if you subscribe to that you know you'll get notifications from that as well you can also follow me on twitter uh and or instagram i uh usually put before i i almost always notify everybody on both of those platforms before i do a stream so those are the main ways to know whether or not i'm i'm going to do a live stream uh two sources how to improve problem solving skills do problems right solve problems practice is definitely a way to do it there are some techniques so you could read up on techniques on how to solve like coding algorithm challenges and things so it's like some systematic steps so definitely try that but i think the most important thing is practice try to do an algorithm challenge like once a day you know just start out your day with you know an algorithm challenge and um you know make sure you get that practice in uh utku says i i just wanted to thank you for your time oh you're welcome i appreciate you saying that um mlv says uh are you front end or back end developer uh yeah i'm i don't know i guess the most accurate right now would probably be full stack if i do more front end than back end and my official title is front end but it's not exactly accurate let's see um mlb says parcel versus webpack what build tool is good i've never used parcel i use webpack i like webpack um i don't mess with configuring webpack myself though um i always use like the preconfigured stuff with either create react app or uh next js but i just i can't really comment on parcel because i haven't used it uh mlb says what is your youtube channel uh check the description of the video i have a link to it in there i can't it's jesse why if you look up jesse weigle on youtube it'll come up okay michael said that that issue so the issue that john hansen was just talking about it was on my last stream that i had that uh mr says thanks for answering my questions um and what should i start simple javascript or javascript frameworks like react angular what do you think which is best for me um start with some simple javascript before you move into a framework so you don't have to go crazy and learn everything but it'd be good just to get some of the basics down the syntax you know and before you jump right into a framework so you know that's my advice if you're going to start like taking on clients and stuff and you need to use a framework then you know go go for it you know it's it's not like it's gonna really you know hurt you as long as you continue to just keep learning as you go um zx says did you ever make voice activated programs uh like sappyspeak i did do an alexa an amazon uh alexa skill before so that's kind of the only thing that i've done that's voice activated and it was really basic it was just a um like a trivia quiz you could ask it to give you trivia it was it was a trivia quiz with trivia from my hometown so it would just give you a couple of different facts about my hometown uh mlb says should i use any css framework these days um i get it depends like if you're doing react i really like material ui if you're just doing some plain javascript stuff or jquery stuff maybe you want to go with bootstrap if you like material design style go with materialize some other good ones that i've never used but i heard are good or like foundation um what else actually i can't it's been a while since i've um i've already worked with any of those yeah but i mean you don't have to use a css framework but it definitely saves a lot of time uh mlb says how much javascript do i need to know to understand react you definitely need at least the basics of javascript to understand react so the more javascript you know the better you're going to be with react so you don't need to know everything but you're definitely better off learning more okay so steven says learn javascript first i'm about to start react myself i have a friend that is in a react bootcamp that knows no javascript and is struggling hard okay yeah def yeah you definitely want to know uh some some of it uh michael says no i was making a joke i don't i don't know where that was at when was that i don't even remember what it what it was or you're making a joke um hey javascript is here what's up uh mlb says is mernstag good for 2018 um so mursack is what um express react node is that it mongodb i think that's mirnstack it stands for that uh so yeah i mean i think mernstack is still valid for sure um let's see uh tushar says do you also work with react native issues than with expo or plane react native i've done both i prefer using xbow because it's it's pretty easy to um you know get it going on an actual phone like and see the results so i i do like using expo but um i have done both okay so mlv says yeah mern stack is express react node so mongodb for your database um express express is like uh a node plugin um to help run like your back end um with this node being javascript running server side and then react um would be which you use to build your your app and the stuff that the client sees right let's see uh mlb says do you use facebook yeah i am on facebook if you want to follow me on facebook feel free i just don't really ever post anything okay all right let's see what time it is oh okay well i just got to the end of the live chat and i i have to go to a meeting in a few minutes so uh i'm gonna finish up here i i don't know if i'm gonna be able to stream until next week uh so if i guess have a great week everyone uh i'll try to give some updates um on twitter and um instagram from my conference and yeah so thank you all so much for joining me uh all the discussion was really great and yeah so i'll miss you all um hopefully i get to uh get to interact with some of you on social media uh this upcoming week but uh so until then have a great day uh have a great week and thanks again
