everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're gonna make some react components still on that same project that we've been working on but we need some new components so first thing I'm gonna do is just kind of break down what we need where these components are going to be used and then we'll figure out the best way to to lay them out to pull in the data and we'll see how much we can get done in about an hour maybe two Pomodoro sessions also at some point I'll give everybody an update on my my job search and interviews that I've had interviews have coming up and answer any questions that that you all have so let me get my chat window out so I can see what you're saying hey everybody okay it looks like Sreenivasan it's their first time so hey welcome glad you could join us Harsha it's here hey how's it going a lot of people saying hey just saying everybody and let's go with switch this up nope that's not it where's mine there we go Hey alright we have a couple of firsttimers here so if it is your first time this is how it'll go I'll put a Commodore o timer on so it'll be a 25 minute timer I'll stick mostly to the code for 25 minutes then I'll take a little break answer some questions and then we'll go back and forth at the end of the stream I'll answer any questions that are left I do have an interview a phone interview for a job at 1230 my time so that gives me about two hours a little less than two hours so there's going to be a hard limit on how long I can do questions so I can go on that interview but let me show you actually this isn't what I want to show you first I want to show you this so I had someone messaged me on Twitter Hampus Algrim who's creating this and I thought it was pretty cool so it's side view dot app I'll link it in the description here but you can check it out but it seems like you can just kind of drag and drop some code over here and it runs your JavaScript code live and lets you play with all the CSS and the variables the JavaScript variables and things so it looks pretty cool and he said that he's hoping to get a version of it out in November so anyway just thought I would highlight that because he asked me to look at it and it looked kind of cool all right let's let's start off the Pomodoro timer and then I'll show you what we're working on where's my I guess I have to do it here so I'm gonna go to localhost I'm also going to start a end grok server so that you all can check this out as I'm working on it I'm gonna paste a link in here and if you click that link or copy and paste that link into your browser you can see the website as I'm working on it there's also a test version available and that's at GCPD Franciscan University but this one will be the most uptodate since it'll mirror what we're working on here so this is what we need let me let me just give you kind of a preview of what our options in terms of what components we already have it could maybe use some pieces of them so a good education faculty I'll show you some cards that we're currently using okay so we're gonna create cards that could potentially be similar to this I call these like horizontal cards usually so we would have an image over here and then a little bit of text we could do this but I'm thinking potentially maybe we could also switch it up and have the image on the top and the text on the bottom and have more like a vertical card the reason being we're gonna have more text content than we do here so I think it would look better with more text if we did it the other way but we could potentially use these and it would be pretty easy to use these so we will have cards similar to this but instead of faculty members we're going to have former students so alumni of the university will have their picture will have their name will have what program they were in so business education you know whatever and then there's gonna be a little a little bit of text just maybe a paragraph of them explaining pretty whatever whatever quote we have from them so we need space for all of that and we we may also have a link we can probably leave the link out for now because we don't have a ton of info I'd like to get all the info on one card and so there wouldn't really be a need to link to an entire page for that that person I do see some questions coming in in the chat so if you have questions I'm not ignoring you but I'm just gonna wait until the timer goes off and then I'm gonna answer the question so if you get hanging a little bit or if you can't hang in there right now you can always come back and watch the recording and I'll answer your question at some point so for now in about 22 minutes I can get to your questions so that's basically what I'm trying to do with these this card component we need to display it on its own page like this so you we'll be able to go to a alumni outcomes page and just see a list of all the alumni similar to what we have here it also needs to be displayed on the home page let's go back to the home page down here we're gonna have a section below this financial aid section and it'll have you know potentially maybe like three depending on the screen size it will have maybe three cards across of alumni and we'll figure out you know who the featured alumni will be maybe we'll have a featured category and those will show up we don't need to figure that out right now and then I'd also like it to display on each department home page so we have pages for I guess we just go back to education I believe we have a page for education okay so we have this education page I like down here to have a section and it would automatically grab whatever alumni we have that graduated with an education degree just show up here if there are none then nothing would show up but it'd be good to have that automatically fill out not only for education but for any of the the major program pages okay so that's the plan let's get to the code so I've been looking a little bit about at the code for those cards that we currently have you can see it I have basic let me make this bigger it's probably way too small let's move this over for right now make some space here okay so I have a graph QL query if you're not familiar with graph QL queries you can ask a question and I'll explain them a little bit later but basically all this is doing is just getting some data particularly we want the name of the the alum we want what department they were in and we want that content of what what is there quote what's there their little paragraph okay so that's what we want and then down here we're just getting that data and for this particular component we're looping through all that data and we're we're adding to the Dom these these cards right so for now I actually am using this same faculty cards that we just saw so that's going to be our starting point just to see I figure since we have that card built it's worth it to see if that content would even fit there I don't think it will but it's only going to take us a few minutes to test it and it could save us you know a lot of time if it does work so let's do that right now we're passing in most of the data but we still need to pass in a the content so let's call this content and we'll go alumni node and I believe it is called content but we'll doublecheck yep content all right so let's save that and now we need a way to get to this this page this alumni list page so we're gonna go to our server EJ yes and let's find where we have alumni so alumni outcomes is the the path at the end of our URL and we want that to go to alumni list so instead of going to our default page component we're gonna make this go to our alumni list component now and I don't really expect this to work on the first try if it does that'll be awesome yeah I'll come alright cool so it didn't work let's see in variant outcomes alright I figured that might be the case so I wasn't sure exactly what format to do this over yet let's get rid of some of this stuff okay so it wasn't sure what format to put this query in because normally we have a separate a whole separate file for our queries but I thought I'd try to do it in line since we haven't done that before and I just guessed what format we put it in so let's whip that up you know really quick here so your fq o query component let's see this is the apollo which we're using apollo so this is the apollo documentation and let's see oh okay you know what i forgot this gql so I have to bring in gql which I don't think I'm bringing in will import gql it won't put that here and then that should that should fix our our problem so let's import it and let's get rid of this import and this import since we're not using them anymore we're brought in gql and then now we'll say gql I believe that's what all we need yep GQ Oh wonderful and we can pop that on the next line it would look nicer give it a little indentation alright that should work make sure our brackets are right I think they are right I checked them out earlier so let's say that to what we have now all right and it doesn't work since X our alumnae outcomes okay so the problem here is maybe our alumni data is not quote alumni outcomes let's check that out so we have the code on github for our our graph QL plugin or I should say our WordPress plugin that has a lot of it's doing a lot of different things one of the things that's doing is hooking up our custom post types to graph QL so we'll just check that here and I'll search for alumni outcomes there it is and our graph QL name our single name is outcome or we have outcomes so maybe it's looking for let's see what do we use we use plural maybe it's looking for singular maybe we'll try the singular no same problem my outcome let me check the chat to see if there's some obvious problem that I'm having here actually I just got hey uh let me let me address this right now so hamro says I'm 17 and this is an all caps I'm 17 in a dropout which should I do kill myself hammer oh definitely don't do that all right so don't kill yourself I would say take a deep breath right now and calm down you have a long life ahead of you and you can do a lot of awesome things so number one I would say find somebody you can talk to maybe a counselor doctor or somebody and tell them what you're thinking about so definitely do that before anything else immediately don't don't wait but also you're only 17 years old a lot of awesome things can still happen to you in particular if you learn coding it doesn't really matter if you have a degree you know at least here in the United States that it definitely doesn't matter you can still make money you could freelance making websites right now and still make money there are so many awesome things that could happen you know you could you could end up getting a degree you could end up having multiple degrees if that's what you want to do you could go to a trade school like there's something you could just not go to school at all and still be fine right it's it's entirely possible I got a brother that he just cuts people's grass he does landscaping he just got a really old truck and made enough money to buy this truck and a couple of lawn mowers and he goes around it does that and and he makes a living doing that in the wintertime he shovels people so so you know he's able to pay his rent and pay for everything just like that and you know he doesn't degree for that or anything so basically I'm saying is when you're seventeen it thinks it might be harder to see things in perspective but I'm 30 I'm almost 33 I'll be 33 at the end of the month and let me tell you like you have so much ahead of you don't even think about about ending it now so hammer oh I hope you're still there and I hope you heard that if you if you are still there I want you to get my info in the description so I'm on Instagram my YouTube channels there my twitter is there okay message me on there let me know you're all right next time I'm streaming try to come in and let us know you're all right if you want more help getting in touch with a counselor or something let me know I can help you find one if anybody else has any advice in this let us know in the in the chat and hamro I dropped out of college twice and and still ended up getting a degree and I have family a wife where kids job like I have a house so it's uh it's okay just because you drop out it it's it's not the you know it you you haven't ruined your life for anything it's you're totally fine okay that was that was pretty serious I thought I should address that so I'm gonna go back to the code now but I'm gonna keep an eye on the chat tomorrow in case you you message back and I'm serious about reaching out to me okay alright so I had come into a little bit of an issue where it wasn't recognizing the name what I was what I was trying to do here so I pulled that query out of C I pulled this out of a different larger query so I'm guessing it's probably something to do with my syntax that I'm using so let's see oh yes here we are I need some more curly brackets right the solution to so many problems in JavaScript or in this case graph QL seem to just be curly brackets right semicolons and curly brackets that's okay whoa all right we got a different error this progress that's good Wow unknown argument last unfilled alumni outcome Wow all right let's see I do want to check and see whether it should be the singular or the plural cannot query field major program on type alumni outcome good okay so that's I think that's that's what we want so let's try this again all right good we got another error this is a good area this means that C we've gotten something back from graph QL and departments okay we don't want okay I see what happened since we got this query from somewhere else we've kind of copied over an existing component it was set up improperly so let's see we don't want data alumni departments we want data I believe we'll be okay with this let's see if that works we could use our property node of undefined let's let's use our graphical plugin for Chrome I think it's this one yeah let's use this and then we'll be able to see what we're getting and if we're even getting the right thing okay cool so we are getting the right thing here and it is in the form of data and everything's within data so it should have data alumnae outcomes edges okay so that's yeah we got a should be able to say yet when we loop through edges then it'll be known okay so what we want to find is alumni outcomes edges here there we go let's see how that works hey okay it worked awesome so whoa this is a lot more data in here than I thought there would be Wow okay cool so we have images that they're actually displaying pretty well I mean these images are in various formats and all of them are the like the face of the person is clearly visible okay I like that all right not bad so we are pulling in the name and we have this learn more link which will probably get rid of but we don't have the content being displayed so let's let's do that so what we'll do and we're gonna add something in here to our faculty list item so we're gonna add in content as a as a prop where we're destructuring here and then within our card we're gonna say right below this this job title which we're not gonna have let's do let's just copy this and we're gonna check to see here's what we'll do we're gonna check to see if content exists if it does exist and we've passed in content as a prop then we're going to render this component and we're going to render content we're gonna pass it through this decode HTML function and right now we have typography going as its this as a span we do have some styles going on that will probably change the styles but for now we're just this is just a test so let's see what we have it is this is probably gonna look pretty weird yeah okay and yeah it's terrible okay so this is definitely not gonna work Wow yeah some of these are just damn inline Styles yeah so what we need to do instead of passing it to this decode HTML which is not meant to handle all that HTML would probably want to do the dangerously set inner HTML okay and two minutes I'm gonna go back to the chat so hang in there if you have questions okay so let's go with dangerously set inner you know what forget it I'm not gonna go with it because it's it's very very obvious that this is not these this style of card is not going to be able to handle that much that much text content I mean even if we made the cards way bigger what I'm afraid would happen is at some point like there we just have to be white space at the top at the bottom of these images and it's not gonna look right whereas if we do the vertical cards they could expand down without messing with the dimensions of the image so that's what we're going to do let's get rid of our changes here since we're not use this component anymore and let's make a new component and that's the component that we're gonna use with this data if so let's just start with a totally blank component I usually copy and don't do that but maybe it'll be fun to just do something you know right from from scratch so let's go up here to our components and let's add a new file and let's call this alumni card and my time is almost up so what will bring in is will import react because we're gonna need react and see what else we'll need nothing right now let's take a short break and I'm gonna scroll up to the top answer as many questions as I can in five minutes we'll do one more sesh one more Pomodoro session of coding available hi from Istanbul from India awesome welcome psychotic face says my question is will you marry me I'm already married so in in the United States where I'm from you can't be married to two people at once so I sorry if you would ask me like 15 years ago maybe but I can't right now let's see Yusef says you make react look easy I I don't know why I can't understand react reacts I would say first of all I've been working with react for a long time in you know JavaScript land so like I don't know maybe two years now I can't remember exactly so I've been working with it for a while and I struggled with it a lot and I'd still struggle with many things so don't worry if you don't get react right now if you don't understand it just keep practicing you will you will get it we're kind of jumping in in an already developed project that we've been working on for months and months so I can understand why it would be tricky to understand what's you know what's going on then she says how can we lazy load components with loading animations I don't know that's I would want to know a little bit more specifically about what you're using every I assume we're talking about react here so if you give me a little bit more detail about your particular application then maybe I can give you a better answer but I that's kind of broad we have checking in from Kenya hey how's it going Oh more firsttimers welcome okay I'm she's just as lazy loading and react please explain okay so if you're gonna try to lazy load and react number one if I was gonna lazy learn something I'd look to see if there are already a package out there that I could just use that would handle that for me hey that number one that's that's not the kind of thing I would want to code myself if I was gonna code it myself you would need to track your scrolling on your page right so you would need to set up an event listener to track the scroll position and you need to track the position of the potential position of what you're going to load and then set it up so that when you get to a certain scroll position and you probably would track this through state right so you would get renders when you get to a certain position then you load that right and react and since this is react gonna say you won't you want to load that through stay so potentially like when you get to the certain position you trigger a state change when that state change it could just be like a boolean right true/false we're gonna load this we're gonna not load this well normally when the page first loads it's a false once you get to a certain point in the page it flips over to true you get a rerender and you load that that bit of of content right so that's how you would lazy load an entire component if you're talking about maybe just lazy loading like an image within a component again my first thing would be go to an existing library okay but if you're gonna do it react you know it would it would be similar really it doesn't matter whether it's an actual react component or just an element inside of a component either way I would use state and track your scroll to handle that hopefully that makes sense live hi from Nepal today the as s says minimum computer knowledge required for programming you gotta know how to turn it on how to install things on your computer how to type and you can get started I mean it's really really minimal you there in browser things that can teach you how to code so you don't really need anything special in terms of computer knowledge you just need to know how to navigate to a web page and then it'll start you off like free code camp will start you off really you're kind of at a low level if you really just need something very very basic you could try scratch search for scratch programming and you don't even really need to know how to type for scratch it's just draganddrop blocks but it can teach you the basics of programming you without even being able to code so what I'm sorry without even being able to type it's really good for for kids but it's also a nice introduction for adults in fact in the harbor is computer science 50 course intro to computer science the first week they have you build something in scratch so it's it's you know it's being used to teach collegeage students and and above so yeah so I don't be intimidated by getting into programming they're very very simple ways to get started where you need almost no previous knowledge okay my timers up obviously didn't get through all of the questions I see one here at the bottom that I'll answer right now said it from david says jesse you're gonna stream on your personal account today I'm thinking about it so last week I did do two streams on Monday one for free code camp and one on my personal account the links in the description if you're interested you can check out that channel subscribe if you want to get notified when I'm doing videos of going live I might do it so I have a take home coding challenge for a job that I applied for with I believe it was with framed IO in New York City so I would like to stream me doing that that take home problem so they they told me that they expected to take for candidates to spend no more than four hours on it so you know I'll try to stream a little bit of it at least we'll see how it goes though but I might do that this afternoon at some point so Eastern Time this afternoon if you're interested in seeing that it's not gonna be react it's gonna be vanilla JavaScript I'm allowed to use jQuery but I think I'm going to try to do it all with vanilla JavaScript so if you want to see it drop down menu that you can navigate with your like an autocomplete dropdown menu that you can navigate with your arrow keys done in vanilla JavaScript then subscribe to my channel links in the description and I will be livestreaming that hopefully at some point today okay let's reset our timer we're going to do one more Pomodoro timer with this we'll see how much we can get done and so here's where we're going we're gonna build a react component that's going to be a a card component so material design card with an image in it now here's what we can do we're using material you eyes or UI framework we can and should check out wood as material you I already implemented it that can help us right so we don't do that's one of the main reasons to use a UI library so you don't have to build all these from scratch they've done it so let's check out material you I it is just material UI com copy and paste that and in the live chat so that links in there now and let's just check out card alright so we have different types of cards we have a simple card which it's not what we want we have a media card and let's see that that looks like what we need right we need a media card and let's see what it says by default we use a combination of a development and a background image to display the media it can be problematic in some situations for instance you might want to display video or a responsive image use the component properties use case okay I think I would much rather have the image be an actual image tag as opposed to a background on a div the one of the main reasons being a background on a div is not gonna get picked up by a screen reader so if someone who's using a screen reader would try to go through the content it's not gonna register like here's an image and here's the description of an image right we can't put an alt tag on a background in CSS so let's use this second example which I'm hoping that this will add an image tag it looks like it it will will use the component property image and then we'll get an image tag I'm also hoping that we had lets us put an alt tag it looks like at least we can have a title okay so that's that's better better than nothing so I'm hoping it would just pass these along so let's see we can copy and paste all of this so oh yeah let's let's copy and paste this whole thing for now and see how it looks right see how awesome this is right we have all this to work with you know by default and what we'll do then object fit is not supported okay let's save that for now and then what we can do is go back to our alumni list and instead of importing faculty list item let's import oops we do need to change this so instead of image media card let's change this to what do we call this alumni card so we caught it alumni card you know what I need to rename this so that we stick with our naming convention of capitalized component names so alumni card and then we're gonna export alumni card here okay so we definitely would change that for now we'll leave everything else the same and then in our alumni list let's change faculty list items so every instance of faculty list item will now be changed to alumni card okay and we're gonna pass in all this stuff which shouldn't it shouldn't make a difference if we pass the stuff right now because we're not not actually gonna use any of it so we should still get rendered the card whether it's a default data will just get rendered as many times as we have pieces of data okay cool so it's not bringing in obviously the image I'm assuming they used a relative path for the image so that's not gonna work but we can see our card so it works to render this and we will need to bring over some of the the other stuff that that we've been using so I'd like to bring over our grid system that we had that we had in place should we do that I don't think if we should use the grid system within the card component or not you know I think it's better if we don't put a grid system in the card it'll make our component more versatile right so what we can do though is add our grid system to our list component so that's what we're gonna do let's copy and paste some grid some of this grid system into here so since it's inside our loop or map it's it's going to be as if it was in the component but we're not locked into using the same grid system for every time we use this alumnae card which we're gonna try to recycle this alumni card and use it in at least three locations in the website so this is I think definitely a much better way to go so we have this grid item and we already have this inside a grid container so that's fine we have the grid container we need to move over the class name of classes card so we have this down here whereas our class's card you know what height and max width actually I I don't think I'm gonna bring that over I'd like to see what we get without setting our hide max width just for now so for now let's take out that class name we got all the red squiggles because of indentation so we should I'll save it it should Auto indent and it'll get rid of these red squiggles hopefully it needs a key the key drop we got that on the wrong so let's remove that key prop from there and put the key on here instead there we are all right that looks a lot better so when you are going through data and adding multiples of the same component to a page and react it you need to have a key prop that's unique for each one otherwise you're going to get a warning so won't error out and crash your application but you look at a bunch of warnings all right let's see how that looks now okay that's a lot better and so we have three across so now that we have a different type of card we definitely could switch up how we're displaying this and let's let's add in an image that is actually going to display so we already are bringing in this image object let's add it into our alumni card so that we can display that image instead of this this image that's obviously not working so let's see how we did it here let's pull over a lot of these these props so I'm just gonna copy over all of this and let's start adding these in here so for our headline we're gonna want to use and we can use yeah let's pull over our decode HTML as well just in case we run into some issues with with special characters and things so we can use you know for instance for a profile name we can pop decode HTML in here and have our profile name in there for our content we're gonna add it inside of here it's not well let's just copy this for now and put it in here and let's switch it up and call this content and let's make sure we add content let's take out job title we're not gonna use job title and we're not gonna have a profile link for now we have this image object coming in and we pass in the whole object and then we check so we have multiple attributes on this image object that we can use so that's what we pass in the whole object so I do want to keep this check to make sure we have an image object because we know some pieces of data that we've looked at before don't have images so if it looks for the image and there is no image it's gonna crash it's not gonna render so we need to check first to see if we have an image so I'm gonna grab uh you know what we have this card media let's just type it out by hand so we're gonna check for the image object and so this is like a shortcircuit operator so what JavaScript is gonna do when it evaluates an end statement is it's only gonna look at the other side of the end if the first one is true so it'll look at this and say let's go over to this side since we're actually doing something it'll look at this and say does an image object exist like yes or no or is it true Falls right so if not it's just gonna stop and it's gonna go on to the next thing so it won't even look at anything in here if it is true it's gonna go over here and it's gonna look at the other side on the other side we're telling it to render this component right so this is a shorthand way of using a ternary or an if statement so it's it saves you a lot of space inside a react component so I use that frequently okay so if there's an image object let's render this media this card media otherwise we're not going to render it at all and then within this we can get this for our source we can get the image object and then the source URL from the image object whoops put that on the wrong thing class name there we are okay so let's get rid of this static address here and now we're gonna get our source URL from here it's setting the height I'll leave that for now but I'm not sure that's gonna work in our title for now let's just throw in our our alt text as our title but we'll probably change that up okay why is it still giving me this expecting annotation of 12 all right it's an indentation thing all right doesn't want me to wrap this see what it's doing okay cool so we have our images right now I'm just making sure the images show up so I this is crazy so our images are rendering right conditionally depending on whether they're there or not not just the image but that that whole section so if we looked at the code you know all of the the divs and everything that's containing this image would be gone as well we're just not rendering it at all but it looks like so far these images are displaying properly you know there's some like you know maybe that's kind of cut off a little bit yeah so some of these are a little bit off so it may want to do is maybe give a give a little more height here you know allow a little more but we also have to think about like in terms of width like what would happen with with oh yeah so this is cut off okay all right so the images are need a little bit of work I'm trying to find a more reasonable length here but it looks like all of these are okay this is a more reasonable link I could I can live with this if if we had content that was maybe this length it's okay hmm okay this length is good this length is good this is little much at least if we're gonna keep it this this narrow okay let's make these a little bit wider and give our images a little bit more room so right now it's the height is being set to 140 let's bump that up to 200 and see what happens you know let's see what as if we just leave the hide off completely and then let's check our our grid oh yeah so here let's save that and then let's also check our grid which should be on what alumni list yeah okay I think we can switch this up and at least have four claws here I think we could do three okay so we have a column system in this grid so full width is twelve columns so in extra small screens we actually do have full width but on a large screen right now we want these to take up three columns so that means it would be let's try four on here small with the six so basically we would have three combs which means we can fit four cards across on a large screen this one would be only three cards on a medium screen two cards on a small screen an extra small screen should be like a phone we can only fit one so you'll see what I mean in a second when we refresh this okay so now we have a little bit more space our images should have let's see what's going on here okay interesting just make sure images we took out that height let's see what's happening here let's inspect this and see what's going on I want to see if it's still adding a height I don't see it there let's see if there's a a height attribute on any of these no we're good so maybe that Heights just being determined by the width or my hat there it is I was on here okay let's go back here and see what's happening also with our width okay our spacing maybe that's where we're getting let's drop our spacing down a bit let's let's drop it by half and see what we get here I really didn't do much to it I'll strap it on and again that's really weird okay so that didn't do anything either we have a max width on our cards that's why okay I didn't realize that we brought over a max width on our card here let's let's see what we get now okay now we have much wider cards which is gonna allow us to display more text but it also kind of messes up the the images a bit so it seems like the images are still acting like they have a height a max height maybe let's get rid of this for now and let's double check our our media classes media yeah we're not we're not gonna pull that in anymore whoa all right let's just kind of mess with the settings then on our own so let's just let's mess with this one okay so we have an actual image background sighs see this background shouldn't matter anymore right because we're using an image instead hmm max width height oh we do have a max Heights though and that's coming from all right then okay so our max height is is actually coming from a file that we're using on that page so let's get rid of that let's get rid of that that entire file for now in in terms of just you know importing it on this particular page on our alumni list page so we can see here we're bringing in this faculty dot CSS which I believe yeah let's get rid of that let's get rid of these files completely get rid of this head component completely and see what it looks like without that okay and let's see what we have now okay so now we're displaying everything on these cards but they're gonna be uneven they're gonna display you know much differently okay I'd rather start from this and then try to make them more uniform and at least we know what we're dealing with in terms of being able to see the actual image dimensions okay all right let me check my time Oh two more minutes okay here's what I want to do for the next step I want to see what this content is actually going to look like oh yeah alumni card and we're bringing in the content let's use I always forget how to use this actually you know what I have this we're using it already somewhere we're using this probably in one of these pages let's see page nope so that's that's a query let's just go to our page is cuz I'm pretty sure this component is using what I would want to use yeah so we're gonna do a dangerously set enter HTML and add content in there and so that's what we'll add here and I want to get rid of everything actually I do okay let's see we may have to change and not have a P there like a P tag I was it working this time there was some weird bug where we had to use a span but it looks like this is this is working better okay I definitely don't want to click effect on here so we'll get rid of that at some point but this will show at least we got the HTML tags out of there so it looks like some of the newer profiles that we have are really short and some of the older ones sort of like full page length I mean this one even has you know subheadings and things like that so I think probably will end up not even showing some of the older ones hey I mean this person graduated in 2003 this person graduated college before I did so we want to do you know probably some some newer profiles okay all right so that's the the second timer is up so I'm gonna go do some questions now the next step would just be taking these and I guess what I would probably need to do then is only show just a little bit of the text maybe if we wanted to use them all show a little bit and then truncate that and then keep that learn more link and show the full amount of data on a page yes so we could definitely do that that way we get out of it a little bit more uniform in terms of height with these images we would probably do the same thing where we would set a max height but be generous with our max height so that it could show everything but we're not gonna get really huge images like was there's one down here that was really long I can't see it yeah like this one ends up being really long all right so we would we would want to cut down on that some of these images just aren't high enough quality they're they're little pixelated so those would be the next steps and then in terms of displaying them other places we would just want to do a similar thing that we did with this this map our alumni list so we mapped over everything so we can either use this same query and then when we map we could also do a filter first before we map and we do a dot filter and filter out for just those particular students who majored in a certain area right or just the ones that we want to feature on the front page or the alternative would be that we modify our our query so that we only return the data that we want instead of returning everything and looping through it so probably long run it would be better to just get the data that we want but either way for now would work since there's really not that much data it wouldn't be an issue in terms of performance but those would be the next steps I'm gonna commit all this and have it up on the github repo links in the description so if you want to check out what we've done here it'll it'll be available soon after I'm finished and right now I'm gonna go back to the live chat try to figure out where I left off at and answer all your questions or as many as I possibly can let's see preferences our videos are in a playlist as projects I want to see from the start of the project yeah this is project 5 so there's a playlist for project 5 each project has its own playlist oh sorry see on in here so V web code asks why is Redux important also how long did it take you to learn and match the react and redux I would say I'm not a master Redux was tricky but it was still something I learned it maybe I don't know a week or two when I was taking the Udacity react nano degree and we learning Redux you know that portion of it probably took a week or two to be able to build something that successfully used Redux Redux is important when you need when you have some complex state management that needs to happen then that's when Redux is important so for instance if you find yourself passing State down through several levels of child components all right then maybe you might want to think about some state management solution you know other than local state so Redux Apollo has something similar built in now you could use reacts new context API so you Redux isn't the only option there's also mob X so you have some options but when your app starts to get complex and handling state through just local state is starts to get complicated um then you might want to think of a different solution for for handling state and that's where Redux comes in and things like Redux I'm trying to I'm skipping through a little bit so to just get some questions I see there are some comments in here to read out more if I have time but I want to make sure it gets all the questions let's see Melo's asks how are you Jessie do you remember me I remember I kind of remember I'll be loose in the chat so I don't remember what we talked about before but how's it going thanks for for joining us Leonard as says 25 right now just graduating with BS and information system programming and my too late for this profession you were definitely not too late for this profession there are people getting into this profession all the time who are way older than you so definitely that's a frequent question that that I see here and elsewhere definitely not too old I'm in asked how to become a best software engineer practice so the more you build things the better you will be so practice and practice doing things the right way so read the documentation stay up to date on the latest ways of doing things for whatever particular area you're in and you'll you'll get better code with Oh head says you're awesome Jesse Thanks I appreciate that if you web coaches do you know the merge stack yeah what is that express react and node is that mine yeah yeah I mean that's basically what we use like I mean right now we're not using but yeah I'm familiar with with the merge stay Chandan says love from India hey how's it going thank you let's see a key says I tried Gatsby why don't people use it more although I know how much is but I read its ratio right I don't know me gasps Keys gasp he's a great a great tool so I don't know why people don't use it more honestly maybe they just haven't heard about it I'm not really sure but I've been impressed with Gatsby also helmet js4 SEO yeah yeah you want trying to think we're using a helmet to add things into the head tag and react I believe that's what what it's used for so you'd want like your metadata that should go in the in the head head tag for SEO you would use it for that Mila says what do you need to go into electrical engineering I honestly have no idea about electrical engineering so I don't I've never done that kind of thing so I'm really not sure up high from Uganda hey how's it going hey from Bangladesh Hey Fred asks if we'll tackle testing react I'd love to do more with testing I'm not sure when that would happen that we would do a show on testing but I think that's a great idea ray asked what my youtube channel is check the description for this video and you'll find a link to my youtube channel Twitter and Instagram I believe my channel is J or as a Jessie why Bowl I don't even know my channel is maybe it's like Jessie Weigel 29 something like that oh yeah Umberto's says Jessie Michael 29 yeah that's it phosphorus says you used Jekyll no I don't I don't remember I don't think I've used Jekyll I I remember looking into it but I'm not sure if I ever actually used it V Webb code says what is react framework like next yes Apollo why do we need them please explain yeah so something like next J s or create react app will help you get started with the react project it'll build out a lot of the structure and handle all your webpack config next also handles things like serverside rendering so you would want to use them to just get a jumpstart on things for react and for most projects they'll work you know you don't need custom webpack stuff going on and that can be a big barrier to entry if you're not a webpack expert like I'm definitely not I don't want to have to mess with that just to get you know a simple react app build Apollo is different Apollo allows you to use really sorry about the onion Apollo allows you to use graph QL with react so it's it's gonna be a it's gonna help you bring that data in make sure you get it where you need to in your app to the right components and help you handle state m40 says how long you been programming I'm currently working on my JavaScript skills and I think I will look for a job in a couple of months as a frontend developer in Poland I've been programming for I think six years now so I think that's great you're gonna be looking for a job I'd say yeah you know and there's no need to really wait to try to find a job you know you could certainly start applying for you know right now and you know all you need to get a job as a programmer to convince somebody that to hire you right it's there's not like some test you have to pass right if you can you know every company is gonna have different things they do in the interview you know different questions they ask somebody might even not ask a technical question but you know don't I would say don't keep thinking like oh I need to get better before I apply you know let let your potential employers decide you know because if you're you know a perfectionist type of person you might keep saying I need to get better I need to get better and meanwhile people with less experience than you or are getting jobs right so you can learn on the job you don't have to do all the learning person and get the job you're always gonna be learning so you may as well get paid for it right that's absolutely I feel V Webb code I'm learning react I want to know why it is the best framework out there I don't know if reacts the best or not right it's react is an option that that will work well there are other options in in JavaScript land that will also work well so I don't think what's the best is the right question it's what is gonna work for for this particular project that I'm working on based on what resources I have what skills that I have and what the what are the requirements for the project teddy bear says are you programming in Mac or Windows I am on a Mac right now Samba desks about which vs code extensions I'm using and which ones are good for yak development get react food truck it will start you out with a bunch of different plugins that basically the majority of the extensions I'm using four vs code have come from react food trucks so look that up it's one extension once you get that it'll come with a lot of other extensions that will help you with react be webco's is can I use WebSocket with react or realtime apps yeah I mean I don't see why you you couldn't use it with react if anybody knows of a reason why you know let me know phosphorus is why Visual Studio code not Adam I found Visual Studio code to be a little faster than Adam I haven't used Adam recently but when I did switch which probably a year ago or so the is code was a bit faster I used to use out in four years I use that V web code says I'm learning react right now and you recommend any udemy courses I have not taken any react udemy courses so I don't know which ones are good or not Alex says will this be archived on this YouTube channel yes it will yeah it'll be available v web says if I build a login system with firebase and react without any backend can anybody break my app oh I don't know I mean there's always I guess I mean I always assume if somebody had enough time and money and talent they could break anything right so I don't want to say that they couldn't break it but you know if you're relying on in this case Google to handle your database then you know a big company like Google I'm sure has a lot of safeguards in place that you might not think to put in place if you're doing it yourself you know from scratch so it would probably decrease the likelihood of somebody being able to hack into your app watch watch rfo says what do you do i am i get i program i build websites and web apps and particularly with javascript and react kami says what you take on CSS frameworks like bootstrap materialize and CSS with react did they make react up slow you can use materialized and bootstrap with react in fact one of the projects we did use materialized with react the problem is a lot of the the interactive things that happen don't use react state to make it happen so it's you're gonna miss out on a lot of the benefits of react in terms of their their rendering the speed so I would you know instead of materialized use material UI or it's gonna work with reacts state management and I think there is a bootstrap equivalent as well so it's you can make them work but it's not gonna be as optimized as fast as it would be if you used react state management to manipulate the dawn right you never want to manipulate the Dom directly when you're using react you always want to do things through state and with bootstrap and materialize you're gonna be manipulating the Dom directly so better better not to use them master nameless is what's a good simple training project to do to practice coding I mean I just check out some of the projects in free code camp free code camp or check out the projects and to get some ideas for that this is also if you consider turning on your YouTube super chat not for free code camps channel that would be a decision for you know Quincy who's in charge of free code camp on my own channel I don't know maybe I'd turn it on I don't even know if I qualify to be able to turn it on to be honest but you know I've thought about it before but for now I'm you know I'm okay with this the web says is github repo important for getting a job when I am looking to hire candidates which isn't often but I if you have a github repo then I will take a closer look at you as a candidate so I want to see your code and having a github repo makes it very easy for me to see that see what exactly you've contributed so I definitely recommend having a github profile you know with some some of your better work on it if you're trying to look for a job and make sure you put a to that on your resume m40 says is it better to stick with an L a JavaScript or jQuery or maybe both vanilla JavaScript is going to be more versatile and you'll be able to use it you know in more places but it's good to know a little about jQuery because a lot of websites use jQuery so the odds of you having to work on it at some point especially if you're gonna work on old websites for clients or even for companies you're probably gonna see jQuery it's not that hard to learn so wouldn't you know worry about knowing it or not knowing it but you're probably gonna come across it at some point but if you're just trying to really learn you know JavaScript you can stick with another JavaScript and that's gonna be a good way to go and then just pick up jQuery when you when you need it if you ever do Mb terms is what kind of projects can I make with react oh really anything I mean really like anything you that's out there on the internet could probably be built with react is it best to motor with react I don't know but you could you could do it I mean even like native apps you can make with react if you're using electron as well you can make dev subset apps with react so there's a lot you can do with with react MB trem says is there any tutorial for react and firebase for beginners there's probably a tutorial out there I don't really remember one off the top of my head but I bet there there's probably more than one out there the web says how much should I code every day to be really good at coding you know you don't know obviously the more coding you do the better you'll be but I would if you could dedicate like an hour a day then you're gonna keep getting better right if you could do more do more it depends on how much time you have but if you if you're spending your whole day playing video games then maybe spend your own a coding right if you have a job or two jobs and you gotta provide for yourself your family or whoever then try to get that half hour in right but it just it kind of just depends on on you and how much time you really do have Samba and I don't have anything against video games I'm just saying like if your goal is to be good at coding then you know code more if you can't Sam it says is it possible bit of progressive web app with react this frontend and go Lang is back in you can definitely build a pressive web app with react to the frontend I don't know very much at all about Galang but you can pretty much use reacted with whatever back end you want so I'm assuming that that is possible Rajan says which language is best for beginners it kind of depends on what you want to do but if I had to pick I would say javascript is good because you can run it in the browser you don't need to download anything extra Python is also good because the syntax is is pretty simple to understand so those would be my two languages that if you're not interested in web development at all then go with Python if you are interested in web development go with JavaScript Josh Eric Smith says what do you think of WordPress with react we're using WordPress WordPress with react right now headless WordPress I think it's a nice combination because so many companies already run WordPress so if they wanted something more modern then in terms of their frontend with react you could very easily use the data they already have and you know their workflow would change very little in terms of content updating an entry but they could have react you know on the front end use react for you know they're at their add their mobile app and still pull the data from WordPress so I think it's a it's a good combination in some situations I wouldn't use it all the time but I think it's a really nice way to transition people into react without you know causing them to have to learn you know a ton of new stuff for maintenance the web says do you have a CS degree I do not my degrees in business do you have bosses how many projects I need to build a powerful portfolio I don't know what that number is but honestly like I would like to see at least three projects on a portfolio if somebody is trying to apply for something if somebody claims they're an expert at something I want to see a lot more than three projects you know honestly unless those three projects are like amazing and huge then yeah I'd want to say so it depends on what your what kind of role you're trying to get right if it's an entry level like junior developer role then try for three good ones right I'd rather have three good ones then you know ten ones that are just like terrible or just very very basic to do apps or something like that MB trance is is reacting react native same in syntax coding they're very similar there are a few differences between react and react native but if you know react it will be pretty easy to go over into react native if you have been learn react native first which is more rare it will be pretty easy to go and just do things and react so just just a few differences Amara says what are products based companies which provide job opportunities and react Jas there are a lot of companies that use react so obviously Facebook users reacts and then Instagram because right they're owned by Facebook trying to think what else sees your act Netflix users react Eventbrite users react I don't know I don't know the list there if you look up like what companies use react you you'll get a lot of info there's a lot of companies using react right now Go Daddy's websites but with react WordPress is switching over to a lot of stuff being so that company is I believe is called automatic is the the WordPress company so there are a lot of companies using react right now you know just you know do a search even go on like a job board and do a search for react as a keyword and you know you'll see a lot of blood I've been knowing that lately it I there are a lot of jobs chris says how do you solve a design problem more and model there I'm not sure what you mean about model layer but to be honestly I don't use a lot of design tools I'm more of a coder developer and less of a designer so I'm I'm a little bit more comfortable just adjusting some CSS than actually going to something like you know sketch or Adobe XD or you know something along those lines so if I'm already working on the project and there's some design stuff I just switched the code up if it's brand new and I have an action code or anything yet then maybe I would do things in in sketch I you know I do you sketch occasionally the web says thanks Jesse you are helping us a lot oh you're welcome I got to keep an eye on the time all right I'm gonna I got half hour throw my phone interview Eldrick says is it possible for me to learn csharp language as a beginner yeah I mean it's possible it's just a matter of sticking with it practicing studying building things Rodrigo says hi Jesse thanks for this lesson what IDE are you using and is it possible to code react for iOS in Linux yeah for sure I'm using Visual Studio code you can code with react on any operating system Windows Mac Linux you know whatever and then you can use react native to build iOS apps so that's definitely possible skee 760 says random question but how do I set up nginx to work with react router on refresh without getting a 404 yeah it should be fine so there shouldn't really be anything you need to set up for nginx right nginx just needs to route your traffic all traffic to your server Jas file or whatever using with react router and then react router will handle everything rector I know on refresher that I do 404 it's been so long since I've set that up I don't remember what if anything special you have to do I'm assuming that there's some documentation about it though but yeah it's been way too long since I've I've set up nginx manually m40 says I worked with jQuery a little is pretty straightforward but I feel more confident with vanilla JavaScript feel like I can do much more with it yeah I mean vanilla JavaScript you you can end up doing more because you're not locked into the jquery api which it's very versatile but still it there are some restrictions oxygen Exedy says why don't you start a tutorial series on react yes I might it's just you know it's a lot of work to you know actually set up an actual tutorials so you know that's it's potentially you know it could happen though it says what are some new trends you see in the programming industry I I don't really know um new trends there's so much you know new going on all the time right everybody is jumping on the machine learning you know like like all industries are getting in on machine learning some of the coolest stuff now I think or the potential would be most helpful is in the medical industry I think that that's a really awesome place to be because your programming work could actually end up saving people's lives so that's that's awesome also the work with a are so like augmented reality is which you know there are ways to use react JavaScript with that you know and that I think that has a lot more applications than people realize it's not just entertainment gaming but there are applications for industry medicine you know things like that too so those are some of the areas that I think are pretty cool also the cryptocurrencies are great you know not not investment stuff but in terms of having distributed systems for keeping track of things like let's say like real estate ownership you know identification even things like like voting is they're doing tests with using blockchain stuff for that I don't know there's a lot of cool areas where I think it could benefit from a decentralized ledger system that that you have with with these blockchain technologies James tells us how can I learn react you know read the documentation check out some react tutorials so there's there's a lot of them out there depending on how you like to learn you know maybe you want to get a book maybe you want to read blogs videos you know they're they're out there a Martha's window discover the right time to jump into Redux get into Redux if you find your apps if it starts to get really hard to think about your estate and keep your state managed properly then you want to think about Redux or something like it Chris X's design problem model layer I mean I started a Java dev I have a project for myself then I run into a use case to solve and wonder how should I write or add classes to solve it yeah I I mean I'm not a job in dev so I'm not sure specifically what you know what you run into but I mean I do run into cases where the you know things happen in a project and you have to you have to do actually add extra components and things like that so I mean I'm not sure usually my my process is like just get it fixed get it working and then look at how you could do it better you know sometimes it has to be a quick fix you just have to do it the best you can and then hopefully you have time to go back afterwards optimize it you know V Webb says have you managed CSS inside react there's a lot of different ways you could do it you could use regular style sheets and just import them like you normally would you could use CSS nsj components write inline CSS a lot of different ways to do it I'm not really sure which is the best one Omar says is react version 17 going to be a big change in terms of learning it's going to be some big changes but I don't think it's gonna be huge in terms of learning much of react is going to stay the same but there's gonna be some cool new stuff as well the UF says do you think machine learning will take over web development no not really I think a lot of the things the machine learning are is good at it's not necessarily the same thing that makes a web developer good so it it could potentially be used to help as a tool and web development but I don't see it no I I haven't heard of anything let's get that is probably gonna significantly change web development in in the shortterm future a few websites what is required to start freelancing as a web developer find somebody who wants to pay you to do web stuff that's it I mean it's depending on your country maybe you need some sort of license to do business but really you just find somebody who one who's gonna pay you to do work and that's about it ego says D you already use reactive databases what do you think about this tech I'm I'm not sure yeah I'm not exactly sure what reactive databases are so I I guess I have no opinion about it right now edmond says hey I'm just an amateur but I need to learn to code learn coding and be a pro at programming need more of your tutorials help out yeah I mean there's it so many tutorials on here like me personally there's I think over 200 videos right now that I've done so there's a bunch for they're just on this channel and then there are a ton of other contributors that have done a lot so definitely this there's a lot of material for you to go through here just with free code camp let's see Aki says thought to mob X versus redux I haven't used my back so I really can't I can't compare amor says is it compulsory to know about component lifecycle perfectly no I mean not perfectly right you need to know enough to make it work right having a general understanding of what the component lifecycle is is definitely important in react m40 says have you heard of red javascript and jquery by john Duquette because i have very good things about the spoken thing about reading it I have not read it so I and I haven't really heard much about it so I can't really give a good opinion on that Ava says why have you chosen Gatsby what problems are solving XS so I'm not using Gatsby for this project Davis eases my uncle Reese's glucose level with a Bluetooth Bluetooth in from implant that's awesome that is really cool Marius wants to know my theme and vision vs code its SETI the you can see how to spell in everything in the description to the video V Webb says what are the main ways to make money after learning coding building building websites working fixing websites so either freelancing or you know getting a job with a company Eva says looks very similar sorry oh yeah yeah no problem I mean we're still using react so you know whether it's reactive gas feed creator a cab next yes whatever you know it's all gonna look very similar so okay I've got the end of the questions and my interview is coming up very soon so I'm gonna take a break here rest my voice for a minute and I will maybe I'll stream later on I know I have two meetings later today so I may or may not stream on my channel but subscribe to the channel turn on notifications links in the description to my channel if I do end up livestreaming you should get in to notification about it and I do have some other videos on there if you'd like to check it out feel free to follow me on Instagram and Twitter links are also in the description so hopefully I'll see y'all soon in any case have a great day thank you so much for watching
