Yo, what's up it's your roomie and I'm back. So, in this video I'm going to talk to you about how I built a personal Chatbot for myself. Yes, I built a Yoroomie Chatbot How I've leveraged this Chatbot to scale my reach and build my brand as you probably noticed from the past videos I'm not just a serial entrepreneur I am a maker so I love building things and taking my ideas to MVP to launching them to getting feedback and Turning them into revenue generating startups, or if I understand this not something people do not want and there I'm going to charge money I pay for simply shut it down also something that I would say and this is more recently which Really is something that I enjoy is actually documenting the process sharing as much as I can about the process of going from Idea to revenue generating startups so They're doing this the best way to do it is obviously through Content. One of the recent builds that I did is our Chatbot which I'l link down here the previous video I did on our Chatbot but I built our Chatbot in the open and really just Kind of let everyone follow along. The feedback I got from it. It was amazing People loved seeing me take an idea to Chatbot literally generating thousands of messages via this Chatbot and eventually turning this into something more than just an idea an initial kind of MVP, so After I did this build I also really became Convinced in the power of Chatbots. You know with Chatbots, I immediately saw how I could kind of Leverage this conversational design that Chatbots have with other Concepts and so I knew that I needed to then build another Chabot. Now, I was kind of thinking You know, what should I build? And I didn't really just want to build another standalone product that didn't kind of benefit everything I was already doing and I'd also think you know thought about my Personal kind of open content that I put out and my personal brand, and I just realized that You know how beneficial it would be for me to build a you ever be chat line now one of the first reasons why I? Thought this would be beneficial is because it's basically social platforms consolidated into one So everyone's like hey be omnipresent across all all social platforms and get your content you know purposed across everything and I was just thinking like that's a lot to keep up with of course I tried to be Omnipresent, but I really want one kind of one place to send one message in this route You know the highest quality message I could and it's make it easier for people to not have to like follow me on everything so I thought facebook Messenger would be A perfect place to do this because I can kind of package up all the channels and all the content into this Chatbot this would be ultimately ultimately the kind of centralized place where I would want to push people to All right now The other is it that I thought was the ability to control the narrative So that's something when you know you have content across all the channels it can kind of become fragmented And then the message can also become fragmented so having this one channel would allow me to control what I wanted to tell people in that narrative and then ultimately how its received Which of course is very beneficial when you're trying to get something out to people and then people add scale. The other That I was thinking about which is a big benefit of having a personal Chatbot is You know people spend all their time on Facebook like let's admit you and I both spend a ton of time on Facebook And when you get that message someone messages you through Facebook, and you hear that Ding You're gonna look at your phone most likely well at least probably over an email or a text message I know I do personally so I just thought wow I mean what better way to reach people than where they spent all their time Which is Facebook Messenger, which is where the Chatbot would be? Accessible to people now that I kind of thought about the benefits of it. I was totally convinced all right I just need to build this Chatbot. The process that I use to build my Yoroomie Chatbot was fairly straightforward It kind of follows a lot of the other process from my other side projects but I first thought about You know why I was building this and how this will be valuable for people and try to define that come up with this? kind of Chatbot And it was really first off just identifying the goal of just making a place where people can learn more about me consume my content and Contact me regarding projects, or you know helping them out if they have any questions about this when I kind of Have that down, then I needed to kind of go into okay? All these channels that I just mentioned for instance all these medium articles How do I then include those because they're already out there? Their already something that I get a ton of really good feedback on even these YouTube videos So how do I then package them in my Chatbot because that's the best way you know to let people consume this content Featured in there so what I came up with was actually a Yoroomie playbook So I thought you know what does all the content cover? And it's really about going from an idea to MVP to revenuegenerating startup to scale and even some acquisitions That I've had in the past so what better way to Kind of package this up and make it easier for people to navigate and having a Yoroomie Playbook in my Chatbot so that's actually what I did so I repurposed a lot of medium articles in sequence in a playbook and also these videos in the Chatbot I'll screenshot here a For the actual dashboard for Chatfuel so I did use Chatfuel and I used I actually took the "Our Chatbot" Template and I repurposed it so I simply Duplicated that to create the Yoroomie bot and then I simply modified using the blocks The content that would be there, so on the screenshot here, you can see the Chatfuel dashboard And it's actually my playbook, and then it's the about me ask a question, and then It's contact me or And then after that is the actual kind of share So there's a little reality effect in theirs that people could then message their other friends through messenger and share, so that's kind of basic Template that. I you used in chat fuel so they're very straightforward, so this took less than an hour honestly what it came down to is just getting all the existing content that I had Already put out kind of packaging it up Through this Chatbot you know just modifying the templates and then kind of testing that conversational interface and design And just modifying it so I can make it kind of as natural and smooth as possible based off of what people actually want to see And would be interested in. After about an hour. Maybe an hour at most I actually had this Yoroomie Chatbot live. What I did from that was I actually Responded to some emails that I got from people asking me questions And I pointed them towards the link for the Chatbot, and and you know just I said hey I'm building this Chatbot. You know because I get a lot of questions that are similar to yours Here's a direct answer to your question But I would love if you could give me some feedback on this Chatbot that I just made by literally like 30 minutes ago so I did that and you know people were very receptive to that. It was only like five or six at first, but I got some really good feedback, so I Made some improvements on that conversational flow And now that's great so it's like my first kind of user feedback then from there I followed a typical kind of launch framework that I take for products because this was and it is a kind of a product It's just my chatbot for myself featuring my content packaged up as a playbook but I then went to Botlist which I know I've mentioned Seth the founder of Botlist. He is Amazing when it comes down to chatbots. He knows everything. Well his website Botlist is a great place to take your Chatbot and get your first users So I posted on, Yoroomie bot, on Botlist which I'll screenshot the profile here But it got around 4,000 initial views So I'm would say maybe a couple hundred users from that from people had actually tried it out Got a few people to review it so it's kind of like an app store for Chatbots. So it was a perfect place for me to launch from there I've actually taken created a bitly short link so I have a bit.ly slash Yoroomie and that's actually my chatbot link so now instead of just having my website and all my content everywhere I can actually link directly to my ChatBot and the benefit of that is people can obviously consume that content and And you know find my playbook through there, but then when people when people use the Chatbot they can contact me But they're also kind of a subscribed user so then when I come out with new content I can actually push them a message And they'll be the first to know through my chatbot About this new content that I have coming out so I actually want to go into another video talking about now After I've launched the Chatbot how effective Chatbots can be for sending messages Versus sending emails, but I'm gonna keep this video short You can expect another video coming up soon talking about that results, but so far I've had some amazing feedback on it And it seems to be actually adding value to people that do have questions and are interested in taking their idea to an MVP To liveto revenue generating startup, so why don't you check it out? I'll link down here below the Chatbot but comment below Let me know what you think give me some real honest feedback on it And I definitely want to improve and hit subscribe so I keep making these videos. See you )
