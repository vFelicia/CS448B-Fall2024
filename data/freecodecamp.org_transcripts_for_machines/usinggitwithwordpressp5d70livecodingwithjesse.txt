hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and i apologize for being a few minutes late i got a phone call right before the stream started i should have never even answered it but it was from a car rental place and i'd rented a car last week to drive down to uh revolution conf and there were some issues with the car rental um in terms of like there was a misunderstanding and i ended up getting charged more than i should have gotten charged so i did really want to answer it and clear that up so anyway good news for me is that everything is going to be cleared up uh and i i definitely apologize for uh um for the lateness of the stream start all right so uh i just want to take let me take a minute here i'm streaming from home so i want to uh make sure the stream's okay so let me know if anything's weird with the stream if there's a delay right now it says the health is good um but i have more things running on my computer than i normally do when i try to stream so so far everything's running good just let me know uh i'm not gonna play spotify on my computer i'm gonna hook it up on my phone so i'm gonna set this up right now and play this okay um yeah and then this is somewhat humorous i i went to start the stream because i was in a hurry because i was late and then i looked in obs and i could see myself and realized that i did not have a shirt on so then i had to grab a shirt really quick before i could start so i had already started the stream done the preview on youtube and you have to hit one more button for it to go live so i almost had hit the the third button um not you can really see much more than this up but still i i didn't want to scandalize anybody all right i'm going to check the live chat real quick before we get started uh and i'm going to start out by explaining what we're doing and why we're doing it and then we'll get right into it uh just a disclaimer i've never done this before so this is going to be one of those streams where we learn together and i'm expecting for it not to work right away uh so we'll just we'll see how it goes uh let's so if you were saying hi um subbender hi edward says who else is excited i'm definitely excited i i hope some of you are excited too um treasure says hi hey how's it going mildred says uh it's looking good i assume you mean the stream is looking good and not necessarily me but if you did mean me thank you either way thanks jeff said thought you were laying on the floor for a second there yeah actually it does kind of look like i'm laying down it's i'm actually in a recliner and then behind me i just put up a tablecloth i hung them from the ceiling so it kind of encloses me a bit and uh that way if my kids run through here then it's not distracting and you never know there's a bathroom like in the corner there so sometimes the little ones will be so excited that they went on the potty they'll run through here uh without any pants on or anything so just wanted to make sure we keep this pg here uh and family friendly all right let's see i'll just read a few more hellos before we get started carlos says hasn't been able to watch previous episodes because i didn't get home until now good to see you live yeah it's good to have you here live carlos uh let's see harsha says hasn't worked with much with now lately well that's we're actually getting ready to work with now uh so we're not gonna get there today but we're gonna do the prep work for our wordpress installation to get to that point let's see kcb says no pants wednesday i do have pants on well i have shorts on so let's uh all right cool all right let's get started uh first thing i'm gonna do is just give you a quick explanation of what we're doing and i'm gonna paste the link in here for you to follow along with some of the documentation as well let me get that link right now i had it up on my other computer okay i got the link now let me paste this for you i'm gonna paste this here in the live chat if it doesn't work when you click it just try copying and pasting it that usually works and this video is kind of dark i'm gonna brighten my screen it's amazing the difference you you get in the video if you i just brighten my laptop screen uh okay so i'm gonna move this over on my other screen and i'm gonna share my screen with you all so we can all check it out together okay so this is what we're looking at and this is the link that i copied in i um what i'd like to do is set up wordpress in a way that i can track it with get and that i can also deploy it using now so if you've used wordpress press before and if you know anything about now you know that that's it's not going to work right off the bat we definitely have to change some things so this is in anticipation of putting in motion the plan that we talked about on monday uh so that we're gonna separate out that mysql database and all the files uh all the media files from wordpress and then all we'll have left are you know the php files the plugins things like that that's what's going to end up being hosted with now so that's what we're going to work on today we're going to take the actual wordpress files that we've been using and we're going to try to get them into this format and put them up on github so let's dig into this a little bit and just see what's going on so that we can all get an idea of what we need to do so you can see uh we're running you know we have our wp config file which i'm sure we'll have to modify but that's standard um we have this docker file so we check docker this will really give us an idea of like what's going what's going to go on inside this docker container um you see we're doing this curl right if you're not familiar with these commands curl was like going out and like downloading stuff in in this case it's downloading these zip files so you know we're getting latest versions of wordpress uh we're getting some plugins uh secure database connection we're getting a sendgrid plugin uh wordpress does send emails uh for just some of its administrative tasks uh so we're gonna run that through sendgrid and we should be able to just use the free plan on sendgrid because there's there's not going to be very many emails and we already have sendgrid accounts set up so we won't have to send anything new up for that all right it's using huh sorry so you can see when we run docker it's it is going through all the steps to run wordpress to install and run wordpress uh with nginx so this is really cool we haven't used docker on the show so i mean i'm kind of excited about this and so that's that's what's going to be going on inside the container and let me see if there's anything else that we need to oh you know we ought to check out this config file i guess we check out this run file too okay uh and the config i'm assuming this is going to be a little different than a normal wp config all right see we are going to have to put in some info okay i mean it it actually looks pretty much somewhat normal um okay and i forgot to start with pomodoro as ever i'm sorry about that let's start it now and i'm just gonna keep it on my other screen i already have it there um it'll play a sound in my headphones whenever actu no it won't play us on because i have my headphones plugged into my phone but i'll uh it should give me a notification all right let's see harshit says you need environment variables yes yes thank you uh yeah so we're what we're not going to have on our github repo is our environment variables right because um obviously we don't want the world to know all that stuff uh so i will set that if we get to that point where we get far enough that we need to set these things up then i will definitely do that on my other screen and we'll have to keep them you know elsewhere okay all right harsha's talking about the e flag on now let's see what they have set up for now uh there we go so hard i don't i don't know if you were looking at this or not on your machine but this is the now.json so at least we know what we need all right so what we want to do i guess first did i clone this already i can't remember if i fork this yet or not so let me double check and see if i did fork it yet and then we can get started um let's see i i as i believe i'm pronouncing that right i'm not sure though uh as i see your questions after this pomodoro session i'll i'll come through and answer a bunch of the questions so you can just hold on uh for about 20 minutes or so then i'll answer the questions all right so let's check out my profile and if i did clone it i think i would have cloned it to this organization this fds marcon let's see or i'm i keep saying clone i mean fork sorry there we go i did it's here okay so i'm gonna run from off of this now uh this repository that i forked uh you can see for this main repository it's it's not like it's been updated anytime soon so i don't really need to worry about updating my fork so we can get rid of that and let's let's clone this then and this it may take a few minutes since i'm trying to run obs at the same time but that's okay because that would give me a little bit of time to check out the live chat and i have this really small so i'm gonna make these a bit bigger before i do anything else you go one more it looks really huge on my screen let me know if it's good for for you all uh so i'm gonna do oops i want to get out you know what i don't want to do this in in here let's let's pull up a command line so let's go into here for now okay so i'm in my projects folder uh if if you're doing things with the command line pulling down repos i always find it helpful to create a projects folder so i know where everything is at just keep things clean for me so i'm gonna do a git clone and i'm bringing down that repo wow super fast okay and we can cd into this it's just wordpress and we can see hey here's all our files now i'm going to open this with visual studio code i know i could have opened up a window and code first but i've just gotten into the habit of doing it this way and i always have my eye term open anyway um so i'm not 100 sure that it's faster but it's easier for me since it's a habit now uh remind me later i've been asking him to remind me later for that survey for months maybe one day i'll actually do it i mean i do want to help i just am always in the middle of something okay so you can see uh now we have all those files right everything that we we ought to have so what we can try to do now is set this up and try to get something running locally uh on the machine so um let me i take you know what i think i may have to set up if this sendgrid stuff is not optional which i it doesn't look like it is how about it i'm going to try to run it without setting up something on sendgrid but if you know what sendgrid is it's like uh an email server so we've done things with sendgrid before it won't be too much of an issue but i think we can save some time and try to do it without sendgrid we'll see if we get an error then we'll set it up but you know it's worth saving like 10 or 15 minutes to try to do it um without sendgrid first since this is you know kind of a a trial run this is the first time we're trying this i'm trying to scan the uh the chat as well just to see our i see i see your comments let's do that now then let's make that dot end file no it didn't i didn't hit the dot hard enough there we go dot okay so our dot end file env is uh where we're going to add in all the stuff that we saw here right the host username all that so let me open this side by side so i get them all and i just want to grab these just so that we have them and take let me take out all these quotation marks we don't need them okay and i don't believe we don't need the commas either no what did i just do there we go all right i don't think we need anything i'm just gonna need what like equals and the equals for all that so at this point i am going to pull this off to another screen let me get let me see if i can open this in another i guess it's not going to let me do that um i just see axel s what's with that end this for um i need all these values to get this up and running so i need to put them in an end file and then now is going to grab them and use them so that's what i need hardship thanks he just reminded me to remove the spaces as well i assume you meant this stuff over here so thank you for that and let me make a new window and pull it over to my other screen and now i should be able to drag this over to my new window and close it here all right cool so let me just open up this just have something else in here we're going to close that and i'll do my best to never show that mfile again let's see uh harshit says is the database set up or will you use the same test database for now i'm going to use the same test database so i don't have the things we talked about in terms of on monday in terms of file storage and database i don't have set up yet because it occurred to me that the school that i work for uses microsoft office uh 365. so i thought it might be a good idea to look into like hey could we use azure for free or for a big discount so the it department is looking into that right now i hope i get an answer back soon if it turns out that we get a really good deal then i may go with uh azure for our database management and our file storage if not i think i'll probably end up going with google uh because from from what i've seen so far i think google will end up being uh a bit cheaper so that's the plan right now if i don't hear anything back by the end of the week i'm i think i'm just gonna go with google stuff because i can't really wait all right let's see i'm gonna grab all right i'm gonna look away from the live chat for a while because i need to the screen space to look up some info about uh my wordpress installation okay so let me see i may have to trying to think how i can get this info quickly uh maybe i'll just ssh into the droplet and bring up the current wp config i just need to get the ip for the droplet all right so i'd rather not show you all my my stuff for this process so i'm gonna just describe it as best i can so right now all i'm doing is just logging into digitalocean it's asking me for my twofactor authentication so uh i just need to get on my phone here and get that i use authy for my authentication and i have a lot of stuff in here it takes me a little while to find it i definitely recommend using twofactor authentication whenever it is available uh definitely better than just using a password okay so let me go in here uh i'm in digitalocean i am i'm on several digitalocean teams so i'm switching to the team that we have for um for this university and we have quite a few droplets in here right now i don't remember what the name of this droplet is i think it's this one let me double check before i start trying to get into this droplet all right let's try i'm gonna try to do some stuff here just to show you let's see do a new tab and let's see i think that's it no that's denied all right hold on a second let me bring this to my other screen okay okay all right so evidently uh i don't think i set this one up but evidently i am not set up as a user oh you know what this was we did the like easy one click setup for this and um so i personally don't have an account like i usually set up but the root account is still active uh now it's not you can't pat get a password it's set up through ssh keys uh which is okay but usually we uh don't use the root account uh for time i'm not gonna set up my own account right now let's just do this with root i have to remember how to get to uh this is how we get to it no i can't remember how to get to where we want to go okay if anybody remembers how to navigate uh file structure for apache to get to where wordpress is let me know i cannot remember i'm just not in this file structure often enough all right let's check out what we have here jacob says www yeah that's what i'm looking for the www but i just can't there that's it yeah i couldn't remember what the the top one was or var how do you pronounce that there or far i don't know there we go but thank you jacob all right so we get there we go there's my wp config should be there there we go all right i'm gonna pull this off my screen for a second so i don't reveal all my secrets to the world uh and then that's what i'm gonna use to put stuff in that end file so all i'm just going to run this with nano so i can't show you on the screen but i'm just going to say i'm running the command nano which is a builtin text editor and it's probably the easiest one to use and that's really all i need right now and i'm going to do nano and open the wp config dot php file wonderful so now i'm gonna scroll down a bit to get the values that i need okay now don't show anyone your wp config file so if you're ever going through this you definitely don't don't want to show people okay so i have all the database info in there right now so we'll see if this works hopefully it does and now that i have that in there let's go back here and terminal all right so we have our terminal running down here the bottom which is very nice builtin feature here and i guess let's see how i run this all right so this didn't come with a readme file for what to run this what's what's the command to run this docker file i wonder if i could just run now let's just do that let's run now please enter the values for the following environment variables oh no it wants me to enter values for them why can't it just pull it from this dot mfile okay let me all right i'm gonna stop that here and then what happened to my terminal oh i put it over here all right let me run this in my terminal i can put in this stuff uh okay we need the send grid api key so it wouldn't let me proceed without the api key all right let's set that up and i can show this on the screen all the way up until i actually get the api key so let's go into send grid i didn't really think i'd have to get a send grid for this stream oops you know what i bet my timer yeah my timer's almost up so in about a minute i'm gonna stop and answer some questions so if you have any questions put them in the live chat now i used to log into cengrid all the time and i have not logged in for quite a while all right api keys okay cool um so what i'm going to do is create another api key oops i'm gonna do that after i break so i'm gonna take a short five minute break and i'm gonna go to the chat and answer some questions i'm just go all the way up to the top and just go down in chronological order try to answer as much as i can then when i come back then we're gonna set up uh api keys so that we can hopefully get this wordpress running on now i see a lot more of you were saying hello i'm not going to go through everybody but just hey everyone phoenix says i just wanted to inform you that i might be off the streams for a few days i have my master's exams due next month hey no problem uh good luck with your your exams i hope you do well and after you're all finished come back on and let us know how you did i don't know if you can hear my stomach growling if you can i apologize uh i need to eat okay so i as had that question a while back i i noticed that how can i learn coding i'm a beginner uh looks like uh arnaldo says uh go to free code camp yeah definitely free code camp's a great way to start i mean it does depend on exactly what you want but if you're not sure what you want to do i definitely recommend going to freecodecamp.org and just starting out you know go through some of their stuff definitely at least get to the point where you're starting to learn javascript you know get through the html and css stuff um you know try to stick with it through you know through that to the javascript algorithms and things and maybe try making some of the projects that should give you a good idea of how you like coding and you know i think it's a good way to start out there's a lot of other places you could start out with but i i think that's a pretty solid foundation uh shoe pump says what about react projects yeah we're still working on a react project this is just the uh the piece of the project where we're storing the data and managing the data so we're gonna set this up and then we'll be going back to the react stuff soon i was actually working on that the react stuff all day trying to get more more routes set up and pull in the data correctly nikki says the optional chaining proposal now in stage one possibly coming in javascript will be awesome for the router file on the project that's cool our router's getting huge anything to help out with that would be great says you're a genius jesse thank you i appreciate that i'm not exactly sure i'm a genius but if you say so uh i'm not gonna argue oh nikki s what hotkey i removed the indentation with i just highlighted everything and i pressed uh shift tab so just backwards tabbed everything i've got a questions where can i learn wordpress theme construction um i believe the wordpress documentation actually has a stepbystep process of learning theme construction so i would check that out that's probably going to be where you'll have the most uptodate and official instructions on how to do it uh so so just check out the wordpress docs on that i haven't attempted to construct a wordpress theme for years so i'm not i know where i'd go if i wanted to to do it and that's the official documentation uh but i'm i'm just not in practice to be able to just go in and start doing it myself nikki says there's a folder called magic is there really a folder called magic in there i did not see that i don't know if i see it again then maybe i'll i'll try all right my timer's out so if i didn't get to your question right now i will get to it uh after the next break so i'm gonna start up this next pomodoro session excluding billing yeah that's fine api key name um hopefully this doesn't expose my api key right away it did we cannot show it to you again dang it all right let's try this again off screen all right so i'm gonna save this stuff in my last pass okay all right now let me see if i can if i can get this running you all right so i'm just making sure i copy all these keys properly hey all right that's weird it did not work i'm scrolling through the chat quickly to see if anyone noticed anything i was doing wrong okay i don't see anything let's okay all right i'm going to try this one more time just in case i you know pasted something in here wrong and if that doesn't work then we'll maybe try to look up and get some help on this okay okay got farther than i did last time all right it's going it's doing a lot of stuff in the terminal no errors so far i guess we'll just see what's gonna happen all right it's downloading and unzipping different things uh wordpress files i can see okay cool all right yeah let me i'll i'll put my terminal back over here if i accidentally show some type of info that i shouldn't then i guess i can always just change it all right so while that's going i'll just i'll check in to see some of what's going on in the chat okay oh andrew uh landed uh his first dev job congratulations that's awesome whoa all right that's cool so maybe that worked uh give me your name password information database okay well it was cool that we got it to run evidently i messed up something with the database let's make sure i hope i didn't actually mess up the database itself so i'm going to double check here nand says git versus svn i've never used svn so i'm gonna go with get but i'm not i can't really make a good comparison jacob asks if sendgrid is free um yeah so they have a free tier that works for a lot of a lot of things um so definitely check out the free tier and that may be all you need for your whatever project you're working on all right let me try to get in somewhere that will pull from the database i know this will work i've been working on this page for a while okay cool so the database is not broken it's just the way i tried to bring it into that project that's that's broken all right i'm gonna check how much time i have and then we'll see what we can do here okay all right what if we let's check this out let's check this out so we're going to check out google cloud my sequel let's just do this we'll just try to go through quickly and do this all right so i'm gonna pull these instructions over onto my other screen nikki just said thought he was going to google google for a second almost aged like 50 years in an instant all right so let's go to let's create a project and let's call this uh test test my sequel that looks good location organization can i just leave it with none yeah all right cool and need to enable billing this is my own account so i'm just going to do this on my own account just to get it working so should be billing area yep yep there we go okay how do i still have this link to my billing account i don't know i'm not getting charged for anything so i guess it's okay anyway all right so billing is linked up uh now let's enable this api oops api uh so this is the google cloud platform um admin panel let me make it a bit bigger sorry about that i just realized it was probably really small um oops i thought i clicked on the api i need to enable an api there we go so let's enable and i guess i'm looking for the actually let me search google cloud sql api enable all right cool and let's make sure let me pull this over make sure i enable this for a specific project ah i was dang it i accidentally enabled it for the wrong project let me disable that for this project alright let me get on the right project here there we go now double check to make sure it is enabled all right it is enabled awesome let's go to our cloud sql instances page you know what i'm going to paste the quick start into the live chat as well and then that way um you all can follow along if you'd like i definitely want to go with my sequel and sure let's choose second generation it look better all right choice is permanent for instance id sq instance root password oops generate and not show me no i want everybody to know let me i'm going to generate a different password uh with lastpass there we go and i'm going to paste this location central yeah that's fine let's check out these options probably just leave it all by default we're going to create this instance all right cool so that is doing its thing and the next step is we're going to get access to a console then we'll be able to create the database and actually see if we can migrate our database i'm just gonna while this does its thing i'm gonna search to see if there's a really easy way to migrate and it looks like there is some documentation on how to migrate application database so i'm gonna have to dump the database okay all right nikki says the stream is cutting out oh no maybe maybe i'm trying to do too much it's possible i have too much stuff running oh and my timer is up all right so we gotta wait for this to to be finished anyway so now i guess it's a good time for a break so let me go back to the chat let's see what what kind of questions y'all have okay andrew says uh do companies give you computers to develop on um yeah my my company does uh the laptop i'm using right now is my own but in my office uh at work i have an imac so i think it's pretty common for a company to supply you with a computer nan says uh jesse any words on tensorflow.js i have not worked with tensorflow.js it's it's i would love to work with tensorflow and all the stuff like that i just haven't had a time yet uh so i have some ideas on how i could use it but i i really can't give any comment on it yet because i i haven't had time to use it if anybody else has used it i'd love to hear your opinion on it uh world's asked what is sendgrid used for uh it's it's like an email uh client so you can if you need your app to send emails then instead of like writing the code to send emails yourself you can just use send grids api send the data to sendgrid and then it will handle all the email stuff for you um so we've used it on some previous projects and it's it's pretty um pretty easy to use hey it works cool uh new world says how good should i be at vanello javascript before learning a framework like view um new world says like dom manipulation i mean realistically i i i have not used vue but i think it's somewhat similar to react and you don't do a lot of direct daw manipulation and react so if you is like that don't worry so much about dawn manipulation um and to be honest with you i you know if you know just the very basics of javascript you can jump into a framework uh or library and that should be fine uh you know just make sure you keep learning javascript while you're doing it i sometimes people talk about like mastering job vanello jobs here before they move on but i mean i don't i think that's if you had all the time in the world and all the money in the world and you didn't have to worry about actually producing work for clients or for your you know your employer then yeah maybe you could do it like that but realistically like frameworks and libraries are there so that you don't have to do all the underlying stuff you can just make awesome things and have that layer of abstraction that it makes it easier for you to do not only that but you know if you rely on a framework or a library to do a lot of things for you and a lot of other people use that then it's well tested the bugs are all out if you try to build everything from scratch yourself with vanilla javascript odds are there's going to be a lot of cases where it doesn't work and you were not even going to know about it at first and you may never know about it you know it may affect some users and you never even hear from them so i i think as soon as you know enough to start to understand the basics of a framework it's fine to just jump into that framework you will continue to learn javascript as you use that framework as long as the framework isn't like such an abstraction that you don't use any javascript like react isn't like that i don't think view is like that you'll continue to use a lot of basic javascript stuff as you do that uh you know as you use your your library is is not a fan of the free code camp lessons so it's asking for something else um it says i am 17 i read in class 10th tell me um yeah if you if you're not a fan of the free code camp stuff i mean maybe if you prefer like just reading try out the you don't know js series that's available for free online also eloquent javascript is available for free udacity has some nice intro courses that are also free and it's a mix of video and exercises and projects uh so a little bit different from free code camp uh you know i would try those out see how you like those okay all right the timer went up again so let's let's just try one more time to get this running now with our new database and so what we need to do then is pull the stuff from our current database and then import it into our our database let's see let me i can't i can't find my terminal where did it go oh it's over here all right if we're still here let's try this enter password all right let me pull this off to the side while i enter this password it may not even show up in the terminal but rather be safe about this all right let's copy that password and paste it um all right awesome so let me go back over here and let's see um cool we have this backup file now this backup dot uh sql all right so we have a backup of our database and now we need to import the database okay uh let me go in now and i'm gonna log in to that mysql database is it not letting why are you not letting me copy and paste no there we go so let's grab that and let's get in here and go you can connect to the remote uh ssh i'm assuming i'm rude what's he doing come on hmm okay maybe i skipped a step did i skip the step yep i did i forgot a step all right all right let's find the cloud shell icon there we go okay so this is gonna be yeah just like a terminal there we go alright so let's try to get in here and all right let's see like and connection name maybe i need to use that i'm not exactly sure what name i need to use for this so let's try this user okay so that's obviously not the right name so let's try a different name uh maybe we can try vip address nope all right let's see test my sequel instance let's try that here maybe no i didn't want it to do it again all right let me go over here well that's going again just to check the chat um oh yeah there's definitely uh someone is asking about if this could be posted later it will definitely yeah don't worry about it if it's 3 a.m you know by all means go to sleep uh this will be available the recording will be available online so uh here on the freecodecamp youtube channel so yeah definitely um definitely do that oh that was cool it actually filled out what i needed whitelisting your ip for incoming connection for five minutes excellent all right enter root password okay yes all right so i am in and back up all right i did that i'm follow along with some instructions here so that's why it sounds like i'm talking myself okay cool so let's do a few things here to set this up so that we can migrate this so we're gonna go we're going to create this database we're going to call it wordpress and we're going to end that with a semicolon okay and then we're going to grant all privileges on wordpress to admin um we can you can use any username you want for that we're just going to do admin buy and we'll go password custom password if you wish all right uh password isn't the best password um but since this is just a test and i'm gonna shut this down right after uh then this is okay all right wonderful now we're going to disconnect hopefully uh let's make sure i did that right i forgot that i have an error dang it yep writing um sql commands in terminal is always rough especially because of the um semicolons at the end so that was my problem now i'm gonna exit okay you can tell i'm not used to sequel terminal commands i've done it before but not often okay now for this next part here's what we're gonna do i'm gonna run my sequel you admin p and then we're going to put the ip address of the database basics his name is oops so i think i skipped a step all right let me go back here and authorize actually i don't think i need this anymore let me close this out for now i can always come back in if i need to i need to authorize um this other database so authorized network we need to add a network and we need to put the ip address of our our test or our wordpress database so the one we want to bring the data in from all right wonderful now in that where's my terminal there we go so now back here just make sure we're still in here great now we're going to do my sequel u admin p h uh we need the ip address of our my sql instance so let's grab that and put that in here so what we're going to do is is pull that data that we made that backup that backup sql here we're going to push that over into our our new google cloud sql database let's get that ip address and we're going to send that over to wordpress right because that's the name of the database that we just created that's pretty much empty oops wrong way and we're going to grab that backup dot sql file and we should need a password and the password for that user was password so i think that should work not sure how long this is going to take so i'll read some from the oh wait a second jeff says did you save that change no what did i not say did i not save with the authorization i hope i didn't save shoot uh is that which what it was yeah save it i'll probably get rejected i might have to just run that command again shoot it's kind of an important step huh did it work done save there we go good catch on that one i totally didn't even see it so i'll probably just as soon as it saves i'll just cancel that command and then rerun it because this is gonna allow uh permission uh for stuff to come from this ip address and make changes here all right so let's stop that ctrl c and run this again hopefully we'll get something this time and it see try to see the logs see what's happening all right so i'm not sure if anything happened or not uh but let's check it out hmm interesting all right all right i just want to try to verify that this did something all right i mean we definitely had a spike in storage right about the time when i ran that command so that's probably a good sign all right uh jeff says run the my sequel uh command line interface on the target see if you got anything there oh yeah that's definitely a great idea let's see i'm just going to do that because it'll just automatically uh put in the command for me that i need alright all right connection is oops let me copy this password all right let's see if it saved any of my previous commands there you go all right what sql command is just going to let me see what's in this wordpress database really quick if anyone knows please put it in the live chat otherwise i'm just gonna uh look it up oh jeff's saying use wordpress okay show tables thank you yes all right cool really cool okay so now let me change all right let me run let's grab this and i'm going to try running now again and i'm going to put in the new info for the new database uh both of you who help me out i very much appreciate the help um that definitely saved me minutes of of looking up this stuff all right cool so i can't remember if it made me i can't remember if it made me put in the um all the password stuff and it actually displayed it so i'm gonna do this off screen all i'm doing off screen is it's just asking me for the database host name password and stuff like that i'm just copying pasting values so yeah and it is actually showing the value so some good all right it's it's running it's building i'll throw this back over here now y'all can see some of this stuff um yeah so i'm gonna go back to live chat answer some questions while this does its thing basically um if i'm going to run this once if it works wonderful if it doesn't work then i'll have to try again later because uh we've been streaming for a long time i need to eat believe it or not streaming actually takes a lot out of you wow that was so fast let's try it out no error between unit password and your wp config.php file it's incorrect or we can't contact the database yeah it should be these should all be pulling in the right stuff hmm all right something's still happening i'm not sure i thought i had the right stuff hmm oh you know what i may have made just a very simple error i'm gonna go i'm gonna run this again since it went so quickly and i'm gonna try again and if this doesn't work then i'm really done this time okay bring this over i imagine there's probably a lot in the live chat that i need to catch up on before we end so let me try to find where i left off at all right let's try this out uh air it again all right so what i'll probably need to do at this point is uh see if anybody else has tried to do this and has had similar problems double check and make sure all my my passwords and stuff are sure make sure they're all correct and let's try to figure it out but uh at least for me i learned some uh good stuff today uh that i'm happy i did so i learned how to go through the process on google cloud to set up this sql database which was actually really easy i learned how to copy everything over uh which was also pretty easy so i i think it was definitely worthwhile uh we we set up a service in cengrid yeah so i don't know pretty cool i'll definitely have to do the the setup of the server again you know in the google cloud if that's what i end up going with uh because obviously i'm not gonna personally pay for this since it's for my employer um but yeah a little disappointed we didn't get it working completely but uh we we ended up actually setting up more than i expected because i didn't think we'd have to do this whole database thing so anyway i hope you all learned something uh as well and i'm gonna get through these last few questions here and uh then i'm gonna call it a day for this this stream yeah nikki says google recursion do it do it now just for fun all right let's google recursion i love it it says do you mean recursion so i mean if you get it you get it otherwise look up recursion all right so looks like there's it's a the live chat's actually a lot of you all talking to each other and helping each other out which is awesome i love when that happens so thank you good deal yeah what are you doing baby my oneyearold daughter wants to come see me so she's upset i'm still working uh kevin says what continuous integration tools do you use in your company um shoot where did we just start using uh travis uh we just started using travis what do you all think about travis or other other tools like that what do you use um with your opinions on them i'm pretty new into that kind of thing so any advice you have is uh very welcome uh richard code says hey jesse just signed on have you used local by flywheel it's so good i have not used it yet i will have to check it out i haven't even really heard about it huh john hanson's here says hey i'll miss it all i'll watch it later as jesse says he sounds more intelligent at 1.25 speed i really do if you haven't tried watching the recording of the video at a faster speed try it because when i normally do the stream i take pauses and try to figure out what i'm doing and what i'm going to say next but when you speed it up i don't so i type really fast and i talk fast so i sound like i always know what i'm doing it's better if i have to watch my own videos i watch it like that it makes me feel better about myself uh jeff says try the migrate db plugin okay i'll yeah i'll have to try that thank you all right richard code says it's an environment for wordpress downloads and installs wordpress for you creates database and links fires up a local server amazing oh cool that does sound amazing uh thank you for uh for sharing that all right i'm at the bottom of the live chat i'm super hungry and uh so i'm gonna end this now i should be able to stream tomorrow i'll be in the office so uh be a little bit better quality be able to stream in full hd um yeah i think that's about it thank you all so much for sticking with me for so long and through so many issues i did warn you at the beginning stuff was not going to work um but i i still do appreciate you all uh with all your help and hopefully i'll get this working and can show you something you know it's actually working tomorrow but until then have a great day
