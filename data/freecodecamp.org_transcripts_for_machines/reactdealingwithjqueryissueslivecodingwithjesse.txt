hey everybody is Jessie today we're going to use jQuery with react which some of you might be shocked at that if you read a lot of articles and tutorials usually they tell you not to use jQuery with react and then they're usually right but sometimes you you already are using it or you have to use it for some reason in this case I'm using the materialized framework which needs jQuery for some of the things that it does also if if you haven't seen some of the earlier videos when I started this project the idea was that first we had a really really tight timeline so the first thing we were going to do was make a just a static site and have that ready to launch if we couldn't actually link up the WordPress CMS and with react like we're doing now well the the launch day got pushed back to this Thursday and that gave us enough time to actually do it the way that I wanted it to be from the beginning but in trying to complete that static site as fast as I possibly could I use some jQuery so now I need to make that jQuery work with react so I've had some success so far and making things work and I'll show you what I've done and then we're going to try to make this this navigation piece let me show you so this red navigation bar was sticky if you remember when we had the static site it was sticky when we converted this to react site it started throwing errors in the console so I disabled the stickiness of it just so that I could get rid of the airs temporarily until I had time to fix it so now it's time to fix it and let me make this bigger so we can all see oh if you watched yesterday and saw that I I went through everything and then couldn't get it to work the whole problem was I forgot to save the file so super embarrassing I had hardcoded that hello world page in so that I was searching for the data from the hello world post and then when I switched over to use the variable that was getting passed in I never saved it so it totally works now you can go on the the demo site there's a link and if you go into the to the news portion of it you can click on the different news articles it will take you to the right page so everything we did yesterday worked I I just didn't save it that's how it didn't work hey everybody I got a lot of people saying hi in the latch at I'll answer one question before you start it what's the best way to get started with react probably find it's called create react app and that's what is called so assuming that you know how NPM works and you can you know pull down packages like that then find create react app and you can download that start it up everything will be kind of premade for you so you have less options to customize but it's really helpful to get you started on that so I would definitely check that out and if your just read read through some of the tutorials on reacts site they're actually pretty good and what some some videos hopefully after I launch the site will have time to do some short videos highlighting some nice resources and give us some little tutorials and that's one of the topics that I'm going to touch on okay so let's get to this so this big section of code here that I've commented out is what controls the sticky nav so let's get rid of these comments and see what happens I think that's it now I need this okay oops okay so I think there we go I think that's everything that I commented up is now back in alright so let me make sure I save that this time and we're gonna let me bring this keep this over here let me refresh make sure with changes are in there okay we can see nothing's happening okay so our sticky NAB that was working when we had inpage snap is not defined all right so I'm getting an error I'll bring this over and show you so it's giving us this error it was working when the other static site is not working now it's saying that in page nav is not defined and ass on line one for T so let's go back is this something in vision where is that coming from yes seems like maybe I didn't need that so I'm obviously not defining that anywhere maybe I pulled that over from my previous project and didn't really need it let's just try again all right and refresh oh nice okay so you are getting this working here but what I keep having happen to me is that sometimes these will work and sometimes they won't work I'm not exactly sure why but when I actually put this on a server pretty much everything I'm trying to do a jQuery has not been working I'm not exactly sure why so here's what I did to get around that so let me show you oh actually I'll put this on the on the server in a second and again I'll show you guys how I do that or at least how I'm doing it right now so here's what I did okay so normally you would just put everything in your document ready function for jQuery so and that that would run for whatever reason it doesn't always run it's not always finding things when they're getting loaded so if I want to be able to actually call these like let's say from my component I need to make them available globally so this is kind of looks like a little workaround there's probably a better way to do this I've looked up before but never exactly figured out ways to just use jQuery right within a react component so like import it in and use it there and I haven't gotten it to work not that it's not doable I just couldn't couldn't get it to work and since I'm on such a tight timeline for this project I didn't want to attempt to get that to work so instead I knew this would work I had some things let's do this background scroll so let me show you we had this on the home page we have this effect and so I have this effect of scrolling it's a meeting let me refresh it for a second it should it shouldn't cut that off unless I not a not a great start everything I'm trying to do is either working when I expected it not to work or not working when I expected it to work so I'm just going to restart the the dev server here because it was it just kept loading so that's like it's pretty fast it'll start in just a few seconds all right it's ready okay so the effect that I had which for some reason is is cutting off here when it it was not cutting off previously but the effect that I have basically is this is like kind of like a parallax effect in the background and then it stops and then it starts flowing normally with the page okay so that's that's what we're trying to do I thought that I had fixed this part so it was cutting this image off but I guess I haven't so here's what I did I'm just going to run through this quickly is that how I did it's not important but just me about how we get it to work as within our react component is more important so basically just using some jQuery right because for two reasons one we already have to look Jake here on this page for materialized and to jQuery can save a lot of time and I don't have a lot of time right now so all I'm doing is I'm tracking the scroll as as the user Scrolls down and once they get to a certain point in the page I'm changing the background position Y and I'm changing it by a certain amount let's let me see what this variable is so basically I'm changing in in correlation to the scroll so like every time you scroll one pixel the position changes by one pixel so that's why once you get down to here and start scrolling up it actually is changing the position of this by one pixel every time I scroll one pixel okay so that's how I get the effect I tried just kind of changing it from like background attachment fixed to a different like just to initial or something that I had like a big jerk so at some point it would just change position this very abruptly and it didn't look nice the other thing I added to try to help get rid of this you know getting cut off here was I did add a check to see what the width was of the window so depending on the width it adjusts the position so I just have I just kind of set this in line with a little ternary operator here so it's like if the window is larger than 1540 pixels they were going to adjust it either up or down so you have a negative 12 adjustments are down or positive 12% up so for whatever reason I wasn't it's not exactly working right now so all right there yeah I think maybe my since I have the screen in like a weird kind of square which is not really a normal screen size nowadays that's what was giving me okay so that's kind of how it's supposed to look you should be able to see that part all right so enough about the how I did that the problem was when I first did this and I just had this whole thing inside my document ready function it wasn't working and the same thing with with this one you see a kind of a similar thing happened with this one a scroll function which I just wanted to have some buttons to scroll horizontally on a place where I have a responsive table okay so it worked when I tested it but when I put it on the server this would not work it was not it was not recognizing this this div at all so nothing was working on it so how I solved it was I pulled this function out out of the document dot ready so I pulled all this code out I put it in a function I give it this name now when I go to was my index page of it open so this exists on the index page so now I actually call I can call this from inside my component so I have this component did mount and I call this function inside of there so the function actually did it needed to be called and I tag could test that out in the you know the console where if I would call the function it would run but if just relied on that document already function it wouldn't it wouldn't work you wouldn't run so that's one way it kind of quick an easy way to get your components working now there could be some issues like let's say you have some components that aren't may not be loaded all right when this component did mount fires then you might want to wrap this and in a function that would wait until the site loaded entirely and that would work if it was farther down on the page and the odds of somebody scrolling there before that actually worked we're really slim so for in this case I don't need to do that it works and let me show you I'll pull in the actually have it here okay so this is the version of the site the that's on our test URL so this is actually running on the server the differences we're running next j/s which is our J's framework we're running it in production mode instead of dev mode and there are some differences one difference that I have found that's it's a little bit frustrating if you're not aware of it at first is when the hot reload happens sometimes things just don't work so some of your JavaScript stuff or your Styles just occasionally you'll have a weird glitch where things won't work so if that happens don't freak out just refresh the page and it usually works after that you won't ever have that problem in production because you're not using the hot module reloading obviously in production so let's go to the home page and we'll see this should work alright so that works one other thing to watch out for that I've had happen to me when I'm using this is right now all of this is being serverside rendering and served up so you can watch watch this little you know loading indicator here when I click team right it's actually reloaded that's it that's an entire page refresh but normally you know if you're working with react a lot of times you don't want that page reload you want it to just you click it and everything gets pulled in it's all handled clientside so you want that clientside routing you get you that immediate route right to the next page and you don't even have to do a page refresh so if you're going to do that your document ready function is not going to fire right because it already has fired right it's not going to happen again so you can't leave your JavaScript in there and expect it to work so I'm actually doing that and it works for some things so let me show you back here in our JavaScript so for instance this this scroller function I'm using on the events page let me find that just to show you so if you see on the events page I'm not calling anything from here yeah but in the document dot ready function at the bottom here I am actually calling it this scroller right I'm actually calling this as well just uh I was frustrated trying to get it to work so I was trying to run this function everywhere I could think of to get it to work so I'll probably verify that this doesn't need to be in here and then possibly take it out before this actually goes live just to get rid of some unnecessary code but I'm calling that here inside the document dot ready function and since right now we're doing all our routing like more traditionally where we have a page refresh this will still work let's go to the events page just to show you and we'll go down to the bottom and here's the the scrolling thing let me shrink the page so you can actually get a scroll okay so this is a responsive style table so I can scroll like this or I can use these buttons to scroll okay the reason I put this in is since this scroll bar gets automatically hidden I don't think it's hidden on all browsers but at least Chrome on iOS automatically hides this I wanted users to know that they could scroll so I put these buttons in and since I was going to have these buttons and I figured people are going to try to click those so it needs to do something so we have this girl so you can see if you're using traditional routing you can still call things from your document.ready function and they will work but not if you're using the clientside routing and let's let's just enable that just to show what happens what works and what doesn't work so if you're not familiar with next j/s check out their their dogs on get up I think I have the link in the description you will you'll see about I guess I'll bring up the ducks since I have it here no that's not it I said yeah okay I'll make this a little bit bigger so we can follow along okay so let's go to routing all right so check this routing here so we can enable clientside transitions between routes if we just use the link component we can also prefetch I'm not getting able to prefetch now maybe at some point if we have time probably not before launch we can go over this prefetching it is pretty cool we can save some time with loading but right now we just need to pull this in we need to import link and then we need to wrap our link we'll grab our taking AB menu link and this mic here so we're actually going to go to our component for that stinky nav so let's find that stinking EV and we'll import link and this is something that's built into next so if you're just using react without using next you won't won't have this alright so now let's make let's make this events a link because I think let's check the dogs just to be sure okay we just need to change it okay we're going to wrap it in the link and we'll keep the ax so link and then we're going to put in href I'm going to move the HRF to this link tag and we can move this inside the link and we can remove this I'm not going to worry about the title right now I think that should be fine there and we're save it okay now let's look here let me see I couldn't I couldn't tell if this whoa and get a lot of errors right now okay okay did you see I don't the era's are heard oh I'll show you the air is in a second but knock you're trying to fit now we're still getting a page refreshes see why that didn't work sorry if I'm losing you it's just is not working right now what happened here okay so we are importing this we're using the link tag I guess we can pull this off just since it was like that in the in the docks okay all right so we're on the events page verify this let me shrink this we can verify that this still works okay so that still works now we want to go to a different page and flip back okay so actually a routing just isn't working at all right now I'm thinking maybe just what the hell want to check maybe this has to be on a page we can check the example here next is a good job of having a little example projects so we can just go in here and check ok so they are running this on an actual page let's try to run it on a page and see if that makes a difference or actually it looks like our server is not working right now so let's restart it I'm getting an error on my server I've been it's been happening for like a week now where sometimes it will just hang I think I mentioned this at a video last week so so far it's just annoying and it hasn't slowed me down that much all right so let's let's try this not huh okay I don't know if you notice that what's happening is it is refreshing it's refreshing and not only that but we're getting all these errors here and these were the areas that I actually expected to get for that sticky knife it's saying cannot repro pre top of undefined okay let's look what it's trying to find is this the sticky knife this original sticky nav and it can't find it it can't so it obviously can't get the position so let's try let's try to do a refresh okay so let's verify okay well this now it now that you started working let's see okay there we go alright so here's what's happening so we finally got it to work so I think the the clientside routing is actually working now for that I don't know why it's still giving me a little a little flash I'll have to check this up to be sure Wow okay my dev tools just crashed so it's getting so many errors from that let's open that up again yeah I'm still getting all these errors so let's leave this page for a second so that we don't get we don't keep getting all these errors whoa Wow what did I break if you guys notice me do something hey let me know because now I'm getting so many errors and everything's not working I have not had this happen before hmm that's weird all right let me let's go check and make sure that we didn't accidentally change something that we shouldn't have so the only files that we've really changed let me let me go I'm just going to do the git status just to see what we change the only thing we changed was the component stinky nav component and the app.js file okay so let's check it out so we brought this code back in and that was fine we already we tested this and this worked okay we have this bottom out of class class original okay so it's doing a lot of this stuff and let me verify that we are actually calling this the proper name okay we do a bottom now all right awesome let's let's add in just like we did for the southern component or yet on the index page so on our index page we added in something like this I want to give this a try since it works for that page let's give this a try and see how this forward in case you haven't heard me say this in previous videos this video is just about showing me going through my daily work mistakes included so it's not exactly a tutorial I will be doing some tutorial videos when I get a chance and I'll put those on by my own channel so as we go through this this is not rehearsed this is actually me having real problems and trying to figure them out I saved this for I did a lot of other stuff today but I knew this was going to give me a lot of trouble so I saved it so this was at least somewhat on purpose to have things break because I think it's more interesting for the video so I apologize if you expected more of a tutorial and some of them will be more tutorial like but sometimes everything just goes wrong and we have to figure out what's going on all right so let's first what we need to do is pull this out let's grab everything everything we need here and we're going to pull that out and we're going to put it in a function we'll just put it up here function should we call this this is such thinking that right we'll just call it sticking out and let's throw all that in there and save it and now we'll go back here and let's see if we can call that we're going to save that and let's go back to this you better refresh okay so the sticking app works now let's try it on this events page that was what freaked everything out last time all right it's working I'm also not getting a millionaire's and my console like we were before okay that's nice not bad let me click a few more times just to see if we can recreate all those errors that we had we go back here I think our gosh test servers hanging again so well that's hanging what we'll do is I'll show you how I am putting this on the server right now because I don't think I should showing you that yet so let me bring this in right now I'm just going to say I'm just going to push this to get because what we're going to use get to put this on the server so all somebody else with theme I'm using the theme is setting SETI all right so the server restarted let's just all right cool that's working but what's not word okay so we were able to recreate some of this stuff in terms of the errors so this is no longer working let's give it a refresh just to verify that it's not working okay yeah definitely not working I'm going to make sure it's not a something weird with the screen all this is it working now okay that's interesting it started to work now for some reason it did not work I don't if you guys caught that when we first loaded the page it did not work we resize the page and it works which doesn't really make a whole lot of sense okay you see here it's not working until we resize we resize just a little bit and now it's at least kind of working it's giving us a weird thing okay now I'm going to troubleshoot that right now is I'm in the middle of showing you this yeah because some of these a call on the live chat says it's not working because your window size is less than 15 40 so I guess we'll go back and check this out now yeah so I do have let's go to this function the scroll effect here so I am checking for this window size the window width which should happen is if it's greater than 1540 it's just going to have a different base position but then it's still going to add us this dis scroll this position Y which is just based on the the scroll position so it should still be working I said but I'm not going to show overshoot that now that's just odd because I did test that a lot the only different thing that I was doing was I was testing it on another screen I don't I don't know why that is students make such a big difference but um I guess it does okay I'm we're getting okay so let me let me just show you this so for commit message where we do move remove sticky nav its own function outside okay so we move the stickeen out into its own function outside document dot ready that's about what we did okay so if you're not familiar with git it's version control all I've done is just I've saved this version of the code and I may have a little message there just to say what changed since the last version and now I've pushed it on to github which is a site where you can store your code and on all your versions so you can view it other people can view it collaborate and this repo is available so since we push this let me switch back over we're going to go into our server also looks like I'm still logged in let me just make a mouse to live in looks like this says there we go okay so I wasn't logged in it was still showing it but it was just kind of lagging a little bit so let's log back in so I'm using SSH when you use SSH this is my local machine right now and I'm just going to type in my username and then the IP address I have a private key on my machine and there's a public key stored on the server all right those have to match up and then I can log in and I don't even need a password so it's pretty cool I have to log in from this computer but it prevents people from trying to you know guess my password or bruteforce attack and get in so now that I'm in here you can see here's our folder so let's go in into that folder this is this has all the same things that we have on our local machine but I'm now on the server this is a droplet on digital ocean I did a few videos on how to set that up we're going to stop our server right now as you can see I just stopped that from running so the site actually won't work right now and now I'm going to get pool and all the changes I've now pulled down from github so this version and the version on a local machine that we're just testing are now exactly the same and now I need to build this again so I'm going to go npm run build okay and that's going to run i'll show you in our package.json when I say run build that's going to be equivalent of running next build and then I'm going to actually start it with with pn2 and this is what what will be run when I start I don't think I showed you this when we set this up but when we set up the custom server which I think was yesterday but I did need to change this to start the server we give it this environment variable of production and that basically the only thing I'm using this variable for right now is to change the time out the expiration of the the cache okay so that's all built doesn't take very long and now we're going to start okay so that started now let's go back to it and refresh make sure it's working okay everything's working and now let's give it a test so we did change some things so we added that stickiness back in I'm going to open up dev tools here on the side and I'll put it right here so that way we can check and see what kind of pairs we have let's see mine I don't want to preserve the log so let's refresh should we get a clean clean log here okay so you are getting some stuff let's see nonpassive event listeners will walk in touchstart event okay we're getting some stuff I actually have I have it set to verbose settings so we're getting a lot of stuff that you might not normally see all right so our stinky now is working great let's try this up alright that's working and if you remember this actually is just it's it's just being initialized from our our document ready function okay so this did work we're not using that clientside routing which will actually test out first I want to go over homepage and see what's going on there see sticky networks see all right looks like that's that's off that's not working it did stop at some point but it's stopping a lot farther down that we wanted to what would give it kind of a more normal screen size okay I I wasn't sure what was going on with these images but it looks like they're working let's give it a refresh just to doublecheck that okay the images are working it's possible I think I'm using a source set to do different image sizes and I may have now should be working to test that later okay so this this looks a bit more like it should and now I want to test this out to see if we actually are linking and it looks like that it did work okay there we go finally this is what I expect okay this is what I've been trying to get to happen almost the entire time let me tell you what happened just in case you missed it so we added a few minutes ago we added this clientside routing so before we just had regular link tags it was actually going back to the server we're getting page refreshes we had a clientside routing what happens though with with clientside routing is you the document.ready function doesn't fire again so this never initialized so you can see this is not working if i refresh the page it should work so let's do that let's refresh see it is working so we'll test this one more time just to just to test that our theory and demonstrate how this works we go to the about page I want to go somewhere that will give me a message to okay oh I see what's happening since I'm using source set on a smaller screen is kind trying to grab a different image a different sized image but I forgot to put the correct route I just went right to the image folder instead of static so that's why just a little little typo a little mistake there all right so now we're gonna go to events okay now what you see I think we did have a little flash here but we didn't actually have a refresh so these same errors that we just had on the homepage have not gone away if we had a page refresh this should have gone away so I see I just clicked on news it had a page refresh all that went away all right so those should have gone away so the rep the clientside routing is working and that also explains why this isn't working because we're only calling this from the document.ready function does that make sense want to stop and check on you you all for a second since I've been ignoring the live stream to try to get this to work I know there's going to be a little delay so I'm going to wait basically the question is does any of this make sense at all can you see why it's not working and I'll take just another minute here I know I'm over my half an hour but I'll take another minute to fix this we'll push it to the server and test it again to show that how to how to make your jQuery work with the clientside routing in react so I'll get ready to do the fix while I'm waiting to hear back from here okay finally okay so Patrick said it makes complete sense okay we'll move on here I know there's there's 43 other people viewing right now oh okay Daniel says it works too awesome so at least two of 43 say that it works if if you're one of those other 41 people and you are really confused leave a message in the comments direct message me on Twitter re watch the video I'm happy to help help you try to understand this especially if you really need to understand this for a project you're working on I'd be I'd be more than happy to talk to you go over this a little bit more or if you have a much easier or better way of doing this and you're just watching this thinking like what is this idiot doing please let me know so basically what we're going to do we have all this this is our scrolling stuff down here I haven't put it in its own component yet eventually I will put it in its own component because we do have some things that need to repeat for now we don't we don't have a ton of events so this might be one of the things that just gets hard coded um then this is weird sorry I just got distracted by this little oh okay my syntax highlighting just made it look weird but this is corrected we want event slash title it's highlighting some of the stuff as if it were JavaScript when it's really in here I am for some reason my plugin that's supposed to highlight react stuff more accurately as stuff working I think I probably just need to restart my editor all right so here's what we're going to do let's grab this from sticking up because why type when you can copy and paste and handle throw this in here and I believe we call this H scroll or yep H scroller so we're going to call this on component in mount there's only one thing I'm worried about I'm where that this will actually fire before this stuff loads down here if this was its own component I would be less worried about it because it would only be so we'll see if it works if it doesn't work that's probably why and III do have one more thing that could be done to fix it if that happens okay so we save that let's go over here let's go back to okay so we've changed this we're going to do a git commit and I'm combining to get add and the commit message into one and we're going to call H stroller from the component we're calling a stroller from component did mount okay we're going to push that now let's go back to our server and let's first we'll stop it now let's get pool now let's build if you notice I'm using NPM on the server but on my local machine I'm using yarn yarn is faster I like yarn more but it just simplifies things on the server if I restaurant straight NPM at least for now I have run yarn on the server too it's not a big deal but it's just one less thing I have to load on the server there was some a couple months ago when I set something similiar up there was some weird bug where I I couldn't run yarn with p.m. I had to use NPM it was something with it was it was looking for us so I I looked up the problem that I couldn't get it fixed so I just stuck with running NPM it's possible that it has changed now there's been up updates for p.m. to and you are in since that time but just in case you're wondering that's why it's different now let's just start it up again to the build is complete all right now we're back online and let's refresh if you remember we need to actually navigate away and back to there are sticky networks this should work alright that still works now let's go let's go out to the home page just to see if this if this works as well which it should be working right okay that works awesome sticky now is working on the home page and we're not getting any crazy areas except this one that we knew about already and that's just my fault for not citing the right path now let's go back to the vents now what should happen you can see we didn't actually have a page refresh because we still have all the same stuff in our console now what should happen here is as I scroll down this should work and it does ok so just to recap I'm gonna I'm going to finish up here before it ends I am going to show another video interview I did from syntax spawn and it's only like a 30 second video and I'll go through the live chat and answer any questions so just to recap in case people are joining in late did Seattle normally when you use jQuery you're going to put things inside your document your document ready function okay and then that way if you have to look up elements on the page they're loaded so they will be there the problem is when you're using react and you're using clientside routing which is common with react and you you go from one page to another and you don't actually have a page refresh the document dot ready function doesn't fire again so your code won't work the first time it ran it won't be able to it wouldn't have found that element on the page because you're on a different page so then when you switch that that code will just never run the solution or at least one solution is pull out that code to yours you're still in your main app J S or whatever you want to call it scripts dodged as you're still in there you still can use jQuery as normal but you've just pulled out literally you just copy and paste that code that's doing the thing that whatever you want it to do that jQuery and you just throw it a function name it whatever you want and then you go into your your component and then the component did mount function which this this isn't next specific this is in and react so any type of react thing that you're doing will have this well I haven't worked with react native so I'm assuming req negative has something like this or maybe the same thing but basically you're going to have component did now and you're good call it from in there and that's going to make sure that when you do your routing like we just did okay so when I go to a different page here you can see I haven't done that with the side nav yet so it still doesn't work so we're going to a different page and now we're going to go back to events events right now is the only page where we've enabled the clientside routing for we've gone back to events the document ready function is not fired but since this component is now on the page and it wasn't this component has now mounted and in this case this the entire page is one component if this will be split out at some point but since that's the first time this component is loading its mounted it actually calls that that function okay so hopefully I know a couple you said that that did make sense so hope I didn't confuse you too much it seems like nobody said they're confused yet so I hope that was helpful for you I'm going to repeat what I said at the beginning ideally you don't want to use jQuery when you're using react okay there are some weird side effects that happen because react is trying to track everything in the DOM and if you change it with jQuery instead of the reactor way to do it then it can mess up reacts tracking of the dawn okay and you will get some errors and stuff it won't always break your site okay obviously we're using it here our sites not breaking we're not you know the world is not ending by using jQuery and react together but I expect that a lot of you might be in a situation where you're converting a site to react or for whatever reason it's going to be a big deal to try to do things in vanilla JavaScript or the react way to do it when you can do it very easily with jQuery sometimes it's just a time issue like with me right now I just really don't have time to figure out how to do all these things in vanilla JavaScript I know it's all possible but it's just faster use jQuery right now so hopefully that helps some of you I'm gonna play let me play this video for you and then after the video I'll do a quick run through the live chat see if there's any questions that I can answer for you right now and then I'll have to go because this site needs to launch on Thursday and there's a lot of work to do so I'll pretty much be taking breaks for sleeping and that's about it until we launch so let me I did this yesterday and it worked so I'm gonna try this again I know you can't see this but I'm literally just unplugging my headphones so that I can play the audio from this video on my on my speakers on the Mac lemme there we go I have an iMac so I'm just going to put these through the speakers and the microphone on the iMac will pick it up I don't have any special equipment at this point so hopefully this will work and it's loud enough me full screen it for you okay so this is just a very short interview from syntax Cohen it's a conference that went to last week really great conference and this is a Ron I I know I'm going to mess up his last name sorry Ron um so Ron AK right ratha rai tha tha so sorry Ryan he's a really nice guy I got to talk to him and go to Lee he did a talk on AWS lambda so let's hear what advice he had he's going to say what his name is where he works what he does and he'll give some it what he's excited about with new technology and some advice for new new coders all right say yes I'm wrong I work at boomtown as the back and suffered over the chassis approached me he asked me about you know and to talk about your poker game and talk to people right ah see uh one of the questions was what was the technology I'm excited about one of them is serverless the surrealist framework that just came out and it works at live that a bunch of other cloud platforms it's pretty cool pretty nifty work live and advice that I have for people trying to get into coding is that sure it's nice to watch courses and you do projects but try stepping out of your comfort zone that will help you immensely alright so that's it for the interview really short interview some of the other ones were were longer but I think I have maybe three more to show you let me go to the live chat quickly before we before we end okay I did answer some somebody asked how to get started with react and I answered that earlier so if you're interested in hearing that answer watch the re recording this video and go back to the beginning Ezra is as I'm still a beginner so I'm already lost sorry about that react was like super confusing to me when I started to use it so just just stick with it it it will click at some point all right somebody's asking about my text editor so it is Adam and I'm using the SETI theme okay not a lot of questions somebody else says they're beginner and they're lost so I apologize if I lost you I its if you're not familiar with reacts or even familiar that much with JavaScript I I could see you you would definitely be lost so I'm not always going to be at this kind of level doing videos I expect when I'm done with this project then I'll go back and probably start up a new project or get back to just some things that are like basic HTML CSS things so since this is just my day to day job it's just a big mix of things so if this was a little bit over your head then you know thun thun back in what some of the older videos and you know just follow me on Twitter I'll tweet out what the topic is every day and you can see if it's a topic that interests you that seems like it's more at your level than then tune in there's definitely some really like beginner type stuff that that has been on this show and will be on this show especially like as we get started in projects so hopefully there'll be something for everyone at every at every skill level my hope is that some people will get a lot from this some people if they're beginners and some people who are more advanced will give me some advice and and you know we can kind of work together to learn from each other okay we had one more question here how how do we manage this sticky nav UI check out the playlist so live coding with jesse is a playlist on the free code camp channel in that playlist you'll see maybe two weeks ago I did a video where we live coded that sticking up and I went through that so check out that video if anything is confusing just leave a comment on the video and I'll get back to you and try to explain it more but we did I'm pretty sure that I went over that part in in a video and if I'm just totally losing my mind and I didn't make a video leave a comment as well and then maybe I'll put that on the list for for a video to make later on you can also check out all the code for that on github the link is in the description so there's any other questions get them in in the next five seconds otherwise I'll see I'll be back on tomorrow same time I'll probably be more stressed tomorrow than normal because at that point it will be less than 24 hours to launch and I will have probably been working quite a lot between then and now so hopefully this site is looking way more finished tomorrow and maybe our livestream the launch so we'll see I haven't set an exact time for that launch but that might be cool to actually live stream the you know pointing the domain name to the right servers trying it out and maybe we'll probably be doing some testing tomorrow so maybe I'll show you how I test with browserstack and and things like that we'll try to find some bugs right that's it for today thanks for watching and I'll be back tomorrow
