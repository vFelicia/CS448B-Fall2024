hello hello hello hello everybody we are going to get started here momentarily we're just going to wait for people to filter in and i'm going to get a chat window up here just so i can get you all i'll try to mention your names i can never do it very well hello devops tech techier i'm from ohio in the united states hello hello quincy thanks for having me on again all right i'm going to increase this just a little bit more there we go all right so we're going to get started in about 30 to 60 seconds again i just want people to filter in a little bit more all right you can't see the workspace well hopefully you can right okay so let's go ahead and get started so the first thing i did a live stream here last week uh exactly one week ago at the same time and for those of you who missed it you don't know who i am i'm gary simon i've been a ui ux designer and a frontend developer for the last 20 years i've been doing the teaching thing for the last 10 years on my own youtube channel which you can check out right here so it's at youtube.com forward slash design course and you can subscribe up i do these live streams here on my channel i call it the negative space i'm going to be doing the same show essentially here and if you like this you know go ahead and subscribe up uh at my channel also designcourse.com that's my site i'm relaunching it in a few months time last week i did mention this site and i told you to enter your email if you want to be notified when that goes live and of course with my luck the server that the api endpoint was on at media temple completely went down so a lot of you tried to enter your email and it gave you an error message so again enter it and this time it will work assuming media temple servers stay up all right and in order to participate you need to go to twitter and you can tweet your user interface design this could be a live website it could be just a figma or adobe xd prototype i and also use the hashtag live ui ux review all this information should be in the description here in youtube all right so i'm not going to be taking these in any particular order i picked out a few initially and so what we're going to be doing is i'm going to be reviewing your ui designs and i'm going to be considering both user interface design and user experience design when i look at these so user interface design would mean i'm taking a look at things like white space alignment scale typography color and contrast in visual hierarchy and when it comes to user experience design or ux design i'm going to be asking myself you know it doesn't make sense to do this or that here uh is it going to be hard for the user to use is the verbiage you're using makes sense and so we'll also ask at the end of my little review i'll ask you who are watching in the chat here to give it a rating of one being the worst and 10 being the best i try not to look because i don't want you guys to poison the well and i'll give my rating afterwards and we'll see if we agree or not all right so the whole goal here is just to improve if i don't review your design don't worry about it that much it's not a big deal you're still going to gain a lot of insight based on what i have to say i what's happening with other people's submissions all right so i've picked out a few like i said initially and i'm just going to get started right here with this particular entry so when i look at this design let me push this over so we don't see the background there we go so when i look at this design what i immediately think is first of all there's not a lot of white space from this little graphic and the the top portion here so we can immediately push this whole section down away from the navigation up top second we're lacking what's called visual hierarchy now again this is a ui design fundamental it's not a ux topic i and i've talked about this before in my last stream but nailing your visual hierarchy is very important because what it means is i'm not sure exactly where i should look first when i consider all this text right here i'm not sure where to look so you need to use your ui design fundamentals such as scale color and contrast and alignment in order to reinforce that visual hierarchy or in other words direct the eye where you want to see it so let me just show you what i mean real quick if i get out the dev tools here and i take this element right here okay well what we could do is we can font weight bold it because i think this is going to be the most one of the most important parts this is kind of like the headline of the website right and i think we could also take color so color and contrast we're going to increase the contrast by making the color white so now all of a sudden we see this the eye is directed to this section much more than this stuff down here so now we have a place to actually look it's probably a little bit longer of a headline than i would want we could also probably slightly increase the font size so what's 2m that's a little bit too big maybe 1.3 m units maybe line height 1.3 m as well and now we really can see that this is an important element it's the one thing that we want people to to be able to see all right so next up after this impressed already hit this button and so i'm not going to hit it but it's it's basically a it's a mail to you know their email so it's going to open up my email client um i wouldn't advise doing that now this person is doing something witty which is i see you don't just hit random button on the internet good for you let me flex some of my skills you don't want to trick your visitors i understand you're trying to be unique and witty but you don't really want to trick your visitors because here's the problem sometimes somebody will quickly look at a site they might just read this headline and then see this button like why would i want to hit this button i'm exiting out of this site they're not going to bother reading this part down here where you said you don't just hit a random button so that's something to take into consideration the skills uh progress bar i talk about this a lot in fact i did a video today on my own youtube channel where i talk about the top 10 worst ui design trends of 2020 and this is this is actually one of them it's one of the recent ones that i've seen i you don't want to put a progress bar in my opinion on with your skills simply because what if somebody wants somebody who's proficient in c and they see when they stack it up against all your other skill sets it's gonna it only tells them that this person's not very good and here we go again okay okay i agree using progress bro for skills is not a really good idea so you're being witty but you might be confusing people because they may not read this all right so all in all uh that's my review here there's a lot more but i have to move on what do you people think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best by the way if i refresh this you'll see the original design and this is my changes to reinforce the visual hierarchy so if i refresh this you'll see you're not really sure where you should look first so let me know in the youtube chat one being the worst 10 being the best and we'll see if you guys agree with me and i'll give you about 15 seconds until i start seeing some roll in so i'm just kind of scrolling up here trying to think of what i would give this one personally i'm probably going to say around i could see all the comments on the side of my view my peripheral vision i'm not looking at your answers i'm going to go ahead and say a good old 5.3 or so all right so looking at these we have some eight seven five two five seven six six six five five okay yep uh pretty much around there we had some variants there quite a bit so another one that i wanted to review here is from this user right here so there's nothing wrong with absolute simplicity of course we have a lot of simplicity here we have a lot of white space there's just not much happening here one problem is is i we see we have hi i'm you know your name and then underneath it looks like a button i want to click on it but it's not a button so i might rethink that i would also work on and this is a ux specific idea the ad copy here i think you can probably do a little bit more with this area to fill it out um even also taking this left column here in this right column and trying to construct it in such a way that it fills out more of the user interface also there's no call to action this looks like it could be a call to action because it's a button but it's not but so there's not really a call to action if you want people to scroll down at least do the floating animated scroll down area i'm a fan of having buttons though just to give people something to click on to go right where you want them to outside of that we have another section right here now if you look at the code for this this is whole section there's like a i actually like the background here it's a really cool sort of you know very barely visible background it has nice texture to it it this whole section is set up on a height 100 viewport heights or 100 vh in css and that's good that's fine i like that but this section right here has not been centered vertically so we have all this unnecessary white space so you want to address that next up this is unnecessary this whole me thing because you already said about right here you have a title it says a little about me that's all you need so you don't want to be redundant in that sense so i would just delete that and then take this center it vertically so if you're using the grid that would be like place item or place content uh center and that'll automatically do it for you another thing i noticed this is something i see all the time unfortunately is on the this is a desktop view i this would be right here on a mobile device right where it makes sense to use a hamburger menu if you have enough links to justify it but out here you only have three different links the pro this is a ux issue you don't want people to have to unnecessarily click in order to access a navigation you only do that if you don't have enough physical room to give them access to so you only have home or wait me work find me just put those three right here that way people can click on them and access that quite quickly next up this part's not too bad there's no big ui or ux issues occurring here although um i guess if you only have two examples you can go ahead and fill them out but it might make more sense to put these maybe in a column of three and then list out more at the same time all right so that's my review here what do you think that this person should get for a rating one being the worst and ten being the absolute best you've ever seen i'll give you about 15 to 20 seconds all right i'm going to give this a rating of probably let's see there's not a lot of like really bad things happening here so i'm just going to do i like kind of this section here could improve on the contrast um i'm going to say a 6.1 maybe or so yeah there we go very good and by the way everybody please try not to spam don't give your same answer multiple times in the text chat it just clutters it up way too much it makes the life of the moderators difficult um so yeah just only mention your your answer once all right so next up i have another one that i wanted to showcase that somebody submitted all right so what's interesting about this example here is um two days ago i released a video about using photographs for your landing pages specifically like in the hero section of a landing page just like in this context and there's nothing wrong with doing this um i think they used it and they did it correctly because they did push the darkness on this image um well enough so that you can see the type sitting on top of it a lot of times people try to show you the full image without darkening it and then it's hard to read everything on top so they did that well um but if you do want to see alternative more modern ways to approach this type of design this type of layout check my video um because i show a way to do this so that you have a full nice vibrant image that is seamless and kind of worked into the user interface but for what this is welcome to foodika visit blogs i would probably fill this out with a little bit more content and maybe a sub headline at the very least visit blogs i'm not sure you know where this would take me exactly so apparently this is a blog and this is what you want people to end up on right here the most i actually like the design it's pretty solid from what i see here but it does make me wonder if you really want people to go to the blog why do you have kind of like a splash page really i mean i would take him straight to the content as much as possible so coming down here chef's choice weekly special click here okay so i'm trying i'm still kind of confused about what this is exactly like the purpose of the site and so that sometimes that's a ux issue as well sometimes that gets lost and you really want to address this information as much as possible let me close out my my email client um outside of that just looking at the ui design it's itself it's pretty solid here there's some minute things um for instance we have a certain amount of white space between these two columns but then over here it's like half it's really a good idea to use consistent white space especially in the same section between columns and rows so that's a really small gripe also another small gripe i have down here looking at this email form submit there's a nice allaround wellapplied white space within this button around the text however if we come over here just slightly i'll increase the size one thing that throws things off these are very new small things but if you if you have a lot of them on a design it's just it's not going to look good and you may not know why but what i would do in this case there's not enough white space on the left right here compared to the top and the bottom as well as what's applied over here so that's very small my new issue that is worth and it's easy to address so if we see padding the element is right here maybe we can put one m unit 1m on the left so now that small change just brings everything together so if i refresh this you'll see what it goes back to it's just slightly off all right so that is my review for this one what do you people think that this person should get for a rating one being the worst you've ever seen and 10 being the best you have 15 to 20 seconds so let's see me what would i give this i mean this is a nice photograph it is up here i'm not too happy about uh position fixed backgrounds here i think it's a little bit disorienting to people so i probably wouldn't do that but this is pretty solid overall probably going to be our highest rated one so far to the point so i'm going to give this one a let's see a seven just a straight up seven i think would work pretty well for that example all right so i have a couple more that i just chose before we began and then i'll start looking at the twitter feed for the hashtag all right so there's a number of issues with this particular example and in this case i would say the person who designed this really needs to understand those ui design fundamentals that i mentioned before because a lot of this is ui design based not necessarily ux based so like a like i mentioned at the beginning of the stream white space alignment scale typography color and contrast and visual hierarchy you need to understand all of those and then gain practice applying them so first and foremost we have a navigation up here but then we have this small amount of text kind of really close so there's an issue of a lack of white space first and foremost and there's also i it doesn't really make sense also from a ux standpoint to have this type right here when you have a headline and then a sub headline over here so it feels very disconnected and this just seems randomly placed so what i would do is i would take this whole section and i would oh and by the way just a front end development tip here you don't want to have like two h1s here for this these would probably be the best used as like paragraph tags right here so i would remove those so now we simplify the top that looks better and it makes more sense also you want to make sure as much as you can you want to make sure that your design is working well responsively and notice this button it's touching the edge here and it just doesn't look very good in this case so you want to fix that as much as possible next up there's an issue with visual hierarchy in the topography so yes this is bigger and this is slightly smaller but it's still not separated enough visually so i would reduce the scale here and maybe even make the font weight normal and not bold and then that you see that clear separation between those two elements and the view my work is unnecessarily large you're going to want to take that down quite a bit also i would say this area this little blob sort of bezier curve it doesn't look 100 smooth to me it looks like somebody took this into maybe an illustrator a vector drawing application and where you place and how you place the anchor points is very important when it comes to creating these very smooth blob effects so i would just i try to remedy that as well your navigation too much white space in between each individual link you'd want to fix that and yeah so that's just uh my quick review of this landing page what do you people think this person should get for a rating one being the worst in 10 being the best i don't agree that it's a seven i want you i want to judge how it currently is for me i think it will give this one a rating of yeah it's going to have to be a little bit on the lower side just because there's a lot of issues so i'm going to give this one a flat 4. yes i think that's fair enough now if you fixed all those issues that i mentioned yeah you can bump this up to like a 7 or so or 7.5 based on the content that is here and how it's presented all right seems like most of you agree all right next up there's one more that i had that was preplanned here all right so a couple issues right away that i'm noticing are this graphic right here look how close it is to the navigation you know you definitely want to give that white space there's nothing worse than something that's just like sitting there in the navigation or right next to it that's just taking focus away so margin top you know maybe seven m units there we go that's a lot better looks a thousand times better next up we have the headline in the sub headline those are in terms of typogra strictly speaking of typography those are done well this is light this is bold and it's also larger so it's done well but i would say there's probably a little bit too much white space between both of these and then next up here's here's a ux issue i this doesn't make sense in my opinion it doesn't make sense to use this little linkedin embed right here for a few reasons first of all it doesn't really quite fit this design i i understand that you you want them to go to your linkedin but at the same time you already have a linkedin right here along with all of your other elements and so if you really want them to go to your linkedin i would simply put a button like this and that's it i want to put this whole thing right here and that way it would really help the flow of your design a lot better because this just does it seems out of place right here um next up all right so i actually like this section here um where we have the two columns right here and i strive for i i like that that's really set up well but i would say there's an issue with color there's also an issue with um you making this the description bold and making that kind of stand out more rather than the title of each or the label of each of these four sections so let me show you real quickly how i would refactor this particular design so first of all it's kind of also hard on the eyes a little bit too hard on the eye so i would change this color to maybe something that's a darker desaturated bluish or so i like that um and then inside of it we'll take these elements and we'll do color white and we're also going to font weight bold those now i know it looks ugly right now but don't worry we're going to fix all of that and then you might want to say okay maybe we'll make the color white here and that's fine but you know what we could still increase the or improve the visual hierarchy of this section because these being 100 white and these being 100 white kind of makes a little bit hard to quickly scan this area so what i would do is instead of making it white here's my little trick we take the color picker and you could do this in figma or adobe xd if you're working in a prototyping software or design we take the background that's sitting on now of course it's hidden now i like to take the color picker and just go up a little bit and notice where it says i'm not sure if you can see it here color con color it says contrast ratio 3.14 you want to get that up into where it this gives you a positive reading a check mark so right there is probably the minimum double a and this is according to the wcag 2.0 color contrast guidelines i know that's kind of like a word solid there look it up i've done videos on this you want to make sure you have a minimum level of contrast and that way you'll have a much more accessible design for those who have visual impairments so like right around there would be pretty good i like that so look at this i i like this a lot better compared to what it was before i'm going to refresh and show you the original so this is what i had and now look at the original so this is just kind of harder to read in my opinion if you wanted to keep the same background color you can but at least bold these up and make these uh not quite as bold as they are or just make this a lot bolder all right so that's my quick review here for this design what does everyone think this person should get for a rating one being the worst in 10 being the absolute best i'm going to make an adjustment to myself real quick while you get your answers in there i wanted to improve myself the color was off with me all right so for this one i'm going to go ahead and give this a rating of yeah i think this is a solid 6.3 so yes i am using the point systems i'm getting a little bit more specific 10 just isn't enough or just using the ones place all right so it seems like a negative 10. that's not nice all right okay so yeah it seems like yep you're welcome let's go ahead and look at some of the ones that have been submitted here so let me refresh this and we'll check out just a few of these um and see what how i can do this off the cuff which i i do this for the most part um this is i'm going to try to find sites or examples that are live on in the browser because i like to also just see it fully realized as opposed to a prototype most of the time um okay gary please review this one uh so this is an aesthetic like a makeup company all right all right okay so first thing the first thing that in a good thing is if i have to sit and stare out of design for a while in order to find something really wrong that's a good thing but there is something that i think could definitely be approved here and that is the orientation the layout of this form also there could be accessibility issues because if this is just an email placeholder for the label it gets hidden i mentioned this in the last stream i have to mention it every time i do one of these live streams because too many people rely on the placeholder value as a label but the problem is once you start typing in it the label goes away and then sometimes people they might get up from their computer and come back they forget what is this form field i have no clue what i'm doing here so it's always nice to have at least a floating label i in you can't go wrong when you're actually using a label element in html because it will never be hidden all right all right next up when you have just three elements form elements like this having them float next to each other like one here one here and then your name right here and then request it makes more sense to collapse those all each on their own row so that way it's a lot more easy for people to fill out and just scan with their eyes so i wouldn't agree with having these in two different columns outside of that let me scroll down see what else is happening here all right i think you could probably increase the size or at least the positioning so you have this card here you want to take this and make sure that this centered vertically within that card same thing here i would probably increase the visual hierarchy here or improve it by taking these elements on the left and making them bold and that way you can easily separate them from the prices over here and there is a lot of kind of card based design there's a lot of type here so i might think about possibly restructuring that to make it a little bit less i don't know maybe i'm wrong about that um i just i think it probably be improved visually if you bold these up over here and you center things over here the type is a little bit small in areas like right here chin cheek and nose i thought that said check for a second a little bit small on the small side so you definitely want to rethink that possibly maybe increase it um i really like the type you're definitely reinforcing that that higher end feel uh this this feels luxurious to me and that's kind of what serif fonts tend to do but so i think that's done well there's good white space here inside of these containers so that's all working out well you might want to separate this section right here with the about section in a different content container perhaps maybe making this part like a lighter color maybe even white or close to it and that way it kind of gives more structure to the layout having them inside of individual containers all right and then same comment with the uh this this area right here um make sure you're using labels or at least floating labels all right what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best also i'd probably try to increase the quality of your photo here you can tell there's some decent pixelation here so definitely look into that i'm going to give this one a let's think here i'm going to give it a 6.9 and it seems like most of you are agreeing with that already all right who is next up let's see here let me scroll down just because i don't want to people i want to make it random like i don't want to do only the latest submitted so i'm just going to scroll down randomly and then just check some of these out um let's see here i've been doing a lot of portfolios so i kind of want to change that up first project somebody's first project i'm going to move it off screen first and then check it out okay now this is your first project i'm hoping that it's not based on a template because if i'm if i'm reviewing designs i don't want to base it on a template um that somebody created already so i'm just going to make the assumption that this is not a template the reason i say that because if it's your first design this is actually pretty good for somebody's first design so looking at this there's some um let's see here strange things happening just because we have no navigation that's the only reason i say that now you don't always need a navigation if you have an extremely simple onepage site you know maybe you have one purpose and that's it so maybe that's the case here again once again we have this issue with the forms i'm going to assume these aren't floating you can never know until you click inside of it to see if they somehow float up so if i do full name yeah unfortunately they're hidden also i wouldn't make the actual type white because white on this light gray is not enough contrast i guarantee that would that would fail the contrast checker so you want to use labels here um also this doesn't make sense to me right here having the contact button right outside of the container right here that i would not do that also i would not use this gray color right here this it's kind of like a mid mid gray eye for using as like uh colors like for like backgrounds and stuff like the background of this little card here almost never works it's very hard to make it look good so i would change that color to something else so for instance i would take get out of there i i dealt with this last time okay there he goes so i would take this background and i would make it something that fits you know you're using this color right here we could use that that looks better already just that change you could go darker maybe it will create a little bit more saturation or you know i probably say this one is if you're gonna do this that would be best and then also i would change uh let me change that again really quickly um also i would change the gray here uh that doesn't that what that because it's great now it doesn't really look that good so i don't see the background property for this let's see if i can still change it so if i change background no don't do that i was just typing blue so i have access to the color picker i would take this and maybe make it darker probably make it a little bit darker like that and then fix up the color here as well because the gray doesn't fit very well so if i refresh we'll see the original and i'm just not a big fan of that one right there outside of that looking at this this is pretty good right here you can read it we have a lot of borders borders are one of those things that are for the most part outdated but it's not horrible here um so i'm just clicking on this all right so there's not much else i can do i can't scroll down so i will conclude this rating a one being the worst time being the best what do you think this person should receive yeah you're right you know we could actually because this is the call to action right here we could make this stand out look a lot more we could take the the blue this color this button put it inside here and then make it like orange or we can make this whole section really stick out and make it orange as well because orange is a good complementary color uh to to blue i mean yeah to like a blue color here so um now of course the gray inside of it really makes it look ugly but that could definitely work so for this i'm going to give this a rating for what it is and also especially considering if this is really something they did from scratch it's their first design it's it's pretty impressive but as it is not considering that as it stands i'm probably going to give this a just a flat sometimes i i get stalled like 5.9 or so but considering it's their first design if they designed it i i have to give it like an eight or nine uh for a first time for sure you should see some of my stuff back in the late 90s when i started not good all right so next up i let's see here let's come up here down i'm trying to stay away from portfolios just because there's so many portfolios i've done already let's see so there's so many portfolios this one might not be a portfolio so let me check all right so we'll really quickly spend some time on this one this one needs a lot of work um first of all you don't want to have your image here not being fluid you don't want this to happen next up we have an issue with contrast you can't hardly read this remember i talked about using backgrounds photographs as backgrounds you want to push them off so they're water marks so you decrease the brightness and you darken the whole thing and then that way we can see what's up you don't want to make um this sort of thing comic sans uh and mix your typefaces so that's bad topography right there you don't want to have glows on them as well on your text it pretty much will never turn out looking well um we also have an issue here um with just the cards being spaced out like this and kind of disconnected with the type underneath it not being encased in them so yeah we're not going to bother with a rating for this one just because there's really not enough there but i in that kind of case definitely go back to the basics in terms of ui design and learn about all those fundamentals that i mentioned before next up i this is a project that is designed to develop for a startup company so let's check that out always moving it off to the side of the screen just to be safe okay now looking at this okay so we have the logos already here and i will say now i've been i was an identity designer a logo designer uh and that's all i did for about five to six years of my career and i've i've designed countless logos and i can say right now that this logo needs to be rethought because this looks like it says peeve not speed this s is too abstract so i i'm not sure if you have control over this or if this is your your project but i would definitely change that because that's an issue people are going to think your business name is peeve so outside of that in terms of uh ux and your your ad copy uh that you're using or your your web copy speed does not make sense here um i would this is first of all in terms of the visual hierarchy you're placing all the emphasis on the name and i don't think that makes sense to me the emphasis should be on the headline and identifying what exactly is happening here what is this business about what is this website about welcome to the world of faster deliveries that's what we want to know we don't want to have this huge emphasis this big white container with the business name so i would change that the discover more when you hover over it i would get rid of that uh the drop shadow it just it doesn't work well in my opinion it just adds unnecessary uh clutter or if you're going to do it make it be more of an afterthought don't make it be so obvious as it is um coming down oh also the navigation i wouldn't have an underline under every single nav item maybe the one that you're currently on like this is the home page or the about page i'm not sure which it's obviously the home page or whatever um but not every single one of them just because the big thick borders add unnecessary clutter also there's been a lot of there's been several studies about people expecting the a home link uh in your navigation people expect to see a home button so they can get back to the home page or what they perceive as being the home page so that's also something just to think about people want to see a home button scrolling down here all right so now i scroll down we're left with just this for quite a while which is a big empty area so i would make this come in quicker also this is too large on this resolution at least i'm not sure how responsive it is and it's not responsive so the layout breaks i'm not sure if maybe you didn't get to that part yet because this looks like it's designed only for desktop so you definitely want to fix that if that's something that you haven't considered we have issues with the topography and the visual hierarchy what we do is more which is the label that needs to be the thing that catches people's eye their eye the most i this yeah this is way too large you don't want it overlapping need more white space also has alignment issues so there's a lot happening here that could definitely be fixed this is probably the best part i kind of like this although i would have more white space away from the center line here all right so that is my rating one being the worst 10 being the best what do you people think this person deserves i'll give you about 15 to 20 seconds i will be doing this for about 15 more minutes or so and then we will conclude what do i want to give this design i'm personally thinking somewhere in the fives the type is just way too large i mean this could be cut down way down way way way way down along with these icons here as well by like hundreds of percent down i'm going to give this one just a flat 5.0 maybe 4.6 or 4.9 or so seems like most of you are disagreeing with me you think it should be rated higher okay well that's okay not everybody can be 100 right like me i kid all right uh let's go up back top here and i'll check out some of these that were submitted um let's see here we'll do latest okay so here is a esport site i did all right um it's in a different language so i'm going to use the google translate option or at least i'm going to try to all right we have some we have quite a bit of animation occurring here all right so let's refresh this now it's an esports site so we have to take that into consideration um when i'm doing this review because you know the logo being intense the animation intents in the background video being intense you know that's more forgivable and acceptable um or maybe even warranted um given the nature of the site and what it's about having said that i would say there's probably a little bit too much animation occurring in the background so it's a little bit disorienting looking at this so you could still keep the video based background but i would probably try to choose clips that are a little bit less in motion all right so reduced motion also i do think though that they've done a very good job of making it more of a watermark and decreasing the contrast and making it a desaturated 100 percent grayscale so that works quite well the logo placement i would like to see it up a little bit higher because it's kind of further down on the page and also you're missing something that's really important in my opinion yeah we know this is about esports because it says it here in your logo however what else is about we need to be a little bit more specific and use all this space wisely um because every page should have a goal and so i don't know what i'm supposed to do here i don't know what type this is like is this a is this news is this a news site is this um is this like a of a person or a company that has esport events like i'm not really sure what's happening here just yet or is this a team like is this an esports like clan i used to be i used to play quake 2 like crazy and i was in clans back then this is back in late 90s and early 2000s so i think we need to address what exactly this site is about a little bit more in this area but overall there's some cool things happening here issue with alignment if we we can see right here it says sun we have the title subtitle but then pushed over about 20 pixels is the description you want those to be on the same exact column also um i would work with the i'll probably put this in all into a paragraph and i would not separate them with lines right here because it just looks a little bit too disconnected and a little bit too dis uh a little bit too unorganized all right so what do you think this should be click on matches somebody wants me to click on matches all right one issue here the match with this little logo hard to see um nonetheless i'm not going to review the whole site though we don't have enough time for that one being the worst 10 being the best let me know in the comments what you think esports automatically zero oh wait it looks like oh i thought this was fixed it was based on like scroll position i'm going to give this right here i'm going to give this a rating of a 6.3 or so some people i tell you just because you spam it 20 times 10 doesn't make it 10. i'm sorry all right okay let's continue on my first commercially used website oh okay i love this i love these types here all right i'm going to this is another one i have to translate if you hear a strange noise in the background that is the garage door opening up right now underneath me it'll be done in a second all right so hair stylist all right so another video background this one this background seems to be pretty decent because it is darker and you can clearly see the elements on top of it um i still need something more to be desired in this area where it just says hair stylist and then the name of the hair stylist i might want to do something a little bit more unique or include these but have these be like sub elements or subtitles and then use something like this size for an actual headline that says something very interesting and pertinent or relevant about your business i'm coming down here this section right here seems like um it could definitely use improvement on the topography side of things so like this wow we're using font properties here font size 2m units margin bottom okay that's not working sometimes these aren't working well depending on which element i'm choosing who are using brs i wouldn't use the break elements as well but i would push this down as well and maybe even restructure this um what i would do this stuff right here i probably push i would take this whole car this whole section and put it down beneath the about me section or even down further and also a nice thing to do is i all this location information is to maybe embed like a google maps area maybe in the right column and then have this situated to the left column outside of that more white space above this section because these are two different sections you have about me and what i offer so i put more white space or margin top on this element to separate it out more um coming down all right so it's fine you use placeholders as long as you do have labels and this person does have labels so that's good um sometimes though i think you don't need to have the placeholder value if you're dealing with obvious form elements such as the email and the subject it just seems repetitive in my opinion and it does clutter it up unnecessarily send button i would probably get rid of the the white outline all right one being the worst 10 being the best what do you all believe this person should receive as a rating a abd you saw jean or whatever your name is please stop doing that don't spam i'm going to give this one here and this is hey this is a great job for your first commercially accepted you know live website so you're definitely on the right track i'm going to give this one a 6.5 or so all right next up we'll probably do one more or so depending on the time that we have left we have about six minutes all right i'm coming down this is a well i don't want to deal with figma links honestly just because we have so many that we can choose not a portfolio all right okay it is not a portfolio very good okay so speaking of trends um these trends i i forget what was it um i forget the website name where you can find many of these type of design illustrations which are fine to use but i think because so many people use them they're overused now and you can never go wrong uh trying to use something that's more unique um but still this works well for what it is looking at the rest of this i see a lot of blue and not much variation in the type um in terms of the color at least i think we could possibly improve that a little bit by changing this maybe possibly making this darker or making this text darker outside of that though the it is i like how it's set up this is set up pretty well um in terms of the size and the visual hierarchy um again like i said everything's just blue i think a little bit of variation would help in one way or the other now here's a good thing two different sections right here separated by this background a good amount of equal consistent white space between the top of this element in this section right here and the bottom of these elements and where this section ends right here so that's that's one of those small things that really helps out a design i like this nice blue a lot smaller sub labels or subtitle i should say versus the title and this right here is a little description all three of these elements are designed differently in terms of topography and that really helps it out a lot now this part seems kind of disconnected to me um i don't know why okay everything up to this point has been within this container with a column starting here and then a column ending here but then this is it breaks out of the columns structure and i don't like that so this shouldn't be based on fluid this should these should all be moved together uh inside of the same container you would still have white space between them but not as much buy now button should stick out more make that white not this background color that way it will really stick out as an option to click and then down here i would probably just make this bold maybe darker all right what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best quincy yes uh you're right i it's just i i've seen them these these images so much i but yeah on draw.ceo is exactly what i was thinking there are so many of those illustrations it's it's insane i'm not even sure if like are they perhaps using some sort of like ai generated or something because there's so many of them it's it's insane i i like them it's just one of those things that i see everybody using and you're right a victim of our own success for this one i'm going to go ahead and give i really like this section here this is like the best design section simple but it works well i'm going to go ahead and give this one a 7.1 yeah oh this time quincy gave a less a lesser rating all right we're gonna do one more and then we'll go ahead and wrap this up so i'm gonna come back up and refresh all right um who do i want to try now um a music website this this person said it's their first music website and so because i consider myself a hobby musician we're gonna check that out really sad news yesterday one of the greatest guitar players eddie van halen died unfortunately if you go to my twitter you can see me playing attempting to play the eruption solo from van halen so definitely check that out shameless plug all right um okay we so we have alignment issues here right away the logo which i like it's very simple starts here but then everything breaks out outside of it and we have another columns right here this right here should all start on this line this column this invisible column that's set the tone is set right there by this right here so move that into the left and then also take these headphones which i like this this background move that over to the right as well you'll have to because this will be over here naturally so music is life it's an important part of her life as it is a way of expressing her feelings as well as emotions and there's a link to happy music and i assume this takes us to a youtube link because there's a youtube icon in it so i'm not really sure though what i guess it's it's uh maybe a curated playlist of happy music so i'm still confused about what exactly is happening here or what the purpose of this site is so i think you need to elaborate on that a little bit more coming down we have a lot of white space down here from the bottom of this section which is defined by this higher contrast element you know the these beats headphones but then we have this tiny bit right here it'll look a lot better if you take this padding using absolute pixel elements here and we jumped this up to like 10 m units and this already looks a lot better same thing right here we have this tiny little bit of white space i would scale down the size of this photograph quite a bit but what refresh i'm going to refresh and you'll see the original and it's just it feels so clamped and cluttered when you don't have enough white space all right what does everybody think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best somebody said how to hack facebook with html if somebody could do that they uh they deserve to be like a billionaire or something hacking facebook with html all right get your answers in 1 being the worst 10 being the best i know what i'm going to rate for me i'm going to give this a rating of 6.3 and i think that's pretty pretty fair of course i do because i gave it right and that is it for the reviews once again check out designcourse.com enter your email to be notified when i release this it's going to be a really exhaustive just comprehensive way to learn all the stuff i'm talking about ui and ux design full courses are going to be worked in there teaching not just software like figma in adobe xd and all that but also the ui design fundamentals and a lot of projects will be worked in there we're going to have interactive ui design tests that will really help you develop the eye for all those ui design fundamentals live workshops challenges all of it so that's coming in several months time enter your email to be notified check out my youtube channel it's a design course youtube.com forward slash design course i do this live show several times per month um i'm going to be doing it in two days as well on friday on my own channel so definitely check that out and that is it all right so thanks for stopping by if i rated your design and you got mad because i rated it low don't worry about it it's just a rating i'm only one guy so again if you want to improve check out i google uh all the ui design fundamentals i actually have courses free courses on my channel i released one earlier about ui design earlier this year so take all these resources and use them to get better also check out sites like dribbble.com those are going to help you with inspiration and just looking at other designs can help you figure things out even on a subconscious level and then taking it a step further if you see a design you really like just as a matter of practice go into ui design software whether that's figma or adobe xd and recreate it you know don't don't claim it's your own just as a matter of practice recreate the design that's going to help build in muscle memory so it's really interesting i play guitar i'm trying to learn if i'm ever trying to learn a crazy solo that's really fast or difficult or whatever when i first try it it's it's hard right but when i go to sleep and then the next day i try it all of a sudden it's just right there it your these neurons that are they're creating connections while you're sleeping or even if you just take a break for an hour it still happens even then so the design is the same way so for those of you who are struggling you have to you have to put in the time uh and you actually have to to do not just watch me or follow tutorials or watch the tours you have to do and i will stop at this point rambling on all right thanks a lot everybody and i will
