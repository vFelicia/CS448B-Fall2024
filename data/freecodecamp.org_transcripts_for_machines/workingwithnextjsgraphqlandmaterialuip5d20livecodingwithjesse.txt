hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do all kind of stuff uh so i gave it a very title this video a very vague name because we got a lot of stuff to do i wasn't sure what we were going to get done we're going to have time to do so let's just start out i want to give you some updates we we now have a lot of issues open i set up a project like a kanban board uh within the github repo let me let me switch over and so i can show you what i'm talking about so i started a project here we have a bunch of cards now with issues i can make a card quickly convert it into an issue and then once that issue uh i'm not sure i think once the issue is opened or something it goes to in progress and then once it's completed it goes to done automatically which is kind of cool if you haven't used this yet just click on the projects tab on your github repo and if you select the automated uh kanban board it sets up a lot of it for you it gives you some some different steps to do um searching that issue to pr so we've done some of these but anyway i've used this on a previous project before i thought i'd set it up so we now have a lot of issues if you want to you know contribute these are broken down into most of them are very simple tasks very small things so uh have at it we may actually fix some of these uh today uh we'll see how it goes so i'm gonna move this back over we don't need it right now right hey everybody i see some some highs there in the live chat hopefully uh let me know if you all got the notification on youtube uh because yesterday i got my notification after i had already ended the stream so all right it looks like i did get a notification on my phone two minutes ago so i did i didn't get the earlier notification like usually happens so anyway sometimes i think it depends on how late in the day i schedule this all right so on the screen right now we can see you know this is basically where we left off at yesterday and i want to show you some of what i've been working on oh before i forget i have a new video up on my youtube channel so check i think i have a link in the description to my channel check it out it's my video review of the react nanodegree program so i know i said that that video was going to be coming months ago and i finally did it so it's there it's short video you know less than 10 minutes uh just some of my thoughts on the nanodegree program which i've already shared a lot of it with you all in the in the stream but now there's a short video uh where everything's kind of summed up so if you haven't done the program yet you're thinking about it you know maybe it'll help you make your decision so what i've been working on let's go to our microsoft there we go our sequel i always remember forget the name of this sql operations studio i think that's it we're going to go to sql operation studio here i'm going to show you what i've been looking at so i keep going through this is our database just for everybody that hasn't been following since the beginning of this project just to catch you all up we have a database right now for the current university website that's a sql server database and we're using a content management system called ektron which is pretty outdated the company doesn't even exist anymore so we want to move all the data out and we want to automate as much as possible we want to avoid having to copy and paste things so we're moving out we're not just dumping it all we're moving it out section by section we're using the wordpress api to put the data in to a my sql database and then users you know administrators will be able to edit things through a wordpress admin panel but we won't really mess that much with wordpress the site the public facing site but that users will see is going to be a react site and we're going to get the data from graphql so right now the step that i'm working on is checking out the data seeing what info we have and then i'm going to move it all over to wordpress it's going to be slightly different than the way we've done this with some other pieces of data so these are all news articles and they go back for for years i want to bring them all over so we have a nice archive but what i'd like to do is keep the publish date and make that the publish date for for in wordpress i think that'll be really useful in fact i mean that's necessary right there'll be no context at all for when these things were posted or how relevant they are anymore unless we bring the data over somehow so the last thing i was trying to do was figure out what format i need the date to be in in the wordpress api and i just had that info up here so let me move this over so we don't have to go through too many screens so we can add the date in here um let's see string daytime iso 8601 okay so what i was thinking might be the easiest way to figure out so like this iso 8601 that doesn't mean anything to me right now i need to see what the date actually looks like uh so i'm going to check out the api and see what the api gives us when we want to see a a publish date let me start my pomodoro timer and we're going to work on this for 25 minutes and i'm going to have minimal interaction with the live chat i'll glance at it occasionally then i'm going to take five minutes and it's i'm just going to go to live chat check out your comments answer any questions we'll go back and do some more work and we'll just kind of go back and forth and see how things go i want to get at least two 25minute sessions of work on the project at the end of that i'll answer any remaining questions i'll read out comments so you know whatever questions you might have for me go ahead and put them in the in the live chat and please be patient i will get to them all right so let's go with one exactly all right this works all right so our date is going to be in this format this is going to be tricky a little bit tricky all right so here's what we have in in terms of a date and i'm showing all the data here because i just wanted to see what was available normally we would want to instead of an asterisk here for the the query we would want to you know narrow it down so we didn't have all this stuff and when we import it we're not going to import everything we're just going to import a few things but we have a date created we have an edit date i don't think we have a publish date last quarter yeah we don't have a published date so i think we're gonna have to go with day created last edit 2014. this is kind of odd this was created in 2014 but it was edited in 2016. that's pretty wild all right i mean i i think still date created has got to be the the way to go so let's go with that we'll bring in date created and we'll set that as the date so let me see what format oh 620 i'm not sure about that format there is this what we want 1956 nah that that does not match up all right so we're gonna have to do some manipulating of this day created value the other thing that we're going to have to deal with is this title so we've been using the titles as the slugs for our our posts and we um let's see we were manipulating that a little bit so that it matched up with the current site i don't think we're going to be able to match things up with the current site for all of these news uh articles i've been looking at some of them and the the urls don't match with the titles and they're not here in the database so i'm not sure where they're stored or how to get those or match them up so i'm not going to try we're just going to have to live with that we're going to break some links i don't i don't really see any way around that other than having somebody go through all of these and and change things uh change the slug on wordpress manually i mean i if i find somebody that wants to do that then that's okay but i'm not gonna i'm not gonna try that's just not a good use of of our time you know we have other things to to work on for this site um i just glanced at the live chat uh david says remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer all right good advice good advice i'm not sure where that came from am i coming off as really confident today i don't know uh let's see all right let's go to where we have our is this it there we go okay so we're going to have to change our migrate.js and let's put this right beside our sql operations studio screen so here's where we've been importing things uh here's where we put our query all right so i do have date created and i'm also pulling in the content teaser and we're going to make this the excerpt for the post i think it'll be useful to bring in that same excerpt and then we can try to use that as well if we have you know like a small view maybe on the front page of the website before you can click to get the full content so this query should give us all the info we need now we need to change a bit here right so so right now we're saying name equals post content title that's because we originally made this when we were bringing over the data for faculty members probably be more straightforward just to keep this as title but for now i'm going to leave it but here's what we we do have that i think we ought to get rid of in here we are checking for uh titles in the in the slugs so like doctor you know things like that we didn't want them to keep the urls the same we had to get rid of them but we don't want to do that for here for one thing we're not worried about keeping the urls the same for you know for another thing we would actually want those words in these titles alright so we're gonna just comment this out for now and what we still want is to make everything lower case and to replace spaces with hyphens all right so uh that should make sense we'll bring everything over we will need to add let's add a excerpt you know let's check out the api documentation and make sure we can add in an excerpt there we go excerpt so we're going to bring in post dots we call that content teaser all right so the only thing we have left that we do want to bring in is that date so let's figure out how we can adjust this date properly let's look up our date format trying to find mdn all right so this is the format that we want i'm gonna sorry i i know this is boring on the stream but i'm gonna have to look at this just a bit um we need this date to work is all right let's do some testing all right so let me just grab a date in this format can i copy this copy and let's open up dev tools and let's do i don't know uh well let's let's make this bigger and go to console let's get rid of this stuff and let's say um let new let um test date equal new date and let's put that in test this okay all right so we can take this date in and this this date works for the javascript uh date but this is still not what we want so let's see about that iso format um let's see if we can parse string representation of date returns all right there we go uh let's go let's check this one out this looks like what we need new date right and events dot to iso string all right let's try it out um oh yeah oh no let's see if we can get that back there we go um and let's see let's iso date equal test date dots to iso string and then iso date is alright that looks like what we need let's just double check to verify yep that looks like what we need all right cool so um we can manipulate um manipulate the date to get what we want so let's take what we've done here and put it into our migrate dot js looks like there is there's some confusion in the live chat so let me just take a second to clarify what's going on all right so um peter welcome back i did switch to visual studio um everybody kept recommending it it was fast so i thought let's try it out uh stephenmigrate.js is um just a it's a little bit of node uh script so a little bit of javascript that's helping us take data out of one database kind of convert the data into a format that we we want and then sending that into a different database through wordpress so that's all we're doing here we can do we have this on github i'm not sure if i have this repository on github it was on github originally i haven't really been syncing things up because we frequently change this um so anyway that but that's all that we're doing here and claus says uh black screen so is anybody else having problems with the screen being black on my end let's see everything is saying it's good on my end so just uh let me know all right so let's let's do some some work on this date here so let's say um iso dates let's see how much we could put in line here whoops iso date equals post new date and this is going to be post dot date created and then we're going to go to iso string all right not sure if that'll all work in line like that but let's let's try it out and then let's um i guess let's just try it let's try it in the console first because i don't want to run this and have it transfer over bad data so let's just grab this and we can take this date this test date and put it in here and let's change this to iso date 2. okay so that does what we wanted to it should work awesome all right so just to um just kind of recap what we're doing we're taking the date in one format which is a different format that we need and we're making a variable here constant we're getting that date and we're making it into you know like a javascript date what do you call this a date object i don't know what the correct term would be for that but uh then we're taking that and we're converting that uh to iso string so it's iso i forget already what it was um iso 8601 format which is what we need and then we're going to take that and we're going to add that in as the date so the date will be iso dates and i'm going to verify that date is what we want here so let's check the docs and it is date we want a date and it is a string iso format great all right so everything should work um let me check my time all right six minutes cool uh claus in about six minutes i'm gonna take a break and i'm gonna go to live chat and explain things so if you can hold on for a few more minutes i'll explain um i'll explain everything uh just to give you something for now this is a project that i'm doing for my job as a frontend developer and we're just kind of working through it live together uh so that's the like big picture of of what uh what is going on here also uh welcome uh thanks for for watching all right so let me give it one look through just to make sure we're doing the right thing so we're getting content id title uh the actual content html date created content teaser good from folder id 89 and we want to this data length uh here we're saying we we don't want content that has no no data cost url directory oh i'm glad i checked this right we don't want this to be in directory we want it to be in news and i don't know if we've actually created that custom post type yet that that would have been a huge problem if i had just let that go through um there we go so who was that at the beginning to talk about overcon so david thank you for bringing up overconfidence because if i had been overconfident i would have just um hit enter on that thing and ran it and would have messed things up all right so it's so easy even when you're not live streaming it's so easy to make a little mistake like that and i've i've certainly made plenty of them on the live stream but you know also when i'm not streaming make little mistakes all right that looks good now what we need to do is make a post type that's news so let's go with whoops here's our post type so this is just a php file that is in the proper format to be a wordpress plugin so we're going to edit this a bit see what we have directory directory is factory all right so let's copy oh i want to make sure i only copy what i should be copying okay uh let's just copy this and paste it and then we'll change what we need to to make a new news custom post type so we don't normally use php on this stream but occasionally we we do need to use it mostly just when we're working with wordpress so first of all let's just change the word directory where we find it oops you know what i don't want to go down that far because i want to keep the uppercase stuff uppercase so directory let's say all right that's fine it's a little bit awkward to say add new news or something like that but i i'd rather keep it short than say something like news story or news item or something uh it's just easier to work with one word now we have i guess the singular and plural for news is the same right i mean it is right i'm not going crazy there is it's just news whether it's singular plural there's no we don't say news is right all right so let's just say news and then for directory news and then one more for directories we'll change it to news all right so just really quickly uh what's going on uh this part is uh basically saying how do we want this to appear in the wordpress admin panel so these are all the labels that a user would see if they were going in to edit the post through that admin panel down here is more of how is this going to appear and act you know kind of in the back end in the api with graphql you know things like that so that's why we're kind of saying like well what things does this support and thumbnail excerpt editor title yeah this looks good um we do want to exclude from search capability type post sluggish news we want to show this is going to show it in the rest api but then also it's going to show it in the graphql um that so we're using a graph wp graphql plugin that's good that basically lets us use graphql with wordpress that's how we're going to grab it from from this news here let's save that and let's copy it and my timer's up all right so my timer is up so we'll have some suspense now here when we come back from the five minute break then we will update our plugin and try to pull in all this data all right this is gonna be a lot of data we're pulling in at once so if we mess it up we have to go in and try to delete it all and redo it so i'm a little bit nervous about this one we've doubled and triple checked everything so i think it'll be okay but rather not mess up that much data so let me take a short break here and go to the live chat and answer some questions it looks like we've got a few more viewers here in the last few minutes so hey everyone thanks for watching feel free to ask any questions in the live chat all right so um claus had asked a few minutes ago um for an explanation of what's going on because it was the first time you know seeing it so um this is so to start from from the beginning this is a project that i am doing for work i'm a frontend developer and so this is a reallife project we're working on it's a react basically it's it's react combined with a wordpress backend so data is going to be put into wordpress you know from the admin panel at some point right now we're kind of doing a programmatic way uh but later on people will be able to edit this site then we'll pull that data with graphql into our react app and it will be displayed there so we're doing a little bit everything in this project some streams we do like user interface work um sometimes we're building react components uh we're working on pulling in data from our api uh other times like now we're working on you know wordpress plugins post type database things so there's a lot that's going into it later on we'll get into setting up our servers uh there's we're still considering the options in terms of how to set up the servers and what to use but we're going to have to do all that um so that's the project that's what we're doing so today specifically we're pretty much just working with data if we get all the data over and we have time maybe we'll we'll worry about like building out a new react component and um maybe like doing some really basic styling of that and as a followup clause says so wordpress site build with react yeah so kind of so i would say um it's a react site but we're pulling in data from uh wordpress right so that's going to be one of the places we pull in data we may end up pulling in data from multiple sources for now most of the data is going into wordpress and that's basically it's just wordpress is reliable there's a big community and a lot of people know how to work with it it's going to be user friendly for the people that need to edit the data that don't necessarily know anything about coding all right so hopefully that was a decent explanation you can always go back and check some of the previous streams if you want to know more i think the first stream i i went in more depth into explaining everything uh let's see ghost sniper says i hate coding and it'll never help me in life and my school makes me do it i don't know i guess it depends right if if you if you never use a computer again i don't know maybe it won't help that much uh but you know it does teach some concepts that could be helpful uh so school makes you learn a lot of stuff you probably don't want to do i know it did for me and uh there is honestly a lot of stuff that i learned in school that i haven't ever used and i probably won't ever use right i learned how to square dance in school i've never square danced before i've never square danced after that ever so totally totally not needed i took acting classes in school for a couple years and i'm not an actor right so i don't know it is what it is but um i guess all you can do is control how you react to being able to having to learn how to code you can control your attitude and how you feel about it uh so try to make the best of it and to be honest you can make a ton of money coding at some point so it's it's not so bad that you're learning it um let's see including one more question john hanson says anyone having a hard time understanding event dot stop propagation uh in create react app i am is it a best practice to use it to stop a parent event listener to add this onto all children objects with events i'm i'm a little bit interested i'd be interested to let me see some of the code so i'm i'm just wondering about using like event stop propagation is that the best way to do it in react i'm i'm not sure um i personally haven't used it in anything with react so i don't know that i could give a good answer for that but i would be interested to see if there is maybe a unique react type of way to handle that and do something like that that would make things easier uh but sorry john i just can't i don't have experience with it uh so hope maybe somebody else knows uh if anybody that's uh listening right now or watching uh knows about um stopping event propagation with react uh please um share your knowledge uh in the live chat all right so i didn't get through all the questions on live chat but i will come back to the live chat after we uh do a bit more with our data all right i had to write down what question i left off with so i remember later on all right let's restart our timer and now all that's left to do is move this into our wordpress installation our plugin right let's update our plugin and we'll move that data over we'll run our our node program here our uh migrate.js and see if it works so where's i thought i was logged in i am i'm logged in here all right so we go to our plugins to our editor and we can select our our custom types plugin that we've created and now we'll paste it and update the file cool all right no weird errors when we did that and let's you know what let's double check there we are okay just wanted to make sure we did in fact have news let's make sure that we have a title excerpt featured image wonderful all right so don't really want to add a new one so once we transfer this data we should be able to see a ton of news items here news posts so let's do that now let me make sure i'm on the right network okay i'm on the right network i can only access the database from one uh network and write ip address and everything so i know i talked about making copy of the database to get around that i just i never did it so still probably a good idea to do all right so let's see uh it's not i was hoping it would save it um let's go let's see what did we get a range error hmm all right let's see what happened check this out first verify that nothing came through right nothing came through we have some sort of error here so let's check it out oh no promise rejection warning objection 21 ranger invalid time value hmm let's see all right uh the iso date your data is a string literal not the date string all right so my data coming through is not what we want to put in there is that correct let me see oh i see now rook thank you thank you i can't believe i did that all right thanks for catching that um we even checked how many times did we check and i still missed it all right yeah so i was trying to pass in a string that said post dot date underscore created instead of actually the the variable the value thankfully it didn't actually go through and it was rejected by wordpress or that that could have been a mess all right so rook is the hero of the day thank you again let's stop this program now and rerun it whoa there we go it's inserting a lot of posts i've always been interested in like how many posts i could insert at once i'm gonna find out now because i think this is the largest uh block the largest content type that we will have to bring over so if this works i don't have any worries about anything else all right slowing down a little bit whoa did y'all see that jump it was frozen for a second and then all of a sudden it just jumped from 400 to 500. all right we'll let it let it do its thing and if i at one time at one point i had thought about putting a delay and i don't know if we ever did that um like a delay between attempts to add things maybe it finished it's possible that it finished uh 546 rows 546 it did all right cool we finished i'm here i am waiting and nothing because it finished all right cool let's check it out so here's the the big test let's see if it works oh there we are awesome very awesome so we have an excerpt weird format but still excerpts we have the html came through the title let's see the slug i'm really interested to see how the slug came through all right awesome that looks nice can't see scientists gather for the jubilee awesome oh whoa all right we have a little bit of a problem here uh all right i don't know if you'll see this uh it's really small let me zoom in a bit why is the slug field in wordpress this short anyway let's go over everything looks good until we get here and there are spaces in the middle of a word and a hyphen why why would we have that um let's see if this is stay created i mean what's up what do our titles look like all right let's see what we were doing here so all we're doing content title moving everything to lowercase and we're replacing spaces that's really odd i'm going to check just a few other posts just to see if i can find some similarity uh as to how this happened because i mean obviously we can see the title here oops you know it doesn't look like anything's wrong here with the title uh so let's just check a few more items and let's check insulation all right i'm just going through really quickly i might write a plugin that makes this slug field larger that's just insane it really bugs me you all know i'm pretty easy going most of the time but that's like that's terrible like that's just a terrible ui anyway all right i didn't check to i didn't think to check the permalink to see if the same problem in the permalink which i think we would so let me go back to this one and see look at that so the with the permalink it doesn't have that problem that's really odd um let's see summer conference sessions so and these even have the same word in it so it's we still have the same word conference none of them have that problem all right i'm not going to worry about it right now um but what we're going to what i do want to double check is these publish dates to make sure six seventh ninth all right so we do have different dates wow 28 pages uh i want to go to the last page right awesome 2014 your details image news one all right so it did bring in just some some kind of nonsense uh posts we can clean that up later i'm not worried about it but this is really cool that's really cool we have all the stuff in all right so now we need to display it let me check my time all right 11 minutes let's go over to the react side of things and see if we can pull this data in so we'll need we need to make it a graphql query we'll have to do another one i know we did one yesterday we'll do one today it shouldn't be too hard we can probably copy and paste most of what we did yesterday if not everything uh and then we'll um we could probably reuse a lot of the same react component uh that we used yesterday as well and just change some of the names so we we may be able to do this in in 11 minutes and i see there's some some comments in the live chat actually there's there's some pertinent comments here let me get to these um ed edward says it's not supposed to be like this did you delete the slug to create it it's gonna populate the field automatically um we let's see let me show you we're adding the slug in so i'm i'm adding the slug manually when we update these uh so the reason we were doing this you're actually right it would have made the slug automatically from the title that might have been a better way to go oh i'm not going to try to redo all that now but that probably would have been a better way to go the reason we were adding the slug before is because we we did want to manipulate the slug previously to try to make the urls match up between what we currently have and what we are going to have later in this case we didn't need to do that so i just didn't even think about it we had it had just been left in previously so that's a really good point though thanks for bringing that up i'll keep that in mind when we pull over more data that this is not necessary unless we we really need to change what the slug will be maybe we could avoid some errors you know potentially we have an error already in there um i won't once we get everything worked out i want to try to type in this in a url and see what data we can get i'm interested to see what what happens with that all right so let's go to our oh yeah server apollo is this it yeah this is it all right cool so we need to go to let's take this and oops can we just duplicate no all right let's grab this and make a new query new file we'll call it we're going to call this news dot js i'm going to paste in this we're going to change it to news news query we're going to change this to news all right so this should grab our id our title the slug the content and do we want let's grab the excerpt as well and the date all right yeah we're gonna we're gonna grab this we may not actually need the date uh it might already be with within the html but just to be safe we'll grab it it'll actually be good to have it because if we want to make a news page and order things chronologically then it would be we we definitely need a date uh to make that work and all right cool so we have this let's save it uh let's go into our pages and we're gonna take let's take our directory and just copy it and let's make another page another these are really react components but in terms of next js which we are also using uh the there there are pages in this case this acts more like a template for a page but you you'll see you'll see how it's how it's all gonna work and we'll also name this news.js here we are and let's change this change the word directory everywhere remember this one if you remember yesterday i forgot this part we had an error all right to news this is fine for now this will prove that we're actually getting the data and then we can see if we want to you know display anything else like the date or something like that all right let's save that now we need to go into our server as well let's go into server.js and let me let me give you the link to our ngrok server so you all can see it as we're working on it and and you can um see the data coming in as well so if you check that link sometimes there's weird problems with links so you might have to copy and paste the link to get it to work but hopefully you don't it looks like it's working so all right awesome sorry i didn't give you that link earlier we didn't really need it until now because we weren't doing anything directly with with the ui for the the react site but uh in any case now you'll have it uh we're gonna take this little block here and we're just gonna copy and paste that and instead of contact we're gonna say news and we're going to say news here let me explain what's going on here let's make this a bit bigger alright so here's what's happening we're saying that when a user types in url that has slash news slash whatever at the end so you know any value what we're going to do is we're going to pass that value at the end we're going to pass that into the component and the component that we're going to pass it to is going to be the news component right so that's what we want to do let's save that and then in our news component we're grabbing that so we get this query id we're grabbing that here in this get initial props function this is going to be able to run server side and client side this is a special function that next js has so that's why we're grabbing things here grabbing the proper data so we can get that nice serverside rendering we don't really need the console log here i just had that there for testing probably ought to take this out and let's see all right looks like oh okay so once we grab that id what we're trying to get from graphql is we're going to use that news query and we're going to pass it that id all right which is basically the slug from our our wordpress post then since we're calling on that news query let's go up here and check it out so the news query comes in and what are we passing in this name all right which is the id that's our slug so it's going to look for a news item where the name is equal to that slug so that's what it's going and it's going to return all of this data id title slug content excerpt and date it's going to return all of that um into um into this component right so it'll go back to the component of news.js and then it's going to put that data um in in here and rook you are on top of things because rook noticed that i forgot to change directories here thank you again so you see we're we're getting that object so we're there's now an object available to us we go data news edges where zero right so the edges is an array we want the first value node content and that matches up with our news here right edges node content right all right so now we have that here let me see i'm not sure if i need to restart the server or not let's do it just to be safe or actually no entry page news stop news whatever looks like uh some of you are trying to look up the news page right now um all right so that should restart and i need to find this a slug to try so let's try one that'll probably work because it's normal and then we'll try one that that first one that has some weird stuff going on all right so let's go back here and say news slash what the heck it just happened did that server come back up all right slash news slash all right passport server is not a valid graphql document node you may use graphql to learn another method into a document all right let's see what's happened all right let's go back to our code what did it say is pages all right um so unfortunately we don't have the correct line because it's using the um i guess a different version of this um let's see my timer just went off i kind of want to i wanted to see if this would work first all right let me go back and answer some questions and i will take five minutes and then um we'll go back to it and try to troubleshoot see what's going on probably it just messed something up when i was changing things over from news to um from directory to news but we'll see there might be something wrong with with our data we'll figure that out for now uh let me chat a bit with you all i'm gonna chat for five minutes with you then i'm gonna check and make sure nothing has come through on slack or my email that i need to handle for work if everything's good then we're gonna figure this out let's see all right so john hanson says with next.js is it then not necessary to install or use react router yeah you don't need to install or use react router with next so we're basically doing our own custom routing in here right so this is some some custom routes so we're just kind of doing our own thing i did see a tweet from can't remember his name guillermo i think his name is um uh anyway i tweet from he's like the the head of zeit which makes next i saw a tweet about the next version of next is going to actually incorporate react router into it so i'm not sure how that's going to work i didn't look into it but i figure at some point we'll probably be using the newer version so i have we'll have to learn it that would that would be kind of cool i think it would be nice to have the same type of routing across everything we're building since we're using react router for you know our our other stuff that we've made with create react app uh let's see uh dipak says hey jesse this is my first free code camp live stream what app are you using for your databases is it free you're doing great thanks for doing this most appreciated you're welcome i i appreciate the comment uh yeah let me show you what we're using for the database so this is um sql operations studio let's see if i can get yeah sql operation studio from microsoft it is entirely free it's free to download and it's it's an electron app it's built with javascript html so it's very similar in the way it's built and even in the ui to visual studio code you know you can see a lot of the you know kind of the similarities here same icon same layout things like that so that's what we're using i really like it i'm not a database person so i don't have much to compare it to other than like i don't like php admin or whatever it's called um or my php admin i don't remember what that is but i like it a lot better than that and also thanks for watching uh and welcome to the stream all right it says suraj says what do you do to select multiple words and update at once visual studio code oh cool the multiple cursor thing i love this it's so cool so let's just let's go to queer params here and i highlight what i want to select and if there's anything else below it that is the same i just hit command i'm on a mac so i hit command d i assume it would be control d on windows but i'm not sure and then i just every time i hit d it selects something new and then i can go in here and i can add whatever i want backspace and i can even move the cursor around with the left and right arrow keys even i can go down with the down arrow key or up so really cool and useful when you don't need the power of a find and replace and there's just a few things that you need to change it's faster than find and replace at least it is for me so i really like it i will say though that i'm using the key bindings for the atom editor because i switched from atom to here so i don't know what the default is for visual studio code it might be different so i would check check that out you know just check the documentation it might might be different coding and caffeine says hello it's me i was wondering if some of you wanted a cup of coffee i actually do want a cup of coffee um so i have i've had a lot of caffeine already today i guess i had a double espresso this morning i had some g fuel um and remember gfuel you can sponsor me but had some gfuel before the stream to help me get kind of pumped up otherwise i seem depressed on the stream so but i'd still like more coffee i'm pretty much always going to say yes to coffee if somebody offers let's see i'm just the my timer went up i'm just checking because i'm almost at the end of the live chat uh john said can the slug be generated from another better source uh like append a number um i don't i don't know i i tried to look for something better but i think the title was uh the title makes sense to use i'm just i'm gonna go with that um michael asks what is the visual studio code plugin that adds the file size on the import statements let me share a link with you all so hopefully this works you may have to copy and paste it because links are weird sometimes in the youtube live chat but there's a plugin called the react food truck and it actually just pulls in a lot of other plugins that have to do with react so that's how i got it initially if you just want the one plugin um let me look up the name for you it is import cost so the plugin is called import cost and i can send i can give you the direct link to that as well so here's the link to that plugin but uh really cool though isn't it uh so you automatically know you know what with the plugin and even is different like um this is 1.1 megabytes and it's in red so i assume the red means hey this is a big this is a big plugin this is a big package that you're bringing in so it's kind of cool i haven't really acted on any of that yet but i imagine if i was really trying to improve things and go in that would be so helpful to just be able to see right away like oh maybe i don't need to import all of this all right let me let me know if the stream status is okay i'm it's telling me that it's bad right now i'm not sure why but if the stream starts getting weird just just let me know i don't really know if i can do anything about it but i still like to know let's see uh osuna asked did you make this website mobile responsive um it's kind of responsive right now i haven't really checked everything out but it should be because we're using material ui uh to handle like our layout and everything so that's like by default responsive but like i said i haven't actually checked it on a phone yet so i don't know for sure but we'll do all that as as it gets you know we get more things built out all right let's let's figure out what the problem is here so all right let's first let's look at server let's make sure news id we're sending it to news all right that looks that's good that's as it should be let's just start at the top and make sure oops there we are there's the problem um we want to take it from the news directory i can't believe i remembered this part and forget this part again did the same thing yesterday all right let's save that now and try again let's refresh a there we go oh let's see this is a bit of a mess wow wow wow wow that looks pretty bad um don xavier says the links aren't working that i posted you may have to just copy and paste the links uh because when when you when you put a link in the youtube live chat youtube actually is like redirects you to it and so it doesn't always work so i would um try try that try to copy and paste or something it the links work i just went to them but just not if you click it inside the live chat all right all right let me ask you all uh do you want me to start styling this right now or do you think we've had a long enough stream we should save it till tomorrow or some other time i'll give everybody just i'll give everybody a minute to respond while i check my work slack and email since i forgot to do that all right nothing on slack that i need to worry about let's see nothing in my email all right looks good looks like we're good to go so if you all want me to keep going i i can i might keep going regardless because i'm still at work and have to work on it it's just a matter of um uh whether or not i stream what the work that i'm about to do see all right so i haven't gotten a response at all one way or another about whether i should stream the rest of this let's see we still have over 30 viewers so looks like there's still some interest all right i'm just gonna keep going and do some basic styling then all right i had to change my song really quick and i didn't like the song that was on can't possibly do do coding without the right music right all right so let's inspect what we have see what we can do about it all right so it looks like we have some images oh you know what i did want to test out that other one first let me do it before i forget so we had that weird slug with which one this one let's test it out um that's not it there's some news wait a second that was the slug that had the problem right maybe it's a different one no that was it that was one of the problem maybe this one no all right i don't know what happened but the problem's not there anymore so that's good news i'm gonna leave it alone all right so let's check out this image let's try https slash that should work i'm going to put this in a browser on my other screen see if anything comes up uh it's not there anymore all right oh well so i'm not sure if we'll be able to get the um the images so for now i need to hide the image i'll i'm not going to worry about the images now i'll need to find these at some point and and figure out what to do with him but let's see we should add the title in here we already have the date what is all this stuff why do we have the same thing repeated news summary and related news summary all right we need to get rid of these all right so let's do some work on getting rid of let's get rid of everything we don't want first before we try to style or add anything uh it'll probably look a little easier if we uh bring it bring the content down first the amount of content so let's check this out let me look back as well at what we did with this faculty because we did do a lot of this type of work with the faculty we did some manipulation here of of the markup which we may want to do that as well let's see hmm i mean the easiest thing would be probably just to do some css and hide it with css right now um so let's grab let's actually get this css page and i i'm probably will come up with a better way to do css but at this point you know this is how i'm going to do it styles where am i putting my styles oh okay i'm bringing it in with this static styles factory all right all right oops and i forgot to set my timer again let me do that all right so i'm going to copy what i have here and paste it as a start i realize that this is not the way we want to do it um completely so maybe i'll make an issue about figuring out what we're going to do with css and then stick with it i didn't really want to decide until we started importing more things and seeing like what we were working with how much css would we want to reuse how much would be unique so we'll get a better idea now that we have you know several different content types imported now all right so i'm going to copy that and i'm going to make another css file and a new file we're going to call it news dot css and then obviously too i'd much rather be doing sas than css this we have for now and then let's go back to that faculty page and let's copy this portion here and use it in our news page do we have it in layout let's see we did and we also need to bring this in and we had brought in grid as well i'm not going to bring that in yet though because i'm not even sure if that worked for us before and where are we at so much stuff going on let's get rid of some of this oh don't want to save let's all right let's wait let's hold off on that solutions queries directories post tests there we are news we don't need that or that that or that or that all right that's a lot more simple there we are and we want to change this to be news all right great so let's let's see what we have now just by bringing that css in i imagine we'll have you know some some impact on how this looks all right it's not bad already it's better not 100 percent uh but better for sure nice nice i i like that sweet hey wait a second hey this actually this article links to the website that we built together the catechetics.com site so uh that's pretty fun all right uh let's add some things in here to get rid of a lot of this stuff at the top that we don't really need and then we'll probably add in a title after that oops moved it over here all right so let's check our css page and we need to check the names again let's check the names news summary i wonder if we can just get rid of this whole thing this whole first part why is the title not showing up at all that's weird but it's okay roots yeah let's just get rid of root that'll solve all our problems awesome we'll get rid of root uh at some point we'll have to figure out what to do about the image uh yeah i'm not sure but for now we'll get rid of root that'll save us a lot of time of trying to pick through what we want and don't want and then we'll add in a title on our own instead of getting that title to show up that that we saw in the markup so let's go computer content there we are let's go roots we're going to do a display none on that that component that was called root we're also going to get rid of some of these that i know we don't need so we don't need a name or phone uh columns that's fine i don't know if we have a right column or center column we'll have to double check that heading h6 let's use your detail side um most of these we probably don't have i wonder though if any of these would end up having a video embed so i'm going to leave that in for now all right so most of it we're going to keep and all right so let's let's see make verify that this actually is going to remove what we want great it removed it now let's add in a title so we're going to go with and let's see typography and then are we bringing typography in no we're not we need to bring in typography what are we bringing in we're not bringing in anything from material ui wow did we bring it in here no wow uh we definitely brought it in for our index so let's check that typography so always better to try to copy and paste from somewhere that we know it works right and so we're bringing that in and i also want to check what the name of all right display 2 subheading display 2 what did we use headline component h2 so we used did that work yeah let's try it out typography type headline component h2 we'll try it we have an h2 really it probably should be in h3 um but we'll we'll see um actually let's let's do it like this let's go dangerously said enter html html i'll explain in a second why i want to do it this way edges zero node title is it title or is it name let's check this title and why we have a problem here all right what am i missing so hmm oh something i guess there's something wrong with the video let's see what's going on all right this is weird so obs says that everything's fine but youtube's admin panel says the stream status is bad for resolution all right i'm not sure what's happening um everybody let me know everybody who can in live chat let me know if the stream is okay or if it's bad if the quality is going bad i might just end the stream because i don't want there to be a bunch of you know bad quality at the end of the video all right so that's that's really weird so this shows up it's fine but i'm getting a weird error here uh that's that's pretty weird all right let's copy and paste this i'm still getting something so that's weird all right well it looks like the video then is is no good so actually i think i'm gonna stop here i mean if you look at it this doesn't look bad right the only so you all can't see but basically if you can't see what's going on let me explain everything looks fine we've removed a lot of what we wanted to remove we now have a proper title it needs aligned better with the rest of the content the only thing that i would add at this point is a date so i would add the date somewhere in here probably at the top and that's really about it uh maybe i would change the link color possibly make the uh font size a bit bigger but that's it so all right so let me uh let me wrap things up then uh i'm gonna check the live chat quickly to see if there are any comments that i should respond to since it doesn't really matter for if i have video for that let's see all right let's see uh john hanson says my son challenged me to build a react component uh ever play with a toy called light bright it uses touch and mouse events give it a try ah no way john did you build light bright in react i've gotta check this out i wish my video wasn't first and i would show everybody uh what you made well i'll try to show everybody anyway if the video comes back in i guess they can see it hopefully this url works you know how it is sometimes with the the youtube stuff even if you put it in like this sometimes it still doesn't work yes oh wow john this is amazing all right you all probably can't see this light right thing but you you have to check it out uh i'm gonna paste the the url in the chat as well wow wow this is so cool i'm showing my kids when i get home uh i want to bring this up on my uh my chromebook is touchscreen this would be so cool with just to be able to touch it wow john amazing amazing work that's the that's the coolest thing i've seen in a while wow that's awesome i love it when stuff like this happens on the stream you are like so creative and i love it when you share stuff like that uh rick adams has just read a uh linkedin pm for a frontend function for monday given my focus is more on back end which qualitative suggests and frontend design video tours are recommended um for frontend stuff i mean you could check out check check out some of the videos here on the free code cam channel uh it's on a lot of different topics so um just kind of sift through some of them there's a youtube channel called dev tips devtip and um the videos are kind of older but a lot of really good stuff about you know frontend work uh so check that out trying to think what else i would go with uh udacity has some frontend courses that are free and there's a lot of video content in those courses so you can check that out as well let's see all right world says does graphql let you query any random website or does that website need that graphql already configured uh that website needs to have graphql already configured think of it like a rest api right you you'd have to someone would have to build the rest api for you to be able to use it it's the same thing with graphql they would have to build the graphql api is that safe to call a graphql api it functions like that right um i mean i know it's it's graph query language um anyway uh someone would have to build that out just like they would a rest api that's a good question though the video came back oh cool john said to drag my mouse on the board that's so cool oh man john is it cool if i share this with a bunch of people because this is really i mean i would definitely give you all the credit but this is awesome i used to love lightbrite when i was a kid this is really cool all right mandela um says you need to restart the stream if it happens next time youtube can give me a thousand for console fee yeah i'll um maybe i should have just restarted um right away i will remember that for next time all right um let me now that the video is back let me switch back quickly to here this is what i was talking about right we have all our paragraphs here uh it's the right font i think it needs to be a bit bigger like font size um but same way with the title title needs to be a bit bigger and it needs to be aligned properly but like i said it's not bad uh looks good just needs the only thing i would add would be the date um but not bad at all at some point it might be cool to include categories and people could click and sort by categories but i'm not worried about that right now that would be additional functionality that we could add in once that data did get entered all right cool this will be fun i think i might share this my boss has been really busy with some other stuff so he still hasn't had a chance to review any of the work we've done so far um so i'm gonna let him handle his stuff and whenever things calm down a bit then maybe i'll i'll show this to him but maybe i'll share it with some other coworkers so i can get some early feedback um and you know see if everyone thinks we're going in the right direction all right awesome so i'm gonna wrap things up now it's been a longer than normal stream but really fun we've gotten a lot done we didn't mess things up i messed them up a little bit but they were really easy errors to um to overcome and we got a ton of data imported into wordpress like over 500 uh what do you call them records right so we have over 500 posts under the news post type and when we started that post type didn't even exist in our wordpress install so not only did we get a new post type and all the data in but now we're actually displaying it properly with the proper parameterized routing but all the infos there needs a bit of work work on the styling but overall i'm really happy with today's stream um cool uh good work everyone and thank you so much everybody for your help especially rook for catching two of my mistakes and saving saving me a lot of time and thanks john for sharing your library app that's amazing i'm gonna be sharing it with other people as well and uh thanks everyone else uh too that was in a live chat and if you're watching later on you can participate in the live chat but you have questions yeah please put them in the comments for the video or you can you know message me on twitter my dms are open you could message me there or any other social media that that you like to use i'm on pretty much everything um let's see oh and don't forget to check out my new video on my channel about my udacity react nanodegree experience so i'll be back tomorrow until then have a great day
