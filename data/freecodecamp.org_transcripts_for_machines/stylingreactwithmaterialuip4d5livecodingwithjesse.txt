hey everybody and welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're going to do some styling of our our new react project we're using a graph QL to get data from WordPress and we just had a massive pool request that I merged in a few hours ago so let's briefly go through what's changed from that pool request you can check it out at the repo there's a link in the description it'll be pool request number two okay it's already closed cuz it's been merged but you can check that out if you want to look through the files on your own I'm just gonna kind of try to summarize it because it's it's quite large so definitely it would take a long time to go through all the lines that have changed so so Harshit submitted this request basically it merged what he had done in pool request one which we did go over last week so he just closed pool request one and then added all the changes into two so in addition to the things that were added before now material UI the beta version of material you are the newer version that we were trying to get working on friday is now working it's all set up there's a layout component let me show you what it looks like as I'm describing it so here we go so he he actually set up a temporary WordPress installation to grab data from so now actually I am I pulled I had an old test install of WordPress that I hadn't really been using for anything so I just pulled it in it just has some well it has bacon ipsum so instead of lorem ipsum it has the names of different cuts of meat and i grabbed some of these images from so that's like the big picture what's changed there's so much more so I definitely recommend if you really want to understand what changed go through some of the at least some of the pool requests to see and you know line by line what did change I've made some changes in addition to that so harsh its API had for every post there was an image but mine didn't so initially when I tried to pull things in it didn't work I was getting an error so I just simply added in a check to see if there was an image and if there was then we try to render the image if not we don't try to render the image at all so in this case we actually don't even we don't even render this whole section of the card so you'll see in a second if you're not familiar with with this particular component and material UI it would try to render it basically be a big blank area so we just completely pulled that out so I'll show you that now I think it's in the post detail is it no post preview that's what it is because you can see there's there's a lot more components in here than there were last week let's see oh here it is okay so we just did this basically we're just checking to see if an image URL has been passed in from the parent component and then if not we don't do anything if there is one then we we render it and I believe the parent component would be here yeah so in the parent component we do a check to see if there was an image see so we're either passing in or not passing in the the image URL all right so that's I mean that's basically it I other than setting up the graph QL plugin on the old WordPress installation and updating some other plugins that's that's pretty much all that was done so let's see let's go to say that's all that was done by me I should clarify let's I do want to start it's not not CSS let's start with our app is and no it's not there oh sorry layout I wanted to start from what we're first bringing in material material UI so you can see we have a layout component now and that's what we're importing a bunch of stuff from material UI and then we have some some styles in line here I shouldn't say in line but in in component Styles all right and then here's where we have like our app bar and ice were and our title right so this is these are things that every page needs here we go here's our drawer so that side that side navigation drawer here that's also in the layout and control here so what wind up doing is will list out the categories here as well see and then this is where we pull in the content from the views so let's check out well let's check out our home view now what this looks like let's see so we're pulling in layout everything is wrapped in layout now so everything that was in layout is going to get applied we also have helmet so react helmet and this allows us to change the title rank is normally within a component we don't have access to the stuff that's in the you know in the top of the HTML document but with helmet we do have access to it and we actually can do at some point up we could probably even move this to the layout component and pass in a prop for the title if we wanted to clean it up even more it's not really a big thing but it might save us a few lines so we'd save a line of code up here and a few down here so we may end up doing that all right so maybe that's that's basically it you know we see the post detail page is the same thing laid out the same way category page right now lists it out posts like those for category one but wind up having when we actually hook up the real data for this we're gonna have so many posts that it'll be way too many to put on the page like this so I mean this works it works for now but we have I think we definitely have hundreds of posts already so we'll have the categories listed on the side and then when you click a category it'll have each page will be like a single category page but this looks I mean this is pretty amazing how much Harshit got done and just a day or two so thank you so much for that this gives us like a huge jump start so yeah and I did I just checked a lot chat now I see harsh it mentioned downgrading WP graphic you also in fact I did we had a little bit of discussion on Friday about it hard recommended downgrading I really kind of wanted to see like what could I make the latest version work and right after the stream I I spent a little bit of time checking it out and I just I decided to go with harsha's advice and just downgrade and that it worked so for now we're gonna do it like that later on I don't know we'll see I actually may want to have the authentication but right now since we're just testing I really don't want to add in that whole extra element of complexity and having to use like JSON web tokens or something that's just gonna it I feel like at this point I want to get it developed out more you know kind of tangibly what we can see and then we can tackle the authentication I'm still I still need to get in contact with someone about the single signon and see you know what what that's gonna involve and integrating that with our project so there's just too many things I don't know yet about how that's gonna work so we're just gonna put that off until later on okay I'm just checking the live chat briefly see if there's anything I should respond to right now okay all right also harsh it reminded me to start the end Rock server so I'm starting that right now and I will copy the link in so if you're not familiar with the end rock server this basically lets you all test out what I have here that I'm running on localhost so if you click the link that I just pasted it in the live chat you can see this you can inspect it you can use your dev tools so if you have react installed with your chrome dev tools you'll be able to see that if you have the dev tools that you use with graph QL you can see that it even responds to the Redux dev tools as well because Redux is going you know doing its thing behind the scenes of Apollo so I mean not it's a little bit different than you'd normally see in react state right because there's I mean Apollo understands what's going on but it's not really like friendly for people to read quite as much as if you'd make your own store but you can go in here to apollo stuff and check all this stuff out check out your queries so it's kind of nice because then it could be more interactive you could actually you know check out what's going on in real time okay so here's what we're gonna do today I know that was kind of a long intro uhhuh it's like um like a 15minute intro but we had a significant pool request so I definitely needed needed to go over that some of those changes so here's what we want to do we definitely need to change the color scheme to match the university color scheme we'll probably add the University logo in here somewhere maybe up here we'll see we'll see it makes the most sense and we're gonna change up the other the homepage here so let's try to get the categories listed down the side and this you this is actually perfect the size and everything but we I also want some other view options available so we can simply get some icons over here so the users can select some of the other options would you see how it's going I'd like to get to Pomodoro sessions in if I can but since I'm starting my first session so far into the stream we'll just have to see how it goes I have a meeting coming up in about an hour so I don't want to be late for that when the the head of my department will be in the meeting so definitely don't want to mess around and I I need to get a little bit of data to present at that meeting so it will be a shorter stream than normal but hopefully we can get something useful in so I'm gonna stop talking about about this and I get to the stream let's see all right so we should probably check the documentation for material UI first and I guess the first thing we could do that will hopefully be pretty easy is just change some of the colors so actually not now that I think about it I don't think we need to check the documentation since we have in the layout page we have a lot of styles here it's probably here somewhere so let's just check it out there'd be color here the only color thing I see here is this background color but looks like that's for the content so let's make sure all right so we will check out the documentation so probably probably themed you see how we're bringing this in I just list the live chat and Brett said this demo is making me hungry yeah I actually just got off the phone with tech support for Google Phi and the woman on tech support was super nice and she was telling me about what she had for lunch and she made this pasta with alfredo sauce from scratch she's telling me how she made it with heavy cream and stuff I'm like I have anybody who's vegetarian or vegan I'm not trying to upset you if it is really offensive to somebody let me know I can change it up but this was just what I already had in here from a while ago so I know my brother's a vegan so I guess I'm I have to think about that all the time now in case if he's going to be over I can't put meat in anything all right okay so what Dorothy wants I don't think we're set up right now with a theme right we're not pulling that in that would probably be the way we want to go Oh actually no we are pulling maybe I'm just missing it let's see haha Bret says there's not a vegan ipsum yet alright okay so in case in case you're not following what's what I'm trying to do here I was basically looking for if we had pulled in something like this from materialized styles but it looks like we're pulling in with styles from material us styles so I'm not sure I'm not sure if we could change these I guess we could try hmmm alright so I was looking for something that was matching up with what we were already changing it here all right so let's let's keep looking a little bit yes we could try to override I'd rather not override for the for the colors because you know we're gonna have a certain color palette that we want to be applied throughout mmm you know see if it says something no bus not only I thought we were gonna start out with something easy and it turns out it's not so easy okay well then let's let's just start here with this theme then and maybe we'll implement this okay all right so actually so hard should is saying theme is the right way to do it so just just for me so I'm clear Harshit so do you mean should we go with adding this in and wrapping everything in this Mui theme provider or are you saying that basically what we have going on here is sufficient and I can just add into this and it would it would work okay so 1010 damer says you should wrap your app in the Mui theme provider Harshit says theme okay so this will apply throughout okay I'm getting I'm getting it seems like conflicting advice here I guess that for now let's just try to put in something into the the current theme object and see if it'll change some stuff so let's just copy I want to find somewhere there we go primary so I'd like to take all right this is nested and so I'm gonna take this palette which trying to find where it ends but it just is not ending all right let me let me just move this to the other screen and I'll just type it out of it all right so let's see instead of steam Opa le TT and primary the primary and goodness I really would rather not have to manually put all these in for now let's see she said it people that I can't remember with that hex color is nolimit execution forget the comma straighten up all right nothing changed a big change from that I mean you think that'd be the primary color right okay all right so now ours just saying we could import so let's import this now should I also import with styles or are we gonna get rid of that and replace it with with some of this let's rap let's wrap everything in that what did i do i okay i messed up on the capitalization there we go alright let's see okay so harsh it's pasting in some some code for me here so let me put this in okay all right so now let's just bring this in see ok well it didn't change that but we didn't get errors so I guess that's ok so case for now alright so now let's see woods who okay I did not put the theme in down here thanks ah if you're just joining you didn't see the beginning so a hard submitted a pool request over the weekend that implemented this material UI v1 and so that's why I'm getting a lot of advice from him because I didn't I didn't implement this so I'm just trying to learn as we go and while I'm not normally an expert at things I'm usually not quite this clueless but I'm benefiting greatly from from Harsha in this stream yeah all right it works great alright so already over a half hour into the stream and we got our first thing to work okay awesome so now at least we know that this is set up in a way that you know we can go ahead and change a lot of things in our theme like this obviously I wouldn't want every one of these values to be green but I don't want to try to calculate this on my own I'll probably try to find I'm sure there's some material design calculator where I can pop in the base color and it'll produce all these for me so alright so we have the color in here that was that was step one that's what we wanted to do first so let's do some shree do let's see if we can put in a logo and maybe some of our some icons up here so we haven't tried to deal with icons yet in this new version of material UI so maybe we can figure out how to do that let's figure out how to do that first since that's kind of new I mean put an image in is probably not going to be that hard this is kind of basic let's see oops so I guess we're good in the app bar component so let's check this out and off I'm looking for where the material ID documentation is I moved it over on the other screen also I just remembered that I'm blocking my timer so you all can't see it with my hat with my face okay let's see so we want the components and the app bar and I guess we'll want to check that bar with buttons yep so we I mean we don't exactly want a button we want to put icons there but it should be similar there we go I think if we just put an icon button biography yeah let's just try to throw an icon button over there and see what it does so we'll need to bring in let's bring in the icon button first we need the icon button actually we need the the icons as well so we don't we don't want the menu icon and want some other icons but actually we're already pulling that in so I didn't check first and instead of the menu icon I want this there's got to be some type of reference for all the icons so let's see where they talk about the icons let's see if they list the icons okay so I'm guess if I just look them up at the regular materiai Khan's place then the names will be the same so I don't want that what is it came out what it's called what's the what's this called word has the three dots vertical that's what I want let's go I know it has to be in here because you see it on google apps all the time and see the lips all right let me try to type in some of these it's not that I probably have it downloaded somewhere Mike the SVG version already I should just check my downloads folder there we go Wow okay more alright that's what it's called so I'm guessing I can just type more vert and it will work let's try that mmm what's project I've type in more vert icon maybe we'll see maybe it'll work alright so let's grab this should have a icon button and put it in down here where our not there we want the app bar or is there a bar bar okay so we'll win it after no before toolbar yeah we want it before toolbar but after typography so I don't want it to have the class a mini but we'll probably want to put some Styles on it at some point but for now let's take that out and it's not say more for now and more birds so now let's see if that word Hey okay so it kind of worked so we did get we got this in here it works it's just on this side so let's see how they did it here probably they have some type of styling they call this one for the login button I think they used to flex one on this I don't think we're using flex one on that we'll check it out sort of typography flex all right let's check out our theme here and see if we have a flex class if not we'll add it now I don't think we did all right let's add a flex class up here and in our our flex class we just want to say flex one all right so this is it's basically gonna make it take up the take up the space as much space as it as it can in this container and who else actually isn't John Hanson is pretty good about flex box stuff so if he's watching I don't think I've seen him but if he's watching you can correct my my flex box and all this year and oh I didn't I didn't actually add that on to the component so let's do that so down here we're going to add a class name of classes oops that's not we have a what did we call it do we call it classes I guess we did classes flex there we go okay so now we have it over here on the side awesome cool we even got a nice little click effect there great okay so I'm learning a lot more about using flex because I'm doing some react native stuff for my Udacity course and I guess when you're doing react native you have to do everything with flex you can't use like other CSS positioning things and so yeah so that's cool all right so we have that icon here for now I'm cool with this icon we'll probably want to add some more icons let me show it's been a while I think since I've shown what we're what we're trying to upgrade so let me make sure there's nothing so this is like a private site so as long as there's nothing that can't be public here yeah I think we're good so let me show this so right now this is what we're going off of so you can see you know you get we have this week's bulletin up here we have some menu icons so we have different views we have a print view we have a view that's like a grid so it looks more like Pinterest and we can search so we'll have some icons up here a few more icons and then we have our categories here and we also have some filters and we have another another view type down here at classic mode and we'll have we have a submit announcement form so that's what we're gonna end up having in here and so depending on depending on how things go and how much time we have I wouldn't like my times up here we'll do five minutes of question answer but depending on how it goes I would like to maybe give the user some more control over the options of what view do they want to show by default things like that maybe giving the ability to like star certain things or bookmark them and save them for later so they'll have their own section of you know like maybe bookmarked announcements but that does kind of depend on what happens with the single signon and and how that all works right now with the way I'm signing users on I could store data and get that for users but since that may change in the near future I'm not really gonna do anything with it right now so let's do a short break check the time okay so we'll see we might not get that much more done actually because I didn't realize my time are you gone off and I I think that went over a lot for that Pomodoro session so yeah we'll see we we might not do another session which is very abnormal usually at least do two but I do want to make sure I can get oops where's my I was trying to get my comments up on my other screen so okay I'm gonna scroll way up to the talks I haven't really gone through the comments very much at all and I'm gonna go down through and try to answer as many questions as I can see okay Jase laces materialise one of the worst web frontend frameworks ever okay it says semantic UI it's one that I've been using heavily lately has a lot of nice API integrations to handle populating forms and such check chicken Jase laces granted I haven't used material on about six months it was really difficult to use properly as a lot of things we're not working this may have changed since okay yeah well I I haven't really used a lot of different UI frameworks for react so we did use the old version of material UI for the last project and this is the latest version so I imagine there is a lot that has changed in the last six months at least with the latest version the old version is probably pretty similar to what it was so I'm very much still learning it I like it because it uses the material design and that's so that helps me out if I'd used if I use another framework I would have to spend more time styling it differently than the default styles to make it look more like the material design style that that we use here at the University for other side projects it wouldn't be a problem but that's why we're going to tear UI now there are a few other material design frameworks out there so I'm open to trying them as well but you know if this works out at some point I'd like to just stick with one and get really good at it right now I'm still kind of in the phase where I'm searching for one that I really like so yeah any suggestions are definitely welcome um Mohammad Reza says hi Jesse this is my first time watching you online hey how's it going thanks so much for watching I'm glad you could catch me live yeah feel free to ask any questions or comment and I'll try to try to answer any questions yet oh cool so Bret Bret says Bret was having a conversation about learning react but I just want to read one of the comments out because it's flattering to me Bret says I was struggling to learn react until I started free code camp and built a site using Jesse's first react project that's really cool I always like whenever you'll let me know that you've used some stuff that we've done on the stream in your own projects I'd love to look at that stuff so if anyone has done anything like that definitely you know send me a link to the github repo or if it's live somewhere online you know definitely like to check it out and I'm really busy lately because of my other course that's going on so I've been slacking on this but I do like to give feedback Lee if you have a project and you want you want me to take a look at it and you tell you what I think I'm definitely down to do that just you know for those of you have done it if I haven't gotten back to you yet I am really sorry I have not forgotten about you but I've just been working a lot you know if I have free time at home to work then I'm working on my my course so that should be over by the end of this month and then I'll have a little bit more time okay all right so my fiveminute timer is up for questions and answers yeah I think I think I'm not gonna do another point Medora session I'm just gonna do Q&A cuz I'm scrolling through and I'm not even halfway through the live chat so I don't think there's any way that I could do another session and get through the chat and still be able to look up the date I need for my meeting so yeah so we're just going to do question and answer so I hope to get a little bit more done I kind of got tripped up a little bit at the beginning and and trying to implement this theme but we got it working now and I mean it's in place you could pretty much do whatever you want with the theme now we did get this working which that was easier than I thought so yeah so I guess tomorrow we'll do some more us stuff we'll get the logo and we'll work on maybe some of the different views maybe you get that like grid view layout and get some categories in here so it'll start looking more like it's it's actually going to look and then we can then we can tackle some more than behind the scenes thing like pulling in some more data we're definitely going to need we're gonna need some custom fields and make sure we can pull those and from the graph QL API so and then we're gonna figure out you know how do we display those to the user we're gonna have to hook up a form which we've done before but we're gonna have to do that again which means we're going to need a custom server so we'll do server Jas file so there's a lot of stuff stuff that we have done before but we're doing again and we'll try I always like to try to do it better you know each time so maybe we can try out some new stuff or you know whatever we need to do file uploads so there's definitely some some cool stuff they don't need done and then the big thing at least in my mind because I'm not sure how it's gonna work out is going to be the the login and potentially authentication for our our graph QL API so that'll be fun learn a lot from that and hopefully you all can learn from it or help me learn from it okay so that's the plan coming up I just want to tell you all just so you know like whether it's worth your time to watch or if if you're really good at something like that you know if maybe you'll want to do a pull request or something like that so anyway that's the plan for now let me keep going through the questions in the live chat if you do have a question put it in there now I think I will have time to get through all the questions and if you don't have a question please stick around the and help answer some questions cuz I definitely don't know enough to handle all the questions okay so Blake has a question does graph QL take posts and content from a wordpress site and poured it into the react website okay so Brett responds to this saying it runs queries on the API in this case the WordPress REST API yeah okay so I haven't looked into exactly what the graph QL plugin that we're using does but it seems so Brett saying that it actually uses the WordPress REST API to get the data initially okay which that's kind of cool and then it then it sends the data so it works just like we were using the REST API in previous projects so we are I mean let me see lakes initial questions answer this correctly okay so I wouldn't say I wouldn't put it like that that graph QL imports them in so you have graph QL basically working on the WordPress side of things so that's your API so before where we were calling the REST API and getting data now we're calling this graph QL API and getting getting data then so we make a call basically using before where we were using fetch now we're using Apollo to make the call I mean I it's it's probably not an exact comparison there but basically it's the serving the same purpose so we're using Apollo to make the call and get the data then once we have it in there Apollo does some stuff behind the scenes with Redux so you basically have the equivalent of a store that's available wherever you need it and that's how we get the data so hopefully that made sense in terms of how how that all those things interact with each other Mohamed's would like to know the best UI websites for making a website trying to see if there are some answers here alright so uh Mohammed it so first of all it depends on whether you're using react or not so if you are using react and I recommend specifically a UI library that works with reacted as react components so if you're in a material design material UI either the original version or the new version one beta will work there are a few other material design libraries for react I haven't had that much experience with them and then there are also some other things I'm pretty sure there's at least one bootstrap library for react so if you're familiar with using bootstrap and other sites I assume it works in a similar way if you're not using react and you're making you know some other type of HTML CSS you know JavaScript site then you could use again if you like material design you could use materialized you could use bootstrap which is very common foundation there's another good one we had a recommendation earlier from Jay slay to use semantic UI so those are just some of my suggestions of things that I've either used myself or I've seen other people use heard good things about so I don't know that there's one that I could say for sure this is the best one because it definitely depends on what what look you're going for with your site right if you really want a material design then I don't recommend using a library that's not material design it could work but you'll spend a lot more time customizing it in the same way if you if you don't want material design look then don't use material eyes or material UI and I noticed a little bit further up by miss Jason Leia says I'm having trouble finding a good use case for react there's a lot of my projects are really small oneoff things so I would say if you are trying to learn react then it's worth it to even do small projects that don't necessarily need react because those small simple projects will help you learn react if you're doing a big project that's more complicated there's a lot of other things that aren't even necessarily react things that you'll probably have to figure out and so it'll just add to the difficulty and make it it'll make it harder to learn so I recommend you know do some stuff with reacts it's really small stuff it'll just get you used to doing certain things you know the react way so if you can if you have the freedom to be able to use react for that I know if it's if it's projects for a client or for where you work you don't always have the ability to pick you know what you're going to use but if it's a side project and you can pick then then I definitely recommend doing that and don't worry so much about it's too small you know for react like you're trying to learn it so it's probably better than small mmhmm sorry yawning again I don't know what this is our last week I just kept yawning during the stream all the time I I got enough sleep I should not be yawning but oh well I hope I'm not making all of you yawn all right let's see and the Resource Center you forgot that yeah I thought we used that for the Resource Center but I wasn't sure if it still worked in the same way for this version and to be honest with you I'm pretty sure it might have been Sebastian that got that working on the resource centers so this is two projects in a row that we've used material UI and I haven't actually set it up myself yet I'm very very grateful for all the help that you give me on here so that probably explains why I am I still had to look everything up because I in fact have never done it even though we used it on the last project the good thing about that though is you set it you set it up once the beginning of the project and then you don't have to set it up again so after that it's much easier to use okay so blake is asking like so Blake asks a question about graph QL saying so Blake said but if I designed a website with HTML react somebody else could write the posts and images and it would automatically add to my website yeah yeah that's exactly how it works yeah so if I were to go into the WordPress actually let me bring this over I'll just demonstrate it so here I am and this is the WordPress installation for this I can go into posts and let's add a new post and let's just say okay does publish that and see how quickly we can get it to show up we might have to refresh Oh we'll see it's already there so somebody could have the login info to get in here and edit these posts and have no access at all to this and they could add data and then it would it would show up here and in fact that's the setup that we're going to have for this once this goes live our someone actually more than one person in my department will have access to this they will be in charge of putting all the content in and then it will display here and at that point I'm really only involved if something goes wrong or if it doesn't show up right so that's actually why I'm using WordPress for the content for this so that someone who doesn't know about the code can edit posts easily okay so Brett's saying we were talking earlier about using react for small projects Brett says the small things are hard to justify using react but Jesse's first project actually uses jQuery a lot and I've been mixing the two a bit getting something to work in jQuery then moving it to react yeah actually I forgot we did do that so we have yes so that first project we build it out as a non reacts it first then we converted it to react I forgot that we did that yes so we basically had that we had a backup plan because initially the deadline was really short and then we ended up being able to launch the site a little bit later which was nice because the site ended up being a lot better you know once we had some more time to work on it but the initial plan was if we couldn't get the react site working then it was faster to just use the just kind of build it out using jQuery and we used materialized CSS so yes that's actually kind of a fun exercise to to take an existing site but with something else and then convert it to react so that that was fun I liked that it was odd now that I go back and look at the code and I see that I'm mixing jQuery with things I think I definitely wouldn't have done it like that now but at the time that that allowed us to get the site up and running as quickly as we did it would definitely took longer than I anticipated but we had a lot of changes that were not anticipated as well so if it would have been based on initially what we're gonna do for the site it definitely could have been done a lot faster Martin asks do you not use semicolons and JavaScript anymore it's it's a choice right so you don't have to so if you want to use semicolons that's totally that's fine some people's really say you should use semicolons but they're pretty much optional there's I think at least one use case where you are supposed to use semicolons because it might mess things up if you don't I can't remember offhand what that use case is I remember looking it up just to make sure and it was a use case that I I don't know that I've ever even come across personally so that's why I don't use semicolons I have like automatic formatting set up with prettier and standard J s and I have it set to remove all semicolons so that's just how I like to do things for me if if you have two pieces of code and one is shorter than the other piece of code but they do the exactly the same thing then I'm going to go with the shorter piece of code you know normally that's that's what I'll go with so removing all the semicolons overall makes less code right so that's why I like it just one less thing to have to type but it's it's it's definitely your choice it's theirs if someone has in the live chat as the handle google sucks I'm just gonna call them Google for right now says this can't be totally free what's the catch what do you mean totally free like free code camp being free or what if it's free code can that yeah it is it's entirely free because like everybody's volunteered so there's a lot of people that contribute their time to make all the different things that free code camp does happen so that's why I can it can be free because of everyone you know everyone making pull requests for things and there's just there's so many people working on things so that's how it's that's how it's free so thanks everybody I who helps out with free code camp there's a lot I mean I I do my little thing here on YouTube but there are so many people who have contributed so much you know for so long so it definitely if you can contribute I definitely consider doing that because that would be awesome and it would keep free code camp going cool Brett says this is great you can have one theme and use it for several projects yeah yeah actually that's that's why when I said earlier like I'd like to just pick one thing and keep using it that's the big benefit of doing that is like let's say I decide I want to keep using this version of material UI I could we could make our theme here set all our colors how we want things to be and then just for our next project we can just copy that over and it will all work and we won't have to do that step again so it would definitely save some time Oh Harshit says by the way I'm only 15 years old never worked on a big project well honestly Archie that is I'm super impressed that you're 15 and you're able to do all this so quickly I mean no like I said earlier check out the pool request number and everything that Harsha did so much stuff and this was all over the course of I don't know two days maybe three days it seemed it really is really awesome so I'm definitely impressed yeah like keep it up I mean you uh I think you'll be a great programmer if you keep you know keep working at it because you're already awesome and Bret says too harsh it's is Europe you are a confident developer at fifteen just imagine what you'll be doing at thirty hardsuits is up studying science right now at high school physics and math cool yeah that's I don't know how it is where you're at I'm not I don't know where you're located at Harshit but from where I am physics and math were always like the hardest subjects to study in in high school so you must be pretty smart yes so I'm actually I'm really glad that you were contributing my project cuz I think one day down the road you'll probably be doing really awesome things and I'll be able to say like hey I worked on a project with that guy you know back in the day but that's awesome I wish I was more productive when I was 15 I definitely was not doing anything as awesome as contributing opensource react projects and well there YouTube didn't exist when I was 15 so I couldn't couldn't have been on YouTube oh cool it looks like so Robert said that harsh it has some nice YouTube videos on his YouTube channel so I'll have to check those out when I get a chance so yeah definitely if you'd like to see what you're working on kinda 808 says hello everyone hey how's it going thanks for watching see I got some reason my lab chest skipped all the way down to the bottom so now I lost my place here all right I'm left to kind of go quickly through the rest of this because I'm coming up close to my meeting time here okay so it looks like we have somebody in here as the name of someone who's famous so I'm not sure I didn't look it up I'm not gonna look it up just cuz I'm running out of time but may or may not actually be someone famous okay alright so I guess he's the vice president of the Indian opposition not not probably not the guy that's in the channel right now but that does the same name he had definitely not the same guy all right cool well anyway welcome Rahul thanks for watching okay I'm gonna try to pronounce his name I'm apologizing in advance if I get it wrong and a new low wopo and a new low I'm sorry I'm so hopefully you know I'm talking about that says testing components built with material is extremely difficult okay hmm I'll have to have to keep that in mind as anybody else have experience testing material I components I definitely want to use some some type of testing if we can on this project so at this point I'm probably gonna keep going with materiai but I would like to know if anybody is has experience successfully testing things let's see no beer says Jessie where do you host your website dot IO domain that's what I'm talking about I do I have a dot IO I don't know it's just I don't know which website any toilet so my my personal website against this professional website is Jesse Weibull calm I don't currently have an IO actually be cool to have an IO maybe I should get one world's asked do most UI frameworks work with react you can make them work with reacts but the ones that actually have react components I think are better so I try to deal with those I've made materialized CSS is not a react framework but I did make it work in project one you just have to be careful with some of the jQuery stuff you you don't you really want to try not to manipulate the Dom because it messes with with what react does so it can work but it's not ideal but if you do want to make it work check out project one on this YouTube channel and on the live it'll be on the live coding with Jesse playlist yeah so check out the first project that we did and I mean that's an example of getting a non reacting work to work with with react Hamza says was was it the first project when you set up lint stage and prettier or the second um I don't know let's just check oops I meant to take github no no that's not it I once see I reacts nuts yes static there we go yeah yeah for the first project that's we did have lint stage and fruitier setup on that one no beer says I heard that react plus Redux equals powerful yeah yeah definitely we were actually gonna use Redux for this project but then realized that we didn't have to use Redux and that's what Harshit had removed Redux and replaced it with all the Apollo stuff but we'll probably end up using Redux at some point for another project so I just used it for another project that I did for that Udacity course and it is really cool it was a little bit difficult to you know figure it all out at first but once I got the hang of it I could definitely see like how useful it is harsh it's asks about a link for the slack Channel I don't currently have a link for the slack Channel that works there's a workaround that I need to work on I just haven't had time to get a setup yet so if I guess for now if you really want to get in the slack channel before I get the workaround set up send me a message on Twitter with your email and I can send you a an invite to your email I don't know if I could get you the invite today cuz I'm gonna be pretty busy the rest of the day but probably tomorrow okay Arshad says there's also been some changes made in the graph QL folder with fragments so yeah I'm betting animals time visit all right I'm gonna have to check that out later okay but I'm gonna leave this open so I don't forget to look at it I'm just going to check I'm not gonna read all the comments cuz run out of time here but I'm gonna check for questions so if I don't read your comment I'm sorry just running out of at a time here Oh actually I'm going to read this this sounds useful Brett says you can make you material UI theme a separate get repo and imported for each project that sounds but that sounds really good I love that idea Robert says have you used material UI with routing in a react project that's the point regular stuck yeah so we have used react router with material UI the the last project that we did well I guess not the last one project to so project 2 is the the Resource Center we use material I and react router we add some routing going on there so check that out maybe hopefully that can help and if you have any questions let me know okay so the name before that I have trouble pronouncing he says you can call me I know so all right I'll I'll try remember to call you a new and start really sorry about that I do try to pronounce everyone's name properly if at all possible oh okay so earlier nobody was asking about the dot IO site and that's the N grog site so that's a it's it's the thing you run I'm running it on my computer it basically takes whatever I'm running with on localhost and it converts it into a live URL that people can go to to check it out so normally you can't have this many people on and rock looking like by default from the free plan but the guy that's that runs and grukk he is letting us use it for free for free code camp stream so very generous very generous of him so anyway that's why you know you all can see that so it's not like my site personally it's through and grow all right so one more question and then I have to go I'm getting some slack messages from my boss so Angela says have you tried to test material I component a fool Dom with just an enzyme okay what did we do on the we had some testing going on with material UI on project 2 so I mean if you want to check out some of the videos from project to the or even check out the repo for project 2 that was the the Resource Center we did have we usually materiai we did have some testing going on so maybe that'll have something useful for you on there but alright so at this point I definitely have to go thanks so much for all your help and for all the contributions here in the live chat I will be back tomorrow and until then have a great day
