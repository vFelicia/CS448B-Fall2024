hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie and today we're going to try to get the authorization working the user login for our app and so I've done some troubleshooting today and I think I've ruled out the the email as the issue so yesterday we were thinking that there was maybe a port that was blocked that was stopping emails from working but that's not the case so I was able to test that out and on the master branch I don't have the login implemented but the email is there when you submit the form that I was going to show you but I can't log in right now so if we could log in there's a form all right so we can get to it on the master branch I can submit it successfully and I can get the email so that works so it's not the email so we have to look elsewhere so I did kind of scatter i scattered console logs all over the place throughout some of our node files here and I didn't I didn't come up with any definitive but I think it may have something to do with the database connection let me show you my my logs here so this is what I keep getting let's see here we go so this this error is is coming from client dot J s that's the area that I keep getting every time I try to log in so between what I was able to do with all the console logs and be able to successfully send emails and this error message that leads me to believe that maybe it has something to do with how we're interacting with with that database so I figure that's not a bad place to start with our troubleshooting so let's it was not much to see here just you know we can submit see actually let me restart this because we're not gonna get this will refresh all right let me check the live chat before we get started and then I'll start my timer and we'll do 25 minutes of in this case troubleshooting we may or not may or may not be writing that much code so you could see this is this is what happens when you submit we just keep getting the same error sorry it's just everything set up hey everybody CEO saying hey air in the live chat sebastian is asking if the the pool request he submitted to fix that UI glitch that was happening with the the drop down for to log out so i did emerge in that pool request i as far as i know it was working alright i didn't have time to test it that much so it was only really minimal changes just to CSS so i figured there's no harm in and merging it in but my take truth my browser stack has been insanely slow lately so if you're not familiar browser stack you can run you can test your websites on all different types of browser operating system device combinations so it's like you through your browser you can log in to these other devices and test it so for whatever reason it's just been really weird and slow and hard to test so i didn't test it yet just because I'm tired of the frustration of working with that so anyway it's it's in the master branch now so if anyone once has the code on your machine and you're running an on Mac please let me know if you see anything weird when you click on that that menu to logout but I think it should be fun okay all right so I have some some comments pertaining to the troubleshooting so let's just go right into that and and check out these comments I'm going to start my timer after this 25 minutes is up I'm going to take five minutes and go through the questions in the live chat so if you ask a question I will get to it eventually just hang in there and and you'll get your answer if you can't stick around for the answer just check out the recording of this video which will be available here on the free code camp YouTube channel shortly after I finished the stream alright so okay so Paco asks did you try to connect your mom go on another port okay no I haven't let's see and Harshit is asking about a user I've already created a user in the in the database so I'm using M lab just the free version of M lab just to set up a testing database so I do have a user created and that's the the user that I'm working with for for my database so where you have to put in your database user and password that's that's what I am using okay Sebastian followed up with initially talking about pull requests yes the white space was gone so there's no white space any there anymore they're on a Mac so that that issue was cleared up so thank you let's see okay so I'm trying to I'm trying to sort out Harshit is the one that that coded this pretty much everything having to do with the back end was done by Harsha so I'm trying to read these comments helping me out here so so harsh it's saying check your dot and file okay so what what do I need to check the string I have checked the string it's it's worth doublechecking okay I should saying to use use his connection string okay let's see I have my dot M file open on my other screen obviously so that I don't show everybody all my stuff to okay cool so harsh it's going to message me the info so that I can I can try it with with his database info that's actually a good idea and then that old that should help us narrow down the issue okay so let me see while I'm waiting on on a Harsha send me that info okay cool I just got it anyway I was going to say when we probably later on whenever I finish up with the coding and we do a question and answer session I'm gonna let you know how everything went with that react native that just to make a lungs long story short it passed the code review so it's officially accepted I've completed all the project for that nano degree which is awesome there's definitely a lot of work that I still would like to do on it and I got some really great feedback from my reviewers so I maybe I might actually turn that into some issues on the github repo and then if anybody would like to work on it with me then at least you'll know some of the things that need the need work alright so I got Harshit I got your your info I'm going to paste that now into my dot and file okay I'm saving that and let me let me restart this so you start this wait for that to refresh okay alright let's give this a shot now okay so waiting okay not sent let's see yep we got the same same error okay so since this same login info works for Harshit on his machine then it's probably it probably doesn't have anything to do with my my login credentials for the database it has something to do I guess with my development environment so well at least we've we've ruled that out okay okay hard sing hard code the string for now okay I can hard code it I will I'll do that on my other screen let's see actually let me yeah okay oops we first that okay still same there well almost the same we had a bit more up here the last time Eric connecting the TV interesting I'm going to try that one more time I'm just wondering why we got different messages okay okay hmm all right I'm gonna get off of this I don't want that off day Esther refresh and show harsh it's trying to use memory store for now I'll different Express session okay physically listen reacts yeah so dragon hunter the the repo is bulletin react okay so harsh is saying try to use a memory store for now from Express session okay you're gonna have to help me out with that because I've this is the first time I've used and Express so let's see okay so I'm going to remove i'll go from exposition I make that big here sorry that was probably too small for everybody I had it smaller earlier there we go okay okay so harsh the same I'm removing so I'm not sure exactly where to remove if if I remove this will that do the trick are there other places where I need to remove it from I'm gonna take that out now and I figured I'd get some sort of error okay so first we remove that okay cool okay so there's another place where we have to do this that's okay dragon hunter the branch someone right now is it's actually harsh it's pull request let me let me send you what PR is that 44 let me send you the get command I'm going to take by the gate command if anybody does want to check this out but you're not familiar with how to do this I'm just going to type it right into the live chat it's get fetch origin pull 44 and then age okay so get fetch origin pool and then 44 I'll put this up on the screen too if anybody wants to see this later on so this is what I'm doing git fetch origin pool so you're gonna pull request number 44 and then head and then at the end here you can name this whatever you want but that's what the branch is going to be called on your local machine so this is what I named it on my local machine but you can name it whatever you want after you pull this down you can switch to that branch make sure you run npm install or yarn because there's a lot of packages and then you should be able to to work on on this or at least follow follow along with what we're doing okay all right so let me go back to this John Hanson says I remember seeing something when using react with express and connecting through MongoDB there can be a shared connection issue between Express and react which can default on the same localhost 3000 okay so maybe maybe we're dealing with with a known issue here that's good to know because there'll probably be some some information about how how to fix it down let DVD compass see where was let me let me go back one so there was one other thing that I had to comment out well let's connect to the database from a GUI first okay we compass be able to could I use instead of compass the bongo DB compass could I just use the command line could I use the shell let me pull pull one over to my other screen here Harshit saying it will be very hard as you don't have longer that well wedding we should I mean all we really need to test is whether or not I can actually connect right so that that might be the only reason I'm asking is because I don't want to go through the to get the free version of Compass TV compass is like you gotta fill out all your contact info and everything so I was just going to try to avoid that and I wanted to download the show anyway oh here we go found another place where it's gonna let me download it without that alright I'll try that then I don't know what that other page was but it wanted a lot of contact info okay oh yeah now it's making me do this again I'm gonna show so I'm trying to install the shell but the the documentation page was just saying how to use it and not how to install it cool I think I could just use brew to install this let's see okay so I'm gonna try to use homebrew homebrew to install this okay cool let's see all right harsh dude I got your link I'm going to open this on my other screen okay so if you're just joining us you're not sure what's going on when installing some tools to help us test our database connection so I have a few things going right now so whatever tool ends up getting downloaded faster is what we're going to use all right so the compass is has three minutes left on the download homebrew is now about 15% done downloading so so we'll see see what happens it's a race so if you've never used homebrew here's what's going on here so if you're on a Mac you can use homebrew to install packages so there are different reasons why you might want to use home homebrew but it can be it can be useful so I just ran brew update which just updated homebrew it's good good there if you don't run homebrew often it's a good idea to just do a brew update every time you're going to install something new and then I'm doing brew install MongoDB so waiting on that looks like it's still saying three minutes left on the Compass something like the the home brew install might might win the race here okay let's see harsh harsh is saying check out all changes you might have done some breaking change is possible all I really added in were console logs and I think I actually got rid of all those so it should be everything should be exactly the same I can always pull the pull the branch down again sirrah mad okay all right so now we reverted all right so we do have Brian's asking about homebrew so while we're waiting for this to install we may as well talk about number so homebrew helps you it's been a while since I even read anything about homebrew but from what I remember when I was first researching this homebrew who helps you use C you install these packages but you do it in a way that protects your system so I don't know if sandboxing is the right word but I guess it's it's somewhat similar to that also it makes it easier really easy to update things so like if you install yarn through homebrew and you want to update yarn you just run the update through homebrew so there's no sometimes yarn for whatever reason can be tricky at least I've it's been tricky for me probably because on some of my scenes I use homebrew and some of machines I use I installed it other ways so anyway I'm gonna do my 5minute break now and I'll just continue talking about homebrew for a minute here but it just kind of makes it easy to be able I mean you can see a lot of the packages here that are available this kind of simplifies installing packages you know you don't have to go like read the docs on how to manually install any of these it just it's there and it works so anyway I don't use it for everything but it is convenient for some things all right let me scroll up and see what questions you all have and try to answer as many as I can here in this little break Oh Goo's says I can't learn vanilla JavaScript could you guys help me yeah I would say if you're having trouble with vanilla JavaScript I mean you can certainly ask any questions here in the live chat or you know ask me questions on Twitter or something like that but I think checking out free code camps javascript exercises is a good way to get your hang of get the hang of all the syntax and run through some algorithms and things there are other great resources so code Academy has some nice like in browser tutorials and there's certainly a lot of YouTube videos there's a great JavaScript series here on free code camps channel that that Bo recorded so you know check that out there's also some good open source books so the you don't know J S series is available for free on github that's a great series so there's a lot of different things you could do to learn JavaScript it kind of depends on your preferred learning style I would say for me things I like the videos and I like reading and all that and the in browser exercises but I don't feel like I really get them the concepts and so I start to use it in my own projects and and need to modify things you know based on the project requirements then I find myself really getting the hang of these different concepts so no matter what you do to learn at first I would try to spend some time every day just you know a little bit of time every day actually using those concepts if you can it'll be much easier to keep those learn those concepts and remember them if you do a little bit every day as opposed to you know maybe taking one day a week and spending hours learning so that's that's just kind of some basic advice if you're having issues with a specific part of JavaScript you know that you know or let us know here in the live chat and I mean we could help you with that okay Blake asked about end rock at the beginning and Rock is the the service that I'm using to be able to let you all see on your computer in your browser the projects that I'm working on locally and you can inspect them however it's not really going to be of that much use right now because of the way we have the servers running so we will be using it in the future but for right now it's not it's not really gonna work and it has nothing to do with n grog and rocks working perfectly it's just what we have one on right now with the project Fernando says I'm from Argentina I need a job Fernando let's see if you if you're on Twitter and you wanna if you send me a tweet with I'm sorry if you tagged me in a tweet that maybe has a link to your github repository or your portfolio website and just saying the tweet like you know I'm looking for work this is what I do I'd be happy to retweet you I don't have that many followers I'm like just under 600 right now but maybe some of my followers may retweet as well and some of my followers do have a lot more followers on their account so that may help I don't I don't know of any jobs available right now and I'm not really in a position to make hiring decisions on my own where I'm working right now but I'd be more than happy to just try to get your name out there on Twitter a little bit more so my link to my Twitter account or at least my name on Twitter is is in the description for this video okay all right so that time is up let's do one more session hopefully we can get things something figured out in this session so let me scroll back down and let me grab let's see I have all my database info open on another screen so let me grab this and paste this in here okay all right so now that I have the shell I'm going to let me get all the all the info in here just to just take me just a second I'm going to I'm going to build the string that I need to put in there on my other screen and then I'll paste it into the terminal okay so I'm not I'm not going to do this on the screen I'm doing some another screen because I have all my database info in here but right now it's it's in the process of connecting so let's see what happens I don't know how long it normally takes to connect okay actually interesting okay so we I did get by an error that gives me a little bit more information here hmm okay so is definitely the problem I think is with connecting to the database let's see oh there's a lot of capital letters in the live chat right now so let's see what har should say okay so harsh is saying that we should run a local database all right so let's do this start dB okay okay all right so we've started MongoDB let's see changing to mondo vocalist bulletin okay all right let's whoops okay so let me let me repeat what's going on in the live chat here sorry I think I've been pretty silent trying to read this so for everybody they can't see the live chat so what we're going to try to do is locally run a database so DB which we can do now since we installed everything so we're going to start this so we've run on my other screen I guess I could pull this over now because I don't have any special there we go okay so let me the the zoom one i therm is a little odd but anyway alright so I was pasting the wrong stuff in here but basically an R should let me know so I did Bruce services start MongoDB and it started a database and then I mistakenly pasted this in here before I saw your comment about where to put that so let's yeah okay so I've done the brewery services start MongoDB and I'm gonna put I'm going to change the dot n file okay so I've changed the database in the dot M file all right now let's restart the server whoops I have it here oh no sorry start this up rates alright as soon as this refreshes we'll test it out okay I'm seeing some hopeful things in the console yes I hate okay so it says the email has been sent let me verify that I have my email upon on the other screen and yes okay I have the token and let me grab this token and we'll paste it in over here so everyone can see awesome all right really cool so let me recap just I guess I didn't need to zoom in that much but let's recap would just happen so our it seems that our whole problem for the last or at least not not our problem it works your Harshit right away but for me for some reason and possibly this has to do with with my network here although I did try it on another network so maybe it's not I'm not sure what the issue is but for whatever reason we couldn't connect to the database that I was trying to run through a service called M lab so instead we installed with homebrew and then we just started up locally a database then I replace the local database in our DB hosts and our dot M file and that's the dot n files where you put information that you want to pull in as variables but you want to keep that secret so you don't put the dot end file in your github repo and nobody ever sees that okay get it it allows you to pull that into your source code but it remains hidden and you can still have things in your repository on github and you don't have to risk exposing API keys or passwords or anything like that so anyway so we changed our den file and then we're able to connect to the database so the authorization works as stated and you know exactly how how it was supposed to work so thanks harsh it great job on that so awesome well this is awesome so what I wanted let's let's test some of this out right great so you see we were able to log in let's check out let's check out where this is being stored at you have this on local storage or in cookies cool all right so okay heart should say we should test the form submission that's a good idea so the form submission was working before let's test it again just to make sure I'm just gonna put some things in here and submit all right submitted let's double check my email yep I got it actually let's try to do that with a file as well so let's see let's send so I'm gonna send something okay this is reasonably thin this is something that a PDF is something something we'll probably get sent frequently so all right and okay cool when the attachment did come through great awesome okay okay so all that works all right so we may as well merge this now so let's go back to our our console and what I'm gonna do first and I always do this always do this when I have branches that I'm merging is first we're going to merge master into our other branch and then if something really goes wrong at least we haven't messed up our master branch right so let's do get merge master all right why are you up to date I actually merged beforehand so I was almost positive that was going to work sometimes you may have merged conflicts in this case there was there was nothing harsh it does a good job of keeping everything merged so anyway let's go let's do a git checkout master up master and now we'll get merge h off great okay let me just double check we should be all up to date with our packages but never hurts to run it again great we are up to date and now we'll do a git push origin master all right that's going to push our code up to github and then if anybody happens to be looking at this pull request it will change from open to merge whenever we do this so we don't even have to do anything in github right from the command line it's it's going to be taken care of all right great okay now here's the thing though we there's some things that will probably change just so that we can all work on this and test it out so for instance right now you have to put in a Franciscan University email address now granted you could have it sent to mail trap so like there are ways but I think it's it's probably a good idea to make some changes hopefully I can get those changes done today probably not doing the stream just to make it possible I guess to skip the login since we know it works basically so y'all can get in and you're locally on your machines and do you know check out other things and do other type of work so we'll see about that so for now just be aware that it's going to make you log in now if you try to download this okay so let me bring over I guess I don't have to bring over I just want to grab one more pull request and that's the last one that we currently have open which it feels really good to get all these pull requests taken care of I've been so behind on getting things merged and really it was it was this request that we just sorted out now that was making me fall behind the most I just kept trying to troubleshoot and didn't realize until we're there today that it was most likely a database thing okay so let's grab this poor request 47 and this is where har should implemented the masonry layout if you're not familiar with that it with what that is hopefully you'll see an example in just a minute so let's do a git fetch origin pool 47 since it's pool requests 47 Ted and then we'll call this H masonry all right you don't have to name it H masonry you can name it whatever you want but I kind of like to put the first letter of the name of the person who's doing the pool request and then it just helps me keep straight who who did what and it helps me to be able to remember and give credit to the a person for doing this pool request so now let's check out let's do a get check out that new branch that we just created masonry and now whoops I keep forgetting I have the have a sent another screen recognized for your component oops I got to do a yarn it's a good idea to just run yarn all the time when you're pulling that down because if you don't need it it won't hurt anything but if you do need it it'll prevent you from maybe trying to troubleshoot something that you really shouldn't have to worry about because it should have been all taken care of oops let's try to restart before we do anything else okay great this is another thing that I found just from experience when you update when you switch to a new branch and you run yarn sometimes it's a good idea just to restart your server I know I've been very frustrated for a minute when things don't work and then luckily just a restart has been able to fix everything so try to do those two things run yarn or run NPM install and then restart the server before you try to troubleshoot anything it could save you a lot of time I know I've wasted a lot of time when I've forgotten to do that okay so anyway here's what we're talking about with masonry layout check that out that's just that looks cool write that all the cards just kind of flow so we had we talked about CSS grid so maybe it would be a good idea to explain the differences between what's going on here and CSS grid because certainly CSS grid is much more simple to to implement but what we had when we had the the grid was first initially when we implemented the grid we had these big gaps so we would have you know one two three and then our second row of three wouldn't start till here so it looked okay for these cards but then for this card there is this big white space then Harshit was able to set a uniform height for these and that got rid of our gaps but then on cards like this we would have a huge white space within the card so what what masonry does and behind the scenes what's going on here is using some JavaScript to position these so this is not CSS positioning each one of these actually has a position I mean I can you can actually see it happening in the console let's see maybe try to get to the right spot here and okay I guess the the first card is not really that useful to look at because all right so let me let me make this a bit bigger see all can can see it and then it'll be it'll be really obvious what's going on behind the scenes in just a second so let's bring this over I'm looking right here at this this positioning so it's absolute position right now it's left four hundred and some four and twenty six pixels top zero so as we move you can see the pixels changing so that's three eighteen three fifty so and now we have our top change so the absolute positioning is constantly changing based on the screen the screen size so that's that's the difference there is the CSS grid of course is CSS based positioning and this is certainly it uses CSS right which we're saying positionabsolute left top those are CSS attributes but javascript is directly controlling those so anyway that's how you deal with masonry masonry can be a pain at times I know in previous projects we had implemented this with react before and it took a while to get that that was with project one it took it took a little while to get it working and I've tried to implement this with with some jQuery stuff before it's definitely it can be a pain at times especially if you have images to get the positioning correct you you need to be able to have everything get repositioned whenever the image is actually load there's a helper library for that as well but there's a lot of different things that could go when you're using this but I think the end result is is worth it and there's cool things you could do with this like like filtering to you know have things just switch around you know on the fly it looks nice there's different types of transitions that you could use so this there's different options so anyway really nice great work on that hard I really like that and you can see you know our ListView is still just regular ListView but when we go back to grid view much nicer so great that's great job and we should have the same thing here when we go to our categories as well right now we don't really have enough posts to be able to see you know the full grid in action here but very nice okay let me check my time all right so this I'm almost done with this 25 minutes so I'm just going to go into the live chat now and answer some of your questions so basically we've achieved what we met what we wanted to achieve we've successfully troubleshooted what was wrong with our auth and with our log in system and the problem ended up being just for some reason I can't connect to a remote database so we had to run it locally so everything seems to be working with that we're able to get this grid layout in and I guess we could merge that in right now as well since I have a minute left it'll only take a minute to merge so let's go ahead and and merge that while we're here so first let's do a git merge master all right we have a conflict all right this is cool I'm really glad we had a conflict ok hard saying to try the logout ok cool off shar the logout let me finish this merge and then we'll try that ok Harshit also wants to make sure that that it is known that to use materialized for masonry yeah I did see that that comment in your pool request so how should saying is a real pain yeah I do I appreciate all the work I mean I I know I've I've had a lot of pain in dealing with this as well both with react and with without react with with some javis a query based single page apps that I made before before I started streaming so I definitely appreciate all the work that went into that so let's um let's see oops trying to find oh here we go alright where's their merge conflict that it was in that CSS file was it not okay alright cool so here if you've never seen a conflict emerge conflict it can look different depending on what editor you're using but basically you're gonna have sections from each and then you're gonna have a section where it gets kind of telling you here's what we think it should look like and so you get to choose what you want so let's check out what's going on here so our head is going to be our current branch so our current branch is that masonry branch so whatever branch your own is the head and then our other branches our master branch so that's what we have currently on a master branch so probably what we want to do is keep whatever's in the master branch so yeah we don't want all this stuff so what we're gonna do then is use master ok so you won't always have that option it does depend on what you're doing with your or what kind of editor you're using my packages that you have so you may have to manually get rid of manually delete that but in this case we can just click use me and it handles it for us which is nice so now we have this padding right important I do believe we want to keep that but let's see oh no we do we need that we have it on body let me double check so let's double check in I guess I can just run this on the on my other screen let me double check quickly what we have here yes oops I need index that's CSS okay we are gonna keep that we are gonna keep this right let me check the live chat quickly Sebastian will know more than anyone whether or not we need to keep this so Sebastian if you're still with us in the live chat let me know I mean this is not really a big deal this is not hard to go back in and change this let's see we'll just we'll keep this in for now if we notice that something weird is happening with it we can always take it out but anyway now I've saved that and we can see if we go back in here we're gonna commit so let me double check and make sure ok was just with index it'll tell you what files have have conflicts so since it was just indexed on CSS we fix those conflicts let's go in here and get commit I'm gonna do a git commit I'm gonna put the commit message right in line here and say okay it's running our tests great okay awesome so the merge has worked now let's well let's quickly just double check and make sure everything's working I don't really have any reason to think that it wouldn't work but worth a shot and then we can also test out our logout as well all right looks good looks good great what else did we have this bad all right wonderful all right let's test our logout okay great we're able to log out and we'll just test a login great that was nice and quick we have our our token here and awesome loves us right back in wonderful okay now let's do get checkout master and we'll do a git merge H mace H masonry awesome now we have the masonry branch here and we can do a git master awesome so now everything should be uptodate we'll have all our pull requests merge for the bulletins react wonderful okay we do still have we have one issue open and there's certainly more that needs to be done so maybe I'll try to add some more issues in here so if anybody would like to work on them you can work on them if anybody needs to get those last few pull requests in before for hack tober fast to get your tshirt maybe I'll try to put in some some some of them are going to be more difficult some of the issues maybe you'll try to put in some easy ones if anybody's kind of new to coding but still wants to get the pull requests in also I still don't have all my pull requests in so if anybody has a project that you need some help with and would like me to open a pull request for your project let me know send me a link to your repository and let me know what need what you need work on so now that I've finished my class I may have a little extra time to work on stuff like that so I probably won't be able to like do anything really significant but you all helped me out so much it'd be cool if I could help you out with something as well all right so let me go through the live chat now and that'll be the last thing that we do let's see so if you have any questions please put them in the live chat now I'll do my best to answer all the questions if you don't have a question please consider sticking around and helping to answer some of the questions I'd love to have your expertise to help give the best answers we can to everybody that's that's asking questions but if you can't stick around you can always catch the Q&A session later in the recording and please join us again tomorrow should be around the same time today was a little later than normal but I like to stream around 2 p.m. Eastern Time we may will probably end up working on some UI stuff tomorrow I haven't decided for sure but maybe we'll work on some of that we've had some heavy backend stuff lately so it might be nice to switch it up do some some front end you know CSS work so but let me know if anybody as anything specifically they'd really like me to go over tomorrow let me know in the live chat right now or send me a message on Twitter and if if it's doable within the scope of the project I'd be more than happy to to steer the stream in that direction okay let me find where I left off there we are oh you know before I forget yesterday I had I think it was harsh it asked about freelancing and then I had someone on Twitter as well asked about freelancing so we'll see how much time the question/answer takes maybe I'll talk about it now but I've been thinking maybe I should do a video a short video and put it on my own YouTube channel about my experience as a freelancer and my advice to anybody that wants to be a freelance web developer so if you think you might be interested in that let me know if nobody's really interested maybe I won't take the time to do it but otherwise if you think it might be helpful for you I did freelance I was a freelance web developer for three years so and I still do freelancing on the side so I'm certainly not the best there is but I have a lot of you know experience about five years of experience so that at least I could give you some advice over the areas where I made mistakes in some of the areas where I was successful all right still I'm scrolling down looking for questions a lot of this section of live chat I was interacting a lot during the the coding so things that we've already talked about I'm just kind of skipping it over okay actually Rohan has a good comment here so previously we were talking about homebrew and I was trying to explain a little bit about what it does but I like what Rohan says here he says homebrew is a package manager for apps for mac just like NPM is for node packages so on Linux you would have apps and YUM so if you think of it like that I think that's definitely on the right track that'll make it easier if you've never done anything with homebrew basically the same thing does a very similar thing and then what is I forget the one that's for PHP but PHP has something similar okay rook asks if there's a Windows counterpart for homebrew Rowan says it's chocolaty okay that's awesome I've actually didn't know that I haven't really done anything on Windows for a few years now but when I did a lot of development on Windows I had no idea so that's that's awesome so for everyone on a Mac check out homebrew for as a package manager but if you're on a Windows machine check out chocolaty hug harsh it reminded me that my timer was not visible so sorry about that I always forget I just I gotta get used to putting it somewhere else I'm seeing all the horseshit trying to get my attention typing in in all caps so sorry for all the stress that my inattention cost you there I appreciate you being persistent in trying to get my attention though okay earlier I was checking I think I was checking on a different screen but I was mentioning local storage and cookies so I wanted to know where the where the login information was being stored so if you didn't if you didn't catch that I was able to log in on this tab and then this tab was still on the login screen and I just refreshed I was automatically logged in basically there's a cookie stored now currently the the live version of this that's a non react very uses local storage to accomplish the same thing basically to store user data so that the login session can persist so as long as you don't log out or clear your cookies then it should persist so actually not sure is if anyone has any opinion on which is better to use cookies or to use local storage let me know I'd be interested to see if there's if there's some good reason to use one or the other I know I believe cookies that have to be smaller so you have the opportunity to store more in local storage in this case we're not really storing that much so it shouldn't be an issue but if anyone's work with that or has any opinion on that please let me know okay Harshit earlier i was talking about how there might be an issue for for someone else to log in and Harshit said i i was setting up said you said that you need the franciscan needy you offguard i simply implemented it yeah yeah don't worry i'm not upset that you implemented it i'm actually really glad that you did that because that's exactly what we need for when this goes live I was just trying to think of an easy way for other people to be able to contribute to the project maybe without having to set up a database and everything because I still want this to be as beginnerfriendly as possible you know there's some there's some little things that people who are new could could contribute to the project but they may not be able to figure out I mean I did a whole database thing I needed your help to figure that out as well so I just wanted to try to think of some way to make it a bit easier so I'm thinking maybe maybe I could put something into where it checks whether it's in development mode or production and if it's in dev mode we just disabled the log in and then if it's in production then then it is enabled and then that might be the better way so we'll definitely still want to enable it and test it before we go live with it but when we're doing like UI work and things maybe we can just just disable that I know it's a tional II it's a pain like on the live version if I want to use I have authentication enabled all the time even if I'm running it locally and it's tough if I use like browser stack to test the browsers and browsers that don't have my local storage data so I have to log in I have another email sent and log in again on every different machine I want to be on if I want to test it on a phone or something like that so I end up having to log in quite a bit so it be cool if we came up with a simple way to disable the login for testing purposes so anyway I just don't want you to think that that was wrong to implement that that was perfect that was exactly what I wanted okay rooks asking what all those warnings actually mean the incorrect peer dependency yeah let's check that out but look at all these things all right let me read down and see if anybody else said anything and see okay I don't it looks like dragon hunter said I can RM RF node modules and then run yarn so would that get rid of this I'll try that out okay so actually this would be cool to run so if you end up having weird problems with your node modules I have done this in the past and it has fixed some of my problems it doesn't always but occasionally basically this is like completely wiping out all your node modules and reinstalling everything and starting from scratch let's do it it's not gonna hurt the project it's just going to take a couple minutes to get everything back but what you're using so we're going to use this RM RF oops RF do not use this unless you're really sure because what this is going to do RM is just remove right but this is gonna remove everything in a folder so all subfolders all files everything so only use this if you're really sure that you want everything to be gone alright this stuff does not go in the recycle bin this is gone like forever gone so having said that I know that I'm okay with my node modules being gone I've done this you know plenty of times so our node modules and when we when I run this everything's going to be gone and our node modules folder is gonna be gone so let's go CD right I can't I can't even get to that that that doesn't exist okay our node module so now we're gonna run yarn and know we're still getting the same errors okay so I guess I didn't fix it it's in Korea dependency hmm I don't really know what the issue is maybe if I updated all of our packages it might work I'm a hesitant to do that right now because but sometimes when you upgrade packages they break something if they're breaking changes within the packages so I'd rather not do that at the end of the day the end of a workday hum but let's just doublecheck everything still works it should work so let's refresh alright great still works see all right let's go back to the live chat oh cool dragon hunter says actually that grid is neat so a good job yeah definitely good job harsh it really like that okay rook said I just got an email from Codecademy that they teach grid now on their CSS court course doing that later get course first awesome yeah that that's the CSS grid is really good for a lot of things this is probably one of the very few use cases that I would want to go with something else just for this in particular CSS is it's good it's great it's always getting better but there's still no easy way to do something like this with CSS and be able to have as much control over layout as you could you know we're doing this with JavaScript okay John Hanson says grid so CSS grid has grid Auto flow row column row dense column dense which gives very tight fit and you can set min max on the rows and columns cool actually I would love to see an example of some something like this done with CSS grid if it's possible to do something that that truly looks like this if there's a pure CSS way to do it I'm I'm definitely open to it so I'm not aware at least the last time I tried to implement something like this which is normal CSS as far as I could tell with with researching it there was not a way to get this exact layout but maybe maybe something's happened since then with with CSS grid that allows it Blake says my droid is isn't displaying all my categories actually if you like if you're having trouble with with some of your files send me send me a link to your repo let me know what's going on I can take a look at it if you want me to harsh it says so so you now like password this NPM module I I don't have an opinion about it yet because I've only worked with it in terms of just reading the documentation to be able to understand what you did and try to troubleshoot so I don't know that I've used it enough to reasonably have an opinion about it but it's definitely working to do what we wanted to do in terms of the password let's login so I do like the results Harshit says will I get a tshirt this as I have 20 PRS yeah I'm for sure you have you have enough full requests just on this project alone I mean I'm assuming you did sign up for hack tober fest so assuming you signed up you'll definitely get to keep this shirt okay so on Hanson saying so in react to change state on an imported component on click go up the Dom to retrieve a key value then uses that key to array dot fine using the key to locate it and pull in the data I'm not sure I'm not really sure how that works behind the scenes so I'm not I don't know that I could comment enough on the mechanics of what is happening behind the scenes within react okay cool it looks like a few of you are interested in freelancing advice oh cool thanks Harsha I mentioned there's a package manager for PHP but I couldn't remember it was its composer all right that makes sense I am I was thinking it started with like a calm I was thinking compass but I knew it was and I was just thinking that because we used something called compass earlier at least we're going to use it so awesome it's called composer for PHP so for any p8 I know we have some PHP people that watch the stream so if you haven't already used a check out composer as a package manager for PHP oh cool and Zuber mentions that rails have gem so gems the package manager and for dotnet the package manager is nugget awesome thanks for that Zuber I don't know that I've seen you that much in the live chat commenting so I don't know if if you're new here to the chat are you just usually not able to comment in the live chat that frequently but anyway welcome and thanks for contributing okay in ass where do you find customers for freelance projects okay cool I'll answer like I said I think I'm going to do a video and in going more depth into this but I'll definitely answer this about freelancing right now so the questions where do you find customers for freelance projects so I'm just going to speak from my experience and and maybe try to give some advice some more general advice but for me I'll tell you I'll tell you what didn't work so I got I think I got one customer through my website through the contact form on my website only one ever now I'm sure that my website helped because people could go there first and check me out or you know whatever it probably did help but the contact form on my it was not really that useful I did sign up for several different freelancing sites so I think I did just call it freelancer maybe it was called freelancer so I did that one I did she was the other one they still send me messages all the time no I can't remember what it was okay so I basically did one where they send you potential customers and you can bid on the project so basically you have to buy like tokens to be able to bid on it I only got one customer from that and it was a really small customer I don't think I made more than $100 off of working with that customer so that wasn't great the same thing with the freelance website I didn't really have a great experience it seems like you have to to get projects you just have to undercut everybody else in terms of price so low that it's it's basically like working for free it takes a lot of work to get enough reputation on those things so I don't personally recommend that unless you really have nowhere else to go and you just want to get some work for your portfolio then you know go ahead and go to those freelance websites what works for me the most was personal connections and I know when I heard this when I was starting out freelancing I always I didn't want to hear that right because I want to just be able to sit at my computer and code and get customers but that's not really how it how it works freelancing is about selling yourself just as much as it's about coding so you have to be willing to talk to people and let them know what you do and you know be able to show them some of your projects basically to talk about how great you are and how great work you have so if you're not comfortable with that I would rethink freelancing or at least think of a different so here's what I did starting out that really helped me I found someone who was willing to do the work to find customers and then they would give me the projects to work on but they needed a gobetween between the customer and between me so I didn't have to handle contracts I didn't have to go to meetings with a customer I rarely had to speak on the phone with customers or email with them this person did all the work now the downside of that is that I made a lot less than I could have if I had done everything but it was nice because I got to focus all my energy on my time on just doing the work doing the coding so I was able to learn a lot more than I otherwise would have if I had to handle everything now through that I was able to build up my portfolio and focus on the coding and then I was able little by little to get some clients so at first maybe it was through family connections I just let my people in my family know you know aunts uncles cousins you know hey I'm working on this and then they would mention it to people that they knew so I got some work from that didn't make a ton of money off of it but I was still trying to build my portfolio I was able to through social media let people know what I was doing so I reached an even bigger audience of people that I still knew in real life and his friends with but then they could bring me connections so I had some of my best clients came from a connection of someone who was a former student of mine when I used to teach high school their boyfriend needed a website and then I did a website for their boyfriend their boyfriend's one of his best friends needed a website for their company saw what I did and then wanted me to work on their websites so I ended up getting into the New York City market through them even though I live far away from from New York City then through them the CEO of that company his his mom and dad runs several other companies in New York and I was able to do websites for them that ended up being one of my best clients I made the most money off of it was very very nice working relationship steady income the biggest client I ever had in terms of money I got because through social media someone who my wife went to college with worked for a company and her father was the CEO of the company found out through my wife that I did websites because she had just asked on social media hey does anybody know anything about websites my wife is able to say yeah got a client from that that was when I did that website and finally finished it and got paid that increased my income by 25% that year just from that one website so basically my point is my best clients came from personal connections sometimes I didn't actually know the people but people I knew knew those people so like I said maybe you might be comfortable this maybe you won't but what you really should be doing if you want to make freelancing work is talking about what you do to the people around you you don't have to be annoying about it you don't have to only talk about that but make sure that everybody on social media knows who you are and what you can do make sure that all your friends and family know what you can do and that's going to be your best clients if you want to advertise otherwise so I did paid ads on on Facebook on Twitter on LinkedIn Google Ads I did all those different ads I did not get customers from those ads was it was a good experience I learned how to use all this products and be able to advise clients on on how to use them search engine optimization it helped to get my website up to you know the first page of Google near the top for my local area but my best clients weren't from the local area anyway so that really wasn't it wasn't a big deal so all those things are good because clients will expect you to have them they'll expect you to have good SEO they'll expect you to have you know a good presence on social media and stuff and if you don't have that they might start to doubt well like does this person really know what they're doing they can't even manage their own website and brand so you have to do those things but don't expect that those things are going to bring you in a ton of clients maybe if you were wellknown enough at some point it would help but at first personal connections are where it's at so I went on for a long time about that sorry but it's really important the other option that you have I mentioned I found someone who is willing to be the gobetween between the clients and I there are services that do that as well if you can't find a personal connection that would want to do that for you so top towel is an organization that you you take a series of tests so that they know that you're a good developer and then they set you up with clients they handle all the contracts with clients they're the ones that pay you directly the clients don't pay you directly so it cuts down on a lot of that stuff that is not always easy to deal with right if you I've had situations where clients didn't pay me when they were supposed to pay me and it can be a mess and it really is stressful when you're counting on income for your family and you know a company is not paying you so that's a tough situation that's another thing I do recommend always always have a contract I I worked without contracts for a long time and I never had problems and I thought it was fine until somebody decided not to pay me and after that I never did work without a contract so you might be able to get lucky for a while I got lucky with it for like two years but then I had a client not pay me and it just it took forever to get paid luckily I did finally get paid but months after I was supposed to receive a payment so anyway I know I just threw a lot at you hopefully I'll have some time to put that in a more organized format in a video at some point but let me know if you have any other questions let me know maybe it'll be good I can write all the questions down and then try to make sure I answer them in my video Blake asks what should I use for wireframing on Windows for free um hmm I'm not sure of Windows what does the thing Adobe came out is it called Adobe XD it was something like that but I don't know if it was free it might have just been free when you they were testing it so I'm not sure I don't have anything that I use for Windows so I don't know of anything but if anyone else knows of anything good and free to do wireframes on Windows please put that in the lab chat now okay John Hanson says I think the big guys like Google are pushing for developers to use local storage dragon on it says go for local storage or local forage module okay cool yeah maybe we'll maybe we'll check into that it's switching it over to local storage Harshit says it would definitely be harder to set that up so we'll check it out maybe we'll see how difficult it will be if it'll be worth it to set it up I'm for this project I'm not worried one way or the other if we're gonna switch it over I would want to do it because if that's the the best practice to do then I think it would be cool to do that on the stream just to show this is how we should do things but otherwise I think cookies will be more than adequate for this use case rohan says the it's quite the irony because most of google services rely heavily on cookies most don't even touch local stores yeah you're right actually that's definitely true rook says Google is weird like that they don't even use angular from what I've heard oh yeah I don't I don't know I usually check with which sites are made out of I haven't done that for a while with Google Sites everyone says using Google API is it's quite common that you can see them say to do the opposite of what they usually say you would usually do really frustrating but that's Google they use angular across many things now okay so dragon hunter says HTTP only cookies are not vulnerable to XSS attacks crosssite scripting attacks but to CSRF attacks so the session could be hijacked okay actually to be honest with you for this project the data is not really sensitive most of the data that ends up in the bulletin is also publicly available through other channels so I'm not that worried about it to be honest with you I never thought that this bulletin should have to be password protected that was a decision made higher up and I fought against it but I lost so I'm not super worried about the security in terms of if somebody really wants to find out you know the what's going on in the bulletin like they're gonna know the dates of when you can go get training on PowerPoint and they're gonna they're going to know what open positions that we have at the University which you can already find out on the main website they're gonna see the chapel's schedule for when they're there are mass times which you can already see on the main web site so there are very few things it I would argue there's pretty much nothing that should that couldn't be public knowledge but anyway I was told that an easy password protected so that's what I'm going to do and I'm gonna provide a reasonable level of security but I'm not going to kind of over engineer this so that we're protected from all everything that could possibly happen if at some point we end up working with more sensitive data then definitely yes I think we should be as safe as we can but I think it potentially could be a waste of a waste of our time to really try to you know make this solid and you know airtight and no one can get in Harshit says I remember some guy named a folder it's the the little Tod icon and and he did RM RF tilde and his whole date it was wiped yeah yeah that you could literally wipe out everything on your hard drive with RM RF so like don't use it unless you for sure know what's going on dragon under says to choose between CSRF and XSS definitely take measures about XSS and forget about CSRF soar local storage all the way okay rook says I heard some guys on the syntax podcast talking about how scary our MRF is they suggest using something called trash it's on brew okay cool oh maybe I'll look into that right now I I rarely use RM RF when I do use it obviously like I I'm very careful about it but if I find myself having to use it more often might not be a bad idea to switch to something a little safer dragon hunter says is there a yarn lock like npm yeah yes there is a yarn lock file and then in a new version of NPM there's the equivalent file ok harsh it's saying basically since I'm using react 16 many packages are not updated that so that's that's probably why I'm getting the warnings okay dragon owner says our MRF node modules works with NPM it seems to not with yarn yeah I mean I guess if you really wanted to get rid of it you should get rid of your yarn lock file too so you could R get rid all the node modules and your yarn lock and then you could reinstall the from that way if you really wanted it to be totally clean slate all Roland says you could also use the force flag to force reinstall of all node packages all right good to know thanks your honor okay I think I think John Hanson is is explaining more is his question earlier about react like moving up to get I don't remember exactly what it was but he's saying vanilla Jas allows easily moving up and down the Dom to create comparison statement is true Falls to render an object I'm not sure if it's smart to do the same in react okay I'm not sure I might need to see a use case to give a decent answer to that so anyway so John if you if you have a use case then maybe I could I could give an opinion on that okay world's us how much would you charge or get for an average project okay I'm going to be I'm going to be completely honest here about what I charge and what I get so I'm not going to name names of clients and they may not want people to know what they what I get paid but I'll try to be vague about that but I'll tell you so when I started out five years ago I started out working getting work from someone else for $10 an hour so which is a little bit crazy right I had two kids at the time and I've didn't pay $10 an hour or working less than full time doing this web work but the deal was basically the guy he knew me personally but he had no proof of my skills he just knew that back in high school I was smart and I was into technology stuff and he knew he could trust me so started me out and would say like hey I'll pay you $10 an hour but what I'll do is you know if you have a project that I need you to work on and you don't know how to do it I'll say you know take two hours I'll pay you for two hours to learn it and then do it right so I was able to learn a lot so I considered it like an internship only a paid internship which it really was kind of like that I learned a lot now what a you did say as well is that every slide on three months or something I'd be up for a race so I ended up making more than that quickly now along the way I moved up certainly whenever I got my own clients I would charge more I got to the point where one of my last projects that I worked on I ended up I did a react site that pooled data in from the WordPress API very similar to what we did on one of that we worked on it was actually it was almost identical in terms of the structure of the project as project one which was the catechetical Institute website and this project I did and I believe I made eleven thousand seven hundred dollars something like that somewhere around so like around twelve hundred dollars or twelve thousand dollars for that website so there was a whole range of stepping up what I would charge people and then it did sometimes depend on who I was doing the work for a nonprofit occasionally I would do work for free for a nonprofit if I really wanted to Baal volunteer or I would at least I would give a discount sometimes if you know someone that was family or friend wanted something give him a discount but in general when you're freelancing it's always best to charge more than you think it's really worth because you have to consider more than just the project at hand because there's going to be over it so there's going to be meetings with the client phone calls you know Skype you know video conferencing there's going to be work on you getting a contract made and discussing that getting that sign you're gonna have to spend time sending bills making sure your client actually sends the bills so reminding them about that potentially even having disputes over billing there's going to be all this extra stuff then you have to worry about doing your taxes there's all this other stuff that's involved that you need to account for in the price so you're always going to end up charging more as a freelancer then you'd be willing to accept as a salary if you are on somebody's payroll and then don't forget about insurance as well health insurance you know sometimes your employer would cover that but now you are your own employer so always factoring more at this point in my with my work I would probably depends on the project potentially if it was some project I was really passionate about maybe I would I would do it for less but I wouldn't even consider doing work for anyone right now for less than $100 an hour if I was going hourly if we're talking a flat rate I mean I don't know that it would be worth my time to work on anything for less than like $5,000 I just wouldn't want to I just wouldn't want to deal with the whole process of building trust with a client and contracts and billing and all that in taxes unless I was making a decent chunk of money like I said it depends on the project if something I really wanted to work on then I would probably be willing to do less if something happened and I really needed money I'd probably be willing to do less but that's where I'm at right now I have income coming in that I'm able to pay my bills so I'm in a different position if I was at a point where I really needed to build up my portfolio I'd probably be willing to work for Less also it depends on where you're at if I lived in San Francisco I would I would never work for that little I would work one even more money because the cost of living is so much more I happen to live in the part of the United States where the cost of living is pretty low the area I live is economically depressed so I can I can charge less people in big cities would obviously want to charge more and then depending on what country you're from I it depends I don't know what you know the economies could be entirely different so anyway I could you know keep that in mind especially if your area like my area is economically depressed try to build up your client base outside that area for me I ended up building a client base in New York City I actually also had a client that she was based in Hawaii but she traveled quite a bit so I don't know how often she actually lived in Hawaii but those clients ended up being the most profitable because they for their market my prices seem like really good prayer for them for me I'd make from them more than anybody else was willing to pay in my local area so it was a great deal for both of us you know they were getting a better deal than they could get in their area and so was I so those kind of seek out those kind of deals and then you know you and the client can both be really happy about about what you're making hopefully that helped the original question was how much you charge or get for an average product project so that was probably way more than you wanted from that question but I hope it it helped you out at least some Blake as our vem and Emax considered code editors slash IDs I think the minimax would fall under the code editor category I don't think they're considered IDs I don't use them though I mean I've tried out vim but I don't actively use them so I don't know maybe for some I know there are some people who watch a stream that do use them so please correct me if I'm wrong about that okay harsh it's asking a question about a specific piece of code so let me let me get this on the screen okay let me pull this over here all right so let's check this code out so Harsha's question is okay so she's a verified label I have set up GPG keys what do you think about this actually I've never used these before so let me see okay cool so I I mean I think that's cool that's fine to do what's the what's the main benefit of the GPG key well okay so earlier I mentioned Adobe XD I didn't I didn't know what the status of that was so it seems like the beta version is is still free so if I guess if you can get ahold of the beta version then then you could use it John Hanson says true Jesse talking about what you do and know is a great selling strategy I've had offers to build sites I've had to turn down as I've got my job beside some websites or beyond my skills yeah actually that that reminds me is well if even if you know other developers and get to talk to them they may send you projects like I know I've had people ask me about doing websites for them and I've just been too busy at the time and so I've passed those projects along to other developers that I know and sometimes it works out really well for those developers so if you get to know other developers and let them know that you're you're open annoying work if they trust you and they've seen what you can do and they know it's good work then they probably will have no problem sending people to you so that's that's another good way to find work heart should ask if I've installed compass not yet it finished downloading I didn't saw at the but Harsha says you should see the database structure there ok cool off to check it out let's see if this bulletin was a real project how much would you have charged okay let me think about this the bulletin so the bulletin site is basically a blog site right it's a blog site it's set up WordPress if two different servers to set up probably not going to run load balancing it's not that important that it needs it I set up the SSL now the complicated thing I guess is the login but we may even have more to login then we currently have depending on on what happens with the IT department here let's see we have custom stuff done on the WordPress end so there is going to be custom post types who are already running the graph QL plugin so it's a significant project I mean this this would be this project I'm thinking right now obviously is depending on the organization and and fact there's you know such as my time and things like that but I'm thinking this website would probably end up being you know more closer to like a ten thousand dollar site so our baby set that as a minimum of 10,000 dollar site I mean that's just kind of off the top of my head if I was really gonna price this out I would I would sit down and so like you know I do with my Trello boards and I break things down if I was really gonna give an estimate I would break all the work down like that estimate how long I take everything factoring in the obviously delays that normally happen and the other stuff that you need to do on a project so but a very loose estimate would probably be I probably wouldn't do it for less than than 10,000 so that would I mean and that also includes like you know I'm doing this for clients so there would be rigorous testing there would be training involved I would probably do training videos and some inperson training for whoever is going to be you know inputting the data so it's not necessarily just the development I would include that in the cost as well but anyway that's what I would charge now but they said it does really make a difference there are times when if I'm really busy and someone wants me to do a website I I'll quote them something more than I normally would because my time is more scarce therefore it's more valuable to me so to make it worth my while to work on that project which basically means for me is I'm not gonna see my family while I'm doing that work right so so for me it's I guess there's two there's two sides to the pricing is how much value can you bring to the client which is important because that's what they care about but then there's also how much do you value your own time which is also important because that's what you care about so you need to think about both things and as long as what you value your time to be corresponds roughly to what they think the value you're gonna bring to them through your website is going to be then everybody's happy right so you just gotta meet up you have to find clients that kind of match up with with that so I mean obviously when you're thinking about how much you're gonna charge like you do think about your own experience and your skills as well but because that will help you to convince people that you're worth that much anyway hopefully that helps I don't know how much would you all charge where you're from your area and your skill set what do you think so if anybody has any estimates I know it's really hard to make estimates right on the spot but if anybody has estimates about what it would be like in your area of the world in terms of price let me know I'm really interested to hear that okay so the GPG code just actually verifies that that's really the person that says it is okay cool that's what I figured I just kind of want to know if there was some other reason so yeah I like that that's cool dragon owner said you should do some podcasting you sound like an authority figure I don't know about that I don't actually have any authority I guess my if I have authority it would only be if if people value what I say that would be the only authority that I that I would have but I have experience though so for whatever that's worth like I can definitely give that michail says hey Jesse watching project 2 day 2 now and saw that you went live not really have a chance to watch online but thanks make good work keep it up Oh awesome thanks for stopping and in saying that I really appreciate that and hopefully you can join us live at some point and let me know what you think or any questions that you have we're suggestions but anyway yeah thanks again Blake says $10,000 as well Harshit says you know $10,000 is a year income in India I didn't know that but that's that's cool to know world says it used graph q oh and react yeah I mean think about I think that's an important point to remember a world sang use graph QL and reacts like a client might not necessarily know what graph QL and react is or even care but as a developer like we know the value in that that reacting graph QL are really the technologies that are I don't want to say emerging because Reax been around for a while and graph heels been around for a while but in terms of like very widespread adoption you know the vast majority of the internet is still jQuery territory right I mean as much as developers you know kind of want to stay away from it realistically it's used on a huge portion of the internet right so some of these newer technologies that aren't really new to us because we're developers but in the grand scheme of things in terms of how much they're really used on the internet they they are pretty new they're pretty cutting edge so the value of being able to use those technologies I think warrants a higher price tag now you may have trouble convincing the average person the average client of why this is important for their site how will this will help their site to be better right so while for a project like this maybe it would be hard to find a client who's willing to see the value in this and want to pay that much so but if I were to do a site that had everything that we're doing using all the technology that we're using I would want to charge at least $10,000 so there's definitely that do I think I could find a client locally that would pay ten thousand no not in my local area could I find one somewhere else definitely I've no doubt about it I've I personally have have known I know what companies have paid for websites I've worked on those websites as a subcontractor I know so I I know enough to know that there are a lot of companies out there government organizations and institutions that are willing to pay an obscene amount of money for products that aren't even really that good so if you're starting out $10,000 seems like a lot especially if you're dealing with like local small businesses but when you get to another level of client which should be the goal he really want to make money when you get up there to the larger organizations ten thousand dollars is nothing to them you know you're they're dealing with budgets of millions of dollars so if they're gonna they're gonna drop a hundred thousand dollars on a website and budget that out and saying okay we're gonna do a website every three or four years we're gonna get an update a hundred thousand for this you know so it you know it breaks down to you know maybe 20,000 a year 25,000 a year and they're gonna think that's not really a big deal right that doesn't even cover our electric bills you know they're they're gonna think in terms of I'm gonna spend twenty five thousand dollars a year on a website I buy one truck for my company and it's probably gonna cost me $20,000 $25,000 right and they're mine like you got to put it to them like that right the website is the public face of a business how much do people spend on building a building for their business and making it look nice millions right I'm have homes that are in the millions of dollars so a business to build their actual physical business will think nothing about spending millions on it their website they're going to be able to reach more people so put in terms like that of how important it is ten thousand dollars is nothing I can come out with ten thousand dollars to some companies and they would laugh at me and say no because they're thinking the work that this guy's doing must be terrible if he thinks he can only get ten thousand dollars off of this right so when you when you're thinking about things like that don't get discouraged try to think in terms of what what are the budgets for these companies you know now if you're dealing with a really small business that has three employees and stuff yeah don't walk her in and say I'm gonna build your website and it's gonna cost ten thousand dollars they're gonna say you got to be kidding me like my rent every month is less than a thousand dollars I'm not going to pay you ten thousand dollars for a website because potentially that could be around here where I live that's really it's reasonable as some people have really low rents for their buildings so because the area is so depressed and other areas the United States that's kind of ridiculous but anyway just try to think like I mean I guess I'm trying to like give you a little pep talk at least to keep your mind open to the reality of what businesses spend and how they're thinking and what they are already paying for products so don't sell yourself short just because something might seem easy right to us building this there have been some there's been some trouble right there's been some hard things right that grid layout that masonry layout was a pain for Harshit to put in and the the author the whole authorization login system was really impressive and that took some time but really for us this seems like oh no big deal we do this every day but there's not a whole lot of people in the world that can this kind of thing and and do it professionally and be trustworthy and have it work and be able to handle a lot of people that there's value in that especially yeah big businesses see value in that so don't sell yourself short anyway I keep going off on these big tangents I need to just make this freelancing video and and then direct you all to that or my live streams are gonna end up being three hours long every day okay okay so for this same project rollin is saying in India if he were to try to sell the same project he would charge about three thousand five hundred US dollars equivalent now in India Rowland says there really isn't much demand for webpages or services here in India small businesses will go for the cheapest bidder and large companies have their own team or will contract with the whole team John Hanson says great advice awesome thanks for that yeah I mean hopefully the worst the client can say if you come out with a really outrageous offer that's our offer that seems outrageous to them you know a quote for a price the worst they can do is say no but you know so what they say no maybe you don't really want to work for a company that doesn't value what you do enough to pay you would what the work is really worth so so you just don't be afraid it's a bad path to go down to constantly be apprehensive about what a client's gonna think is reasonable and try to always undercut yourself because you go down that path and where does it stop you end up doing quality work for less money than you should and then you get the type of client who doesn't value your work so even though you know you're giving them a great deal they don't understand that and that's not really the type of client you want to be involved with I've been there I've been involved with that type of client you're giving them a great deal and and they're trying and then at the end of the day what they do is they try to you know if if you're saving them a thousand dollars off of what they would pay they're still gonna try to squeeze out you know an extra hundred dollars off you in the end and said well I'm not paying for this because something's off with it right that's what that's what ends up happening so just go for good quality clients that are willing to pay with something's worth and you'll be much happier if you have to take the the cheaper stuff to build your portfolio up there's nothing wrong with that if you have to take some of that stuff to pay the bills and take care of your family there's nothing wrong with that I've been there and I've done that but when you get to a point where you're comfortable enough with your finances that you can afford to take some risks go for the bigger clients and then once you get there and get those clients in your portfolio it'll be a lot easier uh okay let's see Blake says thanks did you see the link for the repo I did not see the link for the repo did you paste them in live chat I missed it if you could paste it again that'd be great I could try to go back through and look for it but it'll be more of a sure thing if you could paste it again Oh Harshit says yes you tried doing UI for emails tomorrow if you really want me to do you eyes for email I will do that but for those of you that have worked on UI for emails you understand where I'm coming from I'm sure if you haven't you'll see it's not it's not the easiest thing but I'll do it if that's what if this what you all want to see okay cool thanks Blake I got the URL now all right haha world says companies aren't apprehensive in selling you a smartphone for a thousand dollars yeah you're absolutely right I mean think about think about what companies expect you all to pay for their services and then you know maybe it'll make it easier for you to to charge them more all right so a Blake Blake let me know what in particular you want me to check out on this on this repo and I'll try to check it out and you can you don't have to tell me now if you want to make an issue on the repo then we could like we could talk about it you know in the comments of that issue if you want however you want to do it okay well I'm to the end of the live chat now I think we had a great chat we probably spent more time talking than we did with coding but today I feel like is the first time in a while that we accomplished everything that we wanted to accomplish actually a little bit more I didn't even expect to do the masonry layout and get that all merged in so we actually accomplished even more I know I ended up talking a lot so sorry if it was too much but I hope I helped some of you out and sharing my experiences with with freelancing but this dream has been really long and I'm actually like really hot and sweating right now because it's all in my office I didn't want to turn the fan on and mess up the audio so I've got to get a drink and get out of this office my wife just called me too so I'm gonna see what she needs and I'll be back tomorrow thank you so much for all your help Harshit especially thank you in Sebastian for your pool requests you all have been great and I mean Harshit I knew you're talking about freelancing stuff and you're still a student and you're young so that makes it hard but you have skills you definitely have skills so you just need the right connections and I think you'll be fine and in terms of doing work right now though when you're young this is a great opportunity to study and work on those side projects that you really really want to if you need the money I totally understand if you got to take some projects but otherwise I wouldn't worry about freelancing so much right now I would worry I would try to take advantage of this time in your life to work on things that you really want to work on because once you start working for clients you don't have the same amount of freedom like you could now so but anyway I think you have a lot of talent and I think so many of you in the live chat and the watch the shows have so much talent I'm always impressed with with which you all show me so anyway thank you and I will be back tomorrow so until then have a great day
