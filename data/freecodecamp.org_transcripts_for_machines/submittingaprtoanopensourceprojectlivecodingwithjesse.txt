hey everybody it's Jesse and uh thanks for uh joining me today uh so I'm going to do something a little bit different so normally I work on a project uh that I'm I'm doing for work so but today I'm going to contribute to someone else's project so if you watch yesterday uh then you you'll know what I'm talking about if you didn't watch I'll kind of explain how I got to this point uh so yesterday I was trying to set up click tracking for Google analytics and I was already using something called uh react GA so it was uh in npm uh module that made it easier for you to use Google analytics and re react but when I finally got it I had some other unrelated problems during yesterday's stream but when I finally got it working and I went to click the link I wanted it to open in a new tab but it was blocked the browser treated it as a popup and blocked it by default so that's not what I wanted so I had to end the stream right when uh I found that error or I should say uh you all in the live chat found the error as well I think before me uh but I didn't have time to fix it right then during the stream so later on after I had a really really long meeting I found the answer and um or I at least got on the right track to the answer and so what I did is I made a component uh to use that was kind of like a wrapper around what react GA was already providing and now it works so I'll show you the component first and then I'm going to take you through the process the whole process of forking the react G repository uh making the changes and then submitting a pool request so I have no idea if the pool request will get uh merged in or not but but this this does work I tested it out so uh hopefully we can get everything merged in so I thought I had this up I guess I don't but here's the component okay so I will say the idea for this I I got from an issue that was already open so there are several issues open about this I think I found three of them uh that were all about the same issue so I'm going to I'm actually going to show you just so that you could see kind of the difference here so a Acom in April uh was able to do this and this ended up working okay it worked for for Acom it worked for this guy and it worked for me and uh I guess some other people too because it got four thumbs up one of those is my thumbs up so he did this I copied this and tried to use it and it didn't work now I'm sure it was probably something I was doing that it didn't work because it worked for these other people so I probably somehow messed it up but what I did then to get it to work for me was I I kind of combined what was done in another component so the layout component that I had have and um this this was brought in from a uh pool request and I can't remember who exactly did this this P I submitted the pull request for this one but uh I I thought you know what this layout component is doing a similar thing in terms of you know what it's bringing in and what it's outputting as to what I want to do so I basically took the structure of this layout component and I combined it with what was going on basically in in this part here and I made a new component uh so the combination of those two components works and this is what it does basically is I as an input it takes in a two which is basically your atref that You' normally put on a link it takes a label this is what's going to show up in Google analytics uh and then it takes you know whatever other props you put on there so like your title tag you normally put on a link or any classes that you want to put on there and that all gets in in here right so what gets outputed then is a regular link with all your props your href which is the value for two it says Target blank all by default and then it has this click Handler so on click it runs this and this is what's going to log the event as a click and send it to Google analytics okay so when done like this it behaves properly and it it opens it in another window and I'll show you just just to give you some proof that it's actually working so I push this to the reposit or to the live site and I click it and there it opens in another window and and I'm not going to go through showing it in Google analytics but it does show up in Google analytics and we'll inspect it I'll just just want to show you what it looks like here if you can't already guess you see what gets oops too big what gets put out here is an a tag looks like a normal a tag with the exception of this you know react ID but I mean that's normal for react uh so that's the the change that I want to submit basically I'm going to submit a new component that's going to be just for the situation where someone wants to track an outbound link and they want that link to open in a new window and so that's it's it's going to be pretty straightforward in in terms of a a pull request I'm not going to actually even change anything that's already there I'm just going to add one extra component so we shouldn't have any conflicts or anything like that so uh it'll be if if the maintainers of that repository want to bring it in it should be pretty easy for them to bring it in I know there's there's some style differences I noticed between what I did here and what they're doing so aside from that we can probably use this as is the only difference is I think I'm going to change the name I just used the name from uh that issue and uh but I'm going to change the name to make it more obvious that this is just for links that you want to open in a new window all right so since I've given the introduction here I'm going to check out the live chat and uh see who's here and who's saying hi um hey everyone a lot of people saying I okay so someone asked PR is a pool request so we had uh that's been explained in the live chat yeah so I didn't want the title to be really really long so I did abbreviate PR if you're not familiar with that that's pool request and that's what you it's called when you submit uh a change to someone's uh project on GitHub all right uh La Xavier says I'm going to watch this later at higher speed man sounds too bored for me do I really sound bored uh actually I think I do sometimes I I don't usually listen to my videos but occasionally I do and I do think I sound bored sometimes so I actually try to like have caffeine and stuff beforehand so that I'm a little bit more awake but um I don't know I'm normally kind of really laid back so it's hard to it's hard to put on the ACT that I'm upbeat but I'll I'll do my best um okay so I think um I think I've gotten through everything in the live chat all right well actually there's one question is free code cam good enough to help me change my field uh so har me asked that um free code Camp's a good start and I know people that have done free code camp and then gotten jobs so if you want to be a web developer free code Camp is really good for that if you want to go into anything else uh in in the field you know if you want to develop I don't know like desktop apps I mean with I realize that you can use things other things like electron or react native to develop uh desktop and and uh mobile apps but basically it kind of depends on what you want to do uh but you could I would supplement it though I mean it's always good to supplement depending on what particular project you're working on at the time so if anyone else has any advice for har meat about uh whether or not free code Camp is good enough to get the the learning he needs to change his field uh go ahead and put it in the live chat or in the comments to the video later on uh I personally have used a lot of other resources but it might be helpful if somebody if you've mainly used free code camp and been able to get a job with that then you're probably the person that harate uh needs to talk to all right here's another question about pool requests from Zeal so I'm going to answer this because this really does it's pertinent to the topic today it says why is it referred to as a pull request when you are pushing up to fb's repo I don't know what FB is but uh is it because the repo owner is pulling your code yeah basically uh is you're requesting that the owner of the repo pull your code in yeah so it's it's from the perspective of the repo owner so from your perspective you're pushing code right but from the repo owner perspective they're pulling it so you're asking them requesting that they pull the code in oh okay Z said FB was Facebook yeah so I'm actually uh let me show you the repo I've linked to it in the description as well so here's the repo that I'm going to be pushing through uh and this is what we worked with yesterday as well so this this is not as far as I know this is not from Facebook I mean I potentially could be mistaken I think it's uh unrelated to the official you know react project from Facebook let me see the contributors are yeah I don't know I'm not seeing I don't see anybody in here that I usually see with uh with Facebook's official react stuff so um yeah so I don't know I think this is an unrelated uh repository so anyway let's get to it um first thing we're going to do is we're going to Fork the repo so I'm going to Fork it to my account while I'm waiting for this I'll let you know I did start that react uh course that I was talking to you all about yesterday the uh Udacity Nano degree uh for react so I started it I it went through it only started for me an hour an hour ago uh so I only did a little bit just to check it out so far it's cool it was all just introductory stuff but hopefully it ends up being a good course I'll give if you're interested I'll give some updates and then maybe you you all can decide whether or not it's worth it I've maybe one of you would like to take it as well okay so now we have a fork so you can see this is my GitHub uh account but then I have this okay so I mean this is basic stuff but if there's anyone watching that's not really familiar with Git or GitHub then I'm going to kind of go over each step so if you're really Advanced with with Git uh and GitHub then this might be a little bit basic uh at least at first for you uh might not be that exciting but I don't want to leave anybody behind so I'm going to try to be as detailed as I can okay so now we want to clone this repo so I'm going to copy this I'm going to bring over my terminal cuz that's what we're going to work in it first all right so let me open up let's make this bigger and we need to go into projects so I I keep everything everything I'm working on mostly is in my projects folder so you can see there's all all this stuff in here so once I'm in the projects folder I can type in get clone and then I'll paste that in uh since I have SSH key set up this will work otherwise you can use the uh https so you can click that use the https I think you need if you do it that way I think you need a password I haven't done it that way in so long I can't remember but um that's what you would use if you didn't have your keys set up already all right so let's clone that must be pretty small that was that was super fast so now if we check out our folders now we have react GA so let's go into it and you can see we have when for at least for my terminal I have it set so when I'm in a folder that's a get repository it shows me what branch I'm on SO we're in the master Branch I think that's the only Branch I'm going to check though yep Master Branch the only Branch what we want to do is make another Branch normally uh correct me if I'm wrong I don't have a ton of experience with this but normally you don't want to push changes on a master Branch right you want to create another branch and then submit that is your pool request um I just saw there's some activity in the live chat I'm just going to check back really quick I want try to keep up with the live chat today since yesterday I ran out of time and I didn't get to everyone's questions and I I really feel bad about that uh because I I like to be able to address you know all the questions okay uh um Zan Zan Zano is asking about the react course said $400 or something right the react Nano degree uh yeah I think it was 500 so it's not cheap uh I think as I said yesterday I I've said in the past before like I've I have never spent more than $30 like total in the last however many years I've been doing this on educational stuff for you know for learning how to be a developer um because there's so many great free resources but I really want to get better with react there's a lot of projects that I know I'm going to be working on coming up within the next year that I'm going to use react for so I decided like I'm just going to go for it and then the fact that I spent $500 on it is going to keep me it's going to get make me more dedicated I guess right so uh whenever I feel like oh I'm just I'm not I'm not going to do the work I'm going to put it off I'm too busy I'll think in the back of my mind like dude you spent $500 on this you better better not waste it so it's kind of like motivation for me all right so let's go back back to here so we're going to make a branch get branch and trying to think what I should name the branch um I'm going to say fix outbound fix outbound link does that sound all right if anybody thinks for some reason that the name for that branch is not good at all let me know I can just make a new Branch uh but I think that basically explains it uh so now I'm going to open this and Adam and this is totally unrehearsed so if you've watched before you know that it's un rehearsed because I mess up quite a bit uh but if I rehearsed it beforehand and I still messed up this much that would be kind of sad uh but if you're just watching for the first time this is all unrehearsed so um so this is the first time I'm I'm looking through this code I checked that a little bit on GitHub but uh basically we're going to be working I guess in this folder um test component yeah the only thing I'm I'm not sure about is what the test folder is because I'm no good I don't know what they're using for testing this might be the biggest problem here is writing tests so oh we'll see if anybody is recognizes what's going on here and uh can help me out I would appreciate that but otherwise let's just go to it let's make our component our new component and uh we got to figure out what to call call it so maybe it's definitely it's it's an outbound it's outbound link but we're opening it in new window I kind of want to call this component outbound Link new window I think that's too long but I don't know I've actually I remember reading something or seeing a video somewhere where some of the component names that were used uh for Facebook for building Facebook actually really long so I guess it's not terrible to do that uh so let's do that we'll call it outbound Link new new window so where's my sorry I got find my my terminal here um touch component oh no Source component and I'm going to call this outbound want to make sure yeah they are capitalizing that outbound Link new window Js Okay cool so now we've made that let's go in here I can get rid of these welcome screens uh I am going to take my code from here that I showed you a few minutes ago I'm going to pull it onto my other screen so that I can just pull pull the code over so first thing I'm going to do is just I guess I can copy and paste all of it cuz we're not really changing much so I don't know if I really ought to leave this in or not but I'll leave that up to the maintainers of the repo so that I just always like to uh give credit to where I get the ideas from so what all we need to change is I believe this name here right I think that's the only place place for using it yeah so that's it outlink new window out Link new window okay great so that's it that's all we need to change I'm going to save that and now let's go back and commit this change yep all right so add just going to add that and our k s is going to be add here we go all right so now we need to push this so we're going to go get push origin and what do we call this oh no did I I made the change on Master I'm going to look at the live chat and I'm sure you all have already caught that and uh have yeah you guys caught me oh man how long ago wow yeah it was like five minutes ago at least you all caught me all right so Shoot actually I'm gonna before I mess it up further I'm going to ask there's either two two things I could do one could I I haven't committed this change yet can I just remove what I added and not committed at all uh would that be the best way to do it or um does it even matter what I do to master when I go to submit the pool request I can just submit the one branch right like I could just do this go ahead with my commit copy it over to the other branch and then only submit that Branch correct let me uh let me see if I were to okay so um for everyone watching this later on I was just waiting for responses in the live chat here uh so create the branch from there but before just delete the old one okay so um yeah so I'll just commit these changes create a new Branch delete the Old Branch or flip that order but basically yeah that's what I'm gonna do okay oh wait and I did for some reason I thought I didn't actually commit it yet but I I did so sorry I'm sure you all were thinking like that I was crazy but all right so actually what what's the command for delete Branch it's just D I can I can do just SD okay cool I haven't had to delete a branch in so long I don't even remember uh get uh what did we call that one fix okay now just make a new Branch cool just to double check all right we switch there all this is on the branch okay we're good all right so now let's push that get push origin fix I found like Okay cool so now if we look at our repo so we should have another Branch cool so we have this branch and actually let me um let me pull up let me pull up github's instructions for submitting a pool request because I do want to show you the right way to do this so in instead of me fumbling around with it I mean it's not that hard you could probably figure it out but let's just do it the uh the way described in the GitHub help pages so all right so let's go to the original Repository we're going to go to new pool request I'm going to make this a little bit bigger for youall especially if someone's on like a low red screen or a small screen might be hard so we went back to the original repo react GA we're going to go new pull request and let's go compare changes so we have the base let's compare actually can also yeah we need to compare across Forks that that's what we need Okay so let's take what I did and we'll be able to fix out bound link and then we're going to compare it to the master right yeah oops is that should I switch this do I need a different order why is it telling me this okay I think possibly I just mixed up the order um correctly if I'm wrong in the uh in the live chat Master that's what we need now let's compare there we go that's it okay so oh you know what I totally forgot the whole uh testing thing totally forgot that I just I'm going to check really quick and see if they say something in the documentation about see p request oh no that was just a link to the issues thought it would be a a link to the bottom it's possible that they have yeah they do okay I should have looked for this first oh well um all right so we need to test all right I have gold installed so that's not a problem need to run a test okay so the disc file should not be committed until the review has been merged okay all right so if you're following along in the repo we're down at the bottom here uh otherwise you can just check it out on your screen so these are just some instructions for how to do the test the only thing that's confusing me is it's saying not to submit not to commit the disc files okay that's that makes more sense I I guess I didn't read that carefully enough all right so we got to be careful not to commit the disc files but otherwise it seems like all we'll need to do at least at first here is basically just this part and we don't have to worry about complete code yeah we don't have to worry about anything basically past this because we need to wait to hear back okay that makes sense if I'm understanding this incorrectly let me know uh in the live chat but otherwise we'll just do the tests hopefully everything works out uh as I said before the style is is different so I'm not sure you know if they want it to be of a particular style then that might be an issue all right so let's see if I run npm test this should work because like I said I think I already have golp installed globally let's go oops I never ran mpm install all right so since this is live I can't go back and edit this but what I should have done is as soon as I pulled the repo down I should have done an mpm install so I don't think it'll matter much for what we did since we B we just completely added a new component so that should be fine uh I'll check out we'll check out the package Json just to make sure there wasn't some sort of like hook uh commit hook that would have done something but otherwise I think this will be all right yeah uh in the live chat um with a comment it's or or yarn install yeah normally I do use yarn I didn't want to use it for this project because uh it said use npm so I just decided to just go with what they were doing uh let's see errors errors H okay so it's saying possibly I don't have the latest version s of node and mpm installed well that's no good all right does it give a version it doesn't really give a version number I wish I wish there was maybe up here it'll say mpm version 2.2.0 all right well let's see what version no all right that's not the npm version that's the version of this H all right so what I'm running 7.3.0 and npm 4.1.2 so I guess I'm going to have to update so bonus for this video if you've never updated these things we're going to do it so let's actually I'm going to update uh npm first and then see if that works and then I won't have to update node as well so should be able to update npm like this npm St not sure how long this will take so while that's loading I'm going to catch up in the live chat all right still have a decent amount of viewers I hadn't looked at the analytics of this video in a while and I thought man I've messed up so many things uh everybody is going to be gone all right wow that was super fast let's see I'm just checking to make sure there wasn't anything weird looks like everything worked and so let me just run npm install again maybe maybe it'll work this time nope all right let's see whoa okay for all right I'm just trying to read through some of this let's make it bigger okay I'm going to make this bigger so you all can see since there's a lot of text here okay probably should update uh node anyway since I haven't updated it in a while it's looking like now I'm not so sure it's a problem with my versions I'm going to go back to the live chat see if anybody has some ideas here all right so there's a question here I'm just going to answer it so I don't forget later do I plan on doing any react native live coding yes I do I just need to get a project where I'm going to be using it first but hopefully I'll have an opportunity for that ahed asks uh are you a professional in this field um yes so I guess if by professional you define professional someone who gets paid to do a certain thing then yes I'm a professional if by professional you're implying like that I'm an expert then probably no but I have been doing this for like four four years or so uh fulltime so I I am a frontend developer employed at a university Brian says good to know everyone has the same crappy problems no matter how advanced you are I don't know how advanced I am but yeah I haven't had a problem like this in a while I mean with if you don't count yesterday when the it things weren't updating right on the server and I didn't really fix it I just ran the same command again and it worked the second time uh so I'm going to check out it looks like we have uh node there's an issue already issue 489 for node so I'm going to look it up I'll just look it up on my other screen and pull it over if if we want to look at it aim high says I just got my first developer job starting on the 3rd of July awesome all right so yeah I remember was it probably two weeks ago or so uh you were in the live chat uh this is aim high in the live chat uh talking about looking for jobs and things and I I remember I had asked for for updates to keep us updated so thank you so much for keeping us updated ated uh that's that's really awesome I'm like I'm super happy for you uh so hopefully it goes all right and um you know if I don't know what your schedule will be it's your new job but if you can join in for some of the live chats uh that would be awesome and if you uh if you need any any help or advice with anything you know feel free to uh message me on Twitter um I'll uh I'll help with anything I can yeah a high says uh really excited but very nervous I understand the nervousness uh you'll get just the more you work um you you'll get over the nervousness but you'll have that at first but um you know just be confident be confident in your skills and uh just keep working on it and that's um it'll it'll be it'll be a I think it'll be great all right so let's see sorry I'm I got distracted from looking up this uh issue but it was big news uh so it's worth the distraction so what was that issue 489 okay okay so I'll pull this over so everyone can see uh so this this is the issue so let me scroll down a bit see if this looks like this looks like what we're getting yeah it's not it doesn't look exactly like what we're getting but I think it's worth checking out oh okay well xcode select install all right wow this is back in 2014 let me let me scroll down because I suspect some of the really old answers may not work so this this one was only 28 days ago um I I just saw Amed asked in the live chat should I go for iOS instead of Android um I don't know I I don't develop uh apps for phones right now so I'm probably not the best person to ask but if if I were going to go into developing apps based on what I know right now I would learn react native and I would um that would probably make it easier to develop for both so that's I mean that's my opinion on there but I'm sure someone who uh actually develops apps uh would probably be able to give you a better answer so don't uh don't put a lot of trust in my answer there because I'm not I'm not knowledgeable about you know the job outlook and salaries for like iOS versus Android developers all right let's see all right cool I like this idea uh run npm install G npm latest uh node let's try that I'm going to try this because it looks really easy and if it works then great if not it doesn't look like this will break anything okay cool doing something uh Emerson asks what course is better computer science or information systems um again I I don't know that I could give you a great answer for this I think it part it does depend on what you want to um so sorry I was I wasn't laughing at your question Emerson I was laughing at another comment there so yeah it depends on what you want to do uh if you want probably like something that would just be more broadly applicable then I guess computer science would be better uh I was actually I think I was brief I briefly majored in computer information systems for like one semester when I was getting my undergrad uh and then I I changed and majored in something else uh in well an economics and finance because I could graduate faster like that so when I was in college I was just worried about getting out of college as fast as I could with a degree so don't really recommend it but it is the cheaper way to go uh CU if you can graduate early you don't have to pay for more school all right so let's try this again see if it works so actually so in the in the chat so uh basic so XD in the in the chat which I mean I know that that's that's not how you you're going to pronounce it but just to be able to say it in the live chat saying you had the same issue is is this you that had this issue here or that wrote this here I can't tell because you're you're um your picture on the live chat at least on my screen is like super tiny so let me try to zoom in and see I can't really tell but uh okay cool I thought cuz the hair looked the same so I could defitely make out the hair all right cool sorry I didn't pick up on that uh sooner but no did it happen again all right what just happened here okay here's what I'm going to do I'm going to keep working on this and I'm G to try to fix it and I'm going to keep the live chat going or the live stream going but in case you don't have time to stick around for uh to figure this out then I'm just going to show you where would I have the pool request I'm just going to show you basically what the next next step would be if you wanted to submit the pool request and where do I have over here okay so assuming that you got everything to work and you wanted to submit the request so we're comparing it to the the master branch of the original repo we have over here we have our branch that we did made the changes on and for our request you want to describe what's going on here so I would describe in as much detail as I could uh what's happening uh I could reference issues so in this case I'm probably going to reference um all the issues so that I think there were three issues I found that dealt with the same problem so I'd reference those and I might even mention that user that I got some of these ideas from uh I can't remember the name but I the user I I showed at the beginning and then you would create the pool request and that's pretty much it once you hit correct me if I'm wrong in the live chat but once you do that you hit create pool request then you just wait and see what the uh maintainers are going to say sometimes there are automated tests that happened so you might get immediate feedback if they have an automated test set up in that case like maybe you run it runs the test and it tells you you don't pass the test then maybe you could you know re try to fix it then and resubmit but basically that's it that would be the next step so if you were just here for that and you can't stick around then thank you for watching and uh join join me again sometime um otherwise we're going to try to fix this unrelated problem that just came up sometimes the unrelated problems are fun though uh to fix so let's pull this back on the screen and we'll pull this I'm going to kind of I want to read some of the other things that that happened just to see in myology okay this person said they had to downgrade node so maybe my node version is not out of date maybe it's too new see that I don't really know how to how I can tell this person restarted their computer and it worked wonder if the X Cod I guess I could try the uh the xcode thing oh Patrick says are you using MVM shoot I I don't remember it's been so long since I upgraded note I can't remember what I used to upgrade it last time but I think I did I either used NVM or one of the similar things that NVM does in case you're not familiar with NVM um it's uh B it's it's a way to manage your node versions upgrade versions and uh is it I think nvm's the one that you can have different versions running uh for different projects what's it so try that npm i g no all right let's try I just saw uh xd's comment to try this um mpm I worth a try okay well it did something it added and removed some packages so uh let's see how am I having all right so it is changing package Json kind of I didn't want I change to change package Json but oh well uh that's not what I wanted I wanted seeall run this again and see okay ahed is saying what's what's the speaker's name for uh let me try to go back up okay are you talking about the one that does the uh the math stuff so I know um for free code camps YouTube um if you're talking about the uh tutorial videos for a lot of JavaScript stuff uh B does those on free code camp we do have some other stuff oh okay he is talking about I couldn't figure out if you're talking about Bo or me I'm Jesse so yeah so I do I don't do a lot of tutorial stuff at least for free code Camp uh I am planning on doing some on my own channel but B already does such a great job with tutorials I can't compete with that uh but what I can do is um do some stuff live and sometimes make a fool of myself so that hopefully you all learn something and I get a lot from you all when when I'm working on projects so um so that's why this the show today is is kind of a mess we're having problems but that's the whole point is uh to work through like normal issues that come up as you're doing your your everyday work and did this work I wasn't looking I was looking at the live chat and I think this actually just worked oh okay it says can't find you with with at Jesse wait where are you trying to find me with with at sorry any amage uh in the live chat's asking uh can't find you with at symbol Jesse where I just want to where are you trying to find me at with that if it's in like within the live chat um I'm at free code Camp right now so I'm not I'm not logged in with my um with my account uh right now in the comments to the videos I use my account but in the chat I'm free code Camp all right so it looks like this worked which is awesome so what I'm going to do is I'm going to run the test hopefully that works better than than everything else so far I'm going to run the test and let me know if you think this is a good idea or not but I don't really want to commit the changes made to package Json so I'm not going to commit those I think that would be better cuz I'm I'm not trying to change something like that big to their project I just want my change to be that one thing added that one component so um so that's the plan let me know in the live chat if if you think I should do something else yeah so in case you missed it the command that actually fixed this I mean assuming the other commands I did before that didn't help which who knows I can't really tell at this point uh the command that actually fixed it was this one the one that I'm highlighting here npm ig node uh dyen GP so that fixed it so if you're having a similar problem try that all right now we're going to run I don't I don't even remember what the command was now uh let's see scroll down npm test okay let's run npm test okay I'm only failing one not bad but actually actually um here's the thing I didn't write any tests for my component so of course I should be passing these tests I'm actually surprised that I failed one because I didn't do anything to this so why would it why would that be failing cannot find module Jon uh but at least I can see so what are they using mocha so are using mocha for testing all right so here's what I'm thinking I have two options here well I I'm going to like just for a second ignore the fact that it's actually failing a test and this is just this is not me that's failing the test I didn't change anything in that component so um so for some reason the master branch of this repository is actually failing a test so I don't know how I'm going to be able to uh submit this request without failing something but my other options are this I just submit it without writing tests for that new component or I try to learn mocha in like five minutes and and try to submit something your feedback is greatly appreciated on this I just here's what I'm I'm thinking I kind of just want to take a chance and submit this request without writing the test because it's such a simple pull request and uh the component is really small I don't know that I recommend doing that on projects I mean normally you want to follow everything but uh just because of the fact that I've never written tests for mocha before this is turning into a lot bigger of a a project than I really wanted it to be okay cool so Sebastian says just submit it you're making a new component uh not editing uh one so okay cool I still even if I submit it I'm still a little bit worried about that I'm going to fail just because of of this failing test actually want to check that component out in the test quickly yeah I can't the the odds of me actually writing good tests for this are so low at this point I'm not even like I'm like barely following these already written test so I think I'm just going to submit it and then see what the maintainers say maybe they'll give me some useful feedback and I can make some changes or maybe somebody else will see the pool request and somebody who's good with you know with mocha and and can write that but at the very least the pool request will be there it'll be visible to other people and it could be helpful to somebody else possibly so I don't even know if I should commit any of this stuff because we haven't actually changed anything except the package Json actually let me look I do want to look at this again to see what the build there we go go build I don't think the build really matters at this point because we're I'm not supposed to um commit stuff from D anyway so I'm just going to go ahead with the pull request and I'm going to check the live chat really quick to see what you all think van is is begging for uh subscribers so saying subscribe me please subscribe me please I'll check out your channel um and maybe I'll subscribe from my from my personal account I'm not going to sub subscribe from free code camp but uh I'll check it out all right James says tests are necessary uh James says earlier I think that if you feel that you need a test then it is valid to spend the time maybe they can help you with the error X XD says maybe they can help you with the error all right yeah uh Teemo says uh you could probably copy the tests from a different component and adapt them right yeah maybe I could it seems like I had some suggestion so basically based on what's in the live chat now I have some suggestions that say just just submit the request as is some saying write the test and some saying maybe like submit but ask for for help from the maintainers um let's see how long Okay since this stream has been going on for an hour and 10 minutes at this point what I'm going to do is submit and see what the maintainers say if they want to merge it then great we know Wonderful it'll get merged otherwise if they say I need the test then what I'll do is at some point maybe not tomorrow but at some point in you know the next week or two I'll do a live stream on test so I'll have to learn how to write the test before then but it's probably worthwhile for me to learn that anyway so what I'll do is if I need the test I'll learn how to do it and then I'll write them live on a stream that would be kind of cool to stream anyway I haven't I've never done a stream on on writing test so I think that's the plan does that sound like a good plan okay all right it seems like uh few few people in the live chat are saying that that sounds good all right cool so I think that's the plan I'm going to submit this now um I just need to type add component for tracking and outbound link and opening I don't I don't want window to be cut off I want this all to be on one line and opening in new see if this enough nice okay so that fits all right um I'll just describe a little bit so actually I need to find these let me go to these issues really quick so they were all like right on top so they it shouldn't be too hard to find these three issues all right so that was this one the outbound link one and then this one and I think this one also references another one so I think it was these three so we have 91 71 and 115 shoes let's see all right that's good 115 if I just do hashtag nice uh what was this one what did I say 91 and 71 91 okay 71 yep and 911 all right I'm going to read this back I recommend reading back things that you write if you don't want to mess up so that helps me so uh in regard to issues whatever I created a component that successfully tracks a click on an outbound link and opens that link in a new window or tab all right that sounds good I'm just going to make a little bit a note about the testing uh just to let them know uh what what was going on there uh you I don't know how to write test and MoCA I didn't write any for this new component if this is necessary I'm willing to learn how to write them and submit another Quest all right so how's how's that look uh for everyone watching now I that's pretty straightforward is there anything any other information that probably should be in here or are we good maybe I should include the link to this video so for more information watch how we did this okay cool I see Teemo actually had said just that to mention the uh the test uh in the description so awesome James says you could use grammarly uh in instead of reading that out so yeah actually I've never used that before um but that's probably a good idea maybe I'll do us actually um all right Teo says looks good I actually I kind of do want to include the link to this video now that I think about it because um this might it may have some information that would be useful to the maintainers I mean potentially I don't know what do what do you think I got to see how to um I don't know if there'll be a link ready to use until this video I guess it would be the link would work I'm I'm assuming it's the same link when this video actually uh gets turned into like a recording after I finished it so I'll I'll do that let's see uh let's see actually they need to oops just want to make sure no it didn't work oh okay um actually maybe I should just keep the URL here um okay cool um all right that looks good I'm going to go ahead and uh allow edits for maintainers if you uncheck this box then the maintainers don't have access to edit uh to edit your stuff like you're part of the code uh and some cases maybe you don't want that but in this case I'm fine with with that like maybe they want to go in and write the test or something I I don't know uh but that's fine with me I just I mean I I this react GA has helped me in my project so I just think it'd be cool if I could help you know improve uh react GA just you know a bit and help them out and help everybody out that uses this so all right so I'm going to go ahead and submit this okay ahed did say uh please script the video they may not have time to go through the entire length yeah um yeah I've thought about doing this before I just there's so much some of the videos are really long so it is hard I would love to be able to go in and at least put like a little table contents in where people could skip to head to parts of the videos but I just haven't had time to do it uh that that's probably going to take a long time I mean I think I've done I've done almost 30 videos just for free code camp and I did live streams before that on my own channel so it's a lot of content to go through so I think it's a good idea I just don't have time right now to to do that also it's really weird to hear myself do these videos so I kind of don't like to watch my own videos but um at some point maybe uh you know I'll try to go back and do them maybe some of the videos that get the most traffic it would be worthwhile to do that for all right so now they do have an automated automated system for checking so no conflicts obviously we uh we anticipated that so we didn't change anything that was existing so I don't know how long this check will take it'd be cool to find out what happens while I'm still doing the stream so I'm going to go in at this point uh if if you're not if you haven't watched the show before at the end if I have time I try to go through all the uh live stream questions and answer all your questions so I'm going to go through quickly I have been keeping a pretty good track of what's going on in the live chat so hopefully I didn't miss too many things uh but I'm going to go through and do that so if you were just here for for the actual you know work part of this then uh thanks for watching and um please uh join join in again for another show if you can uh otherwise stick around if you have any questions go ahead and put them in the live chat now uh if you can't stick around for the answer put them in the comments or you can direct message me on Twitter the link to my Twitter account is in the description below actually it looks like I won't be able to get all the way back up to the top of the live chat so it only saves so many messages so it did cut off so sorry if if your message was like really up up high uh then I won't get to it usually that doesn't happen there's uh only a few times have I had that happen that there's so much going on in the live chat that it cuts off so I sorry for that I didn't anticipate that happening uh let's see uh ahed asked do you know any Android live streams actually I don't know any Android live streams so I'm sorry about that uh if anybody that's listen that's watching this later on knows of any Android live streams please put it in the uh in the comments and then maybe uh AED will see that at some point looks like there was a lot of uh good discussion in the live chat so I'm kind of just skipping through a lot of it um ahed ask do you think Android Java iOS are boring uh I don't really know if I'd say like boring for me I just don't know a lot about it uh I I have not that not really a lot of exposure uh to Java and pretty much none at all for developing for iOS uh I did actually once I did pay for and started a course on developing for iOS but I couldn't I couldn't get it to work basically the course wanted you to install some stuff to be I had a Windows computer at the time I didn't have a Mac so I couldn't get it to work so that I could develop it on my Windows computer and it came down to like my uh my CPU like only certain CPUs can handle that so anyway so I got a refund for the course but other than the very small exposure I had then I I don't really know so I can't really comment on it uh whether or not I think it's boring or not because I just haven't worked with it I once went to a class where we uh worked on a game in Java and um I mean it was it was fun uh J jine I'm not sure how to pronounce it it's j a h H uh EI n says why not use Homebrew to keep the stuff updated uh yeah Homebrew if you're on a Mac Homebrew uh is kind of like a package manager type of thing uh Homebrew is cool I I do have some stuff installed with Homebrew I kind of think that I didn't originally install node or anything with with Homebrew so that's why I'm not using it uh but normally yeah with with Homebrew uh it does make it a lot easier to keep things updated okay I see now XD had told me before I even asked he he told me the comment that was his from earlier in the show so uh on the uh on the issues so oh hey I just uh checked it looks like all checks have passed which I mean that was kind of expected uh since we didn't write any new tests so uh evidently the uh issue that we had with uh the code failing one of the tests maybe that was just something maybe the changes that we made in package Json caused that somehow so at least got through here so normally uh if a pull request doesn't pass the automated checks usually it's like rejected automatically uh so this is a good sign it passed these so some one of the maintainers will probably look at it at some point so now all we do is just wait I'll definitely update you all on what happens I mean you could you could check out the repo and everything too but uh so you don't have to keep track of it I will update you whenever I get any uh anything about it so cool I'm going to keep going through the live chat here and see I'm not talking a lot about it because I've already kind of gone through a lot of this stuff while we were while we're doing the video ahed said the moment you said it's going to take time the number abruptly fell to 55 from 67 so you still had the number of viewers so it looks like uh everybody Dro yeah at some point I think I told everybody like you can drop out now if you're not interested in this is just going to take a while and they so they did drop out which is cool I I understand sometimes these videos go really long and uh you know not you just don't have the time not everybody has the time to watch for okay I'm going through uh yeah it looks like I'm almost to the bottom of the uh live chat here so a lot of the stuff was just responses to things earlier that I already uh read out for the most part okay we had uh SJ s Ur r a j says you installed gulp globally uh yeah I did install it globally um um I to be honest I don't use gulp as much as I used to anyway but I think I already had it installed globally I think I did I'm not 100% sure so that's why I just did it globally uh again it's possible that I was mistaken I didn't have it installed globally to begin with but at one time I used gulp for pretty much every project so it made sense for me to install it globally um Ahmed asks are you on LinkedIn uh yeah I am on LinkedIn so if you just look up Jesse wle uh on LinkedIn I am I am there I think I have a link to it so in the description for this video I have a link to my YouTube channel and for my yoube channel YouTube Channel I have links uh to my other social media uh channels so I think the LinkedIn one is is in there uh if you find me on free code or on uh LinkedIn I don't know how many Jesse Wiles there are on LinkedIn but um it's j SS e we i g l so maybe there might be a bunch of them I'm the one that works at Franciscan University and I'm I'm a frontend developer I don't think there are any other Jesse Wiles that are frontend developers on LinkedIn right now uh wizzy 17 asks what language are you using to code um just this is mainly JavaScript but it's it's react uh so it might be it might look a little little bit different uh especially the HTML portion of it but it's basically just JavaScript Okay add a request to show the um show the D I guess that's it I guess just one one check uh it wanted to show the details but I don't unless there's oh yeah details there we go I don't know why I didn't see that all right so let's check out details I'm not sure um s SJ what's your um what you were looking for but uh I mean you could check this out too but it looks like yeah actually I want to see yeah everything passed so we didn't that failing thing uh in outbound link didn't come up again so okay cool uh Ahmed says mobile devices and apps are the new era uh mintra from India shut down their website and continued business only using a mobile app that's cool that's I mean that's interesting I I don't think the web is going anywhere uh right now because it's huge I mean who knows like in time maybe uh but so I mean at least at this point the web is here like it's it's it's pretty steady but I mean who knows things change so it's hard to predict what's going to happen in the future I've also heard people say that apps are going to not be a thing anymore because people just make Progressive web apps that run just as well uh on you know in a browser or on a phone everything so maybe that'll be a thing at some point I mean it already is a thing now but maybe it'll be a reality to where those apps can actually run just as well so I don't know what's going to happen but uh for now I think well as I said said before if if you're trying to choose between web development or developing for apps or anything I would learn react learn react native and then uh you can develop for lots of different things and not have to learn quite as much uh as if you wanted to develop for all those things but wanted to do it you know in Swift and in Java and in um you know in JavaScript or or whatever other even backend languages you would need to know so that's that's my opinion on it I'm not saying it's there there probably other opinions that have good points as well James says I have a game we built in uh seore or C++ it's been a long time it was a nuclear war game that sounds cool I'd like I'd love to build more games in like JavaScript and stuff if I had time I think that it would just be fun and my kids would probably like it it it would help my kids to be more interested in what I do uh XD says you can do apps using react native Ahmed says good suggestion would you help me for this all right cool so XT is actually coding react native now yeah I'm not doing react native yet but like I mentioned before uh at the very beginning so if if you weren't here for the beginning you might have missed it I just signed up and just started today the react course the new react nanodegree course from Udacity and part of that at the end of the course I will be making an app with react native that's that according to the course description it will run on Android and iOS so when I get to that point I will be able to provide help but at this point I probably won't be very helpful for that uh Ahmed says they want to connect on on LinkedIn too yeah if anybody if anybody wants to connect with me on any of the social media channels like I'm I'm cool with that I'll I'll friend you or add you or whatever um you know if if you prefer one channel over another I'm I'm cool with that I'm on everything I'm not really active on everything but um but I'll keep up with like direct messages and things like that now Ahmed said I I was never trying to be rude by talking about the Mobile area during great job yeah Ahmed I I didn't take it uh as being rude so I mean it's totally cool yeah in in general like I don't really get upset with anything anybody says in this chat I mean even I at one point early on I had somebody in here like getting really angry that I was using J query so but I'm cool with it I'm I'm cool with I actually I always expect way more criticism than I really get everybody's been really positive and I know like I know that there are people that are way better than me and I do make a lot of mistakes so uh you all are way nicer than I probably deserve so don't don't feel bad if you have some harsh criticism for me I mean it's always cool if you can say it nicely but even if you can't like I'm I'm okay with that uh wizzy says I'm new in learning to code and I started with python what do you guys think I should learn next uh wizzy it just depends on what you want to do um if you want to do web stuff then you you'll need to learn JavaScript um if you want to do like I don't know like machine learning stuff then from what I understand python is okay uh or like big data like you could probably stick with python and just get deeper into that so uh it's really up to what you what you want to do but you can do a lot with JavaScript nowadays so it's probably a safe thing to learn just in terms of uh being able to get a job you if you know JavaScript you open yourself up to a wide range of jobs um I I don't want to say like more than any other language but it's probably one of the top programming languages uh just in terms of jobs available uh bird person asks do you use Docker for node.js app I have used Docker in the past uh I'm not I don't know it well enough to be comfortable with it for using it for uh for like things that I'm actually making for clients uh or for work uh but I would like to use it more I just haven't taken the time to learn it so um if you know of any good resources for learning Docker uh that's cool I did a plural site course on Docker before uh but yeah I'd definitely like to learn more about it Alberto says your phone started going off right when I got a text from uh my wife yeah it did it was actually my my wife just called and normally I would answer but I think I'm going to end the stream here in just a minute so that's I'm just going to call her back uh I know I know she told me earlier that I have to be home by by 6 so I definitely have time it's only 342 here in in my time zone so I'm not sure what she wanted Ahmed said Jesse I'm relieve you're being positive and sorry about that someone yeah I mean I'm not really upset I don't even remember who the person was that was getting on me about uh jQuery and I was cool with it too like I'm I'm trying to get away from using jQuery as much um the only thing I don't like is if people are getting on each other during the chat uh but if you if you want to say something to me I'm cool with that uh but uh I kind of like to keep it at the the live chat and the comments and everything I like to keep it a place where people can ask questions and not be afraid uh that somebody's going to you know respond with something snarky or mean or something like that so um so yeah that's the only thing that I really uh get upset about and don't like James says I read an article said that programming is the new learning for kids yeah I I definitely agree with that I I've I've read some stuff about that too and I'm education is not usually known for being like on top of things and ahead of the game and really fast at least like especially higher education is super slow uh but I'm surprised surprised that there aren't more schools that are requiring programming like I know at least in the United States a lot of schools require to be able to graduate let's say from high school you have to have so many courses in a foreign language but realistically in the United States if you know English you're fine you'll probably never have to know another language now I know in certain places in the United States Spanish is also spoken a lot but but you can get you know everything that you need to do unless you really want to work in a certain area or a certain industry like you can get away with English so I'm wondering like would it not be more useful to more people if we included programming languages under languages or something like that I mean we uh I just think that we require students to learn things that are way less useful than programming and a lot of these curriculums were made you know years and years ago we've been teaching the same basic concepts uh for so long that it doesn't take into account what's going on today and what what jobs are available today and what the needs are uh for for employees so anyway sorry sorry for that little uh for me getting on my soap box there but um but anyway I I think kids um even in Young young kids should be introduced into basic programming con Concepts uh early on uh Tom asks how important is algorithm scripting uh I would say like for your dayto day work like for me in my daytoday work I rarely ever need to do stuff with algorithms I mean it occasionally I do but if I was looking for a job I would be doing algorithms every day and practicing because you'll probably have to do an algorithm for your uh for your interviews so it there are probably some jobs where algorithms come into play way more often so it might just depend on what you what kind of job you want uh Rich asks do you work for free code camp or do you volunteer I just volunteer I don't I don't get anything for this I don't get any payment I don't even I don't run ads on my personal YouTube channel or anything so um yeah I don't I don't get anything for this ahed says Jess he just talked to her you know that's why I'm not going to get married yeah he was referring to my wife calling actually I should check and see if she texted me it looks like she did text okay she said so she I she told me I needed to be home by 600 but if she saw me earlier at home then she would feed me dinner so so it seems like that's all she wanted which that's that's nice it's good to eat I probably will try to get home before six because I do have a lot of work to do but as as you know I'm I'm definitely into overtime territory so I need to try to leave early at least sometimes to make that up uh um wizzy says in response to Rich's question I'm sorry was says any sites that give projects to work on like a few easy things so I can get the hang of C I don't know I didn't see I guess I didn't see oh okay Rich had a question earlier that I didn't see and it said uh said learn more from working on your own projects than just following a guide okay so I guess I missed a little conversation here about whether it's better to work on a project or follow guides in general you do learn more from working on a project but if you're just starting out in something you sometimes you need the guide first and then you can uh then you can know enough to do the project so it kind of just depends on your level of expertise at least that's that's my been my experience with it uh and Rich says you know think of something yourself um in terms of projects if it's something you're interested in it's a bit easier to stick with so like think of a problem you may face and see if you can solve it I think that's great advice um yeah find something that you are interested in you're way more likely to stick with it so definitely uh really good advice rich sorry I don't know if you guys heard that my stomach just growled was just making noise so I apologize for that if that sounded weird on the on the stream there uh actually I haven't really eaten anything today I just have like um like these weight gain like shakes so basically it's you can drink it but it's a ton of calories and then that way I can just keep working and drink this stuff and I get in my calories so I'm always looking for little ways to be more efficient and get in more coding so I haven't eaten any solid food yet today all right so rich says uh was just Cur this is I guess in response to um so he had asked if I worked for free code camp or I was a volunteer and um I said no I'm a volunteer so he said you are a fulltime Dev though uh how much work would you say you do outside of the office if you don't just work at home yeah so um it depends so I am a fulltime Dev I do work in an office uh but occasionally I have clients on the side that I do work for and so it just depends on if I have a client and what the client is so I do have some steady clients that I do really minor work for like every month and I wouldn't even call it programming work it's really like uploading blog post to Wordpress I don't really like to do that work but it's more like it's almost like a favor you know it's like some local nonprofits that I do things for um one of the nonprofits my great aunt is on the board for so it's kind of a favor to her and the other one is like a family friend runs this nonprofit so um so I charge them like a really really low rate compared to what I would charge like a real company uh and I do the work so it's just really basic stuff occasionally I do get a client that I I have I do like a legit site for and then sometimes I work a lot outside so I might there have been times when I would put in like an extra 30 or 40 hours a week on top of my normal fulltime job to get a site launch for a client that now that's only probably a few weeks out of the year that I would work like that and I don't like to work like that if I can avoid it uh so but it just varies uh garv asks what's the best JavaScript framework to start with honestly here's what I'm G this is going to be unpopular but I'll give two answers I'm going to say what the easiest one to start with is and then I'll say what the best one to start with so I mean assuming that you've already learned some just regular JavaScript which is would be good to start with I would say the best framework in my opinion to learn would be react simply because there are so many react jobs available now it seems to be in really high demand I found react to be easier to pick up than angular was I I tried and failed at angular when it back when it was angular version one so I don't know about the newer versions maybe it's easier but I had trouble with it at first so I would say react if you want to know the easiest framework to use than it's jQuery and don't don't everybody hate me for that but realistically there are still a lot of jobs out there and a lot of places that use jQuery so it seems like it's not popular to use among devs but among actual websites that are out there it's very prevalent so those sites still need people to work on them so if if you're looking for something to get into that's easy to understand then I mean people should know some jQuery it's not that hard to pick up but if you're taking on clients like random clients and businesses like you're going to have to do something with jQuery at some point so uh you may as well I guess learn that at first just don't use it for everything you know try to learn how to do it the regular JavaScript way try to learn how to do it in react or if you want to go with angular try to do it in that so uh it's easy to just you kind of use jQuery as a CR for everything and then when you have to do something without it it's really hard uh Ahmed says I wrote a Blog on using git it's on LinkedIn please comment on it once you connect with me so yeah I definitely will Amed and if anybody else uh you know check out amed's blog on on LinkedIn uh it's about using git so if you want to if you need some help using git check that out wizzy said I guess your stomach wants to reach home before 6'2 yeah ammed says I was once like you not eating food but having fun coding only to realize after seven years that it's an unending story yeah it's true like I probably should I probably should eat more like I legit at one point I lost so much weight because I was just coating and not eating that my clothes didn't fit anymore I had to buy new clothes uh so I actually used an app I used my fitness pile to track my calories so I remembered to eat and then I did gain some weight but now I I I didn't I got a new phone and I never installed that app again so now I'm back back down to um not fitting in my clothes anymore uh Rich says thanks for answering I ask as I see another FCC video FCC being free code Camp a day at Amazon it's seemed he worked at home a lot as well as in the office yeah I um I do some work at home like for this job that I at the University that's my normal fulltime job I do work from home sometimes I'm not like I'm supposed to work here in the office fulltime right so but if I don't feel well I'm I work from home uh just to like not get anybody else uh sick in in my office so that's when I can work from home I would like to be allowed to do more work from home so that's something I'm probably going to negotiate um possibly uh I'm possibly thinking like at some point you know when it would be time that maybe maybe I could negotiate to be able to work from home instead of like a bump up in salary like maybe if there's a time when financially it's just not possible for my department to give the arrays or anything then that would be a good time to try to say like hey well how about you know I can do some remote work instead which would be which would be nice I mean it you don't I don't have to drive in to work I don't have to spend time you know getting them dressed up and ready I can just you know sit at home uh and and do the work from there so that's kind of my plan I would like to do more work from home although it it's kind of hard though if the kids are there uh sometimes times it's distracting but if the kids aren't home I get a lot more work done at home than I do in the office uh because in the office people could just walk by and you know talk to me about things like if I have to go stop somewhere I always run into people on the way and and like every little errand at work takes way longer uh rudaki says Jesse what do you do to not forget the things you've learned I've heard some devs use space repetition software like anky is that common in the community I actually I read about Anie and I downloaded an app for it and then I never used it for me to remember the things that I've learned the best way for me is to keep using them in projects uh so there's definitely something to be said like it let's say that you're you're practicing for an interview and you know certain questions are going to be on there then using something like anky would probably be beneficial but otherwise just doing the work will force you to remember it you know you you'll start remembering things that functions that you use constantly syntax that you use constantly or commands on you know terminal commands that you use constantly you'll remember it at first you'll have to look it up but at some point you won't have to look it up anymore and you'll remember it naturally I like that way of doing things because you know you're actually getting work done while you're doing it and to me that's kind of a more natural way like that that's how kids that's how babies pick things up you know they don't learn with like flat flash right you don't do flashcards with a baby to teach them how to how to talk they pick it up by hearing what you say and trying to mimic that so to me I think that's a much more natural way of doing things and it it works for me uh but so you know people have different methods of learning so what works for me might not work you know for you or for someone else so uh but I do think if if you do have certain things that you know you will have to memorize and you need to know it quickly then something like anky uh which is like a space repetition of the same uh knowledge the same information would be beneficial in that case I just don't really ever have a case like that uh in for what I do uh if you were still in school like that would definitely work for test though uh ammed says Jesse man so many hours after regular job I should start drinking the energy drink you mentioned yeah so uh here's my unofficial commercial for my energy drink that I I don't I don't get paid to sponsor or do anything at all but I I drink gfuel and uh I'm not a doctor so don't take my word for it but it's basically if you ever used 5H Hour Energy it basically is the same stuff that's in 5our energy except it's in powdered form so it's cheaper and you can get it shipped to you cheaper and you mix it with water so anyway they Market it to like professional Gamers but I find that it does help me out for uh for my coating so uh and I like it better like Red Bull and stuff that those energy drinks have a lot of sugar and things in them and this doesn't have a ton of sugar in it so it's it is it's better for you in that sense that it's not filled with sugar if you do use gu I recommend getting one of the flavors that has some type of citrus in it the stuff without Citrus for me is just too sweet you need that like little tanginess from the Citrus to cut the sweetness uh Justin says I guess it just it depends on what your initial struggle with angularjs was a lot has changed now they're on version 4 but moved to an evergreen naming convention yeah that's what I thought Justin I I expect that there are two problems with my early experience with angular one I just wasn't that good with JavaScript period at the time like this was years ago when angular was somewhat new and I just didn't have the experience if I tried to learn it again now I'm sure I would be way more successful uh also angular has has come a long way since then as well so my opinion on angular is probably not that that great I don't trust it too much because when I talk about angular I'm talking about angular one and I'm talking about a version of me that was way less skilled at JavaScript uh Justin says Pomodoro Timer man yeah I I do use Pomodoro timers so I got my pomodora timer up right now I was just using it using it for work earlier uh the problem is when I have that like five minute break between Pomodoro sessions I usually check email and stuff and so I don't get I don't get time to do anything else uh ahed says Jesse please join a gym in that case you can't stop eating and your clothes will fit to yeah I need to uh I need to start working out again I've been really busy with work and I've put that off so uh I need I found like if I don't work out my uh my mental health just is is really bad so like not only physically but like mentally I just get way more like depressed maybe that's why the guy that left earlier said I sounded bored maybe I I just need to work out maybe I'm getting depressed uh but yeah it it helps me mentally I'm way more positive and upbeat it actually makes it easier for me to figure out problems that with when I'm coding so uh I I know what I need to do it's just a matter of of doing it and having the willpower to do it uh amed's ask saying for react do you know some site to start with I don't want to go through the videos now just some quality uh reads would make more sense um react trying to think I think uh code academy has some react stuff like intro to react tutorial stuff um it's not like just reading it's you know you're doing the exercises but that's like a good place to start and then the react documentation itself is not really that hard to read through uh let's see Alberto says in terms of energy drinks that he drinks some green tea thing forget what it's called though but it's it is carbonated um yeah I've tried green tea before I actually have green tea pills uh so I found like they just they don't work that much they don't give you that energy so I have uh my brotherinlaw he does um he like sells tickets online for things buys and sells them and he does stuff in the stock market and he uses green tea pills they work for him but for me I just I haven't had that much luck with him but I really do like to actually drink green tea just for pleasure and not for energy James says I wish I could gain weight actually I was successful I gained like 25 lbs I know this has nothing to do with coding sorry to anybody that I'm getting off track here but just for like 30 seconds I'm going to tell you how I managed to gain like 25 PBS in just like two or three months um so I downloaded the uh My Fitness Pal app and I set a Target goal a weight goal right and then it it helps you figure out how many calories you need to take in so I didn't have to do all that math they did it for me then I had like the weight gain shakes that would give me a lot of um I don't remember what they're called I get them from Amazon subscribe and save and so every month I just get these big bags of like weight gain uh powder right you just mix it with milk and just a lot of protein and a lot of stuff so basically I would just keep track of what I was eating every day to make sure I hit that calorie goal then I also made sure that I worked out so every day like after work I'd come in I come in through my basement door I have like all my clothes and stuff are down in the basement by the washing machine so I change out of my work clothes right there before I do anything else and then I had a little weight set and a weight bench right next to the laundry room so I'd go right from changing out of my work clothes right to there I'd do like a little work just like a 15minute workout tried to just lift like the heaviest weights I could and uh then I would go upstairs and see my family and that way like I always got it in and immediately after that I'd go upstairs and eat eat dinner so I'd get some calories in right away I did that consistently for like two or three months and I was able to gain that weight and it was basically like mostly muscle weight I mean I uh I would do some cardio uh as well and that was M basically for mental health because if you do like 45 minutes of cardio every day uh it does help your your mood a lot like you know in your mental health so that was my how I did it it honestly just takes discipline to be able to eat the amount of calories and to keep doing the workouts uh Alberto says I I'm in a a pretty noncode intensive day day job so spend for like from 730 a.m. to 400 p.m. doing mostly admin type work but then go home do some yoga and work on a web project in net uh until whatever sometime in the am in the next morning uh that's pretty uh that's pretty tough schedule too going home and working on projects at night that's like I'm uh I'm impressed by that because I I know that's it's tough like it's tough to have the energy and the motivation at the end of the day after you've already worked uh Hubert says uh where's the coding sorry just join 10 minutes ago yeah we're doing the question and answer stuff so we kind of got away from coding and we we were getting into nutrition for coders I guess um but yeah I'm actually going to wrap up the live chat here in a few minutes but the uh video of the code portion of it and everything will be available about a minute or two after I wrap up so you can check out the uh the recording uh Rich says I'm a student will hopefully graduate in three months time at the age of 32 any advice as I Look to get into the industry with no experience of working in this area uh manual work previously um so I would say uh work on projects and that's Amed is giving the same advice here um yeah work on projects so if you don't already have projects that you're working on uh get some uh like contribute to other people's open Source projects on GitHub uh and that'll that'll show employers that you can do the work and that you're passionate about the coding and what you do because if you're taking time where you're not even getting paid to work on this obvious viously like this is something you you like to do uh so I would do that and then try to get until you find fulltime work try to get some clients uh you know freelancing so I maybe start out in your local area to try to get some if you really can't find it you can go on some of the freelancing sites I haven't had much luck with that you probably won't make very much money but if you just need some work you know it's not a bad place to go uh so and then just keep you know keep learning and if you have to take a job that's not coding related to pay the bills then you know that's that's cool too uh just make sure that you always like try to keep uh keep coding oh James said I had to have my colon removed sorry to hear that James I hope uh I hope everything's healing up well and uh and properly I know my wife went through major surgery uh in like beginning in November so uh I know that can be really tough to recover from I know even now she's still having complications from the surgery so uh good good luck with that Umberto says uh need a software Dev day job said then the evenings would be all about my wife and me she's been super understanding about my craving to code that's awesome that's really important if um you know you have your family's understanding about things and it's important to spend time with family too and I mean I I say that knowing that I don't always spend as much time with my family as I should uh because you just get into the work uh you know there's deadlines things need to get done so don't forget that though I mean the work will always be there but your family might not you know even like your kids grow up you know they leave at some point your kids don't want to hang out with you anymore so uh and I'm I'm saying this I I need to take my own advice so I'm saying this to myself as well Amed says sorry to hear about your wife Jesse take care of her yeah I mean she's she's doing good now to the point like there's just some weird complications and stuff going on from her surgery so um the the worst part is I don't want to get like super personal so I don't want to weird anybody out but like the worst part is for us like she's she's not able to have kids anymore and that was like unexpected uh you know we had we had thought that we'd be able to have more kids we're really young like I'm only 31 uh so uh kind of expected to have more years of kids so that's kind of the for me at least that's like the really the toughest part and then for my wife still having like pain and things going on so uh she's just been doing physical therapy and and seeing a lot of doctors and stuff but hopefully uh she's one of her doctors has her on this new like nutrition plan and physical therapy and stuff so we're hoping that that'll work work out and help her okay cool and I've reached the end of the live chat so that I kind of ended on like a down note so I didn't intend to but then I just reached the end of the chat so uh thanks um for all the support I have some people in the live chat giving some messages of support for for me and for my wife and uh I really appreciate that um thank thank you for that oh James says there are a lot of kids out there that need to be adopted that's always a good alternative yeah you're right James that's true I I did look into uh my my oldest son is seven and he was asking me about adopting kids uh a few weeks back and so I checked out I checked into it right now it actually costs a lot of money to adopt um at least to adopt like babies and stuff so it's a little bit out of my range right now now but hopefully in the future I'll be at a place financially where that's possible and uh yeah I mean I I love I love babies I love kids I love having kids around so I'm definitely open to um to adopting uh one day at some point I think if I can always have a little kid like or want to come home to I'll be I'll be fine no matter what happens at work if you can come home and there's a little one there you know and they just want to give you hug and uh that just it just like wipes away all the nonsense that happened that day and all the stress and everything so uh I'll be sad when I don't have that anymore okay you're welcome yeah I have some people saying thanks for your time you're welcome everybody and uh on that note I I am going to wrap this up because this video ended up being really really long um so um yeah oh um I think I got I think I answered everybody's questions if I missed something you know send me a message on Twitter or uh put it in the comments below and uh I'll I'll try to give you an answer and sorry if I missed missed your question uh I should be back there's going to be at least one day this week where I'm going to have to change I'm either I either won't be able to stream or I'll have to change the stream time um I don't know where I have my C here's my calendar I just want to check real quick okay so tomorrow I should be good same time streaming but Thursday is going to have to be a different time because I'm going to have a long meeting around 1 I might be able to get out of the meeting earlier but I I don't want to schedule anything and then have to cancel so uh Thursday might be an off time uh for the stream and then Friday I should be good at the normal time so oh uh my Twitter handle is uh someone asked about my Twitter handle it's it's in the description uh for this video so just check check below and there should be a link to it all right so thank you so much uh for for watching and especially if you stuck around for this super long video and thanks for I talked a lot about like noncode related stuff so thanks for for listening uh through all of that and you all have been really great and uh really helpful when I had all those errors and things come up so I really appreciate that uh the video was somewhat less instructional than I had hoped just because of some of the errors and stuff um so hopefully you did get something out of it if you've never submitted a pool request before uh but I'll be back tomorrow and uh hopefully I'll maybe we can have some uh good news about the pool request maybe it's it'll be accepted uh but uh have have a great day uh I'll see yall tomorrow
