welcome back to the freeco camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freeco camp.org and each week we're bringing you Insight from developers entrepreneurs and ambitious people who are getting into Tech this week we're joined by Seth golden he's an open source project maintainer developer a prolific Freo Camp contributor and he is a computer science student at Yale welcome Seth thank you for having me Quincy yeah it's great to have you here man uh you're somebody whom I've enjoyed talking with for years at this point and you have a very special relationship with a gentleman whom uh has who has also contributed a lot to freeo Camp uh Sam cromby and I wanted to start by just going back in time a few years to how you met Sam yeah so Sam and I actually met we're both originally from South Florida and we met through a mutual friend uh Joe who also one of my really good friends and they were working together on a project and Joe and I had worked together on a project and somehow Sam and I got connected and we all have this interest in edtech and that's education technology and so it just like immediately like hit it off um and our first big project together Sam and I was we recognized that there's this amazing wealth of resources that exist on the internet which is the fact that like most college CS curriculums are available online for free publicly yeah and at the time we saw that these were courses that were just being passed around on like Reddit through like Google Sheets like people would be sharing like Google Sheets of like these are all the Stanford CS courses or these are all the MIT CS courses and we were like okay we could probably build better interface than Google Sheets via Reddit post um for like just sort of agglomerating and collecting all of those resources to make them more accessible to people make it easier to find so that was our first project that we worked on together and college compendium dorg again a giant directory of uh online courses that you can take in most cases for free uh through various universities including you know many any prestigious universities like Yale um so uh tell me a little bit about how you two met like what were the circumstances were were you working on similar projects or did you just bump into each other at a party it wasn't a party I was working on an academic information system for the school district of pompage County at the time and Sam and Joe were working on a hallpass system during Co so like a digital Hall Pass solution and there was just a lot of overlap in our interests we got connected and started talking um and what actually ended up happening was the that project uh compendium which isn't like super mantained but there's still a lot of amazing resources that are on that website for free still today um was we learned a lot about like a lot of the challenges that exist with auditing courses online and so that's how we made our first fre code Camp course was we recognized that there are a lot of like sort of tips and tricks that you can use to help yourself get through a lot of these courses that we had discovered through our process of auditing CS courses like Berkeley 61b for example is a really famous yeah example um and you know over the years Sam and I looked at ml courses NLP courses data structure learning natural language processing yeah I'm sorry I'm just going to like there are lots of acronyms used in computer science CS true just if I interject occasionally it's just to make sure that everybody in the audience knows what we're talking about here of course so we thought that that could be a really like useful addition to the free code Camp community and it seems like it was it was oh yeah absolutely like hundreds of thousands of people have watched the auditing course and we weren't sure at the time are people really that interested in formally auditing a university course when they could just just go watch Like You Know video recordings of courses uh or uh do like the you know the online course version of it through like you know corsera or edex or something like that but it turns out there's a lot of interest among developers in the freeo camp community so yeah thanks for making that course of course it's something that we're really proud of and I think a lot of the things that we did after that were a reflection of what that experience taught us which is it's really challenging to finish a course online like learning online is really hard and so the next thing that we worked on samon was this tool that we were trying to build to help people um get through courses like sort of a digital ta which was like a very very early version of chat GPT using gpt3 to create basically a chatbot um in like April of 2022 I think it was um um and so a fun story actually is I ended up skipping my graduation for high school to fly to Dartmouth for like a pitch competition that was happening there um yeah Dartmouth being the school that Sam just graduated from Recently but this was back your high school graduation yeah so that we could um like pitch this new idea and get started on working on it and that eventually turned into a tool that Joe ended up joining us for and the three of us worked together on it for about a year um eventually it being called Friday Friday like like his girl Friday like the idea of a chatot that can help guide you through uh a whole lot of um you know struggles that you might encounter trying to get through these courses right yeah and it was an incredible experience to work on that with the two of them and hopefully it helped a lot of students we had a lot of students using it um over the span of the last year so I think like in general when I think about sort of courses and and auditing courses like it has never been easier to do that than it is today with tools like Chachi PT and all of these advances recently in large language models like even taking courses in person um it's sort of like a a massive step forward that it's difficult to imagine what life was like before these tools existed like yeah I find myself constantly asking questions now that I know I'm going to get like a quick response to that makes sense and is thorough that like a Google search wouldn't have provided um you know as as succinct C or as as explanatory um before and that's actually probably a good segue into the second course that we worked on yes and uh just just to be clear we're going to talk a lot about AI that's going to be a huge thing we talk about later but I I want to hear about like one of the earlier versions of AI uh Google search itself I mean the p rank algorithm and all the additional software they've layered on top of it is this Tool uh that I mean where does the AI really begin I mean it it used to just be if then logic and now it's it's neural networks and things like that but somewhere in between was Google search and Google search still is incredibly useful I use it I don't know 50 times a day probably that's not an exaggeration but I also use llms uh I use uh GPT 4 a lot um especially for language learning as I've talked a little bit about in previous episodes of the free C Camp podcast but maybe you could talk a little bit about your course on Google searching this technology that's been with us for like 20 plus years that a lot of people take for granted like don't you just type what you want no all right you don't just type what you want there's a whole lot of different um kind of tactics you can use to get what you want out of Google right yeah I mean that's something that over the the years like we had picked up uh a lot of sort of tips and tricks about using Google search to like more quickly more accurately find what you're looking for like sure you can just sort of type into the search bar or anything and Google's really good at finding what it is that you're looking for and not just Google search endom in general like that's what they're meant to do um but there are a lot of like operators that you can add to your query to make it more accurately find what you're looking for especially when you're programming and you're looking to like debug this like one error that you can't figure out and you're trying to find that like one stack Overflow post or GitHub Forum comment that like solves your problem uh something as simple as just like putting quotations around like the specific thing that you're looking for so that an exact matth searches for it I use that like every day that's a um like worth it to watch the first five minutes of that course if you didn't know that was a thing that existed and there's a lot of operators like that that I think I find really valuable I think another like that course was sort of a combination of a bunch of things like it was like anything that could possibly be useful to you about Google was how Google used to work how Google works today to our best understanding a lot of these operators that you can use and then also just like strategies for when you're searching like this I think becomes Al it's it remains relevant even in a world of large language models in that like it's still all about how you prompt the model like the the question that you ask is just as important as what it is that you're trying to find like you sort of have to imagine like what it is that you're trying to end up with and then craft a prompt or a query that you think will best result in that result versus that just sort of like putting in like a question um and mlms are pretty good at answering those things too large langu it's also yeah yeah very much about Sor sorry I just wanted to jump in just in case anybody doesn't know that acronym yet you're going to hear that a lot over the next few years large language models llms uh just just to kind of like recapitulate what you just said communication is ultimately what this is and programming is communicating what is in your head to a computer right Google searching effectively is communicating what you want to a computer uh prompt engineering if you want to call it that like essentially The Art of Getting an llm to tell you what or give you the information that you need right or do the task that you needed to do it it's all about communicating and the way that you communicate with a human uh a native English speaking human that grew up with similar cultural context to you and everything like that like you grew up in South Florida I grew up in Oklahoma like the way you and I would communicate is very different from how you would communicate with Google or you would communicate with gp4 right uh so so the tactics that you use to effectively communicate and and get the machine to do your bidding essentially that's that's what your Google course is about right yeah and I think like the thing is the end goal I I think at least is for for the way that we interact with computers to be exactly the same as the way we interact with other people that that is possible and like eventually something that I mean just makes the most intuitive sense like that's what programming is I would agree to point however like it with a human you do have to kind of be polite you don't have to be polite to a computer a computer does not care about politeness that's true uh if you look at like and I always you know I'm a huge Star Trek fan especially the Next Generation which is my my personal favorite uh but I I'm I I'm working through like dpace 9 and I enjoyed Voyager and stuff too but um if you look at how they talk to a computer it's incredibly uh imperative but it's also very declarative in the sense that like they're telling the computer exactly what to do but the computer is also able to kind of make inductive leaps and figure out oh they probably meant this or this but the way they talk to the computer is not like hey how are you doing computer could you please do this they're just like computer XYZ you know and the computer goes and does it so in a way like communicating with a computer that doesn't have feelings doesn't care about like doesn't have a physical form doesn't have all these different considerations emotions that the humans have it can be much more efficient and direct and you can give it like you could just give it a big line of like code essentially instead like where it would take forever to like articulate exactly what you want code can be much more succinct in some instance for explaining what you want to be done so while I agree that you know there's this book called snow crash that I read when I was a kid and he has like a librarian and he has these conversations with the librarian and the librarian teaches him everything he needs to know about whatever topic he's is is relevant kind of just in time learning and stuff like I can definitely understand like a computer embodied in kind of like a hologram or something that that has like a role like oh I want Mark Twain to be my my professor or something like that right at the same time there's a of value in just treating the computer like a computer and just saying you're Google you do this go do this now you know this is how you get things done you know and and understanding why the computer does what it does how it does like you were saying like understanding how Google has changed over time the more understanding you have of the tool the more you can kind of empathize with the tool and what it's trying to do and and kind you have that kind of theory of mind for the computer you're interacting with right yeah I mean I think what you're talking about in terms of proactivity is really interesting to me um we can talk more about proactive Computing and also contextual Computing which is something I'm super interested in right now later in this I've never even heard the term proactive Computing can you tell me what that is real quick just so proactive in contextual Computing is this idea that very soon we're going to be able to use information that we have about people um like context on for example the transcript of this podcast or like screenshots from your computer and also like be able to just start doing things for you I don't like this is starting to get sort of scifi but if you've seen like even like some of the Marvel movies or her with walking Phoenix and Scarlet excellent movie yeah these are ideas of having AI assistants that are capable of doing things for you without you asking asking them to do that which doesn't really exist yet you still have to like hold down and say Hey Siri which I just triggered Siri but like you have to ask for things still you have to ask chat gbt to do XYZ for you in the next couple years I think what we'll start to see is these assistants will like send you a notification and be like based on the conversation you just had like XYZ or like hey Quincy I just finished um you know listening to your podcast recording I edited you know these things and I'm ready to upload it when you are and then you just click like yes and then it does it for you and like sort of automating tasks that you don't necessarily need to do yourself is something that we can start to see over time so proactive contextual Computing like really cool yeah what you were talking about before though um about programming I mean I feel like that's what programming is is it's a sort of more human version of machine code like it's a way for like levels of abstraction that we're able to use like something like python for example is like a lot closer to natural language than something like assembly or C um so like I find that really interesting too is is the ways in which we're communicating with computers already starting to have more of that natural language element to it and it'll be interesting to see like what future programming angues look like um given that we now have this ability to sort of compile cross languages um with like large language models and so on or or at least that that will get better and better over time something I want to ask you actually is what you sort of think the future of this world looks like the future of programming the future of online education given that we have all of these new opportunities and resources that didn't exist like a year or two ago in the same way and that are constantly getting faster and more accurate and less expensive yeah I mean I I think the vision of The Librarian from Snow Crash is is pretty apt uh you know it's it's like a 30yearold novel maybe um but it's I mean it given the Computing resources given the amount of instructional designers and teachers and subject matter experts and stuff who would compile their knowledge the movie Her which you mentioned the operating system that uh is voiced by uh gosh what's her name uh yeah scarjo um that is the product of like millions of programmers they say it like millions of programs have contributed code that ultimately went into this and if you think about it like you know a similarly complicated application like Google search for example may have at this point hundreds of thousands of contributors that have worked at Google over the years and worked on that right so we can see how all this software would get layered on top and and also if you consider all the content being absorbed legally or illegally we're we're not going to talk about that debate uh but you know the common crawl and every Wikipedia post every Reddit post every free C Camp Forum post of which there are hundreds of thousands you know being uh absorbed by GPT and uh you know thus in the great plagiarism engine that is them uh basically it could it could kind of reproduce this and and again I don't want to act like I don't want people to get the the vibe that like oh I think you know uh one way or another cuz my thoughts on it are very nuanced and complicated and they're still forming uh but as a human writer who's written hundreds of Articles over the years I'm probably subconsciously cribbing all kinds of stuff from The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or the Atlantic or the New Yorker or like all these other Publications that I've read over the years like different ways of saying things different ways of thinking and at what point was that an original thought you know who knows uh that that's almost like a philosophical discussion though it's not a programming and computer science question but what you asked about original yeah yeah is is anything original can we have different breakfast flavor cereals or have we tried them all or they all just variations of the same you know uh few tastes or something I don't know but what I will say is I think the idea of a tutor a one toone student ratio uh teacher ratio is pretty amazing and I think in some cases a t two or three student to one teacher kind of like if you go to a fancy school like yo you probably have like seminar courses where it's a very small number of Learners and one professor and you get that benefit of just being in a small group and having a lot of intelligent people asking questions that maybe you yourself wouldn't have thought to ask uh around you that is very good good too so I do think that we're going to continue to have classes where there're you know more than one student but I think a lot of education is going to be with a software system and let me be clear free Cod Camp is a software system free Cod Camp's Core Curriculum is essentially you could almost say like an AI in the sense that it's running your code it's evaluating it it's returning test information all the things it says are based on okay this condition didn't meet we didn't meet this condition and some instructional designer like you know Jessica or Naomi or Chris or one of the many people on our instructional design team has come up with like messages that help guide you almost like Socratic method did you mean to leave this you know uh this curly brace out or did you mean to uh not close your Loop or something like that right like like that's the the dream is asking you questions and guiding you toward the answer that you discover for yourself because that method of discovery that that moment burns into your memory like what you did wrong and that's one of the things about programming that's so amazing is you can sit there with a AI that's been built by thousands of contributors to free Cod camp and you can have an interaction and you can learn programming and the intelligence of all of those people is kind of like represented in the software that you're using that's guiding you to uh an understanding of how to write a sequel query or how how to write you know a python for Loop or something like that right so yeah yeah I I think that uh that's that's the future I it's an extremely broad question but but I think that's where things are heading is just having a extremely intelligent systems that people interact with in addition to you know I I don't think teachers are going to go away uh I I do think that classes are going to get smaller uh and I think they should get smaller because there's you know the only reason that you go to a public school and they 40 kids in there with one teacher is it's an economic necessity for all practical pedagogical reasons there should be like three students in there or one student you know I I just uh I and I think we're heading toward an area where there's such an abundance of resources that anyone who wants to learn anything will be able to free probably pull up something that's dedicated to teaching them that specific skill a lot of that may be video which is what you know your media uh has been recently uh with with the video courses the three video courses that you published on free C Camp and I still think that that's a great mode even though it's not interactive people can code along at home and they can spin up the server and they can you know clone your repo and they can do that and and that is some degree of interactive but I really think the gold standard where things are heading fully interactive fully like you know everything considered by a human teacher who has subject matter expertise and I I do think a lot of people are going to kind of paper over a lot of that human expertise by just like oh the AI can do it but the the AI is going to be mediocre frankly it's only going to be derivative it's not going to have the kind of flashes of insight that a human teacher has in my humble opinion and maybe eventually it will but we have no idea how soon that will come to be and we may be stuck in this Paradigm and things people may think things are going like this but they may actually be doing step changes you know we just experienced a step change so sorry this is not the let's interview Quincy Lon podcast I did not mean to just talk for a really long time but I I think a great deal about these things and I know you too what do you think yeah I mean well first of all like that that's why I came on the podcast is I wanted to hear your thoughts about all of this um I think that you're absolutely right that things are going to become more personalized um more generative um and then like what you were saying about like Interac gamified like I I think things are going to become more gamified in the same way that like like right now I use I use du lingo like every day um and you can debate how like effective that is at teaching you um like a language I use it as a supplement because I'm also taking a language course so it's just like it makes me feel good about myself to like do the Dual lingo every day but it's really effective at getting me to do it every day I'm at like a you know more than a year streak at this point um um and I think that that kind of sort of like dopamine pushing um like structure to a course could be like very effective in getting people to get through those um in a way that's also like more fun like for example like I took a bunch of courses online that were were like for credit for school and those courses were structured in a way where they were you would watch like 3 hours worth of videos and do like 20 Pages worth of readings or something and then you would answer a 10 question quiz and then you would repeat and to me that just feels like maybe not the most a missed opportunity man is it like what if the questions were sort of interspersed throughout all of that materials that you were being checked on how you understood it as you were going through it versus like right all at the end like I think structurally our education system hasn't changed a lot in a really long time and this is an opportunity to sort of revisit like first principles what is the purpose of Education how is like what is the most effective way to learn um and that could be different for different people I mean I personally find it a lot more entertaining and enjoyable to work on projects like when I'm when I'm trying to learn a CS course I prefer CS courses that you like you were discussing where I'm spinning up an environment and like doing something in real time while I'm watching the video versus like just like watching lecture for 10 hours and then doing something but someone else might prefer the latter so it's like what's really nice too is that there's a level of personalization that exists within auditing in the sense that you can just pick what's better for you and then do that you sort of get to pick and choose and build your own curriculum and something that Sam and I spent a lot of time thinking about was this idea of like Pathways that you could create your own that it didn't really auditing didn't stop after you finished one course then it became about okay now what course do I pick and then what course do I audit and what's really cool is that those courses can be from completely different places you don't have to lied to one school you're exactly I mean there are 5,000 universities just in the US right I mean frankly a lot of those are nothing to write home about but even if you look at like really good universities uh there's still hundreds of them and they have different professors who have different expertise in different subjects and there's a good chance that uh there are maybe like just a small handful of universities to teach a given topic that you're really interested in so by being able to audit you can draw from all of them and you can have the ultimate level of customization right absolutely yeah yeah so you think that uh building tooling around these Pathways which I've been very interested in the first project I built once I you know learned coding was basically uh after I'd worked as a software engineer for a while and I wanted to build my own first big project was basically that it would it would strap together a whole lot of different courses and books um and depending on what you wanted to learn and what you knew and it would like you'd sign in with LinkedIn it would read all your uh LinkedIn information including back then they had like these skills and you could have people like rank you for different or rate you for different skills oh I think Quincy knows sequel sure why not so you get like 99 people that like all think that Quincy knows squel you do you remember that on LinkedIn when they used to have the skills and it'd be like um but anyway it would pull in your LinkedIn I know I'm dating myself um and then it would just use that as the basis like oh okay so you want to go from what you know now to working in uh you know business intelligence right or or using like powerbi and different tools like that to like crunch charge and and figure out where to prioritize resources and stuff like that right like so okay well then you should read this book you should take this course and by the way there's like a critical path of dependencies essentially like you need to know this field of mathematics in order to do this type of programming you need to know this type of programming in order to you know use this type of software or something like that so there'd be like a dependency chain and it would work backward and it would create kind of like a a list of courses you should take but to some extent like how do you know those are the right courses you could build like a big engine and you could have like a you know a whole bunch of people rating the challenges yeah yeah um I think like if I were to do this in a a more structured way like not my University there's a lot of people who have already like made like public GitHub repositories doing exactly this where they're like okay I did like this course and then this course and then this course and this is how I felt about it and I probably check out a couple of those before like embarking on something is like sort of timec consuming and like commit commitment level I think is also for a longterm path a little bit higher than just like picking one course yeah but it's also like to some extent there's no commitment right like I think there's a lot of things I've bookmarked in my Chrome tabs where it's like I want to read this article one day or like I I don't know if you have a pocket for so many articles to pocket that I've never read um so I think that that's also a challenge is like how do you get from that crucial point of that looks interesting at some point I want to read this article or watch this video and my my YouTube watch later thing is like 400 videos that are like a lot of them are free code Camp courses I have to go and clear them out periodically because it just becomes meaningless like I just have this big heap of undifferentiated things that at one point I thought were a good idea to consume you know and I think like that's a good resource to have available and so the question then becomes like how do you sort of flick the switch go from zero to one of like okay I added this to something I want to do how do I actually start doing it and that is often like really just a matter of like personal drive to do something like how excited you are about it like if you're feeling like something is a chore it's not something that you like you're doing it for like because you think you should instead of because you want to it's a lot harder to do it and so at that point it's maybe a good idea to like reflect on on just like why am I doing this um which is certainly something I've done in the past as well yeah well maybe I mean you're somebody who has uh probably a pretty good information diet I would imagine you're you know pursuing your uh computer science degree at Yale uh maybe we could talk a little bit about going to Yale and what inspired you to go there because you know I know that you've got you probably got into lots of universities including a lot of engineering universities like Caltech um what inspired you specifically to go to kind of a stodgy old Northeastern liberal arts college instead of going to college yeah yeah I mean so I I chose to go to Yale over schools that are perhaps like better known for engineering or computer science programs on the West Coast Coast because I like also like really love a lot of the liberal arts classes like there's a there's a lot of like smaller things that added up to it um but I would say the big thing is I personally believe that a computer science curriculum is pretty standardized across all colleges yeah like it's the same data structures it's the same algorithms you're not learning like necessarily like a a novel you know binary tree or something if you choose to go to an engineering school to the same extent and a lot of the curriculum here is also like adapted from other schools and they like do acknowledge that as well often so it's a good enough CS program but it also has everything else that you get from attending a liberal art school and you know philosophy and emology and and different topics like that right computer science rankings if you go to like CS rankings. org. I don't remember which website it is but but there's like there's a lot of websites that like keep track of like CS rankings in the United States those are based on two things which are also kind of the same thing which is the amount of research that gets output by that University which has nothing to do with teaching field yes which is absolutely no like at least in my experience like research being a really good researcher does not mean you're a good professor um and so like a school like CMU for example is very high up on there because they just have number of insane number of Cs faculty it is objectively just an incred school to go to for computer science it's super rigorous it's a great program um but like I don't I think as an undergrad like for me at least having like the highest CS ranking wasn't the most important thing to me like I also spent a lot of time thinking about like the experience of of being a student there um and I'm not talking specifically about any one school here versus any one other school um and I think that's a personal decision that a lot of people have to make for themselves for me at least like I always thought I was going to go to an engineering school back in in high school and it was literally like I went to the preorientation days for for Yale and I met some awesome people and I realized like that that was just where I wanted to to spend the next four years um and so it wasn't n a it wasn't really about computer science I guess was my answer which I I I don't know if that's necessarily like a satisfying answer yeah but I mean that makes sense if if you look at like computer science curricula as like it meets a certain threshold of quality and then it doesn't have to be the absolute best I think people get preoccupied with optimizing for one dimension when really you want your little character Pentagon to like you know be more threedimensional I guess uh I mean like I think it matters a lot more for like Master's programs grad school like certainly then I would spend a lot of time considering um okay like what is this and but then even then it's not really about the school it's about the specific Pi that you're doing research with um principal investigator like the main principal investigator okay I didn't even know that acronym okay it's it's like the the main person in a lab who it like that could be at any school and often it's schools that you like wouldn't necessar like a school like y or Harvard might not be the best school for a particular area of research um and so then it really is a lot more about like doing your research on what kind of um I guess research you want to be doing and then rankings I guess within computer science are more likely to correlate to like the school that you're going to do research on but that's not really something I spent a lot of time considering for undergrad if that makes sense um yeah so just to kind of recap what you just said like first of all CS programs are more similar than they are different generally if you're going to like a State University or if you're going to a good private university like Yale um and you can consider other things like the campus experience I mean uh you're getting to live on a you know 3004 year 100 year old campus I don't know how old Y is it's pretty old um it's more than three like yeah it was founded in I think 1701 so older than the US yeah yeah so so you're getting to like and they probably literally got ivy on some of the buildings it's part of the ivy league um so I can imagine that experience and also you're from the south like I am you're from uh Florida and getting to live up there in is is it in New England I'm I'm it's in yeah yeah I'm lying a lot of my ignorance about the Northeast I've never lived up there but um it's about like an hour and 50 minute train from New York city so yeah it's in Connecticut um I grew up in South Florida never lived in the northeast or anywhere there was snow or it got cold so this is a total shock to me as well did you have one of those experiences like oh my first time seeing snow do you remember that I did have a magical experience the first time it snowed here yeah it was um it doesn't snow that often unfortunately um with like other people are like yay and I'm like I want more snow um but that's just the like inner child in me I guess I I think that what I would say is I have never been like I've never been a student at a at a State University um so I can't compare like I've never been a student at other schools so I can't tell you that ex school I can't tell you they're exactly the same I can't tell you that they're similar I can just say based on like my perception of things I'm very happy with how all of this stuff sort of correlates I do know that I have friends at schools that are like like for example like at Stanford um where they do have like courses that yell doesn't offer in some areas like there there's definitely The Core Curriculum is very often very similar but then there's like elective classes that are really awesome if you go to a school that's a lot more focused on computer science for example um but you know there's pros and cons with everything so that would sort of be my breakdown of of computer science at at different universities and and I'll just say like a lot of people watching this are or listening to this uh are probably thinking like why are they talking about un like I I'm like in my 30s I'm in my 40s I don't care about universities move on to something interesting quy but I take university courses all the time uh like I I audited courses I'm a 43y old dude right like why am I doing this because I like learning and I think that it's like a huge Competitive Edge that so many other people are you know sedentary and like oh I'm just going to tune out and like watch Netflix or something and I'm sitting here learning as much as I can right uh anyone can benefit from the courses that yell is publishing online right and and like certainly I've I've taken a lot of Stanford courses uh computer science courses over the years because I just studied at a state school and I don't have a computer science degree I actually have a degree in English right because I was an English teacher so um just because we're talking about universities and and you may be past University age don't don't completely tune out of this section because there's a lot to be learned and a lot of the benefit of having all these great teachers in one place teaching courses and being able to publish them on the Internet like we can reap the benefits of that too even if we're in our 30s and 40s and and if you're somebody who's High School age and you're considering going to get a University degree um we've got the guy who created College compendium right here maybe you could give some advice to people who are like just some quick advice to people who are younger like you know maybe 16ish uh thinking about what they're going to do in the future whether they should go to university do you think people should still go to university I mean I'm biased because I I am currently a university um I think like there's a lot of factors that go into that decision um and like some of them are personal some of them are family some of them are Financial some of them are like what your goals are um to do longterm in life I think that going to University opens a lot of doors like having a University degree does help you get a job after the fact especially in computer science um but you don't necessarily like need to do that there's no like one path in life um yeah and you don't have you certainly don't have to go to any one school there's like this idea I think in in high school that like there's um like this this track Like they definitely push you in high school to apply to college as like sort of the next PATH um and like for a lot of people that is the right choice um and for some people it's not and that's like a personal choice you kind of have to make um but certainly what I would say is like it's worth it to learn computer science regardless of if you're doing either of those things like I think that a lot of the computer science that I learned I learned before coming to you um and it wasn't like in a high school classroom necessarily either it was through platforms like free code camp like solo learn um like learn being a mobile app that people use sometimes uh to supplement free Cod Camp I've talked with the founder uh yeah yeah there's a there's I mean there's literally a million amazing free resources to learn like literally anything you want to learn not just in computer science but like in any field um like available already on the web and so I think it it really just boils down to like what are you interested in learning about and then actually pursuing that like something that I I've learned recently is there's actually a Wikipedia app um mhm and this Wikipedia app will just show you information about all kinds of historical events that happened on like today like each day and it's just sort of like a simple random way too that you can just discover a lot more knowledge than you like previously had um and so like I think if you're a curious person there's a lot of resources like that that exist that are free and even if you're not that curious it's it's a supplement to your curiosity because I wouldn't necessarily think to learn about for example the Tower of knowledge I was in uh Pittsburgh and there's this University that built this they wanted to have like an educational skyscraper and it was so intriguing to me like what's the Tower of knowledge like I never would have thought that but I just happened to uh be reading like the Wikipedia article of for Pittsburgh and it just mentioned that and I was like oh what's that and I I like learned all about this fascinating structure uh the tallest educational building in the world basically built maybe like 30 or 40 years ago maybe 50 years ago uh but it's like so intriguing and you know this this information will just come to you if you keep your antennas out I'm hoping that at least some of the things that you're hearing just here on this podcast you know inspire you to go and learn more about topics one topic though that we do want to talk about absolutely is ethics and everybody's eyes are probably glazing over oh my goodness AI ethics and machine learning right like most computer science programs and we did like a a survey of the top you know 50 or so computer science program most computer science programs this was part of us essentially assembling the Freo Camp University degree program and figuring out what to teach to whom and uh Sam Sam cromby was also involved in this effort and huge thanks to him we're going to have him on the podcast in the near future as well but essentially ethics is completely under taught in my humble opinion it it it's it's almost kind of like a punchline a joke like oh business business ethics as as though there are any ethics and something is Cutthroat as business right or AI ethics as long as though computer scientists really care about that but actually a lot of people do care about uh AI ethics and there are a ton of ethical considerations and it's not just um thinking in terms of like what does it mean to be a good AI right A lot of it is there's real world risk because these these models are being deployed and and you just created this entire 2hour course about it and uh unfortunately it was like one of your least popular course it's just because I think there's not a lot of interest in ethics but maybe you could use this moment to kind of like give people an idea of why ethics is important for programmers and Computer Sciences scientists especially when they're working with AI models I think I would frame the course as sort of everything you need to know to have like a conversation about AI like maybe like half the course is about ethics a lot of the course is also about just like what an neural network is and like how to talk about a lot of these philosophical questions that are really interesting about artificial intelligence and which like make for interesting conversations like the black and white room experiment or um the Chinese room experiment is another famous One um the ethical questions are also there and also important and I think the reason they're important is because of the just sheer impact that these tools that we're building have um like we have what's really amazing about computer science like in my in my opinion the thing that I think is the the coolest about learning to code is the fact that you can like make a website or make an app or make some application something with code that it impacts literally every person in the world who has internet or like who has access to that yeah you can push free C Camp and anybody can open any device that has a browser and they can go there and they can consume that instantly and that's just insane like that is amazing and something that like is by far to me the coolest thing about like any of of programming or the Internet is just the sheer level of impact you're able to have like if I taught the same I did teach this class this AI ethics and machine learning course that I taught um for free free code Camp I taught it to a small group of like 20 high school students um before that and I spent a lot of time teaching them this course and I'm sure like it was really cool to have that experience of teaching this like in person um but maximum 20 people can ever experience that versus like theoretically anyone who wants to you the viewer can watch this video course if you're interested and that's really special to me um but what it also means is that whatever you say in that course whatever um you put in that website or application or how it's designed even if you're like not really thinking about it or it's accidental or it's incidental um can have a really big impact cuz there's like a a butterfly effect um for really small things that that are like really really dangerous at scale that's why like programming and and design of good programming it's really important to think about for example like when you're taking a class on data structures that things run in like you know o of one or o of nend time like you want your time complexity to be low not because it really matters when things are small but because it really matters when things are big and you can apply that same idea or principle to AI applications and deploying them in real world environments like if you're building a selfdriving car yes we should definitely talk about this because Cruz has been in the news and apologies to anybody who works at cruise but like that company was a total disaster based on what I've read about it like I've never seen uh well that that's hyperbole I I've seen very few companies that are so flippant with safety uh I mean it's amazing but uh just to give you some context uh I heard uh that in this report that was conducted and one of the reasons Cruz is no longer in operation it may not ever be in operation again uh I did not know that yeah really they took all the cars off the road after billions and billions of dollars in investment in San Francisco right yeah yeah so what happened was um uh a woman was like bumped by a car hit by a car whatever she flew over into the path of the crew Cruise car and the cruise car basically dragged her for like 20 or 30 ft while it was trying to pull over cuz that was what his programming was is like oh there's been an accident I need to pull over so he's dragging this woman who's in critical condition now I think she did live but you could imagine how like some decision like oh if there's an accident just pull over there's no consideration for like what if somebody's like right in front of the car or like you know how how can you be sure I'm I think that they probably had sensors in place to know whe whether somebody was being dragged like huh that's weird we're like driving really slow or the is the parking break engaged or something I don't know but um it came out that like their AI system had difficulty identifying small children and yet they were in production like the cars were on the road so you can imagine like if they hadn't been pulled lots of kids might have gotten hit by these cars I mean like they weren't just on the Road Quincy I rode in one like the last time I was in San Francisco I've been in selfdriving Cruise like literally like God in one I'm sitting in the back there's like a panel in between you and the wheel and it's just going on its own yeah that was a pretty crazy experience it was actually it was really funny cuz we were trying to go from one like location to a location that was maybe like five blocks away and it did the most circuitous route it possibly could have like I think it was like a 40minute ride for like something that could have been like a 10minute ride um but I think it's maybe sometimes you look at Google Maps and you're like why is it taking me all the way over there well it's just the software is not perfect right a human Taxi Driver would be like a lot of yeah SF has a lot of really like difficult roads that I think they just try to avoid in general so that is my assumption for why it don't ever drive the street yeah they really wind you one um so all that to say like I I definitely think I like is a very obvious example of how like an autonomous vehicle um which granted is a really difficult thing to program um like I like yes like it you know obviously that's a really bad situation um that they they should have been pulled for for but it's also like it's it's a very difficult thing to build a selfdriving car absolutely 100% that is perfect right out of the gate G and I guess like the the the thing of AI safety AI ethics um it is important because it doesn't matter as much when they're really really small numbers of those cars on the road just in like one city right yeah but when you scale it like like time complexity scale it up you have millions of people taking rides it starts to get a lot more dangerous and even though like in theory selfdriving cars could already be safer than human drivers there's all of these like complex questions about accountability like who's responsible when things go wrong like if it's a human driver we know who's in the wrong always like it's one of the drivers for the most part um but when there's a selfdriving car involved it adds all of this extra complexity that we haven't really figured out yet to my knowledge like how that's going to work um and so there there's like a lot still left I guess yeah there's a lot of real world encroaching on this beautiful engineering problem isn't there yeah I mean because the real world is complicated and like in a perfect world autonomous vehicles could probably be ready to like drive like today yeah the the difficulty is human drivers and human pedestrians are like really difficult to predict like some guy might just fall asleep and swerve into the the car or like some pedestrian might decide they're going to make a a run for it across the street even though the cars are going and it's a red light for them because that's what humans do and it's really difficult for cars to predict all of those possible outcomes and then also make the choice that like saves the most number of people or like or or protects the do you protect the person in the car at all costs do you protect the most number of people there's all kinds of interesting questions as well within that like that can be thought about I think interesting ways and I actually don't think the trolley problem is that interesting of a question here yeah I I don't either but I do some of these things uh you you have to choose whether you want to just leave the switch alone in which case this train is going to go and kill five people or if you want to hit the switch in which case this train is going to dout and it's going to go kill one person but when you do that when you hit that switch technically you're sentencing that person to death right whereas in action you can kind of like oh it wouldn't me but so it's kind of like a philosophical question but one thing that I loved about the web comic is how people imagine it and it's them standing at the switch trying to decide what to do and how it actually is going to be when when like things are deployed at scale and you've got all these systems making these decisions is you're one of the people on the track and somebody else is making the decision or some AI engineer has already kind of made the decision in the code as to what is supposed to happen in this situation and you're the one who's going to die for their decision that's one of the reasons that ethics is so important is because we want to make sure software Engineers who are designing these systems like selfdriving cars care about it and think about think things through and have a framework for you know dealing with the messy reality the complexity of reality yeah and I mean like these things are also like not everything is life and death but since we're on the topic of life and death like one of the to elaborate on my my major one of the and why I came to Yo actually yo is one of the the best schools in the world for spefic specifically politics and like geopolitics International politics um and my my four major is computer science and Global Affairs so I did some work I do do some work in the intersection of those things um and like over the last year I've done some work in like AI policy area and I had the opportunity to learn a lot about a lot of the things that people consider like existential risk like what are like some of the really dangerous things that exist with with an AI that you actually should be scared about as someone who lives in a free democracy um whether that's you know potential micr targeting that could influence elections in the next like 6 to 12 months or even something like a a bioweapon that is like a another Co that could be easily created by some of these models yeah AI is speeding up drug Discovery but it's also speeding up discovery of other things that you don't necessarily want to discover ex exactly like there's like sort of a like it's such a powerful tool and like all tools it's you know like a hammer you can use it for good or you can use it for evil and we have to like do our best to make sure that these tools are deployed in ways that are like ethically responsible and like don't harm the human race like as much as possible um and not everything is like about like the singularity like this idea like oh no get all the headlines I mean a lot of people but you and I I don't think we've ever talked about the singularity in our many conversations I think we have I don't think we've ever talked about Skynet taking over the world and killing everybody uh not everything is movies like I think the the the real world ways in which AI is applied are much are very are also really important and less discussed um for example in hiring and in um recruiting like I is examining resumés it's like a first pass now in a lot of places um and there's a lot of studies for example there was a study that that Amazon had where like they're they were using AI in their recruiting process and it was in some way discriminating against different groups of people without like people really even realizing it because the problem with AI systems in general and this is like a problem that you can really boil down almost all of ai's problems into um from an eth eal question is that they're black boxes which is to say we really don't understand in a lot of cases why they make the decisions they do yeah um and we also don't therefore have a way to like just we we can't argue with an AI when it makes a decision if we don't know why you can't even ask it why it made the decision it did and it might just lie understand decision he made it might just come up with some kind of like postao like story to like oh oh I gave you this recommendation because what can I say here that'll sound plausible you know well it's like when you use Chachi BT right to do math it's actually pretty good at doing math now or writing code but that's because it's like also like calling a specific function to like run MTH problems and code that part of it versus just doing it using what it was originally doing when you first launched chat gbt which was just like the same sort of text generation it was always doing um and that's because there was like a lack of understanding of what the math actually represented like you can think of these AI models specifically within the large language model context as like really really really really good autocomplete and it's really good like almost like it's magical almost um until it isn't and the more you use it the more you realize that there's sometimes like a lack of understanding that's really critical um and that problem is getting resolved in multiple different ways like it's way more accurate now than it was when it originally launched yeah um but it's also something where you can liken it there's a really great article that was written by the author of this book um claraa and the sun I think or maybe it the son maybe it was the over story I'm not 100% sure which which author wrote it um I had give me the link to that and I'll add that to the the video description SL podcast show notes yeah it was about how chap PT is kind of a blurry jpeg of the internet yes I read that I read that that's a really you read that you read this article yeah great article um because it's also supered lossy yeah it's a loss it's not a lossless um program and so what you're seeing when it Auto completes is kind of like it trying to like recreate the space between um and sometimes it does that well and sometimes it doesn't and that is also what's happening in a lot of these cases with AI models making making decisions where we are trying to like understand how they're coming to those conclusions and and we don't always understand that um and so like when it comes to AI policy AI ethics AI safety it covers so many different things right from Deep fakes to disinformation to um you know this like existential risk of bioweapon to or just more mundane stuff like really empowering scammers like AI can just you can scam at scale now in a way that you could never do if you had like a call center of scammers uh Opera it's really good at writing spam it's really good at helping people like cheat on their plagiarize yeah um because it's hard to detect and they ways of circumventing the AI detection algorithms that exist and AI is very bad at detecting AI any AI if you're a school if you're like a you know a Chief Information officer at like a university and somebody's trying to sell you AI detection AI plagiarism detection software run the other way that stuff does not work everybody I talk to says it's basically a crapshoot and it's just a cash grab like because I wouldn't describe it as a cash grab but I would describe it as a cat game where like each of them are like constantly getting better at fighting the other thing in the same way that like a vaccine or like a medicine um over time the pathogens learn to resist the medicine and you have to come up with a new I that may be the case but in the case of gbt 4 they people ran a bunch of uh like a bunch of academics ran a bunch of tests on gp4 and said like hey was this content generated by gp4 and even the most powerful llm ever created could not reliably detect AI generated text so it makes depends on how deep you want to get into that but there's like a couple things they're using to actually detect that um yeah let's go deeper into that because I'm very interested in that as a teacher uh and somebody who talks with teachers all the time and tries to you don't want to have false positives where you're blaming your students for plagiarizing when they didn't it's much better you know I was it Ben Franklin that said I'd rather like 99 men go free than innoc guilty men go free than one innocent man you know face execution or something like that right like you want to air on the side of caution and you don't want to like because it's incredibly demoralizing and disruptive to people when they're taking like some sort of exam and like you've been flagged as a cheater by this AI or um people submitted an essay and their teachers like yeah it looks like it was plagiarized but you didn't plagiarize can you imagine how mading that would be you worked your butt off to like create this you know uh term paper and some algorithm written by some you know edtech company education technology company is like oh we we feel 95% confidence interval that you cheated and like now your ecademic record is Tainted just because somebody did a bad job of coding software uh yeah I mean uh maybe you can talk about the state of plagiarism detection yeah I mean so I think you're right like all of this is really boils down to um type one and type two error which is if you're not familiar with Statistics false positives and false negatives right um and actually that's not just the issue at hand for plagiarism detection that's the issue at hand for all AI stuff like all of the these questions of like for example like do you want more of um like what are you trying to select for what is worse like would you rather have someone not get hired because the AI is screwed up or would you rather have the AI like select for this thing over some other situation um there there's like a lot of complexity that exists when you're trying to deal with systems that are really really really um black boxy like yeah um yeah I mean there's no this is the fundamental problem in AI of interpretability like how did the AI come to this conclusion and because it's an inscrutable neural network we don't well people are working on this this is something that's getting a lot better already like this is because it is such a big important thing that a lot of research is currently going into interpretability and it is something that does exist for some models so it's not correct to say that like no AI is understandable AI systems that we can understand yeah that was hyperbole so so real quick we have a course called No blackbox AI uh taught by Radu Dr rodu computer science Professor uh from uh I think Finland uh don't don't blame me ru if I can't remember exactly where you're from but uh he uh basically teaches you how to build an AI where you can understand what's going on but my understanding of the stateoftheart is inscrutable systems blackbox systems and you know um AI that we can actually understand how it's making decisions interpretable interpretable uh AI systems are so far behind and most people are just going to go with the most powerful option they're going to they're going to go with uh you know gp4 instead of some other system where they can necessarily tease out exactly what's done and in some cases you will want a system where you can do that but there's always going to be the temptation to grab the much more powerful tool that's harder to understand and just for context the YouTube recommendation engine that you know recommends free Camp videos to people we don't know how it works and we've talked with Engineers from YouTube and they don't necessarily know how it works either they're like why does it's really good though yeah it works great but I mean it always that's exactly what I wanted to watch yeah um so I mean if you I worked on to to elaborate on what I meant before um I took an NLP class yeah natural Lang processing um and for my like final project in that class I tried to do some some research and work on making AI like chat GPT generated text undetectable by a lot of the biggest AI detection software like um I think like originality AI is one of them um turnit in.com is another gbd predates AI stuff they they they've long been in that industry of like cheating which again I'm a skeptic of if you haven't if you can't guess I'm very critical of that industry and I think it redu it produces a lot of false positives uh people who are well meaning who did not cheat who suffer consequences because they were incorrectly labeled as a cheater well my my goal here was to see if it was possible to do that and also then like how that sort of worked um so basically there's two things that AI detection software typically looks at yes um the two like areas one of them is called perplexity like a perplexity score yeah maybe what that is it's like how well language models can like predict um the word sequences that an AI model will generate because like they're they are derivative and therefore like like when we talk about like uniqueness we kind of glossed over this earlier about you were saying like you know is there anything truly unique well it's hard to say but it is true that with AI models like you're able to end up with the same output if you give it the same exact input and and other like very specific details so might be like slightly different word but the general thrust is similar unless you crank up the temperature yes but like I guess what I'm saying is an AI model like I I sort of said before chat GPT is just really really really really good auto complete m M theoretically what what it's doing literally all of the time is just trying to predict the best next word based on the previous input sequence of words yes and so in theory you could do sort of a reverse of that and figure out like okay what was the most probable sequence of words and then if that matches what the student inputed then there's a high chance that they used AI for that that's one thing the other um like thing that they measure is called burstiness burstiness like burstiness to burst to explode kind of burstiness kind of it basically means like like repetition of repetition of phrases but also like when when a human writes we don't write sentences of equal length or like of of us like we usually write some short sentences followed by some longer runon sentences followed by short like humans don't write perfect sentences okay um perfect paragraphs a do burst a burst of Fire from a you know automatic weapon sorry to to use that analogy but that's what I think of when I think of a burst in terms of it's kind of like uh it's like a similarity score yeah it's like a similarity score between like sections or between like different pieces and so those two things combined or how like something like gbd Z Would detect to my understanding to be clear like I didn't work on their tools so I not 100% sure but I I sort of look at that as two like statistics that people use to me um How likely it is that the text is AI generated and the challenge here is as you said before AI is just getting better and better and gbd4 writes text that's way more realistic than any of the previous versions of and and also like we have open source models now like llama like mistol um that are getting better and better that will like eventually I think we're going to see sort of a like model parody or almost like a like there will be a baseline level of quality ac across these models very high computer science programs that us universities yeah one of the challenges humans are humans are not that good at English also like a lot of us like I write sentences with bad grammar all the time like and I'm a college student um if you're like trying to detect plagiarism in like an elementary or middle or High School setting like the average middle schooler probably isn't writing like great essays and so it's going to be really hard to tell um in a lot of those cases like is that actually something they wrote because even if they make like a couple tweaks it it it almost asks the question like do we need to change the way in which WR like writing this tool that has been around forever is that still the best system for like like what is the purpose of writing yeah it's to sort of help you like check that you understand what you're talking about and so the CH the problem is that like if you use AI to write your essay for you that doesn't actually prove that you understand the thing like the process of writing is a process of revision and editing and it has the same outcome which is you turn in this paper but it do I mean the actual deliverable is a piece of paper with words on it even though the process that I go through as somebody who's not cheating is read a bunch of Articles synthesize that into an outline synes SP that outline into anart whereas you know a person who's cheating would be like hey I need to write a term paper on XYZ write me a 500 word you know 10,000 say on this if you want to hear a fun story about AI plagiarism and then we can move on from this top yeah I mean I could talk about this all day but I don't know about the audience if they really care that much about it so I one of the things I I learned when I was working on on some of this last year um was have you heard of Unicode lookalikes Unicode lookalikes yes yes so Unicode characters uh there are thousands of them every Chinese character every uh Arabic letter every English character and then like emojis stuff like that and sometimes you'll find characters that look very similar that uh like is that period actually a period or what language period is that because like Japanese periods look different than English periods and stuff like that so characters that look very similar to the human eye but actually have different Unicode values is that correct that's exactly it and what's really interesting what's really interesting is this has been fixed at this point because they realized that this was a huge vulnerability these these plagarism detection softwares but something you used to be able to do was you could just write something in Chachi BT and then contrl f for like every instance of the letter e or the letter A or something and then replace it with a Unicode lookalike of the letter e or the letter a and it would like completely make it like the burstiness perplexity scores would just explode because in in terms of um like how unlikely it is that it was AI generated because AI doesn't generate text with Unicode lookalikes that's like such a unique character cuz they're not trained on text with that stuff and like AI is not actually looking at like the letter it's looking at like the machine representation of the letter right so um that in itself I guess like yeah and AI would never swap out the you know e for like some you know IPA like International Phonetic alphabit equivalent e or something like that that looks the same a human probably wouldn't do that either and so they figured that out and that was like that was like an exploit uh that was an vulnerability it was exploited that was probably closed hopefully by the AI detection industrial complex uh and uh as a result people are having to move on to different attacks just like any sort of security vulnerability would be patched like there you know Apple discovered that do XYZ to crack a phone and suddenly you know they've got a fix for it in the next release Auto downloaded and we move on and people keep trying to discover these you got all these security researchers so it's a similar kind of arms race to what we have yeah with any other security consideration I mean so like still in the vein of like talking about AI use cases within you know an education system but not necessarily in the same context of plagiarism I suppose it could be be viewed as that is that like AI also writes really good code really really good code um in a lot of cases it's really good at debugging your code it's really good at figuring out like what exactly is going wrong in a memory leak it's really good at understanding error messages um and there's all kinds of new tools that exist now because of that like GitHub copilot and cursor if you've used cursor I've heard good things about it yeah there's a lot of even vs code has Integrations now for that so if you're like a developer chances are you've seen this stuff or you've used this stuff and you also can use AI to write a lot of your code like there's a lot of code that exists that's boilerplate there's a lot of code that exists that is like writing a react function or something like a a hook like this is something that you do a lot it's replicable there's a lot of training data for it um and so it like begs these questions of how should this be used in in production settings and how can it like improve our workflows um and I'm actually very optimistic and positive about this because I think it's going to do I'm not worried about AI necessarily replacing a programmer um anytime soon because of complexity across like entire projects like AI is very good at writing one file two files three files um it's not yet capable at least I haven't seen it be capable of like writing an entire full stack project from scratch like maybe extremely simple proof of concept type applications yes like like maybe something simple a simple game that people have made a million tutorials for maybe a website it's not going to be able to build some crazy like full stack application um by itself in one go without someone who actually understands coding can connect the dots and so the way that I see this sort of playing out at least for me in my use of this has been use it to write like a function or two or help me understand what's going wrong within the code so it you can be like a 10x developer in terms of the speed of your your code output but you still have to have like this sort of higher level understanding of how you're connecting all of these pieces so that you build like software that compiles and runs when you're talking about these really large projects with like 50 plus files because like speaking honestly like that's most big projects if you're working at a big organization or a big company or a big personal project or startup like it's likely your code base isn't that simple and especially if a couple different developers have touched it in anytime has passed codebases get very large uh I mean build the context window of llm is pretty small even then like the more you give it the more confused it'll get by stuff it could be many years and many uh kind of like engineering breakthroughs before you could feed a large Legacy codebase into um into well people are working on this yeah I mean it's an active area study but we'll see it's very much a Never Say Never situation um I think like I've seen already some people have built really cool tools that you're able to like give a GitHub repository to and it like reads through the whole GitHub repository and figures out opening issues right and it's able to like explain your code base open issues like these are like really cool use cases um but there's a difference between being able to like understand a code base and being able to like write the whole code base from scratch and I don't I don't know I mean like I think we'll see improvements over time and that's when the really exciting things about this field and this this area not to spend so much time talking about it yeah well whenever new tools come out developers should learn them so I mean this is fairly meta but for this week um maybe not as much meta is Apple but what do you think of the New Vision Pro and like what spatial Computing means for Education like when I see this I I Envision like a couple years down the line or sooner being able to interact with like physical manifestations of like a binary tree or a hash table or like computer chip like abrac things that are like ideas in a textbook and bring them into the realm of like something you can you can see and potentially even touch um I think it's really exciting for a lot of kind of mechanical engineering things for sure maybe for some semiconductor engineering uh but it may also be a helpful tool for understanding you know abstract software Concepts like data structures algorithms like seeing how the data Cascades through a particular application like you know we see all these different Renditions of programming in the future uh I think the show Westworld had one that was pretty cool with like the tablets and of course yes uh the computer interfaces from Minority Report where you have to stand there and move your hands around all day and like you have to be incredibly fit just to use a computer and the world of uh Minority Report but I mean I've always been like very excited about these just from a wow perspective you know like watching you know Iron Man and seeing all the different interface you strap something onto your head and it's essentially like augmented reality and so you can put whatever you want in physical space Microsoft has done this for quite a while with the hollow lens I'm sure there are some good industrial applications uh I will be amazed if it really makes that big of a difference over just looking at a 2d screen like I can represent a lot of stuff really well in 2D on a flat rectangle thing that I'm looking at and it's true good yeah absolutely and you know as Sergey Bren observed if you hold the the screen like a screen that's like this far from your face might as well be an iMac screen you know in terms of like how you're looking at it well that's Pro kind of is right like I think for me like like obviously like VR has existed for like a decade now and you could already do these things where you like move around with objects and virtual reality like using the meta Quest or Oculus um but what's interesting about the app this new Apple device to me is that it's like the best example of um like not really AR cuz you're still looking at screens reality reality it feels it feels like you're still able to see your surroundings so you're not like in this enclosed view you like can kind of see things like in your real life I don't know if this is necessarily like it is still like very early very expensive but um maybe there is a world where that's something that people use for more than just entertainment um yeah I don't know I I think a lot of it comes down to like cost like yeah if you're a wealthy person and you want to have a a system on a chip like laid out in front of you so you can like look at all the different you know components of you know a processor um yeah that's great but until there's like a huge install base of people who can afford to do that who's going to write the software for it right that was like the Google Glass kind of chicken in the egg problem nobody was really that interested in Google Glass and Google was working very hard to try to get people to develop for Google Glass but I knew a lot of people in San Francisco Silicon Valley during the time that Google Glass was like Rising before they kind of abandoned the project uh and I don't think anybody really built apps for it because the install base was so small so you have to get like a big enough install base for people to start really building meaningful apps but like assuming that they can solve that business case problem and that there are really cool you know experiences that you can put in there I have yet to see like a killer app for VR like my understanding is is there something about the way the brain works and the ears work and stuff like you can't really move around in VR without feeling a little sick so almost all the you know VR type games have been like experiences where you have a fixed point of view or you're like sitting somewhere and you're able to look around or you're on like a you know a roller coaster or something like that because that's not going to make sick well you're also fundamentally like wearing a ski mask right like it's it's difficult to move around with that weight on your head without you know recognizing that you have that weight on your head um I do think there's a couple crucial differences with the Vision Pro because it's Apple that solves some of those problems um one of which is it's Apple's ecosystem already so all of your photos all of these applications that are on the app store by default are like also on the Vision Pro as 2D screens and that's not exactly building for the Vision Pro but it it solves a lot of the utility issues that I think other like devices that are starting from scratch have um the other one the backward compatibility by the way video game industry backward compatibility has also always been like a huge deal PlayStation 3 can play PlayStation 2 games yeah well I actually think that's one of the challenges that Apple faces is Apple's never really been a gaming company and or a company that like people go to for games and that's one of the main applications of V up until now like Mata has a huge advantage over them on that specifically but you can also just like mirror Dem Mo your PS4 or Xbox to it if you really wanted to if that's something you want to do yeah and to me at least the big difference here is this being Apple I find it unlikely they're going to have and if I think I think they'll put a lot of money into it I think years of R&D are ahead like the iPhone wasn't a perfect product as like the first iteration of it it didn't even have an app store as the first generation of it but like by the time the iPhone 5 or the iPhone 6 rolled around it was like a mass Market product that like basically is the same iPhone that exists today with like some minor changes yeah um and that's like one of the best products ever made and so to me what I'm really excited about is not this really expensive Tech demo that exists today yeah but where's where's heading where is this going to be in five years that's I'm I'm really excited to try that and like I I think that the people who are excited about the Vision Pro today are like really excited about that future too um and you're sort of like thinking about spatial Computing not to go back to contextual Computing but like I think to me one of the coolest things I can imagine is like I I'm wearing context right now right but I I I have glasses I almost always wear glasses when I'm like in classes and stuff um what if my glasses just also like had a screen to the side that was able to show me information about what I'm looking at or who I'm talking to or what I said the last time I talked to this person or when their birthday is or is keeping notes during class or is up relevant information just putting a clock up there would be pretty awesome right like never needing to know what time or which direction am I facing am I facing a clock the weather Direction like there's so much information that like having a HUD um or an HUD like around yourplay yeah yeah um could be really valuable and like so I have a I I know someone at Yale um who's working on these like glasses that are glasses that basically make captions it's like subtitles for your life um and he's working with the Stanford kid to do this um and to me that's like a very early application of what like the longterm potential of this is yeah um which is to like be able to like have all of this additional information I mean well you mention subtitles for your life like literally subtitling I don't want like some simultaneous translation app like telling me what somebody's saying and in my ear I I'd love to just read subtitles when I'm talking to somebody in a language I don't understand or something you know what I'm saying like think of what a game that would be so helpful for me yeah yeah so that's all very interesting um where this is possible to go I'm glad that our yeah I mean I think there's tons of like obvious utility if you can get it to work in the form factor of like a pair of glasses even pack you get the all that stuff I think they'll get there little weird mask yeah I don't want to wear a weird ski mask and I also I want to actually be able to see things and not rely on the software like I'm never going to feel comfortable like driving or something if that could like short out and like suddenly I'm completely blinded or something like that cuz the past revision is actually like they render what the cameras are seeing it's still a screen yeah it's not a past through screen and and to me I'm a lot more interested in AR than I am in augmented reality virtual real I think for the Practical reasons of AR is like informational VR is like experiential like I I do play games uh like I'm I'm a big fan of like Doom Eternal and like the the really deep gameplay of that that came out a few years ago and when I'm playing the game it does not matter what like how big the screen is or anything like I'm I'm in trance there was this great uh documentary about the history of like industrial design that I watched a long time ago I can't remember the name of it it's I think it's by the same guy that did the helvetica um documentary if you haven't seen that that's a really good one but basically they had this like you know German engineer who's talking about like I built the perfect laptop look you can do this got all these different designed factors and stuff and he he gets this made and then he he gets a prototype and he sits down and he's using it and he realized very quickly like once you start actually using a computer all that other stuff just melts away and you're just focused on the task at hand you don't need like you know 4K you know giant screen like you don't need like a lot of the usability interface like you go back and you play an old arcade game from 40 years ago and it's just a joy stick and buttons and you can kind of mesh with that game just as well as you can with you know a modern game where you're using like a keyboard and the mouse or something like that right like it's really amazing how the human brain works how we're so able to tune in and tune out all the noise and really just focus on things so to some extent I do almost feel like using like VR headset is an over Overkill really like do I really need that is it really that much more immersive than what's already going on inside my brain yeah so I've always kind of been skep I I don't have one so yeah I can't really speak to that um yeah and in terms of like yeah there's an argument that reading a book your mind is doing all this stuff and it can be almost as a Mir of experience reading a book as it could be having like some VR you know educational experience now some people might argue that like they're completely different and the use case is completely different but uh it it really just depends on how into reading you get and how powerful your mind is at bringing up these representations and stuff like that um yeah yeah I mean I don't mind I don't want to sound like a lite or anything but like books are great and books are going to exist as long as Humanity exists maybe not paper books I don't think there's really like a strong argument other than like Nostalgia for having a physical paper book you can have like a nice backl screen sorry I I know like half the people in the audience are probably like ah what the heck quizy I love K are great yeah love Kindles yeah yeah but but like the notion of text as an interface for your human brain it just carries so much information you know people say like uh a picture's worth a th words well depends on the words depends on the picture you know like a few words like uh Ernest Hemingway wrote like flash fiction he had like this sixword story which I'm going to tell you right now for sale baby shoes never worn just those six words like conveys like an entire kind of like mood and I mean like it'd be hard to capture that in a picture in the exact same way is that you know the sixword story captures so like six words six words are worth a thousand pictures I mean it just dep if you if you think of this video I mean this video is probably tens of thousands of pictures right it's 30 frames per second our words matter a lot more than like the picture of me in this room with exactly like if you just showed the picture outside of context you'd be like okay it's quzy it's some other guy uh who yeah the audio matters a lot more right um yeah like there's so much more to like education and I feel like the education industry if you want to call it that like because it is industrialized much to my chrin is around chasing these things like oh if we could get everybody a hollow lens or you know we we could completely change the world got everybody a Smartboard or we got every kid like their own laptop or something like that and that's not necessarily like there's a lot of technological solutionism in education and I'm much more of a back to Basics kind of person like I I obviously I see the value in video see the value in multimedia and stuff like that not just reading textbooks but I also see the value in going up to a whiteboard with somebody and sketching out you know things and and learning from them in that way too uh so the old ways are not necessarily you know abandoned you can just expand your repertoire but I would absolutely say that like in my my opinion most education should probably be textual because it's just an extremely efficient way of communicating things and you know like I I kind of look at I'm an old man yelling at a cloud right uh like Tik Tok and like watching a 60c video that's trying to compress all this information into you get into a a loop of information grazing where you you're getting like really superficial topical kind of information but you're not really going very deep at all so that that is one thing where like I value the fact that people put out these lengthy podcasts like I listen to tons of podcasts that are several hours long uh I I watch tons of video essays on YouTube that are like three or four hours long right and I learn so much more from those than I probably would have learned from watching you know however many Tik toks that would be like 200 Tik toks about the same topic right uh just because there's going to be so much repetition yeah I mean people covering the same thing over and over um there's a really great article sort of a or like essay along the lines of what you were talking about with text um it's called text is the universal API um text is the universal API by Charles Dickens yeah um but very much like sort of speaking to the same thing that you were talking about this idea that like it always has been and all like will be the main way in which we like language is so important in how we understand our world um and convey information it's just so efficient it's so effective um yeah and I mean one of the reasons AI is so good at generating images is because it uses text to like reason about how to generate images like if you look at a lot of the new tools like dolly or uh what's the one that uh there there are several ones uh what's the one that you use Discord to talk with um for some reason it's escaping my memory the really popular one that people use to create all theour mid Journey mid Journey yes it's mid journey I think yeah yeah um I mean for me like the most mindblowing thing the the first mindblowing thing that I saw with like all of this AI was um NLP techniques of just like creating vector vector space um of words you would just embed like 10,000 of the most common English words and then you could do arithmetic on those words to do like King minus man plus woman equals Queen yeah and that like you could represent words and like their relationships Through Math that was just incredible to me and that you can do that with all kinds of different words and that you can do that then with um Finance the transducers and and you can um eventually like get to something gpt2 which was really the first time I saw something like a generative pretrain Transformer model um and it was just like absolutely mindblowing like very very early version of these AI image generators that could do like a 32x32 image um and immediately you're like look this is going to be revolutionary um and that is something I was lucky to be exposed to early through doing research but it's also just a um I don't know like I I think it's going to continue to improve over the the coming years yeah it remains to be seen whether we're going to get giant step changes like we get with you know GPT morla like is it is it going to be morla um or faster who knows um it's too early to say right yeah so I I just uh and you know we we've talked a lot about AI ethics and stuff like that one of the reasons I don't really care to think that much about you know whether we're going to build Skynet is because I'm not convinced that the growth rate is like that right now I don't think we need to worry that much about it I'm not saying you shouldn't worry about that but I don't think that that's the most immediate concern the more immediate concerns are misinformation scams and stuff like that I mean so I agree with that I think the argument that people will make is that it's not a like linear thing or even an exponential but that like there's just some kind of breakthrough that hasn't happened yet that's sort of like we have no idea when that breakthrough is going to happen it could be several consecutive breakthroughs that need to happen but they could happen quickly or they could and who knows like I like if you talk to the best AI researchers in the world like the timeline is all over the place between them so that's for me like why like I'm not an expert on this this is not something that I should be like my opinion doesn't matter very much um and therefore like I I just try to like stay out of those conversations for now one thing that you do have probably a very nuanced opinion on is physical activity as a programmer I I I know that uh at Yale you're a captain on the running team and I can only imagine how good you have to be at running and how into running you have to be to like pull that off but uh maybe you could talk a little bit about running and the role that it plays in your life yeah so importantly I'm a captain on the club running team not the okay Verity running team um they are incredibly talented Runners on like the official team um we do it for fun um but it's a I ran Varsity in high school and then um continued at Yale it's a great group of people to to run with um and I think like what's really interesting to me within the context of our conversation which is focused obviously on audience of mostly programmers or developers um is that there seems to me to be like this huge overlap between people in this ecosystem and running just so many software Engineers I know also like that's their like chosen sport or like mechanism for exercise along with maybe like some lifting or something but um and I have to be very candid that I used to run a lot when I was first learning to code and recently I switched to kind of like what I call Mall walking just because it's like lower impact and it's a little easier for me to like digest a podcast when I'm not hearing thp Thump Thump Thump you know uh it's just a little bit more mellow and you still get a lot of cardiovascular benefit just from walking quickly uh but um but yes I also was a programmer who ran a lot and so it's not lost on me that I know a lot of other programmers who run a lot too and have are very passionate about that type of activity well I guess the thing that I'm interested in asking you about or or talking with you about is what you think it is about running that is just like something that meshes well with yeah people who like to program to to do software engineering um because I have some thoughts on it I think yeah I mean I'll throw out some naive guesses uh it is a way to decompress and it's something that you kind of do automatically like once you start running you don't really have to think about it too much you just keep going and it gives you a lot of time and space to like maybe think about engineering problems you're facing or think about what you want to do next with a given project I mean that's exactly what I do too um I think like there's like definitely the element of it's just something you can do that's like good exercise while also letting your mind sort of like roam free um um and you can either think about what you're working on or you can sort of let yourself have some time to decompress distress um but it's also about I think to me this idea of like like I think a runner's higher like a there's almost like a flow State you enter into when you're running longdistance running because I I do specifically longdistance running um that you just sort of like get into it and it's a very similar feeling I think to the feeling you have when you sit down to like do a like pretty like intense programming session um of like really being sort of zoned into exactly what it is that you're doing right then um to me those are actually very similar things I I was curious if you felt um the same way definitely like I there's this old saying that like there's this old joke that you know what's the purpose of a program body is is is to keep their brain off the ground right like that's how so many programmers and developers and I guess you could say knowledge workers by extension have treated their body let's go eat some fast food we got to we got to get some sleep real quick everything is kind of like it's you're you're almost like paying lip service to the fact that you have a corporeal form that has to be maintained and uh I think that's to people's detriment if they neglect their their health um and running is something that really you know boosts your cardiovascular your respiratory Health um probably has all kinds of other positive knock on effects because historically like you know ancient humans probably ran a lot a lot more than they do to today you know whe whether that's running toward prey or running from predators um and there's there's something that does feel really good you get get all these endorphins when you run so it it maybe it just boosts your energy level it boosts your ability to to think I mean like I said I I feel like I get a lot of these just from walking and again I'm a 43y old man who uh has a lot of like weight just from like working out for years and years like it is kind of hard on your knees if you go running and it's hard on your lower leg too uh so people who are listening to this I know and people who have mobility issues and stuff like I wouldn't say like oh just throw to the as side and go run but I would say any physical activity you can engage in is probably going to be a virtuous circle in terms of improving your productivity improving your ability to think improving your your ability to sleep improving your energy level like all these things uh your body is a machine and you want to make sure that that machine gets regularly used and doesn't just becomes this thing that you kind of like spite there were so many years of my life when I was a kid where I was just like man I wish I was just like the lawnmower man I wish I could just be everywhere and do everything and like not have to think about like oh you know uh what am I going to eat for breakfast or oh man it's it's late I need to get some sleep you know like I didn't want to have those uh limitations I wanted to live in a realm of pure abstraction and have that kind of power of being a disembodied you know entity right probably tale is old as time I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote about this in Greek myth ol or something somebody giving up their body to become this omnipresent spirit that can do whatever right um but the reality is you have a heart you have lungs you have a brain you have all these other things in your body and you need to to keep those sharp if you want to be able to perform and you know I'm optimizing for longevity I want to live to be 100 years old I don't think there's any reason uh unless you have like genetic disorders which I don't seem to have uh I've I've been very blessed in that regard I went and I got a colonoscopy ahead of schedule because I had blood in my stool and I was concerned about it and um thankfully no cancer uh but you know you want to be on top of those things an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and a big part of preventing things is exercise right that's like the the health exercise or like the uh the the diet exercise sleep triangle right the thing that everybody should be thinking about as they age so anyway this I'll get off my soap box but that is my immediate response to why I think so many programmers are Runners because they're also probably pretty smart like well adjusted people who who do want to optimize for like a long healthy life yeah I mean and it totally is a great way to do that um I think on the subject of of viewing bodies as machine um and this might be a great like last question to talk about on our podcast today um we've talked about a lot of like different scifi and and interesting media related to programming or technology or AI today from Westworld to her to I think you mentioned Minority Report and Y A couple others but I guess like you have any recommendations for me like what are your favorite like books movies um TV shows within the genre medium like for any of the listeners maybe go check out I I have also read and watched all of the things you just mentioned and they're all amazing yeah I mean I would just say like if you haven't seen her you should watch that that's definitely the best kind of Singularity movie I've ever seen um I think it's the most realistic frankly I think the machines are going to just be these kind of benevolent like they're just going to see humans as like oh whatever you know like go do your little human things we're going to be doing our super intelligence thing over here you know there could be some dark feature like I used to watch a lot of like cyberp Punk and dystopian stuff and read all the William Gibson novels and all that stuff and I I'm not that pessimistic anymore I'm much more optimistic so I think her is is pretty optimistic as a movie in general like if we're going to have a singularity hopefully that's the singularity we have where the AIS are too interested in like recreating Mark Twain and talking to him than uh than like figuring out a way to like you know turn all the humans into paperclips so to speak the the famous Nick Bostrom paperclip problem of if you give it an AI something to optimize I I mean rather than recommending science fiction movies and stuff books like I'll be completely C I don't have a lot of time to to consume fiction these days almost everything I watch is like a documentary but um again any good ones of those her her would be my recommendation again probably everybody's already seen it rewatch The Matrix uh Trilogy a lot of people like bash the the second and the third one as not that interesting or like bad CG or something um computer generated imagery CGI but I genuinely think that's a really wellmade and I haven't seen the fourth one but I I genuinely think I haven't either the early the late 1990s early 2000s Matrix movies if you rewatch it there much deeper than you may have realized when you were a kid watching them and what it says about artificial intelligence what it says about The Human Condition if you really go down that that rabbit hole of like understanding The Matrix there there's a lot there like I I watched it uh maybe like five or six years ago I watched all three of them and I was just like wow so like like I never got any of this as a kid I always thought the machines were bad right they're trying to kill everybody but then the more I watched the more I realized oh this is actually like you know it's a dystopian movie because humans make it dystopian in a way so I would recommend rewatching those and maybe reading some of the the fan theories and stuff like that I'm not sure if the the orasi sisters have ever publicly talked about like exactly why like what the story is supposed to mean or anything but there's a lot there and it's of course certainly the first one is an amazing movie it's one of my favorite movies of all time so would you take the blue pill or the red pill Quincy uh the red pill is the one where you go deeper in absolutely I would take that yeah because I mean I would want to know I I wouldn't be content like that guy that wants to get put back in The Matrix I would never want to do that like once you know something you can't turn back you know you got to be true to yourself you can't delude yourself um and I think most strong you know people would would not succumb to that kind of uh temptation of wanting to go back to being ignorant I don't think there's any uh turning back the clocks what about you you probably have a lot more recommend what are what are some uh some science fiction uh that you would recommend if people want to have a good feel for like AI good cases bad cases oh the expanse the creators is pretty good they they've said in the future AI like in the expans universe AI doesn't even really matter that much like it's doing all kinds of things passively like what you were saying earlier about like contextual or what was the term you used where AI just figures out what needs to be done proactive Compu proactive yes so there's tons of proactive AI it's like figuring out like all the different little minor calibrations that the ship needs to make while the pilot is sitting there actually doing like the most I guess important highle decisions and then those decisions are cascading down through all throughout the ship systems so AI is there but in the expans universe AI is not that Earth changing of a thing or I guess solar system changing of a thing it's just a thing that is a tool that they use and there wasn't some like big AI war or anything like that in the expanse history uh that was just you know how they do it and to some extent Star Trek similarly AI is just another tool it's one of many fascinating Technologies alongside teleportation Tri quarters you know all these different tools right yeah um the expans is a great one although there's not a whole lot of like AI as part of that story um I think if I think about great movies that are in this this area or genre um absolutely love both Blade Runner movies um those are both really good this don't sleep on the sequel It's good the sequel the sequel's super underrated um with Ryan goling absolutely like I think the maybe equally good depiction of um like a personal AI as like the one in her um exmachina is also one that people sleep on sometimes um good movie I saw that yeah um I also like I I think there's a lot of really good TV and and books in this genre um Westworld is very sadly cancelled I'm really like I only saw the first two seasons the first season was much better than the second season did you watch the first season was incredible yeah I watched the whole show there's four seasons actually oh okay um I think that they sort of went back to basics with the fourth season um and then they kind of left I think they knew it was going to get canceled so they kind of left it on like an ending that's sort of unsatisfying but still like relatively ties things up kind of um but that has so many interesting questions about Consciousness and exploitation and um like what it means to be human versus like uh an artificial intelligence or a machine like definitely really interesting questions that aren't fully explored but like are at least asked kind of in the same way that like L does um Dune is actually really interesting even though though there's no AI in it because their history of Dune is that there was this like massive AI war and then they just like got rid of all the AI afterwards that's very battles Star Galactica so that's another show like I watched like the I guess it was the 90s battles Star Galactica early 2000s and that is all about Ai and the dangers of AI you can't Network computers because the moment you network them you run the risk of them becoming super intelligent and plotting against humans and they're they're basically fighting this entire race of artificial beings that they've constructed and they've been at this this ly War and the machines are trying to annihilate the humans really cool yeah I mean I mentioned claraa and the sun before um but that book is also about like sort of a a dystopian World in which people are like sort of genetically um designer babies um but also they have like AI tutors sort of that live with them it's like a very um like sort of Slice of Life Book that has like some deeper subtext um yeah I mean I think there's like even something as simple as like Mary Shell's Frankenstein like these are books that don't really have necessarily anything to do with AI like in the surface level um but it it fundamentally is about like mankind trying to like sort of play God yeah and what does that that's is on some level what we're doing here and what does that mean for us to be trying to create like intelligence beyond our own um there's a lot of interesting questions there yeah and what does intelligence beyond our own mean because humans when you group them together can make pretty big important decision I mean you could argue that like the economy is a whole bunch of IND you know individual self you know um I guess selfinterested actors that has the net effect of us having you know this abundance that we have today for for example right um so like emergent behavior from different species like leaf cutter ants uh we we were uh we were hanging out with some leaf cutter ants the other day and uh my kids were terrified of them but we we spent some time watch some documentaries about how they work and stuff it's fascinating and it's just emergent behavior from lots of entities together and uh yeah so will we have a super intelligence that not
