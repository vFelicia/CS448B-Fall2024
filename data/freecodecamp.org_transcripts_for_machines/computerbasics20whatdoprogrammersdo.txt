hi it's Briana from free code camp in this video we are going to be talking about what programmers do programmers are also sometimes called coders developers or software engineers and what all of these people do is they take ideas and turn them into functional code now it's not just the creating the code it's also maintaining that code and all the things having to do with keeping it working and healthy talking about how a computer looks at code specifically JavaScript the computer looks at code one line at a time and as you're writing code you're going to notice these numbers on the left hand side the computer will literally go down line by line making sense of what each line has to say now what I've written here is not actually relevant in JavaScript there is no that feed method but the point of this is it does it looks at number one says oh that's a comment I'm going to ignore that and move on number two verbana equals new teacher it processes that and then moves on everything is done sequentially just straight down so if I were to try and write something up here that referenced something down here we might have a problem if you're going to reference something make sure the information that it needs is above it because it does go down linearly now that might be a little bit complicated really all you need to know is it just works down just like you would read a book The most important thing to take away from this video is programmers take ideas and break them down into little little tiny steps and write them in a way that the computer can understand them
