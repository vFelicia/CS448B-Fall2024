all right today we're going to be talking about data networks you've heard of networks before maybe a water Network a road Network even a television network or a cell phone network today we're talking about data networks which are the networks that computers use the three types we're going to cover in this video are the local area network the wide area network and the virtual private Network a local area network is just a small group of computers that are connected together the most important thing about a local area network is that those computers are close together so your WiFi at Starbucks or at a school that is local area network that you can only connect to if you're actually close to that a wide area network is two local area networks that have been connected over a long distance so maybe a School in Colorado wants to connect with a school in Missouri they could use a wide area network you might think that those are connected over the internet and in the case of a virtual private private Network which accomplishes basically the same thing as a wide area network it is vpn's use the internet to connect their two local area networks however a wide area network will usually rent a cable from an internet company and connect that way so just to review a local area network is a group of computers connected close to each other a wide area network and a virtual private Network are two local area networks or more that have been connected over long distance es the wide area network accomplishes this by renting a line from an internet company and a virtual private network does it over the internet
