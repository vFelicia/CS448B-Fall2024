Loops are one essential part of programming and in Python we have two kinds of Loops while loops and for Loops while Loops are defined using the while keyword and they repeat their block until the condition is evaluated as false so here's a while loop with a counter so you you start the counter at zero and then while count is less than 10 we're going to print this count equals count plus one so it's going to increment the counter every time until we get to the end and other type is the for Loop so using four Loops we can tell python to execute a block for a predetermined amount of times up front and without the need of a separate variable and conditional to check its value or items here and then four item and items for each item in the list we're going to print the item pretty straightforward
