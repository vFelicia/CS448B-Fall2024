hey everybody welcome to live covering with Jesse and today we're gonna keep working on our homepage so I just finished turning that card that we had made on Friday was it Friday yeah anyway so I just finished turning that card into a component so that's what you can see on the screen here probably can't see it right now it's fonts not big enough but make the font a bit bigger we could see that we have this profile card now and so we've replaced a lot of the code with this profile card now this still is a lot but once we put this data into a different format may be imported and you know then it wouldn't really be that much and at some point I would imagine this data would be populated from graph QL but for right now we're gonna hard code this and just so we can get things ready for my presentation first presentation is Thursday yeah Thursday so over the next two weeks I'm going to be presenting this website to a lot of different people here at the university that I work for so I need to get that ready and the launch date potentially is now pushed back a little bit I still would like to launch it on time which would be by the end of the month but having to present to all these people is really gonna slow that down so I'm still shooting for them but realistically it may be later we'll see I did have a question here Michael said I thought Jesse tweeted he was sick and wasn't going today I tweeted that yesterday so I was sick over the weekend but I'm feeling feel better today and let's see hey Anna how's it going and hey everybody in the in the live chat so I'm gonna start out let me give you the link to start with so you all can see this the link to the repository with the code is in the description to this video and now you can actually see the site as we're working at on it with that end Rock link so end Rock if you haven't used it before heard about it and Rock is an awesome little tool and it lets it lets you share a site that you're working on locally with anybody online who you give the link to so it really helps us here on the stream and we were given full access to an unlimited amount of users using the link at one time which is really awesome so check out and Rock if you get a chance I've found it to be very useful and I'm probably gonna use it for maybe one of these meetings okay alright so first thing we need to do then is let's commit what I've done and push that to the repo so you all can see that and then we can move on so let me commit that first and then I see a few more questions in the live chat that would be good to address first before we start any coding so let me commit and then all I'll answer the questions all rights to get status oops can't spell there we are yes can I steal my spell oh no that one worked let me know if the fonts too small as well I can never tell from my screen if it's too small not okay so pages and profile yep that's exactly what what I expected to change which is good so let's do get add and we're gonna add that little dot afterwards just means we're gonna add everything and then go do yarn cm this is something we have set up for our project in particular you wouldn't normally do this unless you you've set up your project this way but if you do want to contribute to this project when you go to commit type yarn cm instead of a normal git commit and then you'll you'll have these options to be able to more properly format your commit so let's add victim I guess web teacher can phone no breaking changes I so this needs to whoa oops I guess I forgot to remove some of this which is a common mistake at least for me so let's try this what's the command it sneaky watching right now Nikki told me about a command I could use to not have to type this all in again and now I can't remember what it was what was it let's just try see and can I get no retry that's it the retry flag thank you our shed said two dashes yeah and thank sneaky that's so much nicer than having to type it all again all right awesome so we'll get push and now that's available on github so y'all can check out how we pulled out what we had done last week and now it's its own component and all the styles of course are in this component as well so we were able to remove some styles from this main index file let's see oh there was an error it didn't catch that let's see oh okay to reoffer the link profile link that's fun Oh 58 that's odd that the committe went through even though we had an error I thought it wouldn't get through so why a nun props file a same and lank at profile card 58 we should not have a class name unless somehow this is being passed down because it's in card actions ok harsh it said it's not air just a warning okay if I have to guess with that error or warning is about I'm gonna say potentially since we have this link inside the card actions something's going on with this yeah that's that's what I'm guessing that material UI is attaching something in here in particular class name because we're not obviously we're not trying to put class name on the link component so with scarred actions okay yeah so for now I guess I can live with that warning let me double check yeah everything's displaying properly so I'm gonna live with that warning for now I would like to sort that out at some point before we launch but I need to get this looking good so I can't really get sidetracked by that right now because running out of time to update the look here and speaking of the look let me pull this over for those of you who for whatever reason can't get on and rock you know this is how we're looking now let me make it smaller since we're primarily looking at the the mobile view this is that component that we had made I asked my boss about the italic which is what we had gone over last week and he said he preferred this instead of the italic but he would like some type of like icon that's quotation mark or potentially even like a watermark thing behind this you know that's a quotation mark so probably put that in that's not really a priority right now if anyone wants to you know try to see how that would look you know feel free to open a pull request we'll check it out but I'm not going to spend any more time on this component right now what I can do and I probably won't do this on the stream when we wanted a different component but now that we have this component we can put in what we want I'm going to add you know a faculty profile and alumni profile and throw in some different content and I'll be able to use that to display the homepage at my meetings all right so now let's work on let's work on this events I know this is an important section to my boss the events and then the news which did we even make that you know we didn't so let's start out with this events one and work on it in particular we're definitely going to want I think the images need to be a bit bigger that's at least for me this is really hard to see something that small it would work maybe if our events were just maybe somebody's face and it took up most of their you know the area but that's not how the events are going to be and also needs some sort of description I would think since we're talking about events here it might not be a bad idea to put a date now eventually we're probably going to want to connect this with some type of I don't know event service so maybe Eventbrite maybe just a Google Calendar I don't know so the data for these events is not going to come from our WordPress CMS it's probably gonna come from somewhere else we don't need to worry about that right now for the presentation we'll just hard code some stuff all right I did say I wanted to address one of these questions in here before we coated why was it okay Alexander asked do you have any projects that we can work on with you yep pretty much any of the projects that are in the fu s Markham github organization which you can get the link to this project here and then from there you can easily get to the organization and see our other projects but pretty much any of those projects you can work on check out the issues for each project and that'll give you some ideas on what still needs done or if you notice something that really looks broken you could bring up an issue or open a pull request and you know potentially you know that could get merged then pretty much every pull requests for the most part does get merged in occasionally it will need some work before it it's ready to be merged in but I try to work with everybody so if you're nervous about you know submitting pull requests to projects these projects that we work on for the stream are a great place to start because I'll help you out as much as I can to work on your pool request alright so let me get started we're gonna use this Pomodoro timer you go for 25 minutes I do need to make sure the stream we can go maybe like an hour 15 minutes total with this stream so I have some other stuff I have to go somewhere a little bit later and then after that I have a meeting with my boss so the afternoon is going to be very full all right so let's check out this component so we're going to be in the index dot JSP in the pages folder so in the pages folder index and I'm gonna shut this because will mostly be working in here first so what we'll do is we'll we'll edit it directly in here get it looking like we want it to look and then maybe later on probably not on the stream maybe on the stream you'll see we'll turn it into its own component and make sure that it's customizable enough that we could use it for multiple things all right so right now we're using this builtin you know lists that is part of material UI we could keep using it oh sorry so let's yeah let's kind of see how what the limits are of this component and see if we can work with this to make it look the way we want it to look and if not then we could you know try to build something else so let's go back and just work within dev tools for a few minutes so let me adjust this a bit okay we're up here so the first thing I'd like to adjust then is this image yeah so this container for the image currently is the images are 40 by 40 and that's a bit too small let's see if we can go 60 you see how that looks whoops okay a bit bigger not too bad you know also I want to I want to check this out on my phone so we really want this to look good on a phone if you need to I'm gonna be constantly kind of going back to my phone so if you can check this out check out that n drop link on a phone that would be ideal and I'm just gonna copy this and send it to myself so that I don't have to type it up on my phone it's okay so now I can see this on my phone and obviously the changes I just made aren't gonna be visible on my phone because I just didn't dev tools but this gives me an idea of what those images look like on the phone and they do look way too small even on a phone let me know if you're getting a lot of weird noise from my phone being close to my mic if you are all try to do a better job of holding my phone farther away Michael is asking why not use the responsive mode and dev tools I do use the responsive mode sometimes but it just doesn't look the same as as a phone right and and to get that that real feeling of like the scroll and touching and stuff it it just doesn't give the same feedback so I like to actually look at it on my phone too you can also I mean it doesn't have to be an Grogg so you know potentially I could do this yet application no that's not it I can't remember where I guess I'm not gonna do it because I can't remember where to go I gotta set it up is it Network No I don't remember at all where to go to set this up did you remember where to go to to use a phone with dev tools open localhost 4040 all right let me check this out oh cool thanks are I didn't realize that you could get a nice UI like this with end rot that's pretty cool so I can see all the requests that are going through right now awesome anyway the 3w you used to be able to do there we are remote devices yeah that's have been uses throw up for a while so couldn't remember how I used to use this okay so that's for forward so 3088 alright cool that works so I should be able to go then too so for you or you can use Angra of course but for me since my phone is directly connected here I should be able to just go to ports while local hosts 8080 and I can see the the site here so I can't actually see it and the advantage of doing it this way is that changes I make in dev tools will show up automatically on on my phone so anyway just for those of you who want to do something like that when when you're developing then you can plug in your phone need to enable that so enable remote debugging which you can there documentation linked here and dev tools but so you go up here to your little menu and then go to more tools and remote devices there's a lot more tools here now than I remember there being the last time I checked this maybe I need to read those release notes more those there's what's new things here I always just skip over them because I'm usually in the middle of something okay anyway so I still think this is too small actually that's weird I thought I would automatically reflect changes on my phone but I guess it's not that's really weird hmm oh you know what I gotta open up another inspector that's why okay so here's the inspector that I can I need to change for my phone so maybe I won't do it like this because only I'll be able to see the changes right now unless I I guess unless I show my screen which I don't really want to go through all that right now okay so I'm just gonna stick with n grog on my phone so it'll be the same as as you all have anyway which might be better for the stream so if I was developing by myself and not doing a stream then I do recommend using dev tools and opening up that second dev tools window and then you can see the changes live you know right there in your phone it's a lot faster for now I'm just gonna do some changes here and since I'm not here we go see we'll switch over to this mode yeah let's just pick a phone iPhone 4 okay so we'll switch over here so it's kind of you know simulating a mobile device and then once we get some values that look like they'll work then we'll actually put them in to the react component and when I save then it'll update an end grukk so then we can all see it on our phones oh let's see how its set I should got timed out by the but it's funny I guess we have a bot now that stops people from spamming kapps so are all of our shits messages got deleted oh no oh whoa okay so watch out for that now everyone I suppose we have a button here now that might have been put in so since we're doing that 24 hours a day music stream I guess that was probably put in to stop people from spamming and in that channel so or on that stream I'm assuming so anyway so note no caps okay so this is a little bit bigger this might be too big yeah that's too big let's drop it down then let's go to 80 I will try 80 and go over here I think all right list item is the class that we use let's go up here to our list item if you're not familiar with react there are lots of different ways to do styles this is one of the ways so we have a JavaScript object and we're putting our Styles inside that object so it's very similar to CSS but you can see the format is that of an object and not you know your normal CSS format so where's my list item did I read that wrong the class is list item that's odd so we have that class but I'm not seeing it up here that is what I want right listen that's our or would it be a versa maybe we need that on the avatar do we have styles coming in here no we're not adding any additional CSS so let's try to put a clasp right here on this have it's our last name and let's just call it avatar well you know what it looks like we're already adding some classes somewhere else let's find it there we are okay so we can put class names right there on the avatar alright so that should work then so let's go ahead and put it on a few more of these so I'm not worried about the formatting we have Auto format unsaved here so we should be fine after so I'm using that class that CSS class here as the key and then the value is going to be an object that has key value pairs and the key value pairs are going to reflect what we normally do and in CSS so in this case we're just going to do with height and so I'm gonna copy this to save time and you can see we've already done some things with great points here we may end up doing that again but for now I'm just worried about the mobile view so let's take this down to 80 and save it oops forgot a comma area and they don't like that comma there okay oops I thought I fixed that great for fresh area just didn't refresh automatically okay that looks alright I want to pull some data from actual events that we have so I'm just I'm gonna move this over on the other screen so I don't have to keep flipping back and forth and I'm gonna grab some some events that we actually have going on right now so let's go back here and put in Class A in this front one where we have our primary text I'm going to say in crisis American higher education and put in these are the actual events that are appearing on the home page of the website right now all right so oh yeah okay so let's see how this looks with actual titles okay not too bad this definitely needs to be larger I mean the font size needs to be larger this is too small especially if these are the titles so I'm gonna just hard code some fonts in here just to see what we want let's try 16 pixels which I guess is a default anyway 16 mm I wonder I really don't like the way this looks with the titles on a small screen here now I mean this is a very narrow phone most phones aren't going to be this narrow but still maybe maybe at some point when the screen so small we just don't include the images at all for events or we will have to come up with some other thing because I don't want to go very much smaller for these images it it'll be very hard to even see anything the other alternative is if for events let's say we don't use images at all but instead we we have a date actually the main site right now does not use images for the events they just have a little date icon maybe we should maybe we should do that we could potentially make the component so that if an image is passed to it then we do display an image otherwise it doesn't display the image so we'll still have a lot of flexibility and be able to reuse this component but in the case of events we'll be able to show more info how does that sound let me check my time all right about three minutes I want to see what feedback you all have about what I just explained and I am checking this out on my phone it doesn't look that bad on my phone and this is still with the smaller font size but the IMP the size the font size for the title is just so much smaller than the image is it it doesn't go together so we we definitely won't have any bigger images we need have a bigger font size and that just won't allow us to have very long titles without it looking weird so let me read off some of the suggestions here that some of your thoughts on this Nicki says what about a background image with text on top yeah we could think about that you know what this might be a really good time to check out how things like this are done in a material UI and other circumstances so maybe we'll take a look then not right now because we got a break coming up so I'll take fiveminute break we'll go to the lab chat answer some questions and then when we come back maybe we'll take five minutes or so we'll look at the material design documentation and just see how they do lists and get some examples hopefully maybe we get some examples even of you know kind of news or events yeah there's probably some examples like that in the material design documentation already how Peter says do people even still have iPhone 4s I don't really know that was just the first thing on the list so I clicked hit but I mean it I think it's better to so this is I believe the narrowest tongue you can have is 320 pixels so it's good to look at it there because if it looks if we can get it to look okay there it's probably still gonna look okay on a slightly larger phone okay all right so let me I'm gonna go ahead and just take the break now or start the timer for the break now I'm going to scroll up to the top and get through as many questions and comments as I can so if you have a question or comment please put it in the live chat now okay John Hanson said I'd like to see the border on the quote to be a bit more transparent she was talking about this quote yeah we could try a little bit more transparent at this point though I I'm gonna try to resist the temptation to make small changes like that just because of time so I'm gonna try to like put off of those changes for for later for after I have some of these presentations because if I can get right now if I get a few components to be exactly how I want it like a hundred percent done and I go to present it it's gonna look like it's not finished but if I get all the components let's say 90 percent finished it's going to look like it's finished you most people won't even worry about details let's see Anna says this typing speed matter for coding Harshit says absolutely but tools like smart code editors help says code is all about typing logical stuff uh yeah I would I would add as well do you this typing speed matter I would say it's a little bit different so if you go to take a normal typing test for typing speed I think it's different than what a coder would type so the reason the reason is different is so normally as a coder you're hitting different keys than most people would hit right we don't do a lot of data entry we're entering you know long strings of text right we're grabbing data from api's and things all right so the keys that we hit are in odd places on the keyboard not only that but we do have a lot of help from editors right so we just need to type in the first few letters or something and then we hit tab and we're good to go so traditional typing speed I don't think is that important for coding so you know traditionally you have a paragraph you see how fast you can type the paragraph or something like that and it's all just you know normal words the only odd characters you would have or if there's a quotation mark question mark exclamation point period okay it's not not really a big deal but when coding it's it's almost reverse is you're using mostly special characters and very little you know strings of like normal words so I would say what could make up for if you're a slow typer what could definitely make up for it make it even faster than a fast typer encoding is if you get if you're very knowledgeable about all the keyboard shortcuts that you can use with your particular editor so if you are good with something let's say like Emmett which allows you to write your large amounts of HTML very quickly with just a few keystrokes then you could definitely you know code faster than somebody who may be a fast typer but doesn't take advantage of any shortcuts like that so my answer to that question of does typing speed matter for coding is maybe it depends it depends on on what you're doing and what would you take advantage of in terms of what editors can do so actually there was a question about this somewhere I can't remember where it was it was somewhere online there was a very similar question and someone was being kind of rude about the about it was it on I think was on the free code camp forum so there was one response on the forum that was I think kind of really made it seem like speed was very very important and I didn't I didn't agree so anyway but that's my opinion on the subject of of typing let me see okay my timer is up and I got through most of the questions okay there are a few followup comments I think with the the speed thing okay so Nikki says I hate my as AZERTY keyboard as opposed to the QWERTY keyboard so that's the the arrangement of the keys saying the special characters are not visible on my keyboard I said doesn't help I never realized that in assists thanks to the answer you're welcome and a no problem all right there's Ennis had one more followup question what are the top skills needed to get a frontend developer role HTML CSS JavaScript yeah you're gonna need that no matter what as a frontend developer and then depending on the job you might need to know a framework so a framework or library right so maybe the job you want they work with angular it would be good if you knew some angular same thing for react or ember or view or just jQuery so but you can't go wrong with being good with just regular JavaScript HTML CSS for sure now in terms of like other skills definitely need to be able to write reliable code being able to write tests is a big plus as well Harshit I know I don't write tests very much at all so before you say anything I realized that I'm not the best at this but I recognize it's important I'm trying to change right but that's a big thing and being able to teach yourself new things quickly is very very important I would much rather hire somebody as a developer who can demonstrate to me that they've been able to pick up new things and produce like productionready code quickly then somebody who happens to be an expert right now but it's they're very resistant to change and don't like to learn new things right because everything's always going to change if they're an expert at whatever the big thing is right now it doesn't mean that they're going to be an expert at whatever the big thing is tomorrow so anyway that's what I would look for if I'm hiring a developer the in terms of their code you know you can prove that you know what you're doing that's from your projects right from what you have and get up it's a little bit harder to prove the other things about being able to learn quickly I mean there are some ways to do it right I actually like to see on a developer's github profile that they're doing tutorial courses as well so I like to see a mix of real projects for clients or at least like side projects that they're doing and then tutorial stuff even if they don't want to put it on the github I'd still like to see it on the resume and then if I can see like they did this boot camp let's say to learn react and then I look I've looked at the dates and said okay well like they graduated from this boot camp and then pretty much immediately had this production ready react that going to me that signals while they learned enough in that short amount of time to be able to build that that's impressive so there are some ways from the side of someone who's hiring that I try to tell if somebody is a quick learner so I'm keeping that in mind if you're on the other side and trying to get a job you know I would say don't be afraid to list that you've taken a course I mean be selective right maybe you not might not want to say like you know hey last month I took the intro to HTML course not a big deal but let's say if you took the advanced react course from wherever that might seem more impressive like hey you're trying to learn more right anyway hopefully that that makes sense that is decent advice if anyone disagrees please let me know in the live chat okay so let's go back let me take a second I just I got a bunch of messages while I was talking I just kept hearing it buzz I just want to make sure it's nothing workrelated that I need to handle I think this is not for me I'm a part of a team that handles like digital marketing stuff but I'm they're launching something today it's really important but I'm just kind of was like more of consulting on that project so I think most of the messages are about that but I don't have any direct responsibility yeah so that's it so sorry I don't I don't want to take the focus away from the stream but I just want to be ready in case they need help okay let me check the time all right we're still good I think we have time for one more Pomodoro session which I'll start right now and then I'm gonna keep an eye on the live chat if I notice there's a lot of questions in the live chat I might cut the Pomodoro session short so that I can get to all the questions but well we'll see hopefully I am not so focused I forget about the time all right so let's go into the events the last thing that we were talking about was kind of switching up how we do this and let's see yeah let's let's take out this image and then add in a date yeah I think that would be better to add in a more prominent date and not have images for events okay I do see a few more questions if you're just joining and asking a question just hold on after in about 25 minutes I'm gonna go back and answer all the questions so just be patient for a little while longer I'll definitely get to your questions all right let me get rid of this give us some more space yeah so I'm gonna go in here then and take out these list items oops not the whole thing I'm just gonna take out these avatars which it should be the same yep they're all the same so I can remove them all at once and save it now let's see what its gonna look like area okay so now it looks like this which is also not ideal oh you know what I forgot what we were gonna do I was going to go to the material design documentation so material dot iOS material design website just go to our guidelines and let's see if they have a list area lists so we actually have two different lists we have a grid list as well so let's just check out the regular list for right now see these are the lists that actually you know they do have this circular image here and as I said earlier it works really well with with like portraits right so just somebody's face and maybe a little bit of their upper body but with larger you know images like the type of images you might want to have with an event see maybe you don't want somebody's face if somebody is a speaker giving a talk yeah that's fine but you know not all the events are like that so you know might not be bad to have an icon if the events fell into certain categories we could have maybe an icon for each category I guess that's an option all right see you see how we have here this is what I was thinking that would work is if we had a title short description and then some sort of image but I'm just not so sure that we have the space for that we could I mean we do have more padding than we really need right here that kid could give it us a little bit more space Michael said is G fuel time hey I happen to have some G fuel ready right here let me say if you don't stake it up after it's been sitting it's not this is not as good so just the pro tip for you there if you want to use G fuel all right Nickey says the grid list in material design looks cool all right let's check out the grid list so I want to spend too much time on the list so we'll give it just a little scroll here just to see what else is here all right this is maybe more what will end up with something like this without the image all right now let's check the grid list if you haven't checked through this documentation before I highly recommend it if you're at all interested in material design its it's just really really useful oh okay here's the grid list yeah I'm not sure see if we do this we definitely we can't do image only we would need to have the title maybe something more like this but I I kind of I suspect that my boss will want more area for more an area for text you know this just really doesn't give us that much space and if we did add more text that would cover you know pretty much the whole image with text so hmm yeah I really do like this look though I want to keep this in mind in case there's somewhere else on the site where we could utilize something like this I think that's nice it it will require though that we have images you know I you can really use this if only some of what you're putting in here has a good image okay this list controls okay ya don't need that actually if we were to have some sort of control on the list what I would want to have is like something where you could quickly add this to a calendar that would be useful potentially if we can't work it in here we could have it so that when you click it takes you to the event page gives you more info and then you can add it to your calendar there but really it saves users from having to go to another page if we could put it in here so I think it should be in there if we can so let's let's think about this for a second in terms of how much space we're using when we're on a screen this small do we want to keep the cards like fully have the cards or do we want to change it so that you know we're completely full full width and we're still going to have two separate sections out somehow I don't know maybe we should take a look you know soon I'm saying here like let's say we were in a nap right there's no cards here these these aren't cards not I mean this is within a list Nicki's asking about icons for material actually let's take a look at the icons oops hi Khan's alright so there are a ton of free material design icons under which link alright so let's say I look at the calendar okay so date yeah there's nothing in there those ones aren't really working oops bad are there's a nice add to shopping cart there's an add an alert at a notes yeah but there's not already an ADD calendar yes we'd have to think about it yeah let's see so I mean some apps it's actually not even consistent because some Google apps that are using material design have cards within it so I'm thinking of you maybe like the news the newsstand app so if you are material or I'm sorry an Android phone and you check out the newsstand app there are there cards I mean they change they change this somewhat frequently so it could be different but like the first set of cars the briefing is one large card that's that's basically a list which which kind of matches up with something that we do here and actually this format's not bad for news and events if we switched it up and use a similar format hmm that's really interesting I'm sorry I need to like show you all this this format alright so basically there's two different formats that are using in the newsstand app for displaying basically an image some icons and but yeah actually it's just now some of them have a title and they have a description it looks like if there's a large a long title they don't have the description yeah so some do some some zone all right but they have two different formats so let me try to explain this so basically at first they do have a card and it does have padding on the side so they have a large card like this they have the title here but then they have the image here and a few icons actually three icons underneath one for sharing ones a little menu icon and the other one is to bookmark it and then they have a you know optional description it looks like under here and then each item is separated by like a horizontal line here very light grey horizontal line and then as you scroll down it switches over and they have these cards that are full width but they still have the separation and this material design style shadow between them but they are full width in there more like this where they have the image up here and then it's I title and then text and then the the icons for those cards are down at the bottom here so actually either one of those formats will work once again though it's I think it's just a question of will we have appropriate images that will work for something like that and for the events currently we don't so I don't really know I don't know if we have the content to back up that type of design i misspelled newsstand I did 2016 all right it's always dangerous just clicking on the image tab but you never know it's gonna come up but I just want to show you all all right this looks this isn't exactly what I'm saying this looks like maybe an older version but somewhat similar yeah actually that's definitely an older an older version let's see this looks newer yeah okay so this is that first section here where it's one big card this is what I was thinking might work for us so what do you all think about something like this for the events and actually if we don't have an image this section here could maybe just have the month in the day maybe that's maybe that maybe month and day I don't know if we could fit in the time in here and it's still have it look right yeah I mean we definitely have to abandon some of what's already there in the list and kind of redo it which I mean we've done that before so it'll be a little bit more work but this this might work I mean obviously we don't need all these icons and we don't need this part here and we don't need the numbers either it looks like looks like the horizontal line doesn't actually extend all the way out to the sides I actually like that I like that it doesn't extend out all right let me see I did I said I was gonna try to keep a watch on the live chat to see how many questions we have okay not a ton of questions let's try to do just a little bit of work here on this to make it look so I'm not getting a lot of feedback on on what you all think about this so I'm gonna move ahead since there's no strong objections to it I'm gonna go ahead with something like this not exactly but it's something like this okay I'm gonna move this to my other screen so I can keep an eye on it this is kind of an advantage I think of using something like material design is it so widely used that you can get kind of inspiration from other places about how to handle certain content types so you're not completely on your own so and I don't I don't mean like copying other people you know you'll see whenever we make this we're not it's not gonna look exactly the same you know but it definitely helps to be able to look at something else and say okay I liked how they did it this way or you know maybe this will work for what we're doing and you usually have to adapt it but it just kind of helps when you're when you're stuck and you don't really have an idea for how you want to do something all right so I'd like to use as much of what we already have as possible as long as it doesn't make it too difficult okay not bad let's switch over maybe we can switch over that avatar section to the other side let's try that first all right let me just back up here a second let's get rid of this here and then we'll move it here right yeah see what it looks like okay cool easy enough we don't want it to be a circle right so let's see where where do we have just want to see where we actually have the border radius I guess it's on the container yeah all right so we'll change the border radius here and so on our classes avatar which we set a width and height let's also set a border border radius of zero we don't need the quotation mark since it's just you know a number but this may or may not work we'll see since it looks like they define its materiai define each border radius separately I'm not sure if we'll override that oh it did work awesome cool okay so we do have now a square image just great that's what I wanted and I think I do think we need just overall on a smaller screen we need less padding so may as well do that now let's figure out where we're putting that padding in and what component okay so maybe on that grid let's check grid item fix is the class so let's check out our grid item fix okay and we do have a 16 pixel padding so it looks like we can grab this and reuse it here and this is basically like using a media query but this is comes builtin in a material UI so it's a little odd doesn't look like a normal media query let's add padding sooo paddingleft let's see if we want to keep the 16 wonder if we want to keep it this much space in between or not this ends up being yeah I don't think we want that much space because we're doing 16 all around then we end up getting 32 pixels between I think I'd feel better with 16 pixels in between so let's change that and these on the small screen has changed it so let's drop this down padding all around just to 8 pixels and that should give us what we want there okay see so now there's only there's a total of 16 pixels in between and now we have a much more slim eight pixels on each side so that gives us a bit more space so it's still enough that we can see it's a card and we can definitely see separation between cards but yeah I like that let me know if you don't like that or you have different suggestion for that but I think that's that's nice there's no sense in taking up extra space when you already have a really small small screen let me check the time okay that's all I'm gonna do for now we're almost out of time for this Pomodoro session and I did notice some questions so I want to get to the questions so let me commit someone you ought to be able to see these changes so let me commit this now and let's say it's your and really I do the biggest change that I made really was the change that I just did there and changing the padding of the card so that's what I'm gonna put on the commit message the next commit message will probably be all those changes that we're making because we didn't we didn't really do that much we just changed the position of the picture within the events card all right so let's see I will probably get that yeah we're gonna get that error again warning so I keep saying it's an error but it's a warning if it was an error we wouldn't be able to commit origin okay all right so now everything should be available on github the end Rock server is still up so you can still check it out if you if you need to let me scroll up and try to answer as many questions as I can hopefully I have enough time to get through all of them sym Ranji says how is your pixel phone's performance I've been very happy with my pixel it's the the pixel excel pixel one excel and it's been great there are some things that that are weird and but I'm not sure if it's a pixel problem or if it's a problem with that particular app so I've had trouble with Instagram just freezing up on me and crashing I've had trouble with only certain things and Facebook not working and just the loading wheel keep spinning but like it's I don't know is that a pixel thing is that you know because of the app I'm not sure but overall I've I've been happy with with the pixel all right so Shri Ganesh says I'm learning angular will it be difficult to switch to react later I'm I don't really know from experience because I I did very little with angular before I started learning react but I assume that someone who is capable of learning angular is certainly capable of learning reacts so there may be certain concepts that will be more difficult if you're used to angular and this is just my guess I'm not a hundred percent sure but but if you're intelligent enough and you know able to learn enough to do one framework to switch to a different library like reacts shouldn't be a big problem so I wouldn't worry too much about it but like anything it's just going to take practice gonna take effort in time Evos has just joined in and I was wondering how the Pomodoro timer helps you besides not going too long one of the unexpected helps of using Pomodoro timer to break up my work is that I do my 25minute session and then I take my break in that break time sometimes so I try not to think about what I'm doing so sometimes I'll think about something else and it just puts my work in perspective and it stops me from spending too much time on one task that maybe isn't that important so I don't know if this has happened to any of you but occasionally I'll get stuck on some problem and I'll keep working at it and working at it for hours trying to fix this problem but in reality the problem isn't that important and I could just do like a workaround or just remove that feature or do something different and it would have saved a lot of time and in the big picture it probably would have been better just to do it that way so that five minute break really allows me to recognize when I'm in a situation like that a lot faster than I normally would and just kind of switch things up so to me that's been a big benefit you know other than the obvious time management benefits that you get from you know the Pomodoro Technique so anyway I should really do a video on on Pomodoro at some point on my channel so it's not are already on my list maybe I'll add it Gerardo says do you think it's worth fixing github commits aha for a side project for myself I never bother fixing github commits occasionally I do to me I want to say it depends on who's going to be looking at those commits and what it's for really so I don't I don't have a rule that covers everything hmm so I but yeah so it just it kind of depends and it depends on how much I messed up the commit so sorry I can't give you like a rule that would work but if the commits really messed up then yeah maybe you know you laugh and fix it but in general as long as the commit is still readable it still makes sense if it's just a small error I'll usually just leave it I mean it would depend like if I was you know committing something to a repo that had pretty strict rules about it obviously I would I would want to fix it Gerardo says I have two accounts work in home and my work ones are not reflected as being mine I have to patch the entire repos I'm afraid I might end up ruining everything yeah I'm not sure how to handle a I don't know anybody else have any advice but I'm sorry drawer I'm trying to think I'm also I'm trying to get all the questions in and I have just a few more minutes to do that so if I had more time again think about it a bit more yeah I mean you definitely want to try to get credit for what you're doing let's see let me look at some of the other questions the fivetime I'll come back to that as well in s how long have you been coding for about five years I'd learned coding some coding stuff a lot you know longer I learned it a lot farther back than five years I started coding in in high school and like the early 2000s early to mid2000s and but I didn't do a lot with it but I've been kind of more seriously coding for about the past five years Aniki says I really like that text the left image to the right the text is what's actually important the image is there for extra flavor oh that's a good way to put it I you know what I like that now that you say it it makes perfect sense I you know I'm sure like I picked up on you know like I picked up on hey I like this but it didn't like come to me that that's why I like it but now that you say it like that that's exactly right the emphasis is on the right part of the content see Mert says why why the free code camp always put emphasis on the front end for this stream in particular I mean I'm a frontend developer although I do some backend stuff you know from time to time so that's why I emphasize frontend stuff because that's most of what I do free code camp in general I don't I don't know do they emphasize front anymore I'd have to go back and check I mean I know their challenges certainly they have challenges for backend in their YouTube videos it might be the case that friend gets emphasized more but I guess I just never really thought about it so I don't know that as far as you know I'm concerned I don't there's no effort on my part to emphasize front or back end I just do what I have to do for work and I try to stream as much as I can of course both are very important for for web development let's see all right so I am gonna have to go here in just a minute or two Gerardo I guess I still don't have a great answer for your situation my thing is you know is there any way if you say you have two accounts your work account on your home account I'm assuming these are github accounts right is there any way I mean does your work account have your name on it associated with it if so then you would be getting credit for your projects on your work account right is there any way you know when you want to let people know what you've worked on that you could have both of your accounts listed I mean obviously it's not ideal but at least you would have the benefit of getting credit for what you're doing without having to change anything or potentially mess up you know any repos so I don't know if that's an option for you but maybe I don't know you know maybe that could work Mert Mert says that's what I feel this is a followup to the frontend emphasis question but it says that's what if you want to follow the instruction on the site thanks for answering my question oh yeah no problem yeah I mean sorry I couldn't answer it you know more fully I really don't have anything to do with the creating of the curriculum in all the challenges so so I can't answer for sure what the thinking was before that for for that part of it I mean there are the curriculum is guess like the next version of it is coming out soon so maybe things might be different then I'm not sure but you might want to check it out when the new version comes out as well and see if there's more balance between front end and back end all right so my my calendar is reminding me that I need to leave in one minute okay now let's reminding me that I lead need to leave now so thank you all so much for watching and thanks for all your help and all your questions and I should be back I'll probably be back tomorrow I'm gonna start having a lot more meetings than normal this week and then next week so the times that I stream might be a little off I may not be able to stream every day but I'll do my best to fit them in and so until next time have a wonderful day
