hey everybody uh welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and i am trying to stream from home again today so i got my internet upgraded and i made some changes to my settings on obs but i'm still getting occasionally some some issues so let me know uh on your end how this this looks what kind of quality are you getting um and and we'll see i um there's still a few more things that i could try so if it gets bad you know it may be able to fix it but today we are going to work on that search page that we were working on yesterday so yesterday we worked on styling the search bar and we styled the sorting drop down and the um the filters the checkbox filters so i don't know if style would be the right word we um we arranged them differently uh so we laid it out differently so today i'd like to focus on uh styling the actual results so right now they look a mess and i'll switch over to them now because i think i look a mess the only thing i do want to show you when i'm in this view is uh my cool shirt so i get this shirt uh from my grandma at christmas time powered by ramen so anyway i'm a ramen fan um let me switch over now okay cool now we'll be able to see the code i'm gonna make it a bit bigger and i was working on the routing i i did make some pretty uh interesting changes to the routing function so if you want to check out what i've done uh look at the last thing that was let's see if i did this give push all right so i just now pushed these changes so the last commit that is pushed up to the repo uh has some changes to be able to handle some different situations uh particularly when we have two parameters for our routing in our server.js file so i added a lot of comments to try to make it easier to understand so someone can ask me at the end of the stream if you want me to go through this i'm not going to right now but hopefully the comments will help you if you want to check it out on your own the link to the repo should be in the description all right so let's go over and go over to the search page i've been slowly going through every link i could find on every page and making sure that the data slugs are correct in wordpress and that the the router handles it correctly so it's just been uh it it's kind of slow going because occasionally i'll run into something and i'm like are you serious that url is why why is it like that and then i'll have to go back and that's why i had to add some logic into the router to handle this case that i had found all right so we're going to go on to the search page and every one thing i i have noticed and we noticed a little bit the last time i tried to stream from home is that everything is slower uh so even if the stream is okay everything else on this machine is slower so if it gets too bad i may end up either using a different machine completely i have a windows desktop that might be better or it's possible and um the guy i believe was it matthew yeah i think his name was matthew who would help i mentioned yesterday it helped me out he said that it's possible to run obs on a completely different machine network as my laptop and then all the streaming stuff would be handled by that machine and then i would just handle uh the you know actually building the stuff so that might be the best solution i just need to get that all set up on the other computer which currently is on the other side of my house right now so i have to figure some way to make that work okay all right blake uh hey everybody i see you in the in the chat here so blake asks for a speed test uh yeah maybe we'll do a speed test later on remind me towards the the end of the stream or on the next break about doing a speed test it's not spectacular the best internet i can get here is uh 25 on the upload and or 25 on the download and 5 on the upload uh so still not great but i even asked like do you have anything else and i said no that's the the highest we can go so so that's what we have literally the best money can buy all for the stream nikki says speed test while streaming is not a good idea okay yeah good call so anyway those are i'll tell you what the results of my speed test were after i upgraded um i think i was getting like a little over three on the upload and the download was some it was like 17. so you know how that works you never really get what they what they say all right so we do have the search uh page up now and i'm gonna start my pomodoro timer we're going to do a 25minute pomodoro session where we code after that we'll take a fiveminute break and i'll answer any questions that are in the live chat and we're just going to go back and forth we'll do two pomodoro sessions today um unless for some reason we just fly through this and make everything look perfect within the first 25 minutes uh then when we do one and then at the end i'll take all the rest of the time to answer questions and let's see i'm just checking what's in the chat right now all right great so it seems like the stream's doing well i've got no weird messages about it uh from obs so let me check yeah uh most of the users are getting 720p so mostly you're getting 720p which is great that's what i'm shooting for all right i think this is doable so let's search for something i keep searching for biology so why not just keep going and search for biology all right so why did anthropology come up immediately when i searched biology i don't know i guess the word biology must be in there somewhere so here's our search results i'll zoom in so right now we're getting the category which is major although i talked to my boss and evidently it's it's really the department and not necessarily the major uh so the title on the current website said major departments or department majors or something like that there was or no programs i'm sorry these are programs so they said major programs so i think we're gonna go with calling them programs instead for now i'm gonna stick with majors because there's no sense in me changing everything unless i'm 100 sure so anyway the categories is major we see here here's a category for department so we're displaying categories we're displaying the date which we may or may not even want to display i just needed this displayed when we were testing our sorting and then the title we had talked weeks ago about also displaying a a small description i don't i don't know that that's the best idea right now because there's a lot of pieces of content that don't have either don't have a description or worse they have a really weird description that's formatted weird it has strange html tags in it and even if we remove the html tags it would look even worse so i don't think we can do that now so the first thing we're going to do is just make it look good with the category and the title potentially the dates uh the dates really don't matter right now though because a lot of the content came over and they'll all have like the date when it was imported over to the new database and not the actual publish date so i don't know we'll see uh so i think that's all we're gonna have right now for the search results it's gonna be a little bear at some point it'd be great to get reasonable excerpts and descriptions for each page that comes up in these results but that's it just depends on you know who i can get to do that i mean i certainly don't think it's a good use of my time to go through and try to write that right now um all right so let's do that i don't really have any inspiration that i'm going with here or any vision in my head so i'm just gonna we're just gonna like get this design going as we go so i'm open to uh to any suggestions that you all have uh yeah uh angie says uh excited to watch this i've never done a code with me uh before i'm such a noob don't worry about it we're i i'm a noob too at many things so um i'm glad that you're here in the live chat feel free to ask any questions uh that uh that pop up i'm happy to go over anything um if um i'm being confused or anything like that all right so let's pull out this date first that'll do a lot to clean it up because the state's ugly uh we'll go over to the code let me know if this code is not big enough i may have to go bigger than normal because i can't get 1080p quality at home where are we at search and i'm gonna get rid of as much as i can okay so here's where we're should be below right oh no i yeah we moved our check boxes below the um the results okay so here's our results so here's the actual markup uh and we just used some divs we didn't even use any material ui components for right now i think this is okay uh i i don't think i want to make cards for each one of these we can try it if whatever we come up with right now doesn't really look great we can try to do cards but i don't think i think it'll just look cleaner like this so we'll see see how it goes so let's pull out the date right now we'll get rid of that if we do add it back in later we'll definitely make it look a lot nicer than it did we currently have where's this the type here let's see the type is a slightly different color it's a little bit gray but it might not be a bad idea to make this an entirely different color to maybe have it stand out a bit more so let's let's see what color should we like this um let's see what color we have we can make it this gold color let's see what it looks like with the gold and so we already have the classes uh type on here so we could just add to that class i think that's what we'll do all the way up to where we have type and let's go with color and yes what color do we have is it like theme i don't i'm not sure exactly what it's called but let's try theme api oops not api i don't know what i'm thinking theme color uh secondary let's see if that works and i forgot a comma that's why i'm getting that red error line um nikki says if a different color that same yellow is a student profile yes i thought about that did anything happen no nothing happened i wonder if we're using that i may have to look up what that is supposed to be i wonder if it'll give me um i guess we can look at material ui documentation and nikki i think you're right we could go with that color uh but i want to see how the gold looks so i i know that yellow sometimes is a bit hard uh to to make out on especially uh on older monitors so if the if the gold looks okay i think i'm gonna go with the gold and then we may end up changing the cards as well on the home page secondary all right yeah that was undefined all right hopefully it'll tell us primary palette okay maybe we gotta go palette then uh so we'll go theme palette secondary see if that works no it didn't look right secondary all right that looks better let's try it now see what we have should be getting a refresh soon i guess while i'm waiting for the refresh i'm gonna look back in here oh angie says is this a class with the font settings on its own um yeah so angie i'm not sure how much you know about react so this is probably gonna look weird let me see okay uh john i see john's already answered so i'll just kind of add to that as well so in react one of the ways you can do styles is to make a javascript object with css like properties so you can see this is it looks kind of like css but we're doing some stuff like with camel casing so i am just making a class called type basically and i'm setting the color to whatever color we have saved basically uh in as as this so instead of putting the hex value like we normally would then um hey ambrose my my threeyearold is trying to trying to get over here ambrose we can't watch any shows right now i'm doing a live stream on youtube okay so um anyway so that's all we're doing you know very very similar to what we do normally with css just to add the color to the class so yay finally so let's search and see hmm did it not work let's check out what's going on here in devtools and see why it's not working for us if i need let's get rid of the console here at the bottom you don't need that but we do need this and let's move this over okay all right so it looks like our color is not working i messed something up where did i mess up theme palette secondary oh i know what i messed up check this out so secondary does return an object just just like it it says here i i was looking right at it and just didn't realize it so i need to add main in order to return a string i was trying i was pulling in this entire object which obviously you know you can't pass objects as css property uh values so let's go with main and that should give us like the color uh in the color palette that we want michael creole says ambrose in the house yeah it was ambrose was trying to come in um yeah ambrose has been sad all day because he just wants to sit here in my chair with me and he wants me to put my little pony on one of my monitors i have three monitors here oh okay so our secondary color is that yellow color interesting yeah that's really hard to read like that we could maybe change the font weight and it might be a bit better but anyway i've been what i've been doing i've actually been using all three monitors and so i said you know hey i i we can't watch it today so he's pretty sad uh i guess i guess this mom won't put on my little pony upstairs for him all right okay that's much easier to read what do you think about this should we try to go with the gold or should we leave it like this all right nikki says team gold is better than yellow uh kishore says hey jesse you didn't post the url for your live code um yeah you know what i didn't i didn't set up uh ngrok on this computer so i i forgot to set it up and by the time i thought about it today i just i ran out of time also i'm not sure if this computer can handle running it since it's so slow already so i'm gonna try to to work out a way to run ngrok from home but for now i do not have it so sorry about that john hanson says do we get a vote for my little pony yeah if if you are my little pony fans uh let me know what your favorite pony is in the live chat or in the comments below and it'll be a great discussion um all right oh n is here she says hey hey anna how's it going all right gold it looks like gold is pretty much what everybody wants i don't think i saw anybody vote for yellow okay i don't know what color this really is yup it's like yellowy orange but i've just been calling it yellow all right so let's switch it up and do this gold i i wonder if we should just make gold the secondary color in the theme because it seems like nobody's really a fan of this color at all so let's do that let's just switch up in the theme to gold and that'll be cool because we haven't really done any work or even looked at the the theme in i don't know probably since it was first put in there uh so let's go i don't even remember where it is let's check it out is it here yep there it is here's our theme so here's our secondary wait is this a real thing okay are 500 that's interesting it's interesting that maine actually worked that's really weird is there somewhere else let me think all right john says five percent darker the gold will be easier to read it i did i do have a darker version of it that i've used elsewhere that is a lot easier to read but now i'm i'm really puzzled here so let me i don't know if i explain why i'm puzzled so uh we saw you know we can see here that like we brought this in and we have our palette primary like light main dark right but over here what we're seeing is is really different than that it's it's not it's not showing us those options which i'm a little confused about because how did it work when we said maine if this is what we have so i'm wondering if we have something else somewhere let's see let's see okay nothing here it's the last place we could check is here see if we pulled anything in here i guess not all right so we are pulling from here lid fps yeah i mean this this is where it's pulling from okay well i guess it our the equivalent of main would be this 500 so if we changed our 500 here maybe that would do something let's see what value we're getting right now i don't think it's that now this is a value you know what let me search for this value in our project and see if if it can come up so in visual studio code you can do a search throughout all the files in your project which is super helpful you can even do a replace that's how i um i ended up fixing a lot of the issues when we updated fus theme interesting okay so that's the color that we're getting here you know what i'm wondering i think it was harshit who did this uh i wonder if harshit took the main colors and um and then made all these variations i mean there's probably some tool that will make these variations for you that that might make more sense but since we see it here let's just let's try to manually change this to our our gold color which uh let me go my other screen and grab the hex value for that gold color so i do have an outdated style guide that i made over a year ago but it is useful to grab the hex codes so i'm looking at that right now and here we go all right so here's our hex code let's see if that makes a difference i mean it should be pretty obvious whether or not that's really where the color is coming from and if this doesn't work right now then i'm just going to put the hex code in manually and um just so that we can move on and see what it looks like i can always read through the documentation and material ui a little bit more later and you know try to add it into the theme that way okay hey it worked awesome all right so let's let's zoom out a bit and take a look at it so here's that gold color what do y'all think and i i realize i'm i'm not i'm missing things in the uh live chat now so uh i kind of couldn't keep up there so apologies if i am missing some advice but anyway you all can see the gold now my timer just went off so i'm gonna set the five minute timer and i'm gonna switch back to the screen so you can keep looking at the gold let me know what you think okay all right john says gold is gold is great angie said looking good all right cool cool cool when john says the color looks good i believe it right because john is an awesome artist so guaranteed he knows way more about colors and what looks good than than i do so um i'm gonna i'm gonna go with that who else uh nicole says yep that's good hey nicole how's it going uh welcome to the live chat so i think nicole and angie both i don't know that i've seen you in the live chat before apologies if you have been in the chat and i just didn't uh didn't see your message but uh if this is your first time chatting uh thank you and thanks for watching okay and john's saying you need that border top still okay yeah you're you're right we're gonna put in that border do you all remember on project one uh where we did those search listings we had a nice border uh who made that border shoot somebody in from the live chat did some work to make that border and i i modified it slightly but i can't remember now i mean obviously it shows who did it in github but uh anyway maybe we'll do something like that because i i really liked that border uh so all right cool we have um i think this is definitely better definitely an improvement so we're gonna keep that uh and this will match did we ever change these no we didn't so we may want if we're going with this color here we may want to think about you know do we want to change some colors here i'm gonna leave it for now but you know just some uh some options just got a message from work okay not really an issue okay and you know what i set that five minute timer and then didn't answer anything in the live chat so let me set that again because that's not fair to you all i'm gonna scroll up to the top of the chat try to get through as much as i can it looks like there's a lot in there so i may not be able to get to it all in this five minutes may have to wait till after the next session and let's see john says there he is bartholomew roberts a aka black bart you look like a pirate on the youtube preview yeah what do y'all think about that picture on the youtube preview i just i noticed that all my pictures started looking the same it's just like me smiling so i thought i'd do something goofy and different just to kind of break it up so uh yeah so i don't know if that's too silly let me know uh dt98 says what's this project all about um i'm making a new website for the university that i work for so it's a small university uh in uh ohio and their their main you know it's it's franciscan.edu is the website now so we're gonna replace that with this site um it's a react site and we get data from a wordpress content management system we pull it into react using graphql and apollo and we're using a material ui and following material design guidelines pretty closely you know there's we we have a little bit of room you know to do our own thing here but uh that's that's basically what we've we've been working on okay all right vippl says great videos but got too boring due to unnecessary chat and slow development all right thank you i appreciate the uh input there so uh anyway yeah let me know what you all think i i asked this question occasionally because this is not the first time uh that we've gotten some comments like that am i talking too much or is that a good thing in these videos and and i mean you know when we stop and do the question and answer stuff uh i do think the slow development is an issue uh i think the projects sometimes are unnecessary sl unnecessarily slow that's not always in my control you know sometimes like in this case the things happen and we had to kind of stretch out the the project so anyway not sure i can change the project timelines that much but i definitely could change about the talking so um if most of you think it's okay with the talking we'll keep going if you'd rather me cut back on that then i'll i'll think about doing that as well see uh okay uh michael and nikki are talking about attaching color values um here so you know what i did have a plugin that did that in atom i don't know if i have that in visual studio code um oh you know what nikki says it does that in css but not here all right so maybe i'd have to get some sort of separate plugin that would would do that also in javascript files okay john says it's called color highlight i'm not going to install it right now because i definitely don't need something else running even another plugin while we're trying to do this so i'm afraid it'll just freeze everything up uh chris barker asks why are we why are you using javascript to control css uh yeah so in react we use javascript to control everything so css html it's all javascript um so that's that's kind of the react way to do it you can use regular css and we are using that as well uh but wherever we can we're using javascript because that's the usual way to do things with with react all right wow i actually almost got all the way through all these so but the timer just just went off all right let me i'm going to try to remember where i left off so i didn't get to everything um so if you asked something i didn't get to it yet please hang in there and then after this next session i will answer those questions all right so now that we have uh this color here and then we still have the title we need to do we need to do two things one is really important and necessary the other one i definitely want to have as well but it's not a hundred percent necessary so the on the thing that's not 100 necessary is making that divider between each one we're going to do that uh if we have time but what we really need to do is we need some way for a user to click and get to the page right i've been thinking about this and a thought came to me i don't know a day or two ago and i added it in to an issue on github so let's open up github well we'll at least click to open it up and we'll come back to in a second uh so what we'll do is we'll make this title clickable we'll make it you know a link and then oops all right okay it finally opened okay cool um so i can find this issue it will jog my memory so i made sure i wrote it down in an issue so that i would not forget yeah here's how we're going to try to pull this off and we'll see if it works it's under the implement search okay so here and you all can read this too on your own it's you know the repos public uh link in the description so we're getting the data for this um you know from the wordpress api so what we'll have and we have already is the content type we're bringing that in we're already displaying that and then we're also bringing in the slug so if we have the content type and we have the slug for a lot of the content that's all we need to be able to recreate the correct route the correct url for this so let's try that see if it works and then we're probably going to find some cases where it doesn't work and then we can kind of modify things to try to fit those other cases so and if this is not making sense to you right now it hopefully it'll make sense once we start to actually use it uh and if it still doesn't make sense after we use it uh then i can explain it more just let me know in the chat i mean hopefully it works all right where are we at search okay so down here oh yes oops here we are okay i should probably pull this out of here so i can more easily get to it but it's all right now this this will probably end up being its own component at some point so here this span we're going to change into an a tag this is we're probably going to end up changing it into a link tag at some point but for testing i'm fine with just an a tag uh so we need an href and then our href we're going to put these back ticks so that we can do a template literal here because what we want is to do do we want we just want to do a slash for now and so we're going to have a slash and then we're going to use our template literal syntax to drop into javascript and actually oops my fault we need to go into javascript first to be able to use template literal syntax my fault okay if you're not familiar with template literal syntax put a question in the live chat and i'll explain it it's really cool and really useful so if you don't know about it i'm i'm more than happy to explain it because i i think it'll definitely you know benefit your coding uh if you know how to use it so we're going to try to recreate a route here so the first thing we need is item dot uh what did we call that uh type so item.type and then we're gonna put another slash and it's gonna be what is it going to be yeah anyway it just occurred to me how many like exceptions to this rule we're gonna have um so we have item.type and we're gonna have item dots and let's say that and see if it works and it hasn't refreshed yet so we'll have to give it a second okay all right cool so i have a few of you would like to know more about template little syntax so the refresh we're still waiting on the refresh so that'll give me a second to explain it so uh basically here's what you do so anywhere that you would normally use single quotes or double quotes in javascript you can instead use that backtick key and it's the little key right below your escape key right in the upper left hand corner your keyboard so uh it has the little uh like tioda uh character or uh it can be the back tick character so uh you use that and then within it you can type a string just like normal but you can also put a dollar sign and then curly brackets and within the curly brackets you can write javascript so this is useful in situations where let's say like normally we could have done it like this so we could have written href equals um and then you know put our normal quotation marks and then we would have had to put a slash and then we would have had to put a plus sign and then our item dot type and then the plus sign and then our slash and then a plus sign and then our item dot slug right well instead of having to put all those plus signs in different quotes we can just do it like this and it may not seem like we've saved a lot of space there but if you start adding a lot more in it definitely does save space and the other cool thing that we can do here is i could potentially put in a lot of like html in the string with spaces like i can hit enter here and this would still work normally you can't do that uh with strings so you can essentially create html templates with javascript variables in it and and use you know indentation and um line breaks right so you could hit enter and have them on multiple lines to make it look like real html so it's very helpful especially like if you're not using react and you you know you just want to make a quick you know template with some variables in it very useful so the that's template literal syntax um so you look that up if you want a better explanation you know i'm sure there are probably a lot of better like blogs and videos that explain it better than i can but that's just kind of a brief overview of how you would use that and why am i getting an error trailing spaces are not allowed okay at a trailing space all right um let's go and hopefully this is refreshed yeah it refreshed and it looks so ugly that's fine for now i'm okay with with it looking ugly but here's what we have see so now now it takes us to say major anthropology and this says department uh biology header let's try to find it one where this will actually work so biology department text there we go so department biology probably will work let's try it so let's click it and hopefully i have the data in there with the right slug no errors yet ah no okay so there was the air let's go back and try to find one where it works oh so slow all right look there again let's see see some of the times it's not gonna work so like right here we have department slash departments is the url okay so it's not gonna work for that uh oh we do have faculty this one should work all right yeah let's click on this one so for faculty member dr eric haney i know we have the data for him because we used him uh as an example for a while so slow so slow so if anyone is watching right now that is wealthy and really impatient and you'd like this to be sped up you can donate to the get a better computer so jesse can live stream faster from home fund so let me know i can give you my paypal and my wallet addresses for a variety of cryptocurrencies alright cool so that did work so this should work for all faculty members student profiles departments and for majors it's going to work but it's going to work a little differently so essentially there'll be two different urls that we can use to get to majors so what we'll need to do to get this to work for more things and i think the simplest way to get it to work is just to add to our um our server and our routing function that that translation object we're gonna have to add some more items to that object to have alternate urls for certain things that fit with this it's going to be a little bit weird to do that but the alternative is i don't i think it would be very complicated to try to switch things around and have like special rules for each content type so for now that's what what i'm going to do uh matt duchess says sorry got a jet catch y'all later thanks jesse uh you're welcome thanks for watching i'll see you um okay so cool so the concept works excellent there are some cases that aren't working properly we'll need to take care of that probably won't have time this stream yeah about 12 minutes left so i'm not going to get into the the more like edge cases right now that's something i think maybe i'd like to think about more um let you all think about it as well if you have any ideas michael creel says department slash departments work works yes sweet alright awesome so departments slash departments works so maybe there won't be as many cases as i i don't know exactly why that works but i'm not complaining blake says i love that idea but i don't have a lot of money yeah i don't i'm i'm like half joking with that as well so like please don't don't feel bad for me that my computer is too slow to stream like seriously only if there's somebody out there that like hit it big with crypto or something and like literally has thousands of dollars just to throw away like then i would i would i would accept that okay but i don't want any of you like uh you know who who aren't like very wealthy attempting to give me money for something because uh uh you know like i make enough money to support me and my family with you know a little bit left over so i'm not poor i don't you know i don't need uh i i don't want any of you who potentially make less money than me you know donating to to my cause uh i would just i'd feel terrible about that so anyway um let's uh let's see it pulls wp test tv with the department center and academics okay so michael said it it is pulling some data um okay cool well let's yeah let's bring this up again then and the last thing we'll do i do i see there's some more questions in the chat i will get to those in about 10 minutes uh what we really ought to do now is style this so that we don't have these really uh kind of ugly old school looking uh links so let's style that a bit and that'll probably be all we get to today which i think is significant you know we actually have functional links on our search page so let's let's go back here and i can get rid of this and let's see classes title so let's go up to our our class for title here where we have our css and so we still have the right font size the right font weight so we should only have to change the color and then we'll set this the text decoration to none okay that'll get rid of our underline and then our color should be you know what there's probably a match let's let's check our color page for whoops from material ui to see if there's something that we should use um where's our default or text um no i don't want gray hmm interesting okay so uh there probably is something within material ui that i could use but just since we're kind of running out of time i'm just going to use for color let's do rgb a and let's give it 0 0 0 right that'll give us black wait there's no commas is there i always want to put commas in there and then it doesn't work zero zero zero and then the last one is our um like our transparency value uh so we're going to set this to 0.87 and that's kind of the standard the reason we want to do this instead of just doing a gray hex value is because now that i see that i think i should put commas i'm so i'm i don't know what i'm doing like you do a thing so many times and it's like uh there are commas okay thank you nikki and michael says opacity that's the word i was looking for so opacity so anyway if you use a gray hex color it's much harder to read than if you use black with an opacity setting uh it will look grey but it'll be much more readable so always try to do that if you can if you have if you want gray text and if you don't believe me try it out try out a gray hex right next to an equivalent rgba black with opacity set at whatever to get that same color and it's amazing the first time i tried it and saw the difference i was wow i don't know why i don't know why it does that but you can check that out that's that's i didn't invent that that's straight out of the material design documentation all right anyway uh so i guess we'll have to wait for the uh reload um yeah but that should be fine why is our is our font weight while we're waiting let's inspect this and make sure font weight isn't there you go no it looks like it's it's it's in there all right cool there we are so now you can see we have our color okay so it's it it looks pretty dark like almost black but it's not black uh and great very cool um no i mean it may not be like 100 immediately noticeable like oh hey that's a link we'll just have to see i'd like to maybe do some testing with users and just tell them to do a search and not say anything and just see where they go to click if they immediately go and try to click the title they think it'll be okay if they like try to click on something else first i don't know we'll see uh maybe we'll have to change the color um let's see let me check alright about four minutes all that time to wait for an error that i knew was coming okay well i don't i don't think i have time to implement the um that border like uh between you that little line separating each each item uh so five minute yeah and then actually it's less than four now so i'm just gonna go ahead and and start answering questions now so cut that pomodoro session just a bit short oh you know what and i always forget to do this let's let me take the last minute or so of the session to um uh commit this and then push it to github and that way you know you all will have a chance to review anything that we've done and it's a lot easier if you wanted to try to like use some of this on your own it's a lot easier to copy and paste from github instead of trying to type out what's on the video so in my terminal which it's a little bit small there so sorry if you can't read that right now but i'm going to say what i'm writing anyway so we're going to do a git status just to see what we've done and we've changed that fus theme dot js and we've changed search.js so i always like to verify that first and then that way if i've accidentally changed some other file and i didn't realize it uh then i can i can tell i mean it it rarely happens but occasionally you know you it it does happen sometimes so before we commit that and mess something up always check so now we'll do a git add and that adds those changes to the staging area so these are staged now ready to commit and i'm going to say do yarn cm and that's a special tool that we have here that helps us to write a good commit message if you don't have that tool you can just type git commit and then you can put hyphen m and then in quotation marks you can write your commit message right there in line it'll do the same thing as what we're doing now except you'll write your commit message all yourself instead of having this little walkthrough so we've added new features and what we've done is styled styled search results and we haven't broken anything does it change any open issues uh i suppose if we want to say that implement search issue which is 74 we can reference that issue um so let's say yes and let's put number 74 um actually number 74 and hit enter all right and now it'll run through and we have our project set up to do some testing and auto formatting the code so if you download this if you clone this repo and start working on it it will auto format your code it will link your code it will run tests so just be aware of that it could take a while depending on the speed of your computer so if you want to take this project and do something else with it on your own maybe you might want to disable that maybe you don't like the style we use that's totally fine but if you are going to try to submit code to this project which is totally cool if you want to do that that would be awesome just be aware that that does need to run uh because we want to keep everything really uniform as much as possible so you can code in whatever style you like but then when you go to commit it'll reformat to the style that we're using on this project which is the standard js style the biggest thing you'll notice about that is that we don't use semicolons all right so i'm just going to let that go while i go back to the live chat my pomodoro session just ended and let me scroll up to where i left off and answer some questions okay so all right so angie uh says never uh never been before thanks for the welcome i'm really new to coding and i'm trying to gain confidence oh awesome uh well i i hope that this is a place that can help you get some confidence and um yeah don't worry any questions are totally fine uh i i love getting questions and i'm very happy to explain what's going on i want this to be as beginner friendly as possible um yeah and let me know if there's anything i can do to make the stream better for you and uh if it if it's possible i'll definitely try it out uh chris barker says do you have to use javascript to control css and react no you don't you can use regular css and just you know import it as normal you could use sas if you wanted to so yeah you don't have to to use it like that react is very flexible when it comes to how you want to do css it actually has it has so many options for how to do css like i i can't even keep track of them all and all through our projects uh that we've done on the live stream i think we've used a different some different way to do css on everyone it seems like we're always trying out something something new let's see it says michael says jesse regarding the preview uh there are there are new women in here today just saying all right i don't michael let me know what you were saying there i'm not i'm not exactly sure what you say are you saying that i should do like my normal thing where i tell everybody what the streams about that i usually forget to do for the new people anyway let me let me know i guess it's kind of late in the stream to do that i'll have to remember to do it next time though i need to just write a little script so i can just go through it i've been streaming for almost a year now you think i would have sorted that out uh jason lee says from columbus ohio oh awesome awesome jason yeah so i'm i'm in steubenville ohio uh so like right um right there on the border between ohio and west virginia and pennsylvania is right there as well who is that cordelia my my oneyearold is trying to come in here now hi cordelia she's really upset because the door is closed so she can't get in uh nikki says try giving that gold text uh the css letter spacing 1.4 okay cool i'll keep in mind to mess with the letter spacing there hey you got the door open no no no come here you want to you want to see data come here do you want me to hold you no you just want to get all my cups she's down here here do you want to be on youtube here it's okay i'm almost done all right hey everybody this is cordelia could do you say hi you say hi wave right there wave right there hello hi all right can you can you say hello all right what what do you want you you want milk i don't have any milk do you want to go upstairs and get your milk from mama okay go ahead go ahead go get it good girl all right so that was cordelia that's my my baby uh all right sorry about that let me find my place okay uh matt duchess says you do you no such thing is too silly all right so that was when i was asking if my my picture was too silly today so thank you um let's see uh nikki says it makes all caps a bit easier to read if they're spaced out a bit more oh okay cool that makes sense that totally makes sense anna says i like when you talk too much all right thanks and i appreciate the the input um i usually when in the past every time that somebody has suggested that i talk less and code more um i've gotten a bunch of people saying no i actually like the talking that's what's unique about this stream that i do take the time to answer all the questions and explain things so if i keep getting that reaction then i'll i'll keep talking um i think the pomodoro method that we're using here does help to keep a balance so i guess i'll keep going with that and for those of you that would prefer less talking and more coding um you can always uh wait and watch the recordings you can watch it on like two time speed i've heard that i'm you can still understand me at two time speed probably because i don't talk very fast normally uh and then you can skip the breaks whenever i'm talking so you know maybe that might make things a little bit less boring for you uh but if it is too boring i totally understand there's so many other really useful videos out there like go you can watch those and it it'll be fine you gotta find the tools that work for you um so i totally understand that um matt duchess says talking is preferred it helps to see your thought process cool angie says you you haven't confused me yet i think you're fine uh blake says i like the talking uh development isn't slow necessarily but it is a little during the live streams uh by the way the stream quality is good awesome okay yeah um all right well i will keep talking then um okay angie asks uh what to react okay cool so john says you can go to react.js.org which is great um let me give you um just a brief explanation of what react is uh so certainly you'll get a better explanation at react.js.org but just for you and anybody else that's watching it's not familiar with react react is a javascript library that allows you to make uh web applications and it takes care of a lot of the behind the scenes thing that sometimes things that can be really tricky uh so updating the state of your application uh manipulating the dom so the document object model basically the elements the html elements that are on the page so those are just some of the things that it does it can do a lot more kind of behind the scenes what it's doing is you're writing javascript functions and then those functions are adding the html elements to the page but it looks still a lot like html because there's this layer on top of it called jsx that makes it way easier to use so you can write what seems like normal html but in reality you're writing javascript functions so reacts uh the some of the benefits of react are um you have these components that are really easy to reuse uh you can have large projects still be like manageable uh you can it it's fast like things happening on the page happen really fast so i don't want to get too indepth i said it would be a short explanation but that's that's some of what react is you've probably seen a lot of websites that use react uh facebook users react um uh trying to think instagram at least the web version of instagram is react i don't know if the app is react native or not uh let's see what else is react netflix uses react uh godaddy's website is react i'm trying to think what uh i'm like blanking out here but there are a lot of websites that use uh react right now so if you haven't heard of it you know you've at least probably seen it without even realizing uh nino says is the github thing that helps you push better github commits available for npm yeah it is so it's uh committed let me bring up on the screen my package.json file i should just leave that file up all the time because i it seems like i always refer to it at some point so committed commitizen um and then uh cz conventional change log so those i believe it's those two packages that are doing most of that and then it's tied in i i think with our precommit hook so the documentation for committees should cover a lot of which you need to set it up and you can check out our project to see you know how we've set it up as well but um yeah if you want to see version numbers and stuff and copy and paste it check out the package.json file in in this github repo oh nikki i just saw that you already answered nina's question so sorry about that thank you nikki for answering that oh okay so nikki i didn't realize so for those of you that use the azerty keyboard instead of the qwerty keyboard keyboard um the backtick is next to the enter key and it's via alt gr so for qwerty users the way i explained it earlier is where you get it but no i guess not so for everyone else so thanks nikki i was not aware of that all right almost to the bottom of the chat so if you have a question you haven't put it in there yet um get it in there quickly because once i get to the bottom i'll um i'll end the stream and if you're watching this later on and want to ask a question please put it in the comments or you can ask me the question um through any uh social media channel that you can find me at uh if you check out the link to my youtube channel from there i have linked all my different social media profiles so reach out to me however you would like uh it doesn't matter to me whatever is best for you and i'll do my best to get back to you as soon as i can uh carlos says hi jesse what back end are you using what's the setup for your front end uh sorry if you've said this before okay so i had some um some answers to this in the live chat but let me just give a really brief overview for everyone so front end is react the back end is for at least for the react stuff is we were using nodes we're using node and express um to handle a lot of stuff a lot of routing and things like that and then separate from there located on an entirely different server is a wordpress installation that we're just using to handle the data we're not using any of like wordpress themes or anything like that and so that's the setup so the data database is tied in with wordpress so essentially we just use wordpress to manage the database so mysql database we pull data out of that mysql database using graphql we pull that into our react app the only exception being on our search page we don't use graphql we just use the standard rest api for wordpress um nikki asked when i was talking about the difference between gray text and black text with um opacity at i mean we use values like 0.87 for normal text 0.54 for um for input text but nikki says what's the reason it looks more readable better antialiasing or something i'm teddy truth i'm not really sure uh michael says just a guess but it's not as hard as the solid gray since it's slightly seethrough it could be yeah michael says just realize you're using the second terminal michael says no the picture what picture oh i know now so when you're talking about explain the preview all right yeah so so the preview thumbnail for the video i took a goofy picture of my face because just to switch things up like because i normally just take the same type of picture of just me smiling so anyway i just thought i'd be goofy today to change things up but this is like somewhat of a serious stream though so angie says my brother lives in yellow springs ohio okay cool yeah it's always fun to learn where people are from because sometimes it's like find out people are actually like close to where i'm at or like really cool one day i think it would be super awesome to have some type of meetup for all the people that like watch the stream uh either like maybe if i'm traveling somewhere and it's in a location where a lot of you are or something like that i mean maybe it'll just be every time i travel somewhere i'll let you all know where i'm going and anybody that's close we can just like hang out or something uh if any of you would be up for that let me know i just think it'd be fun like to actually hang out in person um at some point since i mean like we we spent a lot of time together online doing these streams so uh it would be it would be kind of cool uh kishore says uh how to make a react app into a progressive web app which is popping up on dev blog hey baby you want to be on youtube um yeah so kishore's talking about that yeah so there is a recent article uh i didn't read it yet but it does talk about how to turn a react app into progressive web app um yeah so check that out if you're interested in that it is actually really easy so uh we've done it before uh so if you check out most of the projects that we've done um that's actually been done usually harshit takes care of that um but yeah it's it's just a few extra lines and it's it's really cool uh a lot of you were saying hi to cordelia and saying she was cute so thank you thank you i appreciate it um yeah i just love that little girl i was spoiler so much i hope she turns out all right but she's just my baby and uh she just she wants me to hold her all the time i just can't like i can't say no to her she's so cute um carlos says hello from switzerland hey how's it going hey this is uh this is gemma this is my oldest daughter you wanna say hi gemma hi and gemma maybe wants to be a coder too when she grows up i think i might go to a coding club today you're gonna go to coding club today i think so i think it's tomorrow huh i think it's tomorrow morning yeah so gemma's gonna go to a coding club tomorrow you're gonna come with us yeah and you're gonna code well i'm yeah i'm not gonna code i'm gonna come with you and and hang out and help you out yeah all right you can hang out here while i'm i'm doing this if you want or you can go play i have the i have students on lexi i mean ar they are at um library they are what at library um they are on the computers at library um it's this thing where you um read a book and then you have to take a test on the on the chromebooks um on the book and you're not allowed to look at the book and uh i pretty much always get um all that right good job baby yeah gemma is very smart and always gets good grades except for the one time i got a c i see that happens sometimes that's okay and once i thought i got a c but it was actually charlie's paper yeah okay all right well if you want to stay down here i'm gonna finish this soon so i gotta answer a few more questions okay hey you got mcdonald's coffee i got mcdonald's coffee this morning after i took you to school all right let me answer these questions okay sorry about the the camera moving uh so i'm gonna try to get a stationary camera soon uh because i don't want to make any of you motion sick okay um oh anna says uh i enjoy your english oh thank you i uh i guess i guess it's okay english i try do you even speak english who that person who said anna yeah julie yeah you remember anna you talked to her i didn't speak english she was the one who said she was going to teach me the other language i think yeah oh yeah i remember her yeah try not to move around a lot you're actually making me motion sick okay i get motion sick very very easily it's like you okay yeah all right this just has a hole in the chair oh nikki says visual studio code tip control clicking on a component name brings you to that file interesting let's let's try it that sounds really cool so uh let's see if i have component name i may not have my own component name in here or a component in here at all i should try index that's that's probably where i have okay so let's control click definition i guess it didn't nope didn't work for me let me try command since i'm on a mac command click ctrl click hmm okay it didn't work for me yeah did you a box just popped up yeah they can teleport they can see it this is what they see on the screen all right michael says regarding graphql oops my window my chat window just jumped down to the bottom so i lost track where i was there we go so michael says regarding graphql i've sort of gotten a hand on it but can't figure out how to connect the the test wordpress database you set up i can hard code the search result url but not search your main url huh um so do i need to have admin rights to do the search on wordpress or is there a graphql plugin that i might need maybe dada you um you know what you could um let the computer um let him in to your thing well we could let me hmm let me i'm trying to think over this look at the problem could be so maybe they're not allowed to do that so they because they might mess a mess everything up um i think that like why but he's not gonna ask anything i'm not saying now okay so you're saying so the search results work for you but the graphql stuff doesn't is that let me know because like the the search uses the rest api so that should work right off the bat with any wordpress instance it should be fine um the graph the graphql should work too i'm i'm not sure why it wouldn't be working i don't have any like restrictions or limitations set on it at least not right now what if everyone was who was doing it was just right next to your computer yeah that would be crazy if they all right let me let me answer these questions then we can talk okay what are other questions there's all right here there's more questions see um yeah so they're waiting for me to answer the questions so i don't want to make them wait for too long okay that's a ton of questions all right well let's get through them uh le levitt says vim awesome also uses react cool very cool um blake says i ended up getting a surface pro 2 again okay cool blake let me know how that goes for you um and how you like it uh psy sai i'm not sure how to pronounce that let me know if i pronouncing it wrong but anyway so i says uh learning a lot of things awesome uh i'm super glad whenever somebody learned something from these streams so i imagine that you all don't always learn it from me there's a lot of really smart people on the live chat giving um some some good information but as long as you learn something yeah they're smarter than gummy me i don't have any gummy bears down here can i get go back upstairs uh think about it let's talk to your mom uh let's see nikki says i was watching a tutorial and the instructor used it without mentioning it my mind was blown it was so cool okay that was the uh the tip in visual studio code that i couldn't get to work but i'm probably just doing something wrong so i'll have to try it again later your coffee yeah you know what there's coffee grounds in the bottom so you can i didn't even realize there's anything left i thought i drank it all if you don't if you don't want the coffee grounds it's fine i'll just i'll drink it i don't mind it when i was little mama used to mama once gave me a haul like different a whole like like a little jar of coffee and i drank it all wow okay listen listen remember coffee gemma remember we're gonna talk later okay all right thank you um i'm gonna say one more thing my shoes kept getting untied in school oh okay well you have to you have to double knot them you know how to double knot double knotting all right well we're not doubling mine um okay well we can we can test test out some notes later okay um uh dev moore says hi new here and to react i was wondering if it's a good idea to go through your earlier projects it could be the only thing about some of the earlier projects are so i've been streaming for almost a year now so some of the things that we did early on are outdated so you know a lot of the packages that we've used have have new changes and and some of the changes are breaking changes uh even react has has come you know when we started this that was prereact 16. baby you gotta let me talk i wanna say one more thing can it wait no so after no so anyway you can look you can probably still get some good info from the previous projects but just be aware that some of that stuff may be outdated um so if if you're okay with that then yeah go ahead and watch some of the previous stuff i probably do a better job of explaining things earlier on and like as i've gone on i kind of just stopped explaining like the same thing over and over again i have two things to say why don't you write down what you want to say so you don't forget and then we can talk about it after um well the world says did you become a remote worker uh yeah so i'm semi remote right now uh so i'll probably be spending like a few days a week at home a few days in the office uh carlos says thanks for explaining very intricate back end routing and stuff from wordpress to node.js express and then react cool yeah it's it's a little bit more complicated than probably most uh university websites are but i think the results are gonna be they're gonna be worth it as long as you don't get on my computer i'm all right with that um yeah so i think the results gonna be a very fast and flexible website john says jesse have you seen the movie brainstorm a scary precursor to your new headset i haven't seen it maybe i have to check it out if it's on netflix i'll check it out yeah actually so i got the headset in the mail today so if if you want to know more i have a project where i'm going to work with a uh brain computer interface to try to help my son raphael with his uh his mental illness he has obsessive compulsive disorder um and get some anxiety you can use yeah you can use it too so i'm gonna be working on that project uh i'll i'll probably be putting some videos on my own youtube channel about it so if you're interested you can subscribe to my youtube channel the links in the description and um i'll be doing videos on that soon i'd like to work on it like later today and tomorrow if i can uh so anyway um i don't know hopefully i can help my son and then maybe help other people too if if it works but anyway if you want to know more about it watch yesterday's stream because i i explain more in depth what i want to do and there is a conversation on twitter more about it too so uh if you want to check out my twitter it's it's a somewhat recent tweet there's a kind of a big conversation going on there um blake says the meetup would be cool cool cool that's well i'll definitely let you all know whenever i'm going right now i'm the closest big city i am that i'm to is pittsburgh so if any of you gemmas is too loud you see the red for the microphone thing when it gets to red it's too loud why we don't want it to get to the red it's like the noise meter at school except there are a ton of balls okay remember you're gonna write down you're going to write i wanted to go on all the way down no no you're going to hurt everybody's ears i'm going to have to i might have to turn down the mic here let me turn it down a bit hopefully you can still hear me hey yeah damn angel i'm not gonna let you be down here for these if you don't quit talking okay and don't don't shake the chair baby i like having you on here but you gotta listen okay um where are we at oh anyway if anybody is in or around the pittsburgh area now or if you're ever traveling around there definitely let me know because it wouldn't be that hard for me to uh drive up and and you know meet up there all right blake's in upstate south carolina cool i may be in charleston later i'm thinking about going to a conference in charleston i haven't bought tickets yet though but i'll let you know if i go i mean i know charleston isn't isn't really uh that is rich upstate but it's closer than where i am now dad is rich you think i'm rich you're rich oh yeah you're a rich man with a beard on your head okay remember we're gonna write down our ideas what we want to talk about write them down oh yeah john says basically create react app out of the box builds a progressive web app automatically yeah you know what you are right john uh that's true like you have everything you need for a progressive web app yeah right mr john gemma michael cruz says uh have franciscan university host a conference and pay for us to get there it really wouldn't be that many people think how much we could do on a hackathon over the over a weekend oh actually that's a great idea yeah right michael gemma or my channel whatever your name is do you go upstairs no all right so i had an idea and i presented it to the head of my department at franciscan gemma why don't you go play in the other room and i'll come get you when i'm done nope i'm saying you're going to hurt everybody's ears when you scream like that because they probably have headphones on okay okay i don't want you hurting everybody's ears okay all right okay okay uh you're not gonna get any any gummy bears if you scream anymore okay no gummy bears all right you gotta be a good girl then i wouldn't make it all the way to that yellow no all right so here was my idea uh i had an idea to start a boot camp like a coding boot camp a code school at franciscan so it wouldn't be for actually you know university credit and that would actually be an advantage because being accredited uh and all that means like we'd have to have people with masters and phds teaching um and the the process to get courses approved is really really slow but if we did it as this separate entity kind of like catechetical institute did that site that we did for them they're an institute people don't get real degrees through there they get a certificate it would be somewhat like that but it would be tied into franciscan so since i wouldn't be like a real professor i could teach there or you know other people you know could teach that don't necessarily need to have a degree so anyway i thought it would be cool and then we could branch out like start with web dev stuff but branch out into maybe like some other cool things like machine learning and then that way like i don't know i think it could be useful uh i think people might might like that and it could be good for the university too so i just need to tell the right people i guess and get it started probably find donors who are willing to donate to get it started as well but um i think it'd be cool all right i'm gonna read it after after gemma and angie said hello and john said hello carlos too i thought i said mr johnny see your beard's getting in my face it's not even your bearded your hair what technically your beard in your hair i think there's a line right there i like that i might have just made a lightweight they said that you sound smart who said that was that who said that was that mr j johnson yeah that was mr johnny hi mr johnny all right anna says you're so cute crazy says uh what's up hey how's it going thanks for joining in the the live chat cornelia is coming you want us you want to be you want to what's that cchs crusaders oh okay that's the um central yeah the catholic the catholic high school here in stephenville is is catholic central high school and the mascot is the crusaders so cchs crusaders say hi michael says my youngest has autism along with adhd so your project sounds interesting oh yeah i mean i i don't have any medical background i don't have experience with this yet but i did i i don't know i the idea makes sense that it could happen it just it's just a matter of if i can get reliable consistent data from this headset if not like i might have to buy a more expensive headset to get good data but i think like um jose says cool stuff regards from el salvador hey how's it going uh let's see javascript says hey i was born and lived until age four in charleston oh cool you probably don't remember that much if you left at age four but i think charleston is one of my favorite cities really beautiful city especially in the spring yeah you see the headphones you wanna wear them all right blake says do i get a name i guess not she left and blake says family reunion uh blake also said hey jesse that sounds like a cool project what language are you using we're actually gonna use javascript so um alex castillo has done a lot of work with us already and uh he has some github repos where he's able to get the data and use javascript to display
