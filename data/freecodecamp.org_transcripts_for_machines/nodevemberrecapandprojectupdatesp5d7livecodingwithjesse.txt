hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i have a lot of stuff to talk about we probably won't be doing that much coding so i hope that's all right but i want to give you a little recap of how things were at november and then we have a lot of stuff coming up this month and in in january so i want to give you all an overview of all the different things that we'll be working on and then if you'd like to you know help work on some of those things that'd be great i'll probably make repos for everything that i talk about today soon if there aren't already repos for them and then we can you know start opening issues and pull requests some of these projects can be really fun uh technologies we haven't worked with before so i'm hoping that i'm hoping this will be exciting to hear all this news and it'll make up for the lack of of code so first off uh let me talk about november sorry okay there we go the analytics on youtube were saying that no one was watching for a long time so just checking so november was really really fun and i i talked about my experience with with this stream with with live coding and i got a just so many positive comments afterwards uh it was amazing it went you know better than i could have hoped for uh so the video of my talk is on my youtube channel so it's the first video on the channel right now i can paste in a link for you all let me do that now and that way you can check it out if you want uh maybe i'll put a link in the description for those of you who are watching the recording hopefully i remember to do that and we'll put it in i don't always remember to put in the links when i say i'm going to all right so here's the link now in the live chat and um of course you're probably not going to want to watch it right now if you missed the stream um but uh oh okay cool it looks like uh rook already watched it um do you like the humble joke cool i yeah i i thought it was cool i thought it was funny i'm drinking the worst coffee i've ever had in my life right now i don't know how long had been sitting in the pot right because i was gone in nashville for the last three days so it's entirely possible that coffee's been sitting there for more than a day i just warmed it up the microwave for a long time hoping to kill any bacteria and it's really bad but um i didn't have time to actually make fresh coffee because the stream was starting so alright so let me talk a little bit about uh the cool things at november and and then we'll get to the project so if anybody happens to be watching the stream and you're at november uh say hi in the live chat if you can and that'd be really cool so just some of the highlights and if anybody's watching and you're a speaker or i talk to you in november and i forget to bring up bring you up is one of the highlights i apologize but it's hard to remember things being on the spot live so uh cool thing gabrielle from microsoft she did a node robotics workshop that was amazing we actually built a a node bot that was a little car that you could control with node from your keyboard so the code was literally like um you know when you press the right arrow key uh then the node bot will go right so it was controlling uh the wheels based on uh like we had a little battery pack and this little thing called a photon which is kind of like an arduino i mean it was really cool a little motor so cool um so and i actually got to keep the stuff for the nodebot so i think i took it apart to bring it home and i think i'm going to make it with my kids so that was a really kind of cool highlight don't know that i'll use it for my job here but it was it was fun to see how that works and maybe i'll find some some practical use for it around here um also uh there was a great talk um about the one of the keynotes from ben ben alegbedu uh gave a talk on why eventbrite switched to react uh so he wrote this really long like 19 page paper convincing everyone at eventbrite why react was the way to go and they were switching from backbone and there were a lot of cool things in there that i had never considered that was a good reason to go with react so i i really like that uh let me think what else um there is a cool presentation from someone at github uh her name was shelley so shelly from github gave a presentation on async await which was really cool because we've started using that in some of our projects and it was cool to learn about she basically went through the history of how you do things like that so from callbacks uh to promises talked a little bit about generators and then onto async await so it gave me like a nice overview of how that sort of thing has been handled in javascript so very useful and i know i'm forgetting so many other things but i mean really the biggest highlight was meeting so many developers from all over um really all over the united states from so many different companies um from big companies like microsoft i actually met um and got to talk to marie from microsoft who works on the um office uh was it the outlook app uh she builds micro services for the outlook app which is cool all the way to like local um small companies that were local in nashville that talk from you know devs from there uh just really cool i got to talk to some people from heroku and um netlify and that's actually gonna i'm gonna bring that up later when we talk about our projects because i think we're going to do some stuff with netlify and possibly with heroku as well so anyway if anybody from november happens to be watching now or later on you watch the recording um you all were awesome especially anybody who i talked to um you're awesome i enjoyed so much you know meeting everyone and talking everybody was just so nice and um so hopefully some of those people from november will start watching the stream occasionally and we can keep in touch all right so let me check the live chat quickly to see if there's any node member related questions uh and then we'll move on um also i guess one other thing the uh the free stuff at november was awesome i got cool tshirts i'm wearing i don't know how i can show you i'm not i'm not gonna try to show you but i'm wearing heroku socks right now which look really cool i've got a bunch of stickers um free time uh on heroku so um 500 free dino hours on heroku i did get a cool fidget spinner um from oh no it doesn't say the the company name i'm sorry i really wanted to give him a shout out but it doesn't say the name i got a cool water bottle that is branded for november so anyway highly recommend going to november if you can uh for 2018. i'll try to go back there if i can it was really cool um maybe they want me to speak again i don't know i have to come up with something different to talk about um so as we said let's see how brett said jesse you deserve a fresh cup every day fresh cup of coffee thanks for that um oh cool john says i'm a natural at talking yeah that's yeah it seems like i have the talking down i just need to talk less in code more right that's the that's what everyone says street fighter motorcycles says i look at the screen i have a notification from you i push the button and you're talking about this thing drinking bad coffee what are you talking about i'm worried now my blood pressure is up uh i got a hard thing please i need to know if the coffee is good i'm worried the coffee is terrible that's what i get for trying to warm up old coffee i have no idea how old it is um shri count says tell us about tell us something about november i'm new to your channel um oh yeah if you're not i keep saying november i didn't explain anything about what it was it's a javascript conference uh specifically geared around node but there were a lot of talks about frontend stuff as well uh node.js being javascript that can run on the on the server uh so really good conference it was in nashville tennessee a lot of the talks were about react um or like somewhat react related stuff like graphql which is frequently used with react but then there was other stuff like the nodebot thing that had nothing to do with react just you know reacts just really popular now so anyway so i got a lot from it because we work with react and um so there are a lot of things you know that i can apply now to our projects all right oh i guess someone from argentina hey how's it going also from new york great and um actually i met three people in november from the dominican republic which was awesome because i've never met anyone from the dominican republic before and then now within like two days i met three people and they're all really really nice awesome people so if anybody's from the dominican republic watching uh say hi and um let's see oh someone from brazil from bosnia awesome yeah people from all over i love it uh okay so now let me move into some of our projects i'm gonna throw a lot of stuff at you oh cool we got someone from dominican republic great let me angel eduardo rodriguez felix awesome hey i'm from dominican republic 2. all right cool we have two people from dominican republic here all right we have some from india i always have people from india india is well represented i think in the uh in the streams it's awesome and i always am like amazed that you all in india stay up so late to watch this and uh thanks thank you for that that's like it's amazing to me that that you are willing to stay up um oh kenya awesome if someone from kenya all right so i'm going to throw a lot at you with these projects now so um i'm not going to go in depth into any one of them because i want to make sure i get them all in and then if there's questions you have about any of the projects let me know and then i'll talk more about the projects that you are more interested in and i'll just kind of go quickly through the stuff that maybe is not so interesting to you let's see uh from the ukraine we have algeria norway awesome yeah urine from from norway i i remember thank you for reminding me um because i remember i had trouble pronouncing that at one time so um okay so let's talk about let's talk first about the project we've been working on right because i did uh say that this was still part of project five so i want to make sure we talk about project five so it's not misleading so that's this main website that we've been building we started in gatsby and then we switched to react but we kept our gatsby branch open so here's what i'm thinking all right i had i merged some pull requests in so thank you for everybody for the pull request and um i will maybe i'll go over that and at some point today or tomorrow we had a cup at least one person it was their first pull request i think so congratulations on that but i talked to some people who know a lot more about gatsby than i do and i think that it will be very doable to do this site in gatsby before i was kind of not sure about it you know partly because i i'd never used gatsby before so i i really just had no idea no experience as to whether or not what we wanted to accomplish would be best accomplished with gatsby and i think that it we can and i think it may end up being faster so here's what i'd like to do i'd like to build out the sites both sites the next version and the gatsby version just a little bit more to the point where we're actually pulling some data from a like a test uh wordpress installation i will try to pull it with graphql and i'd like to set up both of them in a production environment and then test the speed and potentially to even test like the load on servers if we can from what i've heard at november gatsby should be faster if we set it up the way that i was i was talking about so um i think i i know this is crazy to keep trying to develop these well you know we're we're not that far into the development of this site so i don't know let me know what you all think about it but it just seems like it seems like the speed advantage is going to be significant um so in particular i do i want to thank uh brian douglas from netlify so i you know i doubt who he'll ever watch this or anything but i just want to thank him for taking the time to go through explaining a lot about how gatsby and netlify handle sites like this like where we're pulling data from the api um and how the rebuilds work and and all that so so that is the big the big kind of change for this project that will i th that we'll do it will try to do so if anybody is more interested in working with gatsby than you are with next feel free to start working on the branch what i'd like to do is keep them as similar as possible so in terms of ui it's they're going to be identical which should make it a little bit easier is you know all the ui stuff can pretty much just be copied and then the only things that will really change is um kind of our server setup right because the routing with gatsby was similar right it was just the stuff that's in the pages file i believe uh the pages folder i mean so anyway we'll have to take a closer look at that and work on it um but i have a much at least i think i have a much better understanding of how that would actually work uh so anyway that's big change number one we're gonna most likely go back and be doing some updates on our very first project that we did on the stream that catechetical institute website that we built with next wordpress the wordpress api uh we did serverside rendering a lot of caching in there we're doing load balancing on that so if you weren't with us during that project you know check out the repo for it uh if you go to the repo with all the other projects i think it's called ci react so i'm gonna probably open up some issues in that repository for the new things but just to give you a heads up i'm gonna have a meeting i think next week or the week after i can't remember the date with the people who are in charge of that that project uh the catechetical institute some of the things they've requested are um basically a a space kind of above the fold on the home page for uh new like news and and stuff so that they can kind of pin it to the top all this new stuff so we already have that section at the bottom so there's going to have to be some discussion on what this is going to look like since we already have a section that does exactly that could could we just move the section up and maybe redesign it so that it's not quite as big i don't know we'll have to discuss it but if you all have any suggestions for that let me know and then i could bring it up in the meeting or also we're going to add some new sections that'll basically be identical to some existing sections so that's not really even worth discussing um they'd like to maybe update that find a nearby event section that we already had the geolocation in but we just need to build out the ui so that it's obvious that you can use the geo location so we had never finished finished that before so we'll get to that so if anybody has any ideas for you know kind of an intuitive way uh to basically for a user to know that these fields are clickable and they could sort by them in a way that looks nice you know mobile desktop uh and it's pretty obvious and fits with the overall material design scheme and the particular color scheme for that site um let's see oh we're gonna have to do some forms most likely so it's not like we haven't done anything like this before but we currently don't have any forms on that site so we're gonna have probably two forms and uh so it's not gonna be a big deal i don't think we need file uploads at all so it's gonna be pretty basic but you know we'll need some form elements we'll need some um the word just slipped my mind when you check form validation that's it so we need some form validation um let's see okay they're not happy with the font size so they think the font size is too large so um we'll see we'll see i'm i'm more likely i like to have a larger font for readability uh so i'll have to let you know how that goes um that will be hard to change though and uh good news is that resource page that we spent so much time building they love the resource page and they thanked us they thanked me for all the hard work but i know that you all did a lot of the work too so i'm going to extend that thanks to you all for that and we may end up adding an entirely new page to the site that would be a place to submit advice and then also have that advice displayed for everyone so that's a possibility uh that's listed as something that would come in the future that we might not have to work on um you know this month or even next month so uh i'm gonna check the live chat see if there's any questions about some of the updates that i just talked about before i move on and uh let me know too if you if you'd like to see like something else on the screen besides me i can switch back to the view where you see the code uh i don't have a lot of code to show you right now but um i'm happy to switch it if you uh if you like okay okay uh the wall says uh so are your past projects on mirn stack um what is that so mirn is what like exp help me out on mern i can't remember what the m is is the m [ __ ] is it [ __ ] x express reacts nginx okay so them is [ __ ] well yeah well we're somewhat on the mern stack we haven't really used [ __ ] uh very much did we use i think one of the projects that we haven't launched yet uses [ __ ] uh that bulletin project we got some updates for that too so we'll get to that i hope i don't forget because those are really exciting but basically all our projects we've used react if we need to do stuff like custom server stuff we're also doing some some things with with express obviously node we've used yeah so we have the urn of the mirn stack we have the ern um that's uh that's who yeah so thank thanks for the in the live chat thank you for uh letting me know what what the everything in mirn was so i had i had some of it right i forgot about the manga um yeah so basically we have everything except the [ __ ] all right let's see all right a lot of people saying hello there's somebody from birmingham uh uk there's a birmingham in the united states too so make sure you want to specify from romania but living in birmingham awesome albania cool um oh there's a new react update so john hanson mentioned react update 16.2 no more div around divs or using an array of components with named keys and commas uh react fragment is here awesome i'll have to check that out maybe um if if possible i'll try to use that feature in an upcoming stream i think that'd be really cool to you know try it out live as soon as we can um cool jordan says hey from ann arbor michigan awesome um all right let me move on to i think the most exciting things that we're going to work on so let me let me set up this scenario for you all to ex so that you all know why i think we should do this so as some of you may know recall i try my best to not complain on the stream but you may have heard me complain about the amount of support i have to provide for things like the bulletin or the resource center for the bulletin in particular the login process people just um almost always the problem is old browsers but occasionally there's some weird things with emails not being sent uh it's not really from our end the emails do get sent from ion they just don't get picked up by they get blocked basically i don't even want to say block because i don't even get a message that they're blocked they just get lost somewhere along the way i don't know why but anyway we have that problem and then in the resource center we have the problem with older browsers not accepting the forms being submitted so right now we have a disclaimer on our one of our forms that it does not work with older browsers but i think i figured out a way where we can just totally avoid all of that browser compatibility stuff and i was inspired to do this uh when i was talking uh with um shelly from github i cannot remember her last name so sorry um but shelly from github who is a speaker at november works on the electron team so if you're not familiar with electron it's a way to build um desktop apps for windows and mac i think also also linux i'm pretty sure that it works for linux too but you can build that in javascript html and css and it will run or as a desktop app so some examples of this are atom visual studio code slack maybe spotify i can't remember a spotify the desktop app runs on that or not but for sure the first three that i said so i think we should make the bulletin and the um the resource center desktop apps and mobile apps so we're going to be using react native for mobile and then is there a name for making electron apps with react does it have a special name or are we just is it just called electron and we'll just use react i don't know if there's a special name let me know um but i think that'll be so cool because we've never done anything with electron before and we've just kind of briefly looked at one of my projects that i did with um react native but i was just kind of showing you all how you know kind of the final result we didn't really work on it together so these are going to be like side projects that we'll do in parallel so i'll create repos for them i'll set up like the boilerplate so i'll use create react native app and get it started just to set up the repo and then i'm going to need to do my research on electron because i've never done anything with electron so whatever is the easiest way to just get something started we'll do that and then the process will simply be taking what we already have for those projects so the um resource center is already live and it's at a completed stage we'll we'll port those over uh to react native and to electron and then for the bulletin there's a little bit more we have to do for the bulletin to get it to a completed stage but we'll also have repos open for those so that when i have time i'll work on it when i can but as as you all may know my number one priority now is that main website that we're working on at project five so as i can i'll work on them but if any of you are really interested in learning more about react native or electron and you're you're kind of looking for a project then uh you know go ahead with this i'll try to do my best to keep up with pull requests and open up issues but the cool thing is is you all already know exactly what's expected from this because you can just check out what we've done on the just normal react versions of both of these uh so yeah so and these are some things that they don't need to be done there's no due date on these this is just kind of my idea i ran it by my boss this morning and he thought it was a great idea so you know i i we're gonna do them and it'll happen sometime but there's no due date on these so uh we'll just work when we can i think i think that's all uh the only other thing that i want everybody to still keep in mind is i'm looking for a good javascript cms that is as easy for a user to work with as wordpress in terms of being able to upload um data what i don't want is i know there are some cms's out there that are like you you pay for like monthly i don't want something like that i want something that is preferably entirely open source and can be selfhosted just like you know wordpress can be selfhosted but i'd love for it to be javascript so we don't have to mess with any php i mean obviously it needs to be very easily you know compatible with graphql netlify has a cms that i haven't looked into at all i just heard about uh i don't think that it will work for our use case but you know we we don't need to decide on that yet so i'm still kind of testing things out if we need to to get some data just to test things we'll use wordpress with graphql and that'll be fine because we could always plug in a different source of data later on all right i think that's all that i had in terms of new announcements if i think of something i i'll let you know um but i will um so hey i just got all these messages uh so just distracting me for a second um the really cool thing about the november conference as well is i made so many uh met so many new people and then the fact that you can just add people on twitter right away is great because then i can contact i love that we're not like exchanging business cards anymore right like it's just like okay what's your what's your twitter name you know right there and um now we can you know communicate like that anyway let me check the live chat quickly before we move on to something so i can answer any questions um street fighter says jess has the coffee gotten any better with age no it says if not i suggest instant coffee sticks i recommend them personally they are amazing an instant coffee stick would be an improvement on what i have right now um it definitely keeps me awake just from like the flavor in my mouth it's just awful i don't know why i keep drinking it i need to put it far away from me so i don't drink it anymore um let's see okay so um electron does work on all platforms thanks uh so angel do you pronounce your name angel or some other i mean because you're from dominican republic so i'm assuming that's not how you pronounce it let me know how you pronounce it i'm not going to try to guess and mess it up i want to know how you pronounce it so i can i can get it right uh world boss asks if i'm a freelancer um i am not a freelancer i was a freelancer for three years uh but now i am uh employed fulltime as a frontend developer i do some freelance work on the side still i'm currently not i sh well i take that back i'm currently doing like very minimal freelance work i have someone who's um like a friend of the family and i keep their wordpress blog up to date uh i upload some post form twice a month and uh twice a month i go and update plugins so it's really minimal i mean literally i make 15 a month off of them it's like super minimal um it's insane because i spend like way less than an hour a month uh on that site and i gave them a very good price because uh because of the connection the family connection uh anyway i am interested in doing freelance work so i don't want to be always doing something because it's hard on my family but if anybody ever has any projects and you know you'd like some help with them uh i'm open to that i'm really picky about what projects i do so i'm not going to guarantee that i will say yes to doing that but i i do like if it's a technology that i'm interested in that sounds fun then and and potentially if the if the price is right as well uh then i'm i'm definitely interested in in doing that um let's see of a few other questions john hanson says uh jesse i wonder if some of the email delivery issue comes from dkim and spf pass in the header of the message this is a serverside setting it needs to be in place from the web hosting servers all right i honestly have i i don't know anything about um those issues i've never heard about that before um so you may be right but i don't even know how to check that so so anyway john if you have more info about that can give me some more direction i can try to check into it i assume that it was a problem with the university's email servers since basically i can trace it through sendgrid and sendgrid says that it's delivered um but they still don't see it and i know other people have had similar issues with other things other than sendgrid um i'm hoping so at the end of the month we're going to switch over to use instead of group wise we're gonna use outlook i was hoping that with that switch it might help things that's why i haven't really been like digging too far into it because i thought it may end up being a waste but i'm i i don't know that much about email servers and things like that so i'm definitely open to any advice you all have okay so the spanish pronunciation of angels different um so what would you say so is it like angel or something like that i don't know all right you know what let's look this up right now all right so i got it oh man this is killing me i have to watch a commercial to watch a five second video on how to pronounce it according to youtube that's it all right and that's cool okay so on on hill says yes that's good all right awesome i think it's important to do my best to pronounce uh your names correctly so anyway um all right uh brett says possibly starting a job right next to blue bottle coffee in oakland california have you tried blue bottle i have not tried a blue bottle um is it really good i'm not sure if i can get blue bottle coffee out here in eastern ohio oh cool street fighter says shelley from github is an amazing person i've never met her but i've listened to people who have um yeah like i only talked with her uh we were both um in the speaker's lounge like prepping for our speeches at this our talks at the same time so just kind of like you know occasionally talking uh but yeah she seemed really amazing i mean and she's not even out of college yet and she's already working for github and and doing cool work with electron a lot of cplus plus work yeah really cool so i think i mean she's gonna be like i think an amazing programmer already right you know being so young and already um you know doing such great work so um yeah so it was really cool to get to meet her all right brett says so we are swapping next js for gatsy gatsby on uh fus marcom no not on fus let me you know what let me switch uh my screen and bring up the repo just so that uh we're 100 on the same page i should have done this right off the bat when we were looking at this um where are we at it's more chromes franciscan react yeah this is it franciscan reacts okay so this this repo so the uh it is in the fus marcom organization and then the franciscan react site so we have branches right now so we have a gatsby branch and we have our master branch we also had a next branch but that was merged into master and it's no longer being updated um so the master right now is next and then we have that gatsby branch what i'd like to do is uh puts basically i want to pull in data into the master so that we can run a test of being able to pull in data from graphql from probably wordpress server side rendering that and then serving that and then doing the same thing with gatsby but instead of serverside rendering it will build a static site um and then push that to the client so i'd like to get them to the same point with just like minimal ui and bringing in the same data and then just do some testing on it to see like which one's easier to deploy and work with which one is faster uh i think it would be cool i know there's articles and people have already done stuff like this but i think it would be really cool to do it live on the stream uh i don't know i think there's value in that if you guys uh if you all think that that's kind of a waste of time let me know but uh sometimes it's just cool to you know try it and see the results being able to like tweak things on our own you know and and see how it changes uh the the load times and things uh also you know being able to see like what's the size of the the files that get sent to the client you know will one give us you know less that needs to be sent because that's you know ideal um anyway so that's the plan and while i'm in here on github i'll just so that we're clear on the other things um let me make this biggest this one okay so we're gonna do this resource center here the resource center repo we're going to make another repo that'll probably be resource center uh react native and then we'll have a resource center electron and we'll build it out react native build it out an electron i do want to make sure when we build out with react native we use the proper components so that it will work on ios and android if you've never used react native that might be confusing but there are some components that only work on android so we don't want to use those if we do use those we definitely want to have a check first like a ternary and if statement saying you know if it's not ios then use this so i'm okay with that as long as we account for that so um i mean i'll talk about it more when we actually make those repos and everything but uh just keep that in mind and then on this bulletin react which isn't finished yet we're going to also have an electron version of this that'll be a separate repo and a react native version that'll be a separate repo and again if you weren't here uh when i discussed this the reason behind this is that i'm having a lot of trouble with people with really old browsers trying to view this and uh it's it's causing me a lot of time to have to uh handle that kind of thing and it's so i usually the complaint comes in to someone else in my department they have to handle it then i have to handle it and then what i usually have to do is go over check it out because often at times they don't know what browser they have and then i don't have the um the access to be able to update their browser i need an admin password for that and i don't have like kind of the universal admin password so then i have to get in contact with somebody from the i t department and then hope that they get over there and upgrade everything correctly so you can see it for each time that happens it takes a lot of time out so the solution i'm i'm thinking is have electron which if they're using electron right then they're automatically getting a version of of chrome a version of chromium um that will work so they won't realize it but they're essentially downloading the browser that they need to run it properly so i and i believe i need to test this out on windows but on a mac even if you don't have an admin password you can still download electron apps and they work so i have done that before um on a mac that i didn't have an admin password for so assuming that it also works with windows then that would be really great so anyway uh also i think it'll just be really cool and a great experience for for me and for all of you to be able to build ios app an android app and a desktop app that will work crossplatform to build all that together i think it'll be some great skills uh that can be in in your portfolio uh and some great skills you know be able to take like our starting point and then you all can use that and modify it to make your own apps or your own uh you know desktop apps with electron i just i think it'd be really fun okay john hanson uh talking again about the email thing says once you look up these two items dkim and spf and get them set it can mean a difference of mail taking hours days not at all versus the mail going through in seconds contact the web hosting service okay cool i'll have to i'll probably have to talk to the it department then i'll look it up though because i'm not i'm still not 100 sure whether that'd be something on the email sending or the receiving side uh so i will have to um look that up i'm still hopeful that maybe it'll be fixed when we switch to outlook okay cool angel says i think if we have time to do all that uh that test the performance it'll be good and we will learn more on the run yeah you know what that's a good point if we have time to do that if you remember we still need to have this done by midfebruary preferably early february so we can have more time for testing and this thing needs to launch by the end of february so you're right we need to keep that in mind so this testing needs to happen soon like let's try to get both of the branches to the point where we can get a decent test within the next week and then we'll make our decision and there's no more second guessing and it's me that's doing all the second guessing so i'm gonna promise to no more second guessing whatever we pick at that point we're gonna stick with it and we're not gonna switch at least not for months and months so that'll be the goal before the end of next week we'll make a final decision based on our testing matt robinson didn't know you were going to be in my neck of the woods oh so or matt are you um from around nashville then if so yeah i wish i wish um we could have connected i actually had very little time the one thing about november that was good or bad depending on how you look at it is it was just packed with stuff uh breakfast for the conference started at 8 am and then the keynotes were over at 6 00 pm and then after that every single night there was some type of event so you know really you could go from 8 a.m to 8 p.m or later pretty much every day of the conference so it was packed with stuff i had hoped to get some pull requests merged and things at the conference but i i had no time when i did have any time i was like taking a nap because um it was it was exhausting but good it was it was good exhausting all right let's see i am on time 250. let's see okay so i think that's all i wanted to say in terms of updates just checking briefly yeah that's it in terms of the update so we got a lot of stuff uh kind of planned out and i guess we could i tell you what we still have we've only we've been streaming for less than an hour so i usually go longer than this let's do one pomodoro cycle of setting up the react native repo for let's say let's do one for the resource center since the resource center's already finished so i'm going to go through the setup process we're going to use create react native app and then we'll set up the repo and then that way we'll have at least one of the repos that we need to set up so one out of the four new ones that we're going to have uh i don't think we've yeah we've definitely not done this on a stream so if you've never used react native before hopefully this will be beneficial to you and where's my pomodoro i have it somewhere all right let's use this pomodoro clock and let me pull over my my terminal okay let me make this big enough so that you all can see it okay so first thing i'm going to do is cd in my into my projects folder and so here's what i'm gonna do i will be going to the create react native app github page and following the instructions for that and you all can follow along if you want if you just search for create react native app for me on google the very first uh result that came up was the github page so we're going to install that globally here i'm just going to copy over what's on there just to save time so let's install is that is it over already that was like super fast amazing all right cool um all right so i'm in the projects folder and i'm going to say create react native app and then we're going to give it a name so this is our resource center so let's call it our i'm gonna call it rc rc native i read somewhere that there was some weird issue where you can't use camelcase or hyphens i can't remember exactly what the issue was but that's why i'm going to make it like this which is a little weird but just so that we don't run into that issue that's that's why i'm doing this every time i've ever used this which was once i just had one word and it was all lowercase so i've never dealt with that issue so what this is going to do is uh give us kind of a starting point for react native app and when it goes when it's all done we'll have a new folder named rc native that we'll be able to go into and we should be able to see basically it'll be a working app let's see while it's going through its thing i'm going to check the live chat john hanson says does this mean i'm personally soon going to be building a react native app i'm just getting used to create react app blaming all of it on you jk yeah yeah we're gonna do react native um don't worry if you are intimidated that's exactly how i felt before i made my first one it's so much easier than than you might think all right so yarn starts and the expo all right so let's cd rc native which it gives you nice instructions right there uh and then let's let's yarn start i don't know if i have everything i need on this computer i do have my laptop i thought i downloaded everything i need we'll see i do have so on your phones you will need to download if you want to work on this an app called expo that's expo so you can see you're talking about expo here and that'll allow you to preview what's going on directly on your phone uh which is awesome and uh so i'm gonna go uh here in my search bar and and and expo now i could potentially um i'm trying to think if this always runs i don't remember if this always runs over wifi or if you can plug in your phone and have it run like that but this should work as long as i'm on the same network which let me double check that i am on the same network i am cool um let's see let me open up expo and maybe i'll uh make my screen bigger just to show you all you can also use um the emulator so let me open up the ios emulator so you can see it there oh i could just scan the qr code what am i thinking similar because of a problem all right so it looks like i could not open it q let me display that qr code again it's way too big i need to make this smaller so i can see it oh okay cool it worked now um yeah so let me make my screen my camera bigger so you can see some of this it's all right i'll let you see it when it actually gets finished it does take a minute oh shoot what happened sorry try to scan this again all right almost done now if i was thinking properly i would have put up i would have used visors you can see this on the screen but i wasn't planning on doing this oh what the heck happened dismissed come on if you shake it you can reload so you can see i shook it and hit reload hmm unidentified is not an object evaluating native version major all right i'm not exactly sure um i'm not sure what the problem is i'm currently getting an error message and the glares you probably can't see because of the glare so that's odd i've never gotten an error message right away what i do want to do though is duplicate this tab quickly and then open up atom just to show you the file structure all right um see we have all our node modules which is always a lot um let's see our app.js there we go okay so check this out this looks almost exactly like the regular react uh that we're used to using uh i'm still on me sorry there we go check this out now um look at this we're importing react from react and then we're importing a couple of components from react native right export default class right this is all familiar and then we're rendering return we have a view which when you see view and react native think div okay and then when you see text instead of p tags or even h tags we have our text tags so and look at our style sheet so we have our styles here we're using flexbox we have a background color right so without i know i can't get this to show up but we already know exactly what this is going to look like right we have our container that's going to have a white background we're using flex all right it's going to take up the full screen we're going to center it so the items will be centered both vertically and horizontally and all we're going to have are three lines of text and it's going to say this right just like we have in there so so easy we could check out our package json and see it's just simple now of course this is the create react native app right if we ejected it would be way more complicated but for now this is what we have we run start when we're um when we're in development mode and i believe if we want to make an android app we type android and it creates all the files we need and then if we want to do with ios it says we just type ios so npm start ios or or i'm sorry npm run ios or we could just do yarn ios um yeah super easy and that's it and this is i i still i have no idea what the issue is with the um with the error that i'm getting but maybe i'll just i'll try one more time to restart this and then if it still doesn't work then i'm not going to try it again alright so in the live chat oh blake got in here late it's cool blake um no actually blake this is an electron right now this is react native so we will be working with electron in the future uh but right now i was trying to set up react native but i keep getting an error saying undefined is not an object evaluating native version major dot major and node modules oh man yeah um don't know why this is not working see you might have been getting started hmm that's my npm version okay i have the the right version that should work um let's see i did let me double check i did check on the network so on hill says check the network yeah it is the the correct network hmm let me um it's already up to date okay all right let me i just totally turned off um that instance of the app that i was trying to run an expo and now i restarted the server and now i'm going to try to open it again and see if something happened maybe i'm like gonna flush out yay it worked awesome okay i don't know what happened at first but once i i turned it off and turned it back on and then that fixed it so um let me show you i know it's going to be hard to see and like again i'm sorry i didn't set it up so i could show it on my screen um but here's our uh trying to get out of the glare you can probably maybe barely see it depending on what your screen resolution is but there's the text that we had um open up app it's all backwards for me who's trying to look at it uh open up app.js to start working on your app so there we go so essentially in just a few minutes it would have been shorter if i would have just restarted it right off the bat um and got it working but in just a few minutes we actually have an android app that works now we didn't bundle this all in the correct file format or anything like that so i mean i guess technically it's not exactly like an android app but you know we have it running via expo uh on an android phone right now and if i had an ios device it would i could do the same thing so last thing i want to do which i think i still have time yeah we have about nine minutes left in this pomodoro session so what i'd like to do now is make a github repo for this just bare minimum github repo i'm just going to change just a bit and let's say i don't want to say mobile app i'm going to say react native oh my typing is terrible today okay remove these and save that and now we're going to make a get repo out of this and then push that up it'll be in there obviously there's like so much we want to do this is the bare minimum of of apps that we could make right now oh no i didn't have my screen on i'm i'm really bad at that at having my screen um switch back over so you all can see what i'm doing okay um so what we need to do first is a git init all right so we are in the folder right our project folder we're going to do a get init um let's see yeah okay great um git commit uh let me make sure i have a um a get ignore file yes i do awesome i thought it came automatically but i just wanted to be sure so we're going to git commit and it's uh get in it and so i commit a um there we go so after my silliness there i had to add the files first before i could commit them obviously um sorry about that okay now we have our repository let's go ahead and create a repository in github and then link the two up and then we can push what we have so far up to github and then now if anybody wants to take a look at it or mess with it or anything then then you'll have that let's see github and we're going to create a new repository we're going to do it under the fus marcom organization and we're going to call this rrc native um make that public and i don't want to add anything right now we can add in our license and we already have a git ignore we can add in the readme later actually we already have a readme we'll just have to edit it so let's create okay so now we already have a repository so we're just going to copy each of these lines i never tried copying both the lines at once would that work i guess it would but in this one we're gonna oops you all probably can't see that huh there we go um we're gonna add right this is our like ssh address for a repo so we're gonna add that and then our next one we're going to actually push to the repo that we've just linked to great now we should be able to see that code that we just had yep so here we go um here's our there we go there's our code and there's our text that we edited all right so that's that's ready to go so now we have a repo to work out of like i said earlier i'm not going to be working primarily on this or any of our other electron or native things that we're going to do because that's not that's not a priority right now for me um it's just something that will be helpful and that i really like to work on but i will keep up with the pull requests or at least i'll do my best to keep up with them and i'll bring them up from time to time you know if things change and if we do work on some of these things all right and my cycle yeah the palm door cycle is almost over so i'm going to go back to the live chat i'm going to answer any questions that you all have and after i get to the bottom of the live chat we'll finish up the stream for today oh okay on hill said i could also check out if there uh if there's a new version of expo um that's a good idea i mean we got it to work but that's still a good idea to make sure everything is is up to date uh john hanson says looks easy yeah right yes it looks familiar what is the trigger or logic to call the app to render on a device as opposed to a desktop create react app um it should be it's it's the same so essentially in terms of what's going on in the background i have no idea right i it's and it's working differently depending on if it's ios or android but in terms of you know as a developer what we have to do um the triggering the render works the same way everything is controlled by the state right so you you never um just like in uh normal react you never manipulate manipulate the dom directly it's the same thing here even though we don't even have a dom um you change the state and then things are you know here in the state so just for instance let's just say oops so we could do this and we say i can't believe i'm losing my mind where do i put state up here right um so our state uh is going to be display display text it's false we're going to say it's false right now um oops not that this latex is false and so we would do something like this right um display text where's my hopefully this is answering your question and i'm not like totally missing the point here okay so um if we save that i get i'll get an error can't find oops sorry state this state the display text okay so our state is false and let's see if i can open debug.js remotely let's try to open up this remote debugger and i have no idea where this is gonna open up at i have too many screens open and i can't find the debugger there it is all right so let's inspect and uh let's let's pop this out and make it bigger here's our debugger oh goodness all right let's go to our react oh no do we not even do we not have the react debugger well this is not this is not good why do i not have the react debugger oh well i can't do what i wanted to do all right let's get rid of that we'll just add something this thing all right so let's do is that how it is i think that's what it is in react native um a little touch this set state uh and then we'll just do um display text true so i have to do it's crazy i haven't coded anything for a week and now i'm like forgetting everything um all right let's just save see if i get an error all right not working all right so i'm i'm not gonna uh try to work with this anymore because obviously i'm i'm forgetting too much it has been over a month since i did anything with react native so i'm messing something up but i guess i can just do this just to even see if my code is correct at all there we go um so we can see the state is true um really small there uh so you could probably see that we have two lines you can't really read it but anyway um sorry i just went through all that and i couldn't get it to work i'm guessing that my issue is i i don't know what um what the right handler is here i don't think you can do it on click because you're not clicking but i can't remember what what you're supposed to do and hill says uh you can set up an android simulator on your window or iphone simulator on ios to work with expo yeah so i that's true um so i don't have it set up you can actually set up the android thing on ios 2 but last time i checked it was just more complicated than i wanted to do since i already have an android device it's easier just to run it on there i tried to get the simulator to come up but i got an error so i just didn't really feel like trying to fix it you know on the stream but if we do start working with it a lot on the stream i'll make sure i get the simulator at very least for ios up and running um let's see all right so native w01 says jesse have you tried the new version of firefox it's called firefox quantum and it's pretty dang good just made the switch from chromium or from chrome today i have not tried it yet but i've heard really good things about it so um i may have to try that soon um has anyone else used it like i everybody's saying it's super fast i know it says are you going to create some issues i will create some issues uh i'll do my best to create them soon let me think what i have i gotta think about what else i need to do that like needs done right now if so if i have time today maybe i'll try to do some issues otherwise i'll try to get them in there sometime soon blake says i use ssh to pull repo once and every minute it would ask me for my ssh password while i was working on it how i'm trying to think how i set it up you should be able to set it up so that you don't you don't need to it won't ask you for your ssh password actually you know what i do see if this works all right so blake the next time you um use ssh to pull rebo do this and see if it works uh yeah so do ssh add so ssh hyphen add hit enter it'll ask for uh your passphrase and then enter it in there and then you should need to enter it in again i don't have to enter in again until i restart my computer which is infrequently so once you do that as long as you don't restart things then you won't need to put in uh your password again uh alex b says jesse i'm new to free code camp i saw you uh did a lot of videos with multiple technologies can you recommend me a playlist a series to start from um i guess at this point it does depend a little bit about what you're interested in but most of our projects have used react um so it might maybe you want to start with project five day one and because it'd be really easy for you to catch up because we're not that far into the project if you're not worried about catching up with the live stream then i would go with maybe project three or four i'm trying to think what was project three maybe project four then uh because those are kind of simple to get started with we're using create react app to start with one of those i don't recommend starting with project one anymore because it's already kind of out of date we started that months ago they're already we use next they're already new versions of next and we use jquery with um with react which i don't recommend doing so yeah so start with you can start with really any of the projects but i would not recommend starting with project one project five is the best if you want to catch up to the live stream quickly oh okay uh michael is saying you should use touchable opacity and on press okay let's let's try that um let's do that all right cool let me try this kind of chosen oops i might have to put text in for some of the uh buttons in react native you have to put text inside and for some of them you don't i can't remember which ones you do and don't so yep i think that was it great all right cool so let me uh reload this and just show you um let me move my camera okay all right so this is going to be really small so right now i know it's hard to see but if we have our click me button there it's just text and if i click it now we have the more text right the state is true so in terms of like rendering telling it when to render it's exactly the same right we just have the equivalent of an on click handler and that does not directly do anything uh to anything that's on the screen but what it does do is it changes the state every time there's a state change that triggers the rerender um so that's that's still how we're how we're handling things thanks again uh michael for setting me straight on how i needed to do that all right cool blake says uh the new version of firefox is good but i just prefer chrome john says the new firefox is good but just a day after chrome really pumped up their dev tools sticking with chrome here yeah that's what i'm wondering my my big question with the new firefox is how are the dev tools because i like chrome's devtools so for me it doesn't really matter how fast firefox is if chrome has better devtools i'm sticking with chrome at least for dev if i'm just looking on the internet for something else then i'll go with firefox but actually to be honest with you if i'm just browsing online i'm using my phone if i'm on a laptop or a desktop i'm most likely working so i'm still gonna try it obviously but that's gonna be the deciding factor for me is the dev tools okay so that's the end of the live chat no more questions or comments uh so it's we actually ended up getting more coding done than i thought we would uh so a lot of new exciting things happening and i'll be setting up some more repos and hopefully adding some more issues to those repo so whether you're interested in regular react react with gatsby react with next create react app react native or using react with electron there will be something for you to learn from and contribute to so i'm really excited about that it feels like we're we're covering like all the react areas now we just need something with redux i think and then we'll really be like hitting all the major things but those will all be available we'll be talking about all those uh in the in the coming month and uh our main project is still going to be project five so that'll get the most attention but we are going to branch out a bit and uh this will be cool i hope we have some more people you know contributing to the code and helping helping you to learn and build up your portfolios um cool all right so i will stream tomorrow i'm gonna i'm gonna try my best to stream tomorrow i may have to attend a three hour long training session on leadership i would rather not but it's not up to me so that's going to take out a big chunk of my day i'll let you know if and when i can stream on twitter tomorrow and of course i will schedule a stream so you should get a notification if you're subscribed to the free code camp channel just in case i don't stream if you still want to see me you can check out on my channel my personal channel which is linked in the description i believe you can check out my talk from november that i just gave on tuesday afternoon about live streaming and live coding so uh so you can still watch me somewhat live um if you watch this that was like a shameless plug wasn't it but um anyway you guys might like it or you all might like it because i talk about you in a very good way uh in my um my talk from november so check that out if you get a minute it's only 30 minutes long a little less than 30 minutes uh all right so until then like i said hopefully i see you all tomorrow i really really hope i can because i haven't streamed for a while and i miss it um but if not i guess i'll see you uh ceo on monday but uh either way have a great day and i will be back soon
