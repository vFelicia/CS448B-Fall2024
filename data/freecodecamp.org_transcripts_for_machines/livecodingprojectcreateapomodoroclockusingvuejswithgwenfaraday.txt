all right hi everyone welcome back to another live stream if you don't know me my name is gwen and i run a youtube channel called faraday academy or i do mostly vjs and django content if you're interested in that the link is in the description below so today i'm going to be building the last free code camp project or the last frontend one of the series again in vjs and it's the pomodoro clock so yeah you can find this on free code camp's website so i do want to show you so about five years ago i think uh yeah around five years ago when i was looking for my first developer job um i built this clock you can see the background image is broken now but it basically had a timer and i could change the time and i could take a break if i wanted to start oh good it start and pause and etc so i thought that was kind of cool i can find all my old projects and rebuild them now five years later um okay so let me close that of course this is kind of space shippy looking you know it doesn't look great so hi anish hi tech stats good to see you again so i'm gonna close that um in my repo so this is also linked in the description below so you can see free code camp projects view in my github and i let me so in the pomodoro clock folder i have a readme with some of the requirements of a pomodoro clock basically a timer a special timer with a special name and this is the mockup that i have so pomodoro short break long break and then i'm thinking about having a settings file or settings menu and popup so um yeah users can change the amount of time for each thing like the amount of time for the actual pomodoro clock or the short break of the long break and i have all of those in the requirements here all right so i'm going to go ahead and get started so this time actually let me zoom in actually there so this time i'm using um of course for ujs vcli to bootstrap the project and then i'm going to be using uh beautify for the ui components and design i used bootstrap a couple times incline once um but i just really like vidify i think it it'll give us a nice design it's way more than we need for this project but yeah we can just use what we need out of the library so let me go to my terminal so i'm in free code camp projects view and i'm gonna cd into the pomodoro clock folder and now in this folder i've read me and mockups i'm going to create my app in this folder so i'll use view create and then app name i'll just call it pomodoro or pomodoro app actually because i think that's the standard that i've been using for the rest of the apps okay so i'm gonna actually manually select features this time so i don't need a router or view x again um css yes so that's the one i want i want to use sas so do that um island with air prevention only yeah normally i do prettier or something but for the stream i just like fewer uh issues with i guess nonerror linting lint on save is fine dedicated config files all right so while that's bolding hi sassy how are you so that should take a minute to build and then i'll go ahead and pull up the beautify documentation so i can't remember if it's beautify.js all right here's the documentation and basically yeah they recommend a cli install as a cli plugin so it'll set up everything it needs to set up for me and then i believe oh no it's going to create all this for me so i think i won't have to import anything else on my own i'll just do view add vidify and i'm still waiting for the project to build all right it's almost done poking generators that's a good sign additional dependencies i'm good i'm happy to be uh able to stream on free code camp today um let's see cd pomodoro okay good so it's built and now let me go into my app is vidify similar material ui in react yeah beautify is a material design framework um material ui i haven't used that for a while but i think i mean the look of it is definitely gonna be but i don't know how similar all the components are and stuff what they offer versus what vitify offers um okay so i'm in my app let me open this in a code editor and now i will run the development server and i should be able to open it localhost 8080. cool and i have my vue.js boilerplate oh yeah before i do anything here because i want um viewify to set itself up for me so before i change files on my own i'm going to do oh wait not npm i'm going to do view add viewify to add that cli plugin there are uncommitted changes yes i know about those all right so it's asking me to choose a preset and i'm just going to do the recommended one so this will add all the setup and config for me yeah so let me run the server again it does take a while for this to build all right so anyway in source here in app um vidify added all the beautify components here and then they set up my app oh wait it's in here yeah they set up the v app wrapper and then yeah v content for me to put my main content in and then they gave me this app bar that i'm not actually going to use for this because i'm going to use some tabs so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of that all right so that got rid of it and now the rest of the beautify components here i'm going to go ahead and get rid of those as well and those are in hello world so let me just delete the hello world component delete that and i'm going to create a new file which will be i guess i'll just call it pomodoro.view and in here let me put a template just a div for right now and now let me import that component into here instead of hello world so pomodoro and pomodoro okay components pomodoro okay so now this component is registered and now my page only says clock all right so now i need to look at my mockup so i'm going to be doing most of the styling first at least getting these tabs and then some kind of box in the middle for the timer and getting all this to display and then i'm going to start making the actual timer function so first i'm going to get some tabs i think so let me go to beautify and search for tabs v tabs component this is fine if i go down i can see some more examples like this one where everything is contained in one box and i believe this is inside a card because that's pretty similar to what i want yeah it's inside a card and then they have the v card title um i don't know if i'll have a title but i definitely want tabs so let me go into pomodoro now i'll just delete this row and let me add a v card and then v tabs all right and so i need a v model for the current tab um background color color grow i wonder what grow is oh i think it's where it stretches the whole width of the container maybe i can try it so let me first vmodel the tabs and i'm gonna say i guess i'll say timer type because my tabs are all uh if the pomodoro long break or short break so i have to create those here in a script tag i'll create a data method so oh wait didn't need that all right i'm gonna do timer type and this will be i guess i'll do one um because the i think the tabs will default to a number like zero one two unless i denote that it's a string so let me actually do zero okay and now let me put some actual tabs in here so it's v tab and that will give me the title at the top and then i could loop through tabs or yeah i think i'll loop through the tabs so let me do i guess tab titles as an array i'm going to call this pomodoro and the next one short break and the next one long break and i'll just do a v tab here oh and then a v 4 directive inside and so i'll do title i guess tab in tab titles and then i need a key here so key and that will be just tab because those are all unique names so oops i can close that and then close the tab and then inside the tab of course i want to display the title let me zoom in one okay and then i want to display the title so i'll say tab so let me see how this looks and all right so i see i think this is just the card don't think it's showing anything okay there's a v card there's v tabs inside and v item group okay so i have the tab let me see what i'm missing here from the dock so okay they're just looping through the tabs there and i wonder because i have the light theme but it doesn't seem to have anything inside of it anyway but i could change this to dark i think there and that didn't do anything so let me undo i'll have to look up themes later but let me see why the tabs aren't displaying so let me open this up okay so in the item group tab slider yeah so the tabs aren't displaying at all um so i'm showing tab in tab titles yeah everything should be working let me take this card and put it more in the center of the page or further down so i can see better so class equals i'm going to give it a margin top of eight okay so that bring the cut brought the card down and now i'm gonna give it a width so i think i can say let's see um promise circular okay i don't know if it has classes for width so i'm just going to add some styling here so i can style the card a little bit so i'm going to say style and let me go ahead and use sass here so i'll do laying equals sass and then i'll do um what is it it's probably a v the class is probably called v card too oh i did okay thanks i'll go and fix that uh tab tab titles oh i did okay thanks okay so here i'm gonna do oh now it's failed to compile oh it doesn't like the dot um anyway i can just real quick yeah the um the class is v card so i'm going to reference the v card class and do um a width i'm gonna set a width of i don't know 400 pixels okay not not wide enough let me just set it for 600 then all right that looks okay and now i want it centered on the page so um i could do a grid system which would probably belong in the app component so i could do here like v container and then close that and then the row okay oops and then inside i'll do a v column and then small of six columns and offset small of three columns okay so let me put the quotes around that too i think i need quotes all right okay that's pretty good and all right now i need the actual card content inside so let's see okay get out of that component now i have v tabs here and then after so outside of v tabs i'll put oh no it has to be inside of the tabs so let me see what component i use for that okay it's v tabs items b tabs items and then that's also v modeled to the current tab so let me do uh v tabs items v model and this will be i guess timer type okay and then inside of vtabs items i would think it's v yeah v tab item inside and then okay they're looping through and they're also doing a card inside i guess to give it some spacing and then they're giving it the prop flat so i think i'm going to do the same thing so let me copy this all right and okay now i have to fix these tab items so right now i'm just going to work off a one tab so i'm going to completely get rid of the loop color basil i don't think so um oh there's nothing inside of the card so what should i put in here i'll put i guess just a placeholder for now so zero zero zero zero okay cool a timer and now so also inside but that's not giving me any spacing for some reason i thought it was going to give me spacing but that's okay i can add a padding class here then so class equals padding all of five let's see yeah that's better and now let me add buttons here so the is it vbtn or v button i can't remember all right button this one thing i love about the beautify docs is that they have so many playgrounds so you can test out the buttons in the browser here but i just want basic button yeah it's vbtn so i'll do vtn and then i need three buttons so start and then v btn stop and then reset and the start button will be um i guess i can is it color or variant so i can do primary for the start button okay cool and actually these look kind of weird next to each other i wonder i know there's a button group somewhere here so let me see what the button group looks like oh this looks like they've updated this i haven't looked at it in a long time okay multiple toolbars um let me see how it looks with a button group where's their basic example so vbtn toggle actually i don't want toggle maybe i'll just leave separate buttons yeah oops didn't mean to get out of there yeah i'll just leave separate buttons for now um let's see are these let me make the timer bigger so i can use some of their font classes and what would i call it oh type in their typography section text and typography okay material design so okay these are their defaults anyway but i think there's a list of classes for bigger smaller i guess maybe i guess maybe that was some other framework i'm thinking of all right so i guess what i'll do here is just add a class of time and then here i'll do time and style that class by the way i'm using sas if you haven't seen indented syntax before it's not the default syntax but it's just the one that i usually prefer i think it's a bit easier to read and write and you also get some other shortcuts that i don't believe are in the regular syntax for sas um but you can do basically the same things so for time i'm going to set a font size and let me just look first at what this font size is so in the h1 and computed i can see font size is 32 pixels right now so let me do let me try 80 pixels make it really big okay i think that's good it should be a big timer now the font weight is i wonder if that's just the default i think it's using roboto yeah it's using roboto um i don't know what i have available to me but i can try setting the font weight so it's not so thick and do like a 400 okay cool i like that better all right um so that's good um i can also do text align center yeah i like that and now i guess i should start doing the actual timer and then i can fix other things as they go along so for the timer i'm going to use of course javascript set interval actually this is kind of bothering me real quick so let me um go back to tabs just for one second and use that prop to stretch them i think i think it's this grow prop that will stretch them all the way across the page the third tab looks bigger yeah because it there's this blank space on the edge there so let me okay so in here i'll use grow yeah and now it's it's completely stretched out all the way across and looks much better and with this centered and then the buttons i'll figure out what to do with them at some point and then add icons to the buttons too um actually let me go ahead and do that since i'm already doing the styling here so with the buttons um actually the stop button i'm going to give it a color of error yeah okay i have these and actually i'm going to go ahead and get the icons for the buttons because i can do that in a minute and where is it okay so when beautify when i added it as a vcli plugin i think that it it set this up for me but i can check so in the plugins vidify and no it didn't okay so i want material design um it's already doing everything else for me so i think i'll just add the icons object here icons and then icon font which should be mdi i think i think that's what i usually use so icon font and then mdi and yeah let me see if now so let me go in the start and try to add an icon there um where is it yeah v icon and then i can pass in the name of the icon that i want so the icon and then i'll do mdi dash whatever the name of the icon is so let me see if there's a start icon it takes a minute to load or no i want a play button so maybe it will be play yeah i kind of like the circle one play circle outline so let me do mdi dash play dash circle dash outline okay cool and now i have the icon in the button now it doesn't look great because i think i have to give it a left prop yeah so it pulls it away from the text and then let me try to make it small too and see if that looks better yeah i think that fits in with the button size that i have so now let me do the same thing for the rest of the buttons so for stop and let's see oh yeah i'll copy that and then i have to figure out it would be nice if there was just stop circle outline oh there is nice and then reset um what would reset be called um what was the first thing i typed in start yeah i think restart that's a good one so let me do restart restart yeah and see uh oh wait i accidentally changed the stop one so okay now and now i can change the reset button so restart okay cool i think there is actually a refresh one but or okay reload never reload one restart looks good i really like how that looks for some reason maybe i'm just seeing something new okay so let me center these buttons and give them a little bit of spacing um so i can put i guess i can put a wrapper around the buttons and i could give it a class of button group okay then close the div and now um actually so these buttons or the button groups inside of the card so i can also do a display flex and then align items center is it a line or is it justify no no no it's justify justify content maybe it's not oh oh yeah that makes sense it's because um what was i saying oh yeah it's because i'm doing flex here and i have two i have the button group and then i have this and then i have the h1 yeah so you're right flex direction column flex column yeah and then here which i mean i already had this though so but now i think i can do justify cont content center um or let me just look up flex their flex classes real quick okay so they have justify okay it's just justify justify center and i thought because now i'm doing it as a column it would be justify center let me see no i think it's a line items center let's see flexaline align items i have a line center okay cool that's good now i'm going to give these like a margin of just a few pixels in between the buttons and see um so i'll just add them as classes here so let's do or actually oh i don't have it here but i'll just add it down here vbtn and then add it as a margin let's see margin left margin right is there a margin y i can't remember i'll just do margin and then do um zero for top and bottom and then two pixels for left and right yeah i think that's pretty good it separates the buttons a little bit all right i'm happy with this and now um yeah this is probably the best looking of all the projects that i've made so far so i almost want to take a second just look look at it i think it looks pretty nice um so now yeah let me set up the timer so in here i'm going to need some methods methods and object and i'm going to need start and then a pause yeah i'm just going to use stop for pause because there's really no difference thanks i don't think i don't see any difference between stop and pause because this is just stopping the timer and resetting is what actually actually resets the timer so uh i have start now i'll need stop and reset okay so i think on my old pomodoro i did have pause but i had no stop so i think it was just like renaming of it uh start stop reset okay so i'm going to start with this the start one which i need a set interval and pass it a function and then i need the interval to run every one second so wait 1 000 milliseconds and then so every second i'm going to have to recalculate the minutes and seconds here so i'm gonna one i'll need these on data so i'll need minutes and let's see uh yeah because i'll need to make these strings at some point because i need leading zeros on them um hmm let me make them a string and see uh okay so let me do this then let me do total seconds which will be a number so it starts off with the default is well no based off of the timer type okay so let me just lay these out so i need a display minutes and a display seconds right and those will both be strings and then i need some kind of actual total time that i can recalculate every second and then change or update the display times um so let me do well should i call it total i think inside of these minutes and seconds i should put them inside of a display object anyway so let me put these inside and then so inside of display and then let me say total seconds and actually this i could do that as a computed property um no no because i'm going to reset the number of total seconds if they change to like pomodoro short break long break okay so i'll have total seconds and the default again will be 25 so 25 minutes i have to put that in seconds so 60 seconds okay so i think i think that's good right and then let me put the display actually up here now so let me see um so this will be a display dot minutes and then this display dot seconds okay and it's still displaying the same thing because i have those as strings down here now the total seconds let me look at the total seconds oh i did get view devtools in brave so just in case i'm having to look at this a lot i'll open the brave browser so you can see it better okay so in pomodoro yeah total seconds is fifteen hundred okay so now i want to start um actually so now i need to initialize figure out how i'm going to initialize these the seconds here so i could actually do these as computed properties computed then um and then based off of the total seconds the display minutes and display seconds updates so i think that's what i should do right but then yeah then i would i guess i would call them i would get rid of them in data and then just call uh oh display minutes and display seconds and computed and then based off of the total seconds so let's see for minutes i would just return total oh yeah and then i have to check if it needs a leading zero okay but first let me do total seconds times 60. then i have to wait no no yeah no no it's divided by 60. it's like that's going to be a really big number of minutes so total seconds divided by divided by 60 and then floor it so math.floor and then this one will be display so this one i'll have to do the remainder just like trim the seconds off the end so i'll do okay so total yeah total seconds divided or i think i can just do the modulus right and get the remainder of seconds that should work and now i have to check so here i'm going to do const seconds equals um total seconds actually not const this would be let seconds is total seconds modulus 60 and now i need to check if that's a string so if no i mean if it's less than 10 so if it's a single digit i need to append elite oh give me an error so i need to append a leading zero if it's single digit or the clock's gonna look really weird so if seconds is less than ten i kind of don't want to change between strings and numbers here um so if seconds is less than 10 i guess i could return a leading zero plus seconds that would turn it into a string otherwise i would just return seconds oh am i missing something oh total seconds is not defined oh it's this that total seconds yeah this dot total seconds and this dot total seconds okay so i'm gonna actually need this same logic inside of display minutes so i could do another method here to call like if seconds is greater than 10 so i can do um format time let's see um okay so let me do format time and move this out of here i guess so it would be um yeah let me move all this logic into here minutes could probably not need the leading zero the thing is if i don't have a leading zero here then it's going to change like this whole timer would shift to the left so it's going to move around the page i want everything to stay in the same place so the same number of digits i guess okay so i'm just going to pass in time as a number so time return a string if times less than 10 return zero plus time so now i can call format time oh else i need to return something so return time dot to string just to make it always return a string so now i can do i can always call the format time function and then do the same thing here where i can do const minutes equals that and then return format time minutes okay this will be cons too all right and now i need to put these in the shouldn't it be less than oh yeah i thought that was less than for something yeah thank you oh tom that's why i was wondering why you had that i thought maybe i was forgetting an html tag you're right thanks everyone it's less than okay so now let me put these in the dom display minutes and display seconds oh format time oh it's this dot format time um where is it where is it yeah here i have to call the method okay so this dot format time cool sweet so now i just need to start the timer all right so i have the set interval here so first let me make a method on the start button so i'll do at click equals start and i'll go ahead and add all these at click so for stop it's at click equals stop for reset it's at click equals reset all right okay so i am starting a set interval here and um so in set interval every second i'm gonna have to recalculate the total seconds so i'm basically gonna just minus one second off of total seconds i guess uh so total seconds minus equals one and oh it's this dot total seconds this dot total seconds let me see how that is sweet cool all right but there's no way of stopping it now so i'm gonna let that keep counting down so to stop it i need to actually have a reference to this interval so that i can clear it what if the time is at zero i haven't gotten there yet the time it's probably going to count down to negative numbers right now um but it's not there yet so thank you um let's see so i have display oh i don't need this display anymore because i have those in computed now i do need so i need a reference to this timer i'm kind of waiting to see what happens if the minutes are correct when it counts down five yay cool so now i need a reference to the timer instance that i start so i guess i'm just going to call it timer instance and um yeah i'll start it with null i guess so i have a timer instance and i'll set this dot interval so this dot timer instance so now i have a reference to the timer instance as long as i don't start multiple instances because then i'll just have no reference to them so what i can do here is use this dot clear interval um oh and then pass it no no it's not this what am i doing it's a this dot timer instance so i can clear interval on the timer instance and then for reset i'll go ahead and do this so i can call this.stop which will clear the interval in case it hasn't already been cleared and then i can reset the time so for right now i'll just do because i'm i'm not dealing with the breaks yet so i guess i'll just do this.total seconds is 25 times 60. so total seconds is 25 times 60 when i reset it okay yeah and that's one reason why i wanted to use vidify today because i knew it would be a little bit easier to make a nice looking app versus just trying out kind of different design frameworks each time all right start stop okay start goes down again stop stop stop oh because i click start twice okay we're going to have to fix this bug reset i'm going to have to refresh so if i only click it once and then stop you know i'm doing a clear interval on it so i can do start stop reset okay that all works but if i do start and then start again and then start again see how fast it's counting down keep clicking start and then i stop and because i lost references to all of those intervals that i started all right let me clear that so i'm going to have to do some kind of check here uh so before i start i should actually reset should be disabled when it's running that's a good idea um uh so here let me just do this real quick so let me do this dot stop before it started so now i can't so if i click start multiple times here it doesn't matter if i click stop it still works okay so reset disabling reset it's a feature yeah i don't have to work as long as my timer goes faster um okay so reset how do i so how do i know because let's say i clear interval here um let me actually see what it is after i clear the interval because i don't think it's a is it a fault does it is it a falsie value let me see okay so inside pomodoro what is interval right now okay let me refresh it because the timer instance should be null starting out yeah timer instance is null right now so let me start stop reset yeah it's still pointing to the same timer instance even after i stop or refresh so what i could do is in reset i could clear that instance so that uh no no no no that won't work never mind that was faulty logic okay um what should i do then so i could set a boolean maybe i'll set a boolean like timer going or something and that way i can know so i can disable the reset button like if timers started um unless someone else has a better idea that's what i'm going to do so is is running is running is that a good idea so it starts off as false and then in in start i'll do this dot is no because so reset if i want them to only be able to reset if it's already stopped then i need to know if it's currently running yeah so i think i'll just automatically in the start function i'll do is running is true and in stop i'll do this dot is running is false oh and then let me get go to the button now in reset i'll do disabled here so i'll put disabled equals is running so if it's running it will be disabled let me see if that works um yeah it should i guess it should be disabled here or if it matters so now when i start now that it's running it's disabled when i stop it it works again okay cool um what's next let's see oh i wanted to add a progress bar oh and i need to do the brakes let me do the brakes first how how is that going to work um so for short break and long break actually i only want to change the time here i want all of these features still here so i wonder if i could do so really all i want is one tab so i wonder if there are events let me look at tabs again here there must be an event i can capture and just change the time let's see so okay yeah i'm in tabs and now in the api i can see events okay so there's a change event emitted when the tab is changed and this is in the vtabs component so i can capture that here i think i can so let me do at change equals one second making sure i can see everything all right um what was i just doing oh yeah so at change equals um what should i call this so change change tab change timer type timer type and then i can make a method for that so do it here and i should so i should get the number of the tab i think so let me just log out that number and see if that changed because i don't know if i'm going to be intercepting their event so yeah let me see sorry um okay let me open the console oh wait change timer type is not defined on the instance but referenced during render oh i think this is an old error v content is deprecated oh right right use v main instead well i i set it up from their um their cli so that's weird i remember so they changed this this is something that vidify changed so but i might as well update it so it only takes a second okay so it wants me to use a v main wrapper instead of the content so let me see if that went away if it still works yeah okay so now when i change tabs yeah it's showing me the tab numbers wait long break to that one okay yeah so now i see the tab so i need to change the time based off of the tabs so i should have the times stored somewhere and um so i have tab titles here and i wonder if i should do objects because i need the number of time for each one of these so i think what i'm going to change this to is so here i'm going to do current timer i'm going to break everything so current timer and then here i'm going to do timers and i'm going to change these into objects oh yeah name and wait let me fix uh fix all this all right so current timers which is actually this so this needs to be each one needs to be its own object so the name and then i'll put time or i'll put minutes minutes will be 25 for this timer because we'll just assume they don't want to time seconds for right now okay and now i'll put minutes for a short break will be five minutes and then oops for a long break it will be um minutes i don't know so some people do 25 some people do 10 but hopefully i'll get around to doing a settings menu in this stream so they can change the time for it um oh yeah there we go so timers is a whole array of objects now current timer is the index of where the timer is in the array so i'm gonna have to change okay so here's the v model so i'll change this to current timer and then timers so where are my tab titles oh they'll be in here so um timers what did i call that i can't remember what i called it already yeah it's just timers so for timer in timers and i'll set the key as timer dot name and then this will be the same thing so timer dot name and does it work wait i have timer type is not defined on the instance but reference during render um oh yeah v model timer type so this should also be current timer and then i'll just update the method name to match so current timer and then change this will be current timer okay so now this should all work and this actually you know you know i might not even want this inside because all these tabs are is inside of the card here and i don't even need this inside of a tab item i could just not have any tab items since i want this to stay in perpetuity i don't want it to to move or change when the tabs change i just want the number to change so i'm capturing the event of the tab change but i don't actually want all of this inside so i think i can just get rid of all these tab items here and see if that works oh no um didn't really like it okay never mind apparently it does not work so i guess i need tab items um so how do i make this stay then i mean what if i what if i just take the card out and if i take this v card outside of tabs oh because i left it inside so let me see what happens if i take it outside oh yeah that works perfectly so maybe it was just because i had that inside of tabs let me try to get rid of these then i think i just made a mistake yeah it was because i accidentally kept this stuff inside of the v tabs okay so i didn't need that that's good can we refactor the tab um yeah we could we need to even this whole component is only 111 lines long um if we were to take out some of the logic the tabs really only takes up like this is all the tabs is all the v tabs it's these like eight lines of code so it's not that much we could probably eventually move i guess some of this stuff out or maybe just move everything out into components let me get rid of this color basil because i don't know why it's there okay so now like 30 minutes left okay so timer works shows up so i'm getting the event so what do i want to do with this event i want to change the type so what i'll have to do is change the current oh cool yeah so that that should be easy because i can change the current timer yeah if i have time at the end i will refactor current timer equals i guess just numb because that will be zero one or two and then okay so if the current timer is zero one or two i need to calculate i need to recalculate total seconds so when the tab changes i'm going to have to call reset yeah i'm gonna have to call reset here and pass in the total seconds i guess no um okay so i'm setting the current timer let's say i i call the method change current timer i changed the current timer now i have to recalculate the seconds so i should be calling reset this dot reset because i do want i want to stop the timer and i also want to reset it but i need to be passing in yeah let me i need to be passing in the minutes so yeah because i'll be able to get the minutes off of here and then calculate so i'm going to pass in the minutes and then this is going to be minutes minutes times 60. so here i'll have to pass in the this dot timers the num the index of which timer i want of the current timer this dot timers dot minutes yeah and then i'll get the minutes of the current timer so dot minutes past the timer object do i need the object for anything else other than minutes because i'm also going to be calling this reset from here so yeah i'm going to be calling reset from here so i need to do i need to also pass in the minutes here so i wonder i guess i just do the same thing only it will be this i don't need this dot so i'll pass in the minutes there too when i click reset okay sweet let me see if this works yeah it works i can stop i can reset no i can't okay so reset doesn't work but the reset here does work let me make sure there are no errors yeah so this works but for some reason when i start it stop it reset that doesn't work anymore so i have some kind of a bug here um oh timers is undefined oh oh right um num so i obviously can't do this so i need to do current timer because there's no num there so now i can go into timers pass in the current timer which is the index of the timer and do dot minutes so i should be able to do that let's see stop reset okay sweet i am happy about this reset okay so there are a couple things so the timer let's see what were we talking about earlier oh yeah the timer will count down to negative numbers so we should stop it and um so i should set kind of a catchall in here so if this dot total you should change the interval to 10 milliseconds oh to play with people i think so i i want to do a settings menu so people can change their own intervals here oh let me actually see yeah that'll just count down real fast oh yeah like a stopwatch timer that's kind of it looks cool though all right undo um all right so if this dot total um oh yeah total seconds it's right below it okay so total seconds is less than or equal to zero then i'll call this dot stop and return out of the function and i think so i think that should work and just to test that out i will do well i guess i'll do this so i'm going to temporarily change this to being 5 seconds start sweet so it reset because um because the timer's not going anywhere it must have called the stop function and that's why reset isn't disabled anymore cool so let me undo that and um okay so total seconds this actually should be computed because right now i'm just betting on this being 25 but if i do make this was actually easier than i thought yeah so what if i make a settings menu so that the user can update these these settings um let's see what would a settings menu look like i don't have a router in my app so i don't want to route them i don't want to bother installing it so let me do a dialogue click me all right form dialogue yeah so i could have some basic form elements in a dialog like this um yeah i think i'll borrow this so let me and actually the dialog is definitely going in its own component because that's going to be too much so user settings or let me just do not user says i don't really have users um dialog settings dialog dot view let me do a template and then i'll copy some of this let me open this again okay um close yeah let me close it okay so let me copy this and for right now yeah i'll just i'll just see so i don't want the row i just want a dialog and go ahead and close the card close the dialog and i need to first v model so persistent means i can't just close it by clicking outside which is good for a form oh cool it gives me an animation too so i have to click the close button um and now i need i need a v model so i have to pass that in via props so let me do a script tag here and props let's see what i guess i'll just have a dialog prop and this will be a boolean so i'll do type boolean and required is true okay um what else oh yeah let me import this component so i can start playing with it um oh yeah in script tags i'll do import settings dialog from settings dialog dot view and then here i'll have to register the components so settings dialog i know i didn't mock up this dialogue but um because this is just the basics because i thought maybe i wasn't even going to get to it because all of these have taken a little bit longer than i thought but i guess the timer isn't that hard to do so um let's see so user can choose timer yeah so this is where i thought i was going to do they can select and this isn't even real clear how i wrote this user can choose timer short break or laundry oh no i think i was talking about the the tabs here um oh yeah here is where i was talking about settings so user can set the number of minutes for each type of timer yeah and this will be actually the last requirement besides some optional things i had in case i needed more stuff to do so they can set the number of minutes for each timer so i guess it would just be like three input boxes and then they can update the minutes if they want so um what am i doing oh yeah i imported the settings dialog so now i can put it in here so i'll put it do i really have two cards yeah i do have two cards that's fine so i'll put it here oops and i need to pass in a dialogue boolean so let me do that and then i need to create the dialog boolean here let me do after timers i guess so dialogue and i'll do false oh i did it inside of timers so let me yeah do it after timers ah wait wait okay dialog is false i'm passing that in here oh right so the thing that i'm doing here i'm passing it in as a prop but i'm still using this activator button so i actually need to turn this off get rid of that and just put some text here as a placeholder okay and now i need some kind of a settings button on the page and i think what i'm going to do is a floating ax a floating action button since i'm using material anyway so floating floating action buttons i need some water ah i feel like i've been talking forever does anyone have any questions suggestions anything anything else to talk about um okay let me do floating yeah i think i can just steal one of these and these are just regular buttons where is it oh it's a v button but it's just set as fab it's given this fab prop um okay so i'm gonna copy this let's see and let me put it just on the page somewhere actually it shouldn't even be inside a v card so i wonder if i should put this in app let me try it here v button oops okay why is maestro oh it is that teacher he confused with maestro um let's see okay wait i have a dialogue and mdi plus so let me do mdi settings and just guess that there's a settings icon or is it gear oh cool it might be gear icon it's not gear either let me actually look at icon so material design setting this page always takes me a while to load for some reason yeah what is what is this one oh it's cog outline uh so mdi cog outline let's see what this one is yeah this is good except for the color color is not nice but let me do secondary for the color yeah that's okay um let's see so this is left let me do right okay and that actually doesn't look bad there it doesn't look great but it doesn't look bad and it's away from everything else so now if i click it i need to what do i need to do open the dialog yeah well i don't want small though let me oh no i do want small i do want small all right maybe top right let me try top right no then it's over the tab i would actually like it on the page up here but then i'm gonna have to do this in the parent so i have to do in app um so here did it change back to pink did i copy i think i copied the right wrong thing ah i don't know what just happened that's weird oh well secondary uh top right oh wow that's off the page okay so that should probably be inside of the container then so let me put it here yeah which is why that's a big reason why i use vs code vim instead of regular vim now because of copy pasting um oh yeah and this was cog cog outline so why let me see um let me try inside the row then otherwise i'm going to look in devtools and see why it's doing that nope it doesn't doesn't like it okay so it is absolute let me try getting rid of absolute okay so now that puts it here which isn't actually bad up here and then i think if i move to outside of the row it would go more towards here but since everything is so centered right now i think i'll just leave it here but now i need to i need to have data inside this component so and i know this is not too important but i just i like to have a return statement keep everything the same so let me do return and i'll have what will i call it here so i'll call it dialog from here so i'll have dialog as false and then when they click on the button it sets wait at click so at a click event it sets dialog to true okay and then i need to pass in that dialogue to pomodoro so let me pass in dialogue as dialog if i had view x i wouldn't need to be passing to grandchildren but there's so few components i guess it's okay i'm just passing one thing okay so dialogue i passed it into pomodoro so now i need to receive it in pomodoro via props here so let me do props wait uh props object and i'm getting dialogue which is the type is boolean required is true all right and now i didn't put it here oh yeah i did put it here so let me take it off of there okay so i have dialogue and i'm passing in dialogue here okay what else do i need to do then oh sweet it opens oh but it's persistent and i have no close button let me add the buttons then so let me go back to dialog in here dialog in here and where was the form one yeah i'm just going to keep copying from here so vcard actions all right i won't be able to set dialogue to false from in the component i'm gonna have to yeah i don't have um i'm gonna have to call an event or a method or something or just install vue x for one small thing uh where was i where is it okay so in pomodoro now no no in settings dialog inside of card i'm going to add the actions and dialogue i can't do dialogue is false so um should i do a custom event i haven't used events in so long because i've pretty much just used vuex or past things between components um should i do yeah let me try doing a view custom event view custom event okay so emit events so it's basically the same as doing listening to the kebab case version right and i think in view three actually this syntax got better too so maybe i don't yeah maybe i'll skip events and oh wait it didn't throw an error i changed props yeah avoid mutating prop directly so that's just a warning actually um oh yeah but now it doesn't open now because i changed the prop from inside um inside the child component um so let me let me just pass down a method see how that works i think that will be easier so methods let me do close mo not closed modal because it's called dialogue so close dialogue and this dot dialog equals false and then i'll have to pass the method in to pomodoro here so i would have to pass in close dialogue equals close dialogue and then let's see close dialogue yep it's spelled correctly so that's okay that's an app now i need another prop so i have to do close dialogue type is a function acquired is true and now i need to pass this in okay so accepted in props now i need to pass it into settings dialog so close dialog equals close dialog and now at the event oh yeah i need to do um that okay so now i have closed dialog and now let's see let me try to do it in the cancel button and call close dialogue at click so i don't like how long this line is all right let me do the same thing here so save okay oh it doesn't like it invalid handler for click got undefined okay so it didn't like whatever i did um let's see make sure i'm clicking close oh no wait it closed just fine okay i just needed to refresh i guess so for save i'm going to have a different method so here i'll do save yeah i'll just call it save because there's nothing else going on so after props i need to do methods here and i'll do i just tried to click your close button on the screen that would be really cool if i could do interactive live streams where people could type and hit buttons i guess if i did glitch or something i don't know how many people could be in there though it might crash um that's i think that's the future of live streaming the next evolution will be interactive streams yeah the save method could and since the data is in there i guess yeah that's a good idea so let me just receive that then so save would be of type function and required is true oh uh wait so um and click yeah so that will call the parent and now get out of there so now in here i'll need to have a save method that i pass in so let me put this on some new lines okay settings okay so now i need to make a save method and or i should should i do save yeah because there's no other save functionality in the app so i can just call it save so let me do save and i will need to call this dot close dialog though because i do want it to close when i hit save so let me try that out okay save yeah it closes fine all right yeah you're right it makes more sense to put it in there so now i need the form items in here and i also want a header so let's see oh i have four minutes um i wonder if i should one second yeah let me try to get as much done as i can so um the card title yeah i want the title so let me put this in my settings dialog and get rid of that here i'll do i'll just put settings and then here i'll do v card uh text and then in here i'll put the form items so what should i put i guess just input and then let me find oh wait wait that's not what i want i want text fields and then i think i can get a number here or yeah i can put the type as whatever i want prefix and suffix yeah i can add validation i won't have time to do validation for it unfortunately but let me just get a basic text field then and you have the text field that's it and i'll put it inside here oops so oh wait i'll make it selfclosing and then label will be pomodoro and i'll make three of these so was it short um actually i can loop over these so i need to pass in my timers to this now so let me pass in this whole timers object to settings so i'll pass in timers equals timers and let's see now i can loop through oh let me receive it first so put it before save so timers um type is um no array array required equals is true okay and yeah so the text fields yeah this is what i want to loop through i guess oh but then i have to save hmm i'm gonna have to save the unless i want to directly vmod no i can't i'm going to have to set the default as the timer amount and then save the new amount that's entered and it is 12 right now so i'm not sure okay i'm just messaging free code camp all right and yeah it's getting more complicated so um what i can do is okay so i can loop through and display here that's easy enough but i want to actually save a new time so actually my v model here has to be something new um so this is going to have to be updated timers and i think that i can set a default on data here so i could do my default timers and this could be an array of times and then uh i could say when this component is mounted is this the best way to do it i don't know i'm just trying to get this um done or thought through i guess we want more minutes um yeah i don't want to hold it up too much longer but unmounted so on mounted i could set these default timers to be whatever i pass in as timers to start so i could do let's see if i loop through this dot timers dot map the result will be default timers and dot map and then i get the timer in here so that's an object that's a timer object and then i can return um what have i returned oh yeah timer dot is it time or time oh minutes minutes okay i think that will work and now i have a brand new array in here that i can v model to so i can loop through here i can do v4 equals um did i really call it default why is it called default i should be calling this like updated updated timers updated timers yeah this isn't a perfect solution really but i guess it can be refactored because then if they don't update anything am i just going to save everything anyway oh i already called it updated timers here wait what is oh it's complaining oh yeah i don't have the bind key yet so so let me do updated timers and then set a key here to be um what do i want for the key let me just do oh i didn't even let me do time timer in or timer and then i in updated timers and then the key can just be i right here okay and then the v model will be updated timers i so it will be that at that index in the array where the timer will model to that index basically okay so data property must be a function did i do that oh yeah uh let me change this oh and then i have to return from here too oh wait uh return an object and then let me just do updated timers what why isn't my shift button working oh there we go and this is an empty array okay okay it doesn't like what i'm doing oh yeah it does sweet awesome so let me look at the v model then um in the which component is that in it's oh yeah it's inside of settings the settings dialog component so i have okay so i have props which are the timer objects the timers array of objects and then i have in my component data i have updated timers sweet cool it does change it to a string as soon as i change this but um then i could just save let me see if i can set up the save function in just a few minutes um so in save i can pass the updated timers um let's say let's say i just passed the updated timers that's like an easy way to save this and then what do i do in here um where's the save function so save will take updated timers and the easiest easiest thing to do i mean this has no validation or anything so just hope i'm typing in actually i can do the easiest form of html validation and say that the type of this is a number so they can't put in anything else oh yeah and then it won't change to a string either let me validate that real quick but it shouldn't change to a string does it or is does it just do that for every html input okay let me open the settings dialog again and now when i change a timer yeah it still changes to a string oh well that's fine um now i can do so i can loop through timers so i can loop through this dot um yeah i could loop through this dot timers and then update values or what should i do i should loop through updated timers right or no i could i should do this dot timers equals this dot timers dot map and then do timer and then i could do return updated timer uh no no what am i doing i'm not even thinking right now um i could do timer no i need to return an object so i need to get everything that's already on timer in the object which would just be the name and then i'll overwrite the minutes so the minutes will be overwritten by updated timers at the index of whatever this is in the loop so at that index so i can do that updated timers yeah because this is an array updated timers is an array and that will put just that one value into minutes and that will overwrite the minutes that's already in the timer in this dot timers okay let's see if this works and actually um this needs to be a number so let me parse it real quick so parse int because i'm not dealing with seconds so i'm just gonna yeah i don't want anything else just minutes so parse int it's default base 10 update timers okay let me close this and refresh let's see oh oh yeah because that is not um wait let me see let me change this to two save yeah short break is two now long break is ten this is twenty oh because the default is that okay well um can i in data does anyone know if i can reference um this as the default like timers this dot current timer well i'll have to do this here too so it would be this dot this dot current timer and then no i have to watch this dumb idea i'd have to watch it so i would have to watch the changes in these and then update total seconds and that's what i should be doing to probably add that and computed so whenever anything in timers changes i can update the total seconds um but you can still i mean this still works it's just you have to change the tab before you can see it working and then you can still start stop reset all right so i have to log off here um feel free to you know make a pr raise an issue create a suggestion um i appreciate everyone who's made suggestions raised issues ashik paul i think that's how you pronounce it he contributed a couple times to the other projects i've been doing made them a little bit better um awesome thank you anish i appreciate that and thanks for chatting everybody i appreciate the chat and not talking to myself that's that always feels nice so yeah here are the five projects uh some of them better than others today's was probably the best looking project that pretty much works but could use some some tlc some help in some ways yeah if you have any suggestions for me also leave them in the comments below and i hope to see you in another live stream thanks sashi thanks everybody take care
