now let's build a pinterest clone first let's take a look at a cool pinterest clone that ashley built so the theme of her pinterest was winterist the notion of awesome victories and you can even watch this video that'll explain kind of how she came up with the idea so let's go ahead and log in we can connect with twitter and now it's redirecting me back here we go we see some winds that are popping up here um so let's go ahead and see if we can create one of our own so if we go to our wind board we see that i've already created two of these and i'm going to add a win so what that means is i'm going to need a url so let's think of something that's really cool um a winner is you this is a cool meme from some old video game it's just like really bad grammar so we'll just copy the image url and a winner is you we'll paste the link here and you can see how quickly a fetch that is great then we choose image video is eventually going to be supported you can see it shows up right there in my pin board and it even swapped the position of these two which is pretty cool now we can go ahead and look at all the recent wins and we can see that my new win is right here pretty cool huh so i can go and i can like other people's wins so i can like this u.s world cup team the women's world cup team that just won we can like and unlike other things too so it's pretty cool and let's take a look at the user stories first as an unauthenticated user i can log in with twitter as an authenticated user i can link to images which we did as an authenticated user i can delete images that i've linked to and as an authenticated user i can see a pinterest style wall of all the images i've linked to and as an authenticated user i can browse other users walls of images i don't need to be authenticated for that so basically it's kind of like a public pinterest file very similar to pinterest much of the same functionality and as a bonus user story as an authenticated user if i upload an image that is broken it will be replaced by a placeholder image and you can do this with jquery broken image detection a quick hint mason masonry jas is an excellent library that will allow for you to have the pinterest style grids where different objects of different heights fit in it's kind of like breaking it it's a sequence of bricks like you see on pinterest or like you saw here on winters just to make sure that um you see that see how these are different height and it kind of figures out what to put where and make it look reasonably good that is masonry js so um i think you can have a lot of fun with this choose a cool theme make it fun and we're looking forward to seeing it enjoy
