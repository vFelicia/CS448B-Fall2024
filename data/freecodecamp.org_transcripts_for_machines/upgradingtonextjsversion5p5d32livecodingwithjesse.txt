everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse and I was just finishing up with my lunch that's why I was two minutes late huh today we're gonna upgrade next js2 the latest version which is version 5 so let's see it doesn't look like it's gonna be too difficult but sometimes when you upgrade things other things break so maybe we'll work through some of that who knows maybe we'll upgrade everything will work and it'll be awesome and then left to figure out something else to do for the rest of the show let me get my g feel ready for my my caffeine hopefully I won't be yawning too much as always G fuel you can sponsor me if you want there's a music on and let's get started and yeah sorry I didn't stream yesterday I just I had meetings at like awkward times that didn't really allow me to have enough time in between that I felt like I could do a decent stream and then I end up that my later meeting didn't start till later than I thought but I didn't know it was gonna start later until too close to the meeting time so I probably could have gotten a stream in maybe next time I'll just try to fit one in and you know maybe a short stream is better than no stream I don't know let me know what you all think if you'd rather have like a halfhour long stream on those days when I have a lot of meetings instead of our normal you know hour hour and a half stream let me give you my screen here and I will point out after we do the upgrade then I want to talk a little bit about what's changed in our routing so Nikki did some really cool stuff with the router and I added just some slight modifications so I'd like to go over that a little bit later on first things first let's check out our well first thing let's let's start our timer here we are so after 25 minutes I'm gonna go to the live chat answer any questions you'll have so just hang in there and please be patient and I will get to your question all right so first things first let's just check out our package J so to see where we're coming from and this could probably be a bit bigger we don't really need a terminal just now and we won't need this for a little while so let's see what version of next week are using swarm for point two point three but what we want to do is move on to five right so here is the blog post announcing version five make it a bit bigger spread it out a little it's still pretty small on the screen huh all right maybe that's it so there's a lot of stuff in this post I'm not gonna just scroll and read this out on the stream but I will copy and paste the link into the live chat so you can see it and then I also put the link in the description to this video so if you're watching the recording later on just check the description you can go right to this blog post to read more there's some new features build times are not going to be faster they've they've set up webpack now I'm not huge on web pack set up in terms like I don't know all the ins and outs of how to do it but it seems as if now they're routing you know front and backend stuff through web pack and now you can do things like do all this different stuff with CSS so we can do less set CSS CSS modules and they even have these plugins now so I'm gonna skip but you're welcome to read that on your own if you like but now they have these these plugins have CSS loaders for you know sass or or less right so that might be cool we could maybe instantly have some sass features in our in our next app so that would I wouldn't like that we have run sass with react before but it wasn't as easy as just putting a plug in and there's typescript support now I'd only use typescript so we're not going to really take advantage of that but if you like typescript now that is now available and let's see CSS preprocessors you just talked about that talked about module overloading which I don't really know that much about it it sounded cool though optional source maps in production so it's kind of cool there's some cool thing there are some things that I'm thinking like y'all probably use this and there are other things there like this is kind of cool not sure if I use it or not but all in all it seems like a pretty good pretty good update this Zones thing seems interesting basically running like multiple apps on one domain and then just having it be like obviously you can do subdomains and that multiple apps but this is talking about doing a subdirectory right you know so mydomain.com slash settings would be a completely different app living on a completely different server than mydomain.com so that i know that seems pretty cool new Docs and now it's easier to contribute to the docs which is cool let's see what else here's the one about the faster build time so they were able to achieve 23.6% faster production build times on their site on site what does it site dot see uh I can't remember what the site is yeah site site Co better caching for imports so they basically it from what I read it seems like before like on different builds your imports would have like different numbers at the end here so user would have to download that again but now what would happen is like if nothing changed in here when you have another build these numbers wouldn't change and so user wouldn't have to redownload that maybe I'm reading that wrong let me know if I'm if I'm missing that but that's what it seemed like what's going on here which is which is really cool I could have a you know definitely save your users some some data especially if they're on mobile that's a big deal but also you could achieve some you have quicker load times fragments all right so I don't know if we'll switch things up to this yet or not but it seems to me like we don't need to use some of the things that we were using in order to put in like title tags and things like that I believe maybe I'm wrong about this but it seems like it's built in now to next a different way to customize things like that better errors which is great because y'all know I get a lot of those so now maybe it'll be easier alright cool so that's my quick overview from you know from me reading about this earlier that that's what I remembered so now let's let's update so I'm gonna grab these and let's go back oops wrong one I've been migrating more data over so as always have more data so I'm gonna do a yarn add and I'm gonna paste these in so in case you can't read them I'm gonna read them out quickly so we have next at latest and then react at latest and react on at latest so let's hit enter and see what happens whoa actually hold on a second let's take this out of here let's go to a different branch and then hit enter that's weird let's get out of here get checkout and then do the B flag which I believe this will create the branch and put me on that branch at the same time which is always useful so you don't accidentally start committing things to the branch that you're on like master not realizing that you didn't move to the other branch which happens it's happened to me before okay so this is close branch next five awesome so now we have a new branch it's called next five and oops you decide yarn and there we are now let's hit enter and see what happens cool does very quick nice all right we'll verify here in our package.json not that I don't trust that it worked but let's see so we do we have next five great it looks like react and react Dom we're already at the latest versions which is nice and anything else change I don't think so this was these parts were probably just Auto formatting or something all right cool oh it looks like the stream wasn't working no why is the stream not working alright so it's definitely not like the CPU I'm not getting the fans running let me try I'm gonna try to plug in the ethernet cable I think I get faster speeds for the ethernet I that at least that's what I've been told I never really tested it out but I unplugged it because I can't migrate data over the ethernet cord for whatever reason now I can't find it I lost my Ethernet I'm have to stand up and cover the camera here so hold on all right hopefully that will help no I'm seeing drop down to nothing all right now we're back up maybe it just dropped down to nothing because it was switching over hopefully we'll be good all right okay cool so now let's just see what's happening with this now that we've upgraded let me find where I have this running there so have it up here I've lost it there it is okay so here's our app and I was on this page which didn't work before so I'm not worried about that but let's check the homepage and let's get our console up so we can see errors all right not bad not bad that works now let's try some routes all right faculty awesome that works let me restart the server as well just to be sure because with a with an update like that I like to do like a manual restart just to be sure let's refresh there we are okay there's some errors here so a free Actos server cool all right let me go back to the home page interesting all right so even our home page isn't working so let's try this out one thing we could do is go back to the documentation first that might not be a bad idea so let's go here and see what we might need to change all right I'm going pretty quickly through this so maybe missing something but it didn't seem like there was anything that said hey you need to change this for this to work okay let's see Harshit says try reinstalling react dom yeah we could reinstall that I mean we were trying to update that at the same time and let's see yeah I seen on the live chat so vibe vibe have really wants me to answer a question so just hold on I'm gonna do questions in about ten minutes okay we could yeah let's do Rex could not resolve react on server in node modules reactive hallo hey here's Alicia do why not do this the old RM RF node modules and then just reinstall maybe maybe it'll work and maybe it'll save a lot of time so let's do that if you never use this before sometimes it can fix all your problems you don't necessarily know what the problem was but it does fix it so let's try it RM RF oh wait okay our says you found he found the air okay alright node modules your life has been spared from now it's in the babble RC all right let's check it out I guess I could turn on where we have a concern on Angra so you all can see the errors as well I'm gonna pace this over so you can click on the link I just paste it in the live chat and then you can have beautiful errors right on your screen just like I do alright well let's take a look then for a second here at our babble or si all right so it says try commenting out the module resolvers stuff so we can probably call them out coming out everything here right or actually just this right we can't comment out in JSON so let me just remove it then all right let me restart the server just to be sure cool all right that worked let's check out some other pages nope all right so this isn't working probably because we're actually using some graph QL stuff here but this is a different error than we had before so I think this error was caused by us removing all that stuff about plugins so I'm going to put this back in and see what Wow well you see what we can do so evidently we need this part for all of our our pages to work except the home page so we can't just take it out it's so hard who's probably the one that made this file in the first place is saying remove the dollar sign so I will try that hey there we go it works let's try a different page film study No let's try another one I'm not 100% sure that that route worked anyway all right yeah it must be shoot why did that other page work I don't know why it works for a minute oh all right so I should say and restart yeah so we didn't restart yeah let's let's try that I didn't restart because it looked like it worked automatically so let's give it a shot here nope still there's I'm gonna get out of this view so I can zoom in a bit more ever so i'll ReactOS okay i'm gonna remove hard should say and remove the this little guy sorry about that hard I wasn't paying attention in the live chat okay no let's restart it mmm all right so let me check my timer all right we got about two minutes left and then I'll go back to the live chat and I answer some questions but it's saying the dependency was not found I'm thinking it still might be worth it to do our MRF and reload everything not really a big deal for me I've got lots of bandwidth all right so I've just deleted all my node modules please don't run RM RF if you're not a hundred percent sure you want everything deleted in that particular folder because it will be deleted forever you won't be able to get it back but I can get all my node modules back just by typing yarn so that's what I'm gonna do and the timer should be going off very soon so let's see I don't think we're gonna get anything else done 30 seconds oh cool it finished I don't think it finished fast enough let's restart this dependency not found hmm all right well that's it for that session so let me take a 5minute break I'm gonna go back to the live chat if anybody has any ideas for how we can fix this error that we're getting please put it in the live chat now I'll come back to it we'll give it another shot after the five minutes are up also it's really hot in my office so I'm going to take my sweater off see Gander says anyone else going to watch the SpaceX heavy Falcon launch as well maybe I don't know what time it's on the anybody know what time it's on for Eastern Time don't worry about if you don't know I won't take me that long to look it up but it might be cool to watch with my kids later on as long as it's not too late old so I says hello everyone hey how's it going thanks for watching and I miss everyone I don't know about you I don't have anybody missed me but now that I'm talking with you oh and everything I did I miss I miss y'all I tell you what it's really really easy for me when I come in to just be lazy and say like I'm not gonna stream today you know I gotta you know get the thumbnail ready for the video put the info and schedule the stream you know and it's not really that much all that can be done in less than 20 minutes you know probably less than 15 but sometimes it's easy for me to be lazy and not stream like yesterday probably could have squeezed one in but it's like oh well if it's not the right conditions let's just not do it but once I'm actually here with you all I really love it so anyway just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you she AB ass please give me a complete guideline to be a developer I'm not sure I can give you a complete guideline and in the time that we have right now but I would say as a rough kind of outline learn HTML and CSS probably learn things in this order if you want to be a frontend developer or even a fullstack developer learn things and do it in this order HTML CSS basics right you don't need to get too indepth then go into JavaScript it's probably not a bad idea to learn a little bit of jQuery it's it can get your confidence up and realistically you'll probably be able to find a lot of jobs that require jQuery so depending on what your circumstances are it might be beneficial to you otherwise just stick with JavaScript and start building things if you want to be full stack and moving to backend then learn node that'll be the easiest jump for you to make from javis like clientside JavaScript to get into the backend and then you'll probably want to learn a little bit more about api's and databases and things if you want to just stick with frontend though stick with your JavaScript and then if you want to check out something like angular or react or view to help help you out you'll go with that if you want to be able to follow on with these streams definitely check out react and it probably couldn't hurt to check out some sort of UI framework like material UI fusing react or materialized CSS or bootstrap or foundation or something like that depending on how much you like the design CSS side of things if you really like doing it yourself then maybe you don't want to use a framework but in any case it is it's good to at least be knowledgeable of those frameworks and how things are done in them because those are like common design patterns the users are familiar with so even if you don't want to use them I still think it's it's a good idea to be familiar with them so anyway that's like kind of my just outline of what to learn if you want to ask me know maybe I'll do a video of more indepth stuff if anyone's interested in that let me know would you like me to do a video or a series of videos outlining a good plan for what to learn and when to become a developer if you like it just leave some in the live chat leave something in the comments of the video or something like that and then if enough of you are interested then I'll kind of make more of an effort to to do that also I says maybe in short streams you could do question and answer actually that's not a bad idea if I'm doing a short one maybe I'll just say like hey this is just a cute I stream yeah yeah cuz it is kind of difficult to get much work done and just like a half an hour but question answer would be pretty easy that's a pretty good idea thanks Brooke says about the routing I'm sure that code can be rewritten about half the lines while being clearer and more performant Oh Nicki don't I I know I already told you in the the comments to that PR but I think it was genius I mean it was really good is the only thing I had to change and I we can talk more about it is routes that weren't included in that that object where we're actually bringing up an error so I just had to put a change it up just a little bit to make sure that those routes actually did end up going to the universal route but other than that it was was great all right let's get back to the code and let me write down where I'm leaving off Yeah right and if anybody's interested in doing some refactoring with that you know hey you know feel free to take a shot at it you know as long as the functionality remains the same and it's still readable that would be awesome let's see here we go okay I'm gonna check the bottom of the live chat quickly to see if anyone had any more ideas about Harsin it looks like Harshit made a pull request I didn't even merge this it's already made a pull request let's check it out all right let's go to github and once I get in here I will make it bigger there we are and best feather okay cool so let's check out the file first so we can see so harsh it has put in roots source no way that's awesome so that was the only thing to change all right hard do you want to get credit for this pull request I will merge it in or do you want me to just copy and paste this let me know I'm more than happy to give you credit and actually merge this pull request see our she says just copy and paste okay that's cool urgent says I made this as you might have forgot the carrots hole file why do I need to do the whole file it just changed one thing hold on a second modules over alias okay so right above alias I know you thought you thought I was gonna forget all the stuff that I change right but that controlz is my friend all right hey well at least we got a fresh new node modules folder right so restarting hmm it's not working for me yes that will check I'm gonna pull over harsh it's code on my other screen so I can compare exactly what it was okay so it is exactly the same I mean the formatting is a little different but oh yeah still same air same thing okay hmm michael says is react Apollo even in node modules I I would imagine it would be let's check it out don't need it at blank file there what's this this is some cool stuff I'll have to share that with you soon I thought I already had it open I guess not there's my package.json there we are that's a good thought though Michael it's worth checking it out Apollo yep yep react Apollo here modules can't resolve react on server in we react Apollo we could dive into node module and here see what's going on here's the thing I don't get I like really we didn't change react Dom we didn't change react Apollo that's what we're getting the air from react on server and react Apollo that kind of bothers me I would get another arrow down here I know it's hard to see yeah this was sure fine it's never modules tab who lives have Jess okay arch says try removing what is that called the caret sign and the dollar sign after this all right let's give that a shot my Babel save dad no same thing all right so let's change that back I don't like to you know so this is what that that file is looking for react om server so react Apollo somewhere it's searching for react on server alright it looks like this dream cut out but now it's back alright sorry about the stream I just I don't know what's going on with it today I haven't changed anything about OBS settings I don't know okay so harsh is saying remove the cache from the node modules which I did not do before so let's do RM RF node modules slash cache and the next one why is it not found of course it's there maybe it's just something with the copying area that's weird so Microsoft Outlook is giving me a notification right now for a meeting that was cancelled it even tells me cancelled and it's not I was telling me I have 11 minutes to get this meeting with that seems like it's something it should not be doing see all right so say that wasn't it as well yeah same error and you know raluchi she was the ADA okay so saying that's odd all right so yes I don't you'll see that when I mouse over doesn't that look like an odd path yes all right so in react Dom or server digest is just this we also have I mean the only thing I can see is that react Apollo is once a an older version of react Dom I mean again that just it doesn't make that much sense because let's sit this no I Donnie Eric for working with Saddam down here it has a different version hmm all right let me let me go with the left has to go saying Michael is saying why not just reinstall react Dom server like the message says I mean well I mean technically we just reinstalled everything right when we removed all our node modules see it looks like someone else had a similar problem with a previous version of next so there's an issue a closed issue on next J s repo trying to scroll down to see what what happened with that yes I kind of thought we'd have errors I just thought I would have a little bit easier time getting through it alright so I'm going to paste in the to live chat the issue that I'm seeing right now in case anyone else is interested and then I'll pull it over onto the screen so you can see you can see what I'm looking at right now so I was a little skeptical because this issue was from June of 2017 so I figured like an issue that old has probably already been taken care of but it looks like it maybe wasn't so even after the issue was closed we have the issue still happening oh this is still happening in beta version of next mmhmm in this case if the app is built everything works but in development it doesn't work all right so there is a fix Oh Gander has to go hey again or thanks for joining us I'll see you later John Hanson says I saw some stuff on the web similar issue NPM babble plugin module was over and create an alias module resolver for reacts Apollo in Belvoir see mmhmm I'm just not finding really new issues I'd rather have something newer but I mean I guess potentially if this issue just happened again with this release then there's there's not gonna be a lot oh wow almost to the end of another 25minute session here really glad I did this in a separate branch I think it's a really really long shot that this will works and so much has changed since this version of next but I think it's worth a shot let's see yingying ye so I'm not sure how to pronounce your name so why ing j IE please let me know how to pronounce it I'd love to pronounce it correctly for you but anyway it says there's no super chat here now I haven't done the super chat at all is there an advantage to doing the super chat if so let me know alright let me make this file really quickly just to see if it works and then I'll go back and go through everything the live chat so it's saying do this and where that's it's closed up these node modules modules close this ooh if you you know what this isn't gonna work this person's issue also I had to do with change effectuation of different sized shoes and it also had to do with type scripts hmm oh okay so it seems like super with super chat you can make so you can get donations that's pretty cool I'm not gonna start doing it for free code camp stream unless that's what Quincy wants so right now I'm not gonna use it but I'll definitely keep that in mind that's that's pretty interesting all right her shirt says he's got it so I'm gonna wait for more on that from Harshit and in the meantime I'm gonna go up to latch at where I left off and I'm gonna answer some questions Nietzsche says Oh wowthat's today bleedingedge stuff right here yeah it just came out I actually thank Harshad for hearts just sent me a message was it a message no I think it was an issue I should open an issue on this repo saying that next five came out so I saw that check it out this morning if the holidays maybe this would be cool for a stream let's see on Hill says hi hey how's it going son bassist Jesse the hacker in which company do you work right now I work for a small University called Franciscan University of stupid about five of us there are so many frameworks of JavaScript like react angular of UJS ember meteor etc we have to learn all of them to become a good developer oh no way no way you don't have to learn all of them you could be a good developer no none of them and just use JavaScript or you could just learn one of them and be really good in fact I would think if you knew all of them you probably wouldn't be really good at any of them usually take specialization to become really good so yeah don't worry about that you don't I mean it'd be good to know a little bit about each one just so that you can accurately assess whether which one would be best for a particular project that you you're about to work on but don't you certainly don't have to really learn every one of them and it says hey hey how's it going glad you could make it for the latch at Gander has said the RM RF node modules doesn't fix as much as it used to since NPM selfclean since version 5 all right good to know good to know maybe I won't be so quick to try it next time then again just said the SpaceX launch is actually going on like right now liftoff is at 220 Eastern Time alright cool well I'm gonna try to end the stream before then so y'all can watch the launch if you want to I'm high school Creole said I thought you just had a hangover from watching the Superbowl not actually I didn't even watch the Super Bowl this year I just watched like a kids movie with with my kids and went to sleep I'm actually a Pittsburgh Steelers fan and they weren't in it and just wasn't that into it this year James says Jessie beard is looking awesome this beard is looking awesome bro I appreciate it thank you it is getting a little long and you can't thankfully you can't tell on the camera at least I can't tell from seeing OBS but it's starting to get a little gray I got some gray hairs right here on the chin my wife laughs when she sees that so I don't know we'll see how it looks once the stars turned gray maybe I'll look better who knows I'll look more distinguished right with gray divya says it's completely offtopic but do people use react with django apps i have never heard of anyone usually react with django but i mean that that it certainly people could be doing it i just don't know about it i don't know much at all about django I've never used it so i'm i probably can't give you a good answer has anyone else heard of anything like that allen word says thumbs up for the video on getting started and motivation on day 21 of 100 days of code and life got in the way and had to take a week off now it's hard to get started again thanks for everything you rock I really appreciate you telling me that and I'm glad that you liked the video hopefully it's helping you out maybe I'll have to I'll have to make another one here because I've added in some things into my daily routine that have really helped since I made that video and I think it could be helpful for some people so maybe I have to make a part 2 or something along those lines yeah but I appreciate you telling me that when I get feedback like that then I mean it's good because I know what what kind of content is helpful for people Aleksey says hey hey how's it going world's us why didn't you just leave next yes version 4 we certainly could have left next version 4 version 5 did have some improvements that I liked so it was easier to integrate sass the build speed was faster so I don't know did we have to probably not but it I mean while we're still developing it it's a heck of a lot easier I think now before everything's are all built out to update like this that way if we do have problems there's just less code to look through to try to find the problem I mean if we really can't figure this out we can always just flip back to the master branch and come back and try again at some another time but I still have a lot of data in my grade so I don't really need to work on this repo you know right away so we'll see I it's worth giving it a little bit more time all right it just automatically popped me back down to the bottom of the live chat and I see that Harshit is typing in all caps which means that he's got something for me oh you know I had to leave so it was too late here I gotta go to sleep all right well good night Anna thanks for joining us let's see see this got it we're gonna see this oh I should says do the work around in there so hard were you talking about that workaround that I was just going to make so like this in the issues okay oh I should that's a good point arch it says remember to back up the WordPress install because it could set me back that is very very good point I'll shoot I know I did that because this was supposed to be typescript now this type shift even gonna work for me in here will automatically work with next five or you have to set that up I guess we'll find out really soon we had a flash of content yeah remove that show all right remove the any okay the suppose I could take the typescript off of here now all right so we still have some stuff going on suspected digit because of you syntax error number all right we got some syntax errors stuff going on here but we it worked let's try some other pages now I'm not happy yet because I'm I'm like waiting to see if something else breaks I'm not convinced yet all right now I'm pretty convinced all right all right cool now I can smile and be happy cool all right so this was pretty cool hopefully this will be helpful for anybody who's trying to upgrade now I guess not everybody's gonna have the same configuration that we had so it probably won't happen for a lot of people I don't know but here was the deal right so we upgraded and we ended up having to add next dot config dot J s file ok just down here in our main folder right and we had to put module exports and looks this deletes some aliases so this is what we had to put in there alright now this will be in the repo soon once I push this so you can you know copy and paste this use this file if you need to for what you're doing and hopefully it'll help you cool Oh Nikki's Nikki's computer crashed basically because of the same error and so Nikki missed the fix so this is the fix this right here so I'll I'll push this let's push this now do you think we're safe enough now to merge this into master hmm what are you what would we call a commit that's just updating packages there are dependencies michael says don't merge it yet alright well I'll just keep it on this branch for now all right so we're just gonna say this is build I mean really the the the piece of this that we could most immediately benefit from anyway is that we'll have faster build time so that kind of makes sense oops I should saying it's a chore so we should say put it under chore all right all right thanks up are there any breaking changes there were we fixed them yes it does affect any an open issue what issue is that let's see I don't remember what issue of us have to look it up seventyfive uh you know we have to pass all the tests did we pass yay all right all right cool so we do have a branch in our github repo now that is for next five so if you want to see any of the stuff that we just did today check out that next five branch we're not gonna merge it yet Michael I think as has the right idea here is not to merge it yet double check make sure things work give it a little bit more time to test then we can merge it when we're when we're sure all right cool let me try to get through the rest of the questions in the live chat and no I said I'd try to be done before the rocket launch sorry about that totally understand if you were watching this and watch the launch I'll still go through and answer the questions though all right let's see you know what I don't think I marked where I left off I just have to read some of it Niq alright I see now where Nicky said that the lab saw the blue screen of death out of the blue on this last hub nick says this looks hard I learned PHP well PHP looks hard to me so that's yes it just depends on what you're more used to working with Oh harsh it says the Instagram uses Django with react well that's that's a really big example thank you for bringing that up Lexi says can you run react alongside with express in next Jas yeah that's we have let me show you my server the server JS file here yeah so we've got Express running we have next running obviously react so it's all it's all running together nick says where can I learn about cyber security for free thanks for your apply I don't know for sure I've not taken cyber security curse courses well I think that but I did do some of the course on Udacity so I believe Udacity has some courses or at least one course on cyber security that you can take for free I imagine there are a lot of courses on on udemy that probably aren't free so I would check out the one for Udacity from what I remember of it it was actually taught by some people who are really kind of like big names in the field of cyber security they have literally written you know the authoritative books on cybersecurity so check that out first I'd say that's probably a good place to start also says while you're doing your project are you concerned about security website like CSRF attacks equal Jacksons or that is not a possibility a frontend developer or at least Fernandez should know these this stuff yeah so we definitely try to keep that stuff in mind for just purely frontend stuff it's there are different things to be concerned about but you know potentially by using so this is where I see the big advantage of using established like premade things as as opposed to creating everything on our own you build things from scratch they just haven't been tested but if we're using things that that have been tested like for instance wordpress order managing content through wordpress very well none frequently updated mostly updates a lot of the updates have security updates in them as well so we don't have to purse like act like know all the different threats out there as long as we have a reliable you know maintainer so the people who maintain wordpress are pretty on top of things one of the biggest threats for WordPress is plugins that are out of date so in terms of plugins I'm very careful about what I install and what I use and if it's a plugin that doesn't seem like it will be updated or it's no longer maintained I make sure I take a look at the code you know as best as I can with my limited knowledge of PHP and and try to really understand what's happening so yeah so I guess I say I'm worried about it that's one of the reasons why I think upgrading plugins and things is important especially if you become aware that there's a security issue I do have some people in the computer science department and that are interested in doing some penetration testing so hopefully we can get that set up and working and you know so people that are more knowledgeable about security than I am can really kind of check things out and make recommendations okay I'm gonna have to go pretty quick and wrap this up so I just got a message that the head of the department needs to meet with me because and it may have to do with this website so definitely don't want to keep her waiting I know says this project is getting good that is nice see they keep pushing okay michael says they keep pushing to launch back now it's a 90 minutes okay well at least we didn't miss it okay I got to the end of the live chat sorry I'm have to just cut it off right there so maybe join us for another chat if you have some more questions thank you so much for all the help and working through these issues thankfully we you know we got it all working but I really appreciate all the help and I should be back tomorrow until then have a great day
