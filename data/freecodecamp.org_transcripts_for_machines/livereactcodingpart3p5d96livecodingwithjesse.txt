hey everybody welcome to live Kony with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're going to do some react stuff I'm very very excited because we have a launch date for this website that we've been working on this is now stream number 96 this project I'm just so so ready to launch this thing I want people to see it we've put so much work into this I want to know either whether they like it or hate it I want to know I wanted people to actually use it and get feedback and so I've been putting in a lot of work I've been working a lot from home and I've been going to a lot of meetings and unfortunately doing paperwork so it's been a while since I streamed also this was a short week here in the United States Monday was a national holiday so a lot of people had the day off including me so that's why I haven't been streaming a lot I'm gonna try to do better next week hopefully next week it's gonna be hectic though so we're gonna plan on launching next Wednesday that is September 12th I believe so September 12th is gonna be the launch date probably I'm thinking sometime in the afternoon not like too late cuz I want to get out of here you know on time but maybe maybe like very early afternoon something like that I think would be a good launch so let me show you what what my schedules like to get this finished before we jump into some code you switch to my screen here and I'm gonna zoom in hopefully you'll be able to see this okay so this is my Trello board where y'all can see everything I'm working on it's I believe it's a public Trello board so I'm gonna copy and paste this link into the live chat so you can check that out let me know I don't see I'm gonna see any activity in the live chat so all right cool I see something now I was worried that it wasn't working for me so if you want to check out my Trello board and how I have this set up feel free but basically what needs to happen before we launch is everything in this in progress and ready for dev columns this stuff here this to do I've left things in here that don't need to be done yet it can be put off till after work after we've launched so basically I have what do we have here so my estimates are in the dark blue in terms of how many Pomodoro sessions it'll take me to complete these so that's 25 minute sessions so I'm I'm hoping that I can get at least ten sessions in per day per workday and at that rate then I should definitely be able to get this stuff ready for launch now some things that aren't on here are like I guess late deployment type of things so getting like domain names pointed to the right place you know things like that so it is gonna take longer than this to get it ready but and I'm also hoping that some of these items will take less time than I've estimated so today specifically we're gonna create a landing page for admission staff so the first page is just going to be a list of all the staff members and admissions and then the next component that we're gonna make is going to be the component just for a particular staff member okay so if you click on an item in the list it will take you to the page for that staff member this is going to follow the same pattern that we used for the for the faculty components so the first thing we're going to do is look at that the faculty list component and then the faculty page component and first thing we'll do is see in this potential you could save us a lot of time could we just modify those and use them as well if the answer is yes that's what we'll do otherwise what we'll do is copy and paste make new components and just edit them to fit our use case here okay I see some people saying hello and hey did dijanna let me know if I'm pronouncing that right dijanna says hi from Bosnia hey how's it going I got some other questions I'm gonna do a Pomodoro session first of coding and then I'm gonna take a break and I'm gonna answer all the questions so if you ask something just hang on for a little bit we're gonna do 25 minutes of code to start then we'll do questions and then we'll switch switch back and forth okay if you you're saying hello Alex Richard hey how's it going okay all right great now we have a decent number of viewers now 77 all right hey everybody I'm assuming there's some new people here how's it going if you are new this is my everyday work I work at a small University and we are making a new main website let me give you a link so you can check out the site as we work on it I'm gonna paste this in now and you can check out the site navigate to whatever page you want inspect it in your own browser and I'll double check to see if this works all right cool so people are getting on there hey Quincy's here how's it going Quincey did that link come through I'm gonna paste that one more time because it's all it said I had an error so okay people are clicking on it now awesome I'm gonna move over to the code and let's check out those components that we that I mentioned just a minute ago so this faculty list component and then also the faculty oops faculty is now we're using next Jas so any of these components we have in our pages folder is actually gonna be like a route right so work on the I guess we'll work on the faculty list first okay so in our faculty list let's take our styles and move them down so if you've been watching you know I've slowly been moving all of our style objects down to the bottom because I think it makes it easier to figure out what a components knowing when you open it up immediately you don't have as much scrolling going on so we'll get that out of the way and we see here that we're using the next Jas get initial props function and this this lets us get some data for that serverside rendering is so we're passing in an ID and a type so this is getting passed in from our server das file in our routing function that we have there and the ID in this case is the faculty members name and then the type should be is it faculty or the type might actually be what department they're in right so they're they're gonna have a category each faculty member is categorized based on the department they teach in so I think that's what that is here okay we're bringing in some style sheets and yeah we just map over each faculty member and we have this faculty list item okay you know what I think we're gonna do I think it may in this case it may actually be faster to just copy and paste and make a staff list component at some point down the road I think it would be nice to maybe combine these and just have one component but I doing this live I know like I'm gonna get a little bit confused about how to make this happen quickly enough so I'd rather just do separate components that way I won't break the components that are here that already work and if we have to launch without this I can just put a little you know more info coming soon on that page and we can still launch all right so let's copy all this and let's make a new page it's gonna call this staff list dot J s let's paste that in there and first thing I always do when I copy and paste component is make sure I change the name so we're gonna change it in several places so we just changed the name of the component but also we change the name of the query staff list query we haven't made this query yet so we're gonna have to make a graph QL query as well so that's kind of fun we'll get to see some of that and then also this staff list item component we're gonna pull this as well and I need to bring this in so let's get rid of this and say staff so we're gonna need to modify this component the reason I'm making separate components is because the faculty members have a lot more information that we needed to display so I don't want to mess with that I wouldn't like conditionally say like if this information is there then display it otherwise don't display I may have that set up already I don't remember if I did so it's just going to be easier if I mmhmm it's gonna be easier if I I don't worry about that right now and I'll probably immediately make an issue in github saying like hey can we refactor these and combine them all and then it'll be there for whenever I get time or if one of you wants to take a shot at it then then we can work on refactoring let's see okay so this component basically what we want to do is make sure so we definitely need the key we need the profile name profile link it's not gonna say faculty though it's gonna say this is going to be a little tricky so the link is actually going to be admissions staff and we'll have to make sure that in our router that this all works out so we'll take a look at our router a little bit later so we have that the job title let me show you what it looks like right now so let's go to Franciscan dot edu this is the current site so not the new one that we're working on Franciscan dot edu slash admissions staff I just want to see what info we're already displaying to make sure we at least display what users are are used to seeing now so it looks like we have name title a little bit of content phone number and a link and an image so we need those all those in there so image title link huh huh looks like I thought there would be more info for the faculty but I think we're gonna have more info here all right so let's go phone and we'll call this staff node fun I'm just assuming that we've named that phone we'll have to double check and see what its gonna come through in our it come through like in our API and let me change the names of these because we don't want to say faculty we own all this to say staff this is multiple cursors feature so on a Mac on Visual Studio code I'm pressing command D to select them all and that lets me change them all all at a time like that so a lot of you probably know that but I frequently get questions when I do that so I thought I'd just just throw it out there now okay all right now would be a good time to make our query so that we can actually get some data in here and see what it looks like we'll also need to go to our server Jas file and make our route so that we can navigate to this page so let's do that first so I'm gonna check and see we should already have admissions in here oops if you all want to check out this code on your own the link for this repository is in the description it's all open source it's all one get up feel free to do what you want with it but I need to find where we're already setting routes for admissions here we are so for admissions when we get so this first set with page is is telling our application what component to use to render this route so what we want to say here is when you go to would be staff so when the ID coming through is staff we want you to use the staff list page and the type and the quit site it doesn't matter that doesn't matter for now in terms of what the type is gonna be but it will be it will matter in a minute if we get so far as to do the single staff member pages that will matter in our routes that might end up being a tricky one but we'll we'll figure it out when we get there okay so this should at least try to render that page which will probably give us an error now so we need to go into our queries and we're gonna take that faculty list query and copy it so let's make a staff so actually I'm not I'm not really happy about how we have the queries all separated out I think it might have been a better idea to put the queries in the component because we're not really reusing queries that much initially the idea was hey we're gonna reuse a lot of these queries but they end up not so a good refactor might be to add these in the components themselves but for now it works so we're gonna leave it alone so let's change the names here to staff instead of faculty okay and we need actually make sure that these fields are available to us so let's use a tool called graphical if I can find it alright so graphical is let me make everything bigger graphical is a really awesome tool so graph QL is I'm not sure what the right word I want almost static selfdocumenting right so you don't have to build like your own API Explorer when you use graph QL you can just put your endpoint URL into graphical and which is a Chrome extension right and then it it does this for you so let me just show you what's what's going on here we can go into here into our queries and then see all possible queries so let's search for staff and see staff member right so we can go a staff member and let's check out what what fields we can get from staff members so in particular we want to compare what we're getting here right to staff members so actually we know what we're going into the wrong way let's go back out I forgot we we're going to staff departments first okay so staff departments let's see if I can just pull this all in here did I get them wrong I think I got yeah I think I did that right all right let's see go ahead and and paste all of this in here all right so staff departments were named the slug equals I don't want it to be name I want it to be admissions see if that works No I'm not really that surprised that it didn't work unexpected name staff departments is unexpected all right wouldn't ready run we see yes staff departments actually let me check this out let's see what we had before that worked oh okay all right let's try that and I assume we'll need another curly braket let's see what happens now oh no unexpected single quote probably need double quotes alright oops and cannot query field staff on staff Department all right so what's the field this should automatically fill and staff members ok cool see if that works hey check it out alright cool so base like this really it lets us play with our queries in real time get results we don't have to be messing on in our files right and we can play with it here and then copy and paste it over and it only work so Michael in the live chat is saying there's only one department true there's only one department right now but they'll probably be more at some point so we're gonna plan on on more departments ok so let's see alright there's one thing that I still need title slow content featured image job title display name we don't have display name right when you take that out cuz that's not actually we can figure it out let's uh let's go into WordPress where we have all this data house and let's find stuff I've so many custom post types now I don't even bother looking through them I just just feel fine alright let's check out alright Corinne has all the data I believe so okay so okay we do have display name job title phone all right so that value probably is fun so I think we're good ok oops let me check my time real quick okay in about a little less than seven minutes I'm gonna come back to the chat and answer some questions so hang in there if you've if you asked a question so I I just need to put whoops just put phone in here phone field okay oops and I guess I need something else value there you go all right see that gives us what we need all right let me take content out of here for a second just cuz it's taking up all of space okay yeah so we have foamfilled value wonderful we have our slug I don't hmm actually I think our slugs gonna be okay but we should have let me see what our urls are so I want to make sure these right current source oh okay yeah that's right so I guess it is first name first it's the opposite of what we have for our faculty so staff is first name first um we're trying to match up the URLs to what's already there as much as possible all right so this works I believe we have everything that we need so let's copy this I'm just gonna go from where it says edges though so one two so we have two curly brackets in grab edges the reason so let me explain this a little bit more so we're getting first we're getting the department called admissions and within there we are getting all the staff members that are associated with that department and we're getting the last 100 right so I put 100 in there there's no way we're ever gonna have a hundred people in admissions unless we grow significantly as a school but that was a holdover from faculty where some of the departments are a little bit bigger no where's no one is near 100 no department but just wanted to be sure we don't leave anybody out and then we're gonna order them by alphabetically right by the the slug so that's what we're doing there and then within there we're just grabbing all these values from each staff member all right so we're getting just the data that we need no more no less so that's kind of the beauty of graph queue or actually if you look we're getting two different custom post types which would normally if we're using a REST API we'd have to hit two different endpoints for that but we only hit one endpoint and we're able to get the data from from both places so really cool you know the alternate way with the REST API we could hit one endpoint just the staff members but then we have to filter all of the staff members right by whatever category right by this admissions for the staff department category so grad Kiel just makes it a lot easier all right let's paste this in uh so from edges down here I should have paid attention to where this was okay so there we go I think this is where we need to be we're gonna paste that in and save it okay so assuming that I didn't miss any any names for the queries we should be getting some data now so we should be able to hit this endpoint so admissions staff should give us what we need so let's go here and you all might be able to hit the endpoint already admissions staff let's see what we get oh okay cannot resolve staff list item whoops we didn't make our component okay that makes sense let's see just for the sake of testing this quickly before my timer goes off let's change this back whoops let's change this component back oops staff list we'll change it back to faculty list because I think this would work let's see if it does okay no to undefined forest a flesh okay so what's undefined we should be getting slug stop node just my name oops are we getting let's see up here I think it should be staff member staff members yeah let's try staff members nope let's go back here and see yeah there's slug staff members right departments edges node staff members staff data sequence staff okay we're gonna have to troubleshoot when we get back let me set my Pomodoro timer here and let's fill out what we need so we've consumed one Pomodoro session right now so we're gonna put a 1 there I'm gonna scroll way up to the top get to as many questions as I can rip on was talk something about an address account address you need to send to me I'm not really sure what you were talking about with the address so let me know Oshin says do you do any data analytics equal Python etc no I currently don't super interesting but haven't really had an opportunity to do anything with that yet let's see what text editor do you use Visual Studio code so Rev says tomorrow is my coding competition any advice I guess try to calm down as much as you can you know there's not you know all the work you put into this point is what's really gonna matter you know there's not really a whole lot you can do at this point so you you know might as well just chill right and try to do the best you can so you think yeah try to get some sleep to make sure you get good sleep Chaitanya uh correct me if that's the wrong pronunciation Chaitanya says what's the best resource to learn material you I their documentation is actually pretty good I don't know of any tutorials I definitely use it a lot in my videos my live streams so you may be able to learn some from the streams but it's not exactly a tutorial so I would say number one resource is their own documentation number two my videos I guess unless you can find other videos which are probably gonna be better for you Anthony says hi hey Anthony Jacobson says oh okay hi saying hi to Quincy from Haiti I did me it's cool I'm pretty pumped that Quincy is here as well let's see MD says awesome site Thank You Mohammed says what's the easiest way to learn coding I definitely recommend free code can't go to free code camp org and start some of those lessons I mean there if that's not your thing if you like videos you know check out the free code can you know videos if you like to read more you can check out the medium publication so that basically I'm not saying free code camps the only way to learn how to code but no matter what your learning style is we have you covered right so if you know there are definitely other good places Udacity code Academy there's other good YouTube channels as well so you know there's a there's a lot of options out there but the main thing is no matter what you choose and like to learn the material do a little bit every day much better do a little every day than to do a bunch of one day and then take a week off or something right frank says hi from khoutv ivory West is West Africa hey how's it going thanks for watching Ambrose says nice Ambrose I love the name I named my my youngest son Ambrose Joe P says well I'm not sure if it supposed to be Joe P or Joep but says what are some fun projects to work on currently I don't know what to make you know there are some lists online and I believe on github about like app ideas so I would check out those lists and just Google for like fun app ideas or something and you know people have whole lists of you know stuff different ideas that they've had so that's that's your best bet Mohammed says I'm doing some software engineering what language should I focus on more it definitely depends on what you're gonna work with but I agree with Quincy's comment starting with JavaScript JavaScript is very versatile so it's gonna give you a nice intro to programming and it's gonna allow you to work on a lot of different things so you can be eclipse you can make mobile apps you can even delve into machine learning VRA are data science like there's a lot of different areas javascript may not be like the main language for this particular area but it will let you have a little taste and see what you like and then if you you know feel the need to switch to another language to specialize you're already gonna have the basic programming concepts down so yeah so that's is anyway it's definitely good advice from from Quincy okay I'm gonna write down where I'm leaving off at and we're gonna go back and do at least one more Pomodoro session so okay alright so if I didn't get to your question this time I'll get to it next time let's start that Pomodoro session again and troubleshoots okay so here's what we'll do let's comment some stuff out and see if we can get it to render and then that'll give us an idea of where the the problem might be all right yeah so definitely not still not rendering okay we have anything in here so I might you know what let's just read this this whole section we're gonna get rid of and we're just gonna put in we should have put that in and let's see if we can get it to render now I still nothing all right so it seems like our routers working right so it's sorry this is so small I'm sorry let me zoom in so it seems like our routers working right we put an admission slash staff in for the URL and then it's trying to render pages staff list je s right that's what we wanted right the staff list jss what we're working on so it's there it's at that point the problem seems to be it's not finding the data that it needs so let's think about this what's it being sent for ID and type o all right let's check this out so for our faculty list I'm sorry our staff list let's get rid of that and let's get a staff list so for this for this name we're taking this this query string but we really just need it to be admissions for this one right so long term we may have other departments so right now we just have admission so maybe we could do this because I think we're getting the wrong value in I think that maybe the the problem so let's just pass it so into our query here we pass a name oops it's sorry let me think about this for a second are we even passing in props ID interesting so the type doesn't even really know weight this props tight alright that's what's getting passed into the staff list query so we not really even using the type hmm all right I may be missing it but it seems like we're passing in type and we don't need the type okay that's fine that's something that we can just refactor later it's not a huge deal but what we're gonna do here is we're we're gonna pass we're normally passing on this ID in instead we're gonna pass in admissions and now I think we're safe to bring these back at least some of them back oops are we in different stuff faculty list item is not defined oops yay okay cool all right that worked let's uncomment the rest now it's not gonna display the phone number now because we haven't told it to display the phone number we're just passing it in as a prop oops cannot read property phone of undefined whoops yeah so it's not just phone it's phone what did we call that let's go back to our query and phone field and then value so phone field value okay Oh fun field of undefined all right let's check this again funfilled oops not staff listen staff there we are all right hey check that out okay so we have these cards now we're probably going to need changes change this up right so we currently now I mean maybe maybe there's room for you know some difference but currently there's this little message from from each one of our admissions staff members so we may have to switch it up to something more like this list or potentially if we wanted to keep that card look like we have now we could just you know make the cards full with that's another option so I'd say let me make sure I want to see if these what these links are doing if they're taking us to the right page no no yet I you know what I am I had to sign some of my student workers to change up these links cuz they're the wrong links were in them which one's gonna work I think yeah this one should work it's gonna give an error but I just want to make sure yet that that's the right URL okay all right cool so this page works like in terms of data and everything that works so that's usually the tricky part now we just need to render that that content right that we have that we have here and we need to render this this text me this little phone number here so that's where you now doctor wants me to update right now how about later okay my other screen I'm in these update notifications okay Michael s what's the route again it's it's Admissions / staff steak so we're gonna want to work with a different version of this faculty list item and we have I thought we already had a like a fullwidth component that we could use but I guess we don't see what this one is no this isn't it you know what we must have I or somebody else I don't remember who who did this particular one must have changed this faculty list item component at some point because it used to be full with all right let's uh while I'm in here I'm gonna switch up how our styles are done I'm gonna flip them here at the bottom okay and let's save that and then let's copy this and I hate to do this but this what we're gonna do we're just gonna copy this component make another component it's gonna be staff list item J s my stomach is like growling so I'm sorry if you if you have to hear that okay so we have a staff list item component and now let's get rid of this let's go to our staff list and change this up the staff list item and we'll change this back to staff list item okay now it should render this instead which right now it'll be the same thing should still render down the types of bells staff yeah yeah she's verify it works all right great so that works no we can start switching things up so first thing we can do just to see how these cards will look for with is change it up we're using this grid we can just get rid of all these grid sizes and keep this extra small 12 this is a builtin component into material UI which is our component library so on extra small screens this grid item is going to take up 12 out of 12 columns so the full width all right that's what we're saying here and since we haven't indicated any other size up from there it's just gonna use this value for every screen size so that's the first thing we're gonna do let's save that see how it looks see if we get some more space okay it looks like we may have a max width on these on these cards hmm okay not not a huge deal let's let's do some more and then see how we need to change up that that max width okay we need to change this is fine with the name and the title that's perfect that's what we want this is also perfect we just need to add some stuff in here so within our it's okay so job titles so we're gonna continue here all of these are like conditionals so if we get a profile link prop past n then we render this okay so that saves us from getting errors if we have incomplete data right so let's say somebody adds a new staff member but they don't put in a link for them well we're not it's not gonna be an error if we do it like this it's just not gonna show the link because we don't have one so that's why we're doing everything conditionally so let's say this part is I don't know content I'm gonna call it content let's add this here so we're listing out all our props here and then here we're gonna say phone as well so we're gonna say content so if there is content then after the end then we're gonna we're gonna render the content inside of this so we're gonna use typography and the component we're gonna give it as just a P that might be the default so it might not be necessary and within this I don't know why it's not automatically doing that anyway let's render our content okay so within that okay and actually that's we could have probably done that all in one line because it's such a small amount but this will work so what they should do is give us the content wrapped in a P tag so let's see see if we keep going the wrong way it doesn't look like we got it all right let's inspect this to see what happened yeah it's nothing all right let's go back here and see why content maybe we didn't pass it in as content yeah we didn't pass in content at all which I'm assuming it's gonna be staff node content so let's see how that goes see but since we had that conditional we didn't get an error right we were conditionally rendering so it said hey you didn't pass in the prop content so we're not gonna do anything which is what we wanted to happen there's still nothing maybe that was the wrong check out our console didn't get anything in there okay now let's double check and our query just to see woops you know what remember we took out content corral content never put it back in we're also gonna need to do something special with content here you'll see in a second so the contents coming in with all the HTML tags included right so here's how we fixed that this is gonna look like it's not the right thing to do but it's fine as long as you control the data coming in you never want to do this if you're allowing you know just anyone to put in the data and display it right but we're gonna say enter dangerously set enter HTML and then that's where we're gonna put in I believe it's like HTML content I think that's how you do it and in that case we're just going to use oh no no no what's going on here it's secured rid of that there we go whoops said how we doing know am i doing wrong maybe I don't need that all right let's just try it with content and see what happens no yeah I am oh you know what I think I need to double underscores let's try that Oh all right I may have to look this up James you said under HTML equals all right let's look it up am i doing wrong if anybody sees what I'm doing wrong please let me know in the live chat otherwise let's try to figure out what's happening okay so it's possible we can't do this in a typography component so before I let's just try this in a normal P tag first see what's going on still be a minute here whoops all right here it says you have the slash before closing of the typography yeah I was trying to close it there Oh double we're passing an object thank you mate mayor let me know if I'm pronouncing that wrong okay that makes a lot more sense we need double so it all right yeah for this this example wasn't like what we were doing so that's why I didn't show this but we need that double so let's just see how it looks with the P we can switch it back to typography in a second so we're passing in an object whoa interesting we got it for a second and then it went away that's weird we had that happen before I can't remember why it happened though I can't remember how we fix it if anybody remembers how we fixed that before let me know alright but that came up for a second let's use typography though let's see if we can get it to work with typography all right wonderful works with typography and it doesn't go away so what we can see right this is is taking up a lot more and why does this say about me is that really what we have in here Wow I definitely don't want that and I don't want their phone number right there that's weird and their phone number is actually different why is the phone number different i'ma have to remember that and send a message to my student workers to have them go in here and clean that up and make sure that everything is actually working that's so weird it's a totally different phone number all right okay my timer is up for that Pomodoro session let's take another break and let me go back to where I left off in the chat so three okay Lucy says could somebody tell me which video is a video where this project starts okay so this project has its own playlist so it's it's project five so you can go to the project five playlist on this YouTube channel and it should be in an order I don't remember if I have it in chronological order or reverse chronological order but anyway that playlist has everything so it should say day one Aaron says hello hey how's it going Abba car says I want to rewatch this yeah for sure it'll be available as a video on YouTube basically like a few minutes after it's over Nina says what's WordPress got to do with the react app that's where we're pulling the data from so you don't WordPress has nothing to do with react really but that happens to be one of our sources of data for this project they said our only source right now all right well not really cuz we're grabbing some stuff from cloud datastore Google cloud cloud bucket so yeah but it doesn't WordPress doesn't really matter it could be anywhere that we're getting the data from but it happens to be WordPress for this project Cory asked what Pomodoro timer I'm using this is pompom dot now dot Sh let me copy and paste this in here so one of our live stream viewers Harshit who contributed significantly to a lot of these projects Harshit created this timer so it's pretty sweet and I use it all the time for my projects if any of you created a Pomodoro timer and want me to check it out and show it on the stream please send me the link don't try to send it in the chat because it always blocks the links you can DM it to me on Twitter or I'm on like all the social media so just check the link in the description for my youtube channel and then from there I have links out to all my social media and and you can just message me on any one of them with the link and all I'll try to use it on my one one of my upcoming streams but see Erin says I'm learning react right now question is how do you get rid of this kind of imports where you have the dog dog flash something dot s CSS Bjorn says Aaron look at literal imports okay yeah check that out I'm I'm not like a hundred percent sure about the question for that so I'm just gonna go with the Oren's answer here and if you check it out and that's not wishing you need maybe kind of a skating ask question again down lower we can get to it a little bit later let's see silento says hey hey how's it going let me know if I didn't pronounce your name right lol Marsha says hello hey Cal yoke says hello bro how are you not bad I'm pretty good busy day busy day today but I'm feeling good and excited about getting this project done how are you doing Catherina says hey hey how's it going Austin says hello why was the decision made to switch from WordPress to react so we didn't switch from WordPress to react were switched from Extron which is an old content management system based on the.net framework so react is being used to build this we just happen to be storing a lot of the data in WordPress as a content management system because it's easy for people who don't know any code to enter data into WordPress also comes built in with a nice REST API and with the WP graph QL plugin we can also grab data with graph QL okay Oh spoon would said the company isn't legible in Mayan I'm sorry I'll try to adjust the the font size now okay let me check my time all right let's do one more problem adoro session you usually don't do three I mostly do too but I really want to finish this you know get it looking a little bit nicer okay all right so I'm gonna go back now we'll do one more Pomodoro session oops and I forgot to change this too it looks like my estimate is gonna be spoton I think we'll get this finished in one more Pomodoro session okay so here's what we're looking at right now oh I do have to remember to get this data make sure the data is correct for this one though I'm gonna I think manually take this about me out just so I can see what it looks like without it I really don't don't need that in there refresh that should be gone there we are whoa shoot and did it again all right I'm gonna have to go back and look at some of the old streams and remember why why this was happening okay content coming in there we need our phone number so let's pop in that phone number here and I want to you know let's grab this for now and just use this to put in our phone number okay whoa wait a second count east you know we had this decode HTML function in here the whole time and I forgot about it okay this projects been going on so long I don't even remember what's in it now to be honest I didn't write this this function somebody else did this and I can't remember who did it so if you're the one that did that let me know and I will give you a proper shoutout for this but thank you for writing this all right so let's let's do this properly let's get rid of dangerously set enter HTML after all that and I don't even need it okay and we're just gonna put in the code HTML we're gonna add content in there and that's gonna take care of our issues with the HTML and add typography in there wonderful and then in here we're gonna put phone which I believe that is what we brought that in as we'll figure it out if it doesn't work so we got a phone coming in there and probably could yeah let's leave it like that we'll see if we actually need a label like right now the current site has a label it says like text me or something like that I don't know that we need that oh no it's not working hmm our decode HTML was not working why not because I guess it was it was not meant to do that let me go back let's go back to the way it was even though it didn't work we'll figure that out later all right let me switch this up and I'll put in phone it's you good whoops no no no okay we definitely need to make this bigger let's take a look at what we're doing here with our alright so we have a max height we have a height Animax with okay we don't need to worry about the height the height really comes into play when you have multiple columns because you want them to be the same height if they're all gonna be in a row it won't look as weird right if they're the same height and we have this max width of 600 pixels let's bump that up to 1200 and see what it looks like woah wow that's a lot of content let's I didn't realize there's that much content in some of these okay let's check this out let's check out Barnardo's entry here and see let's see what we can do you know what we need we're definitely going to need to have we need to have an excerpt for each one of these and then the full amount of content okay yeah so we just we need some work here and again the phone numbers wrong I don't know what happened there okay all right so let's look at one where the the data is actually more realistic here so this one is is more realistic so let's get rid of yeah let's go and I'm just going to manually edit this one for Corinne worse yet I just I just need one example of what the data is supposed to be and if that looks okay then we're good and then I can just assign someone to correct all the rest of the data put that in there like that and this format okay now let's get rid of all this okay now we'll update that and hopefully get a better idea of what this is gonna look like oops see all right that's killing me why am I I cannot remember it's the phone number shown on yeah I know show no maybe it it has something to do with uh setting the dangerously set under HTML all right well regardless of what's going on here the images are kind of see like this image is definitely not a big enough image for the student to work so we need we may need a different solution cards might not be the the solution here you know if we could do more like well more like we have here where they're just separated out with just a little divider maybe that might be better okay all right mayor says it's because of nesting P tags awesome awesome I yeah that's that's gotta be it okay so let's check this out why is okay let's see if we can put in yep that was it so this is a pee tag and then WordPress is putting in adding in a pee tag I believe that's what's happening so it's just that was the problem before okay so now we have a better idea but obviously the image is messed up here I wonder if our image has a max just this image type of max height what are we putting on the air yep the image has a max height whoa yeah this is no good well now actually it's not gonna be this this long so this is more reasonable this one this one got a more reasonable size but we get down here like the image size is just not good enough to handle that and that's not even that long all right like contentwise this is going to be okay once we get the content switched around but the images are going to be an issue yeah now let's see what we're doing here with images for common time where's that maxwidth coming in there max height I'm sorry oh okay sir CSS hmm let's see if we can remove this CSS file completely and if it if it's okay so we are bringing in in our staff list page we're pulling in this faculty list CSS let's comment this out and see what happens you know refreshes to be sure I did nothing all right I think this is fine everything looks oh no way you know what it went back to this I thought we just took this out Oh faculty lysias this is the season's probably wanted to take out all right let's bring this back in even though I didn't really see any difference okay all right so that did make a difference suspect just to verify yeah we're not pulling that in anymore okay I'd say at this point that's about all we can do until we get the data switched around because when we're gonna be pulling from a different area instead of pulling in from the content we're gonna pull in from the excerpt at least for this so we'll leave it as is the only other thing that I guess I'd like to do maybe is make this a clickable phone number see how much time we have yeah ten minutes all right we can make this a clickable phone number and then yeah I kind of want to think about these pictures and see just kind of think more about how I really want to display these these are the these are the actual sizes of some of these images so yeah you see some of them are just not well yeah they're not nearly big enough to be able to fit the card sizes that we're gonna have so we need to rethink yeah we definitely need to rethink this or get images that work even this placeholder images is it big enough we get probably using SVG for this instead that might not be a bad idea okay yes let's go to where our phone number is being pulled in wait a second how we gonna do this we just need the the raw number it's gonna be a little bit harder than I thought so now let's see I've never tried to do this before you'll see what I'm talking about in a second let's let's let's just try it for staff list item we're gonna take where we're putting in our phone number here and we're gonna do an object so what is called a template literal sorry template literal it's es6 or yes 2015 syntax so actually let's let's do this so we're gonna do ya within our JavaScript we're gonna make a string and inside that string we're gonna say yes it's gonna be within a span and we're gonna put in an a tag and then our href is gonna say tell write and then we're gonna drop back into JavaScript land we're gonna put in phone which I don't think we need to Dakota HTML on phone cuz it comes through as a number anyway so we could probably get rid of it here as well and I think we'll be fine all right so we're pulling in our phone there our phone number so we need to close out those quotes we can close out this a tag we're gonna put in another variable right so we got to put it in the dollar sign curly brackets and then we're gonna close out our a tag and then we'll close out our string put in on another curly bracket to close out JavaScript let's make sure did this work why are you not working I think it works it's just the syntax there we are the syntax highlighting needed to catch up okay so what they should do is make this link clickable with a phone number here let's see if it works oh no all right it took all the because I have it in typography that's why I did it okay we're not gonna be able to do this within typography let's see if we can switch this up let's you know what let's just put this into a span I like to use typography where I can it comes with material UI and basically it applies a standard for all your fonts right but when I run into stuff like that it's just a lot easier to drop back down into you know your regular HTML tags so we'll see how it looks hmm you know what I don't need this anymore what am i doing okay that was my problem that will at least that time okay so now what we can do here is get rid of this get rid of that and oops we are gonna still need that ready unless it's just my syntax highlighting messing me up alright let's see I might not have needed to do that I think my syntax highlighting maybe he just was a little bit behind and that's why it looked weird okay but check it out okay we have this clickable number let's see if it works yeah it's asking me to open FaceTime I don't want to but here's what I was worried about though you can't really see it but when I hover over it as the the tail number it gives me the number formatted exactly like this I wasn't sure if that would be valid if it would work so that was my only thing I guess we'll have to test that out for sure to make sure it still works cool but now mm why did it not work oh you know what some of these people probably don't have phone numbers put in so this is just what was in the content section so that'll be that'll be better whenever we get the content put in properly okay cool so yeah so that's pretty much it's pretty much done like I said the only thing we're gonna do is switch it up so instead of cards these will be just rows with a little horizontal line in between them and what that'll allow us to do is use different size images it won't look as weird so it won't be as obvious that the images are different size we won't have weird stuff like this happening we'll just let the images be with their normal sizes it'll look for some of the images it will look strange because they'll be way small we'll just set a maximum limit on what the images can do so we won't have gigantic ones on the page and then we can always go in later and get better images you know you may have to have our photographers so my department we have photography people so we may have to have them go actually take a photo and then we can get whatever size we want but that's not realistic before launch right so we'll make it look as good as we can for now and later on and you know one day if we happen to have all the images we need at the exact size we need we could switch up to something like this if we thought it was nicer but I think this looks fine right now well what I just described will look fine right yeah so but I'm gonna end of shame because we've been doing this for quite a while and I'm getting pretty hungry so you just want to give you a heads up on what's gonna happen with this if if anybody really wants to jump in and start doing some of this feel free to open a pull request I need to catch up and make sure I sign some of those tasks I talked about and if there's anything I need to put into an issue and get up I'll do that as well and I need to push out some of this code to the github repository shell can see it and work on it so that'll be the number one thing I do anyway and the stream is I'll push this stuff to get up right now actually let me push it to get up right now because I'm gonna answer some questions that might take a look I want to make sure if whoever wants to see this code can see it immediately I'm gonna do a git status just to see what's changed okay I realize that I've changed some other stuff that's somewhat unrelated I'm not gonna do a separate commit for that mainly just because of time I just want to get through this commit and get to the questions so we're gonna do a get add and I'm just gonna put a dot to add everything yarn cm okay so we have a little kind of automated thing set up to help us do a nicer commit message than normal if you don't have this set up it's called committed and if you don't have this set up then you just want to do a regular get commit preferably with the EM flag so you can put the message right in line we're gonna say we had new feature because we did and let's say we add staff list page and staff list item component yeah we did a bit more than that we did queries and stuff but if anybody really wants to dig into that commit they'll see what changed no breaking changes and I don't think that affects any open issues so we're gonna leave it alone if it did effect an issue we can put it in right there and it would automatically get tagged or closed that issue so tests are gonna run will see if they pass we may have to update our unit test I'm hoping we don't all right cool it looks like we won't I don't know those were in dentists where it was it yeah all right cool we passed everything I'm gonna do a get push ok now everything should be up to date on the gate repo if it's not up to date for you refresh it it should be now I'm gonna go where we left off at in the chat control 30 and I need to take a drink because I've been talking a lot I'm going to drink some G fuel if anybody works for G fuel and you're watching I'm open for a sponsorship okay okay Julio as if I will upload a stream of UJS I don't have any plans to do that anytime soon because my streams are almost always what I'm doing for work and right now we're doing pretty much everything with react I do think it'd be cool to work with you so if I'm gonna work with you it'll probably be a side project in that case I'm a stream it may be just on my on my youtube channel so if you're interested in saying that to tell you truth for those of you who subscribe to my channel my my personal channel you know I've been slacking on that lately so I apologize I have a whole list of topics for videos that you all have requested from me I really really want to get to that I mean things are just always busy right not only with work and with my clients on the side but also you know I have four kids so I'm gonna really try to put out some content because I know a lot of you are subscribed to that and I don't want to leave you hanging and I know even some of you have gone onto my patreon and are helping to support me in doing that so I haven't forgot about it I do want to put out content so I'm gonna try to make it a priority after I get this site launched which will hopefully happen next week that's just gonna take a lot off me mentally and time was so I'm hoping I'll I'll be able to do that so if anybody has any ideas for stuff they really want to see for me to either do a stream or prerecorded video on my youtube channel please let me know you can put it in a lab chat here you can DM me or whatever you want I'll add it to my list of stuff and and hopefully get something made soon Lewis says hello hey how's it going Matthew asked where did you study so if you wondering where I studied coding I did that on my own so mainly free code camp code Academy Udacity I think I did like one udemy course or you to me I'm sure you pronounced that a ton of YouTube tutorial videos dev tips channel was really active back in the day and I watched them same way with learn code Academy Channel they're still around there's not as active let's see I mean books blog art blog post documentation you know all that in terms of like formal studies my degree my undergrad degree is in business I specialized in particular in economics and finance and I did that at West Liberty University in West Virginia in the United States so literally this school was like in the mountains right and in this tiny little town with cows there's not even a gas station but it was a nice little school it felt like you're in a private school but it was actually the cheapest school in the state and West Virginia is one of the poorest states in the United States so I didn't have any student loans because it was so cheap which is great anyway if you want to know more in detail about my studies you can ask me stuff and and I'll answer let's see I lost my place sorry William says this is great awesome I'm glad you like it albrecht says view j/s is well the greater than sign so if UJS overreact i don't know i haven't really used view so i can't say i've heard good things about you but my take on now granted I've never used view so take that into consideration my take on view versus react at this point is I see a lot more jobs for react than I do for view it could just be because I develop with react so I get targeted stuff you know that coming you know when recruiters reach out to me it's with react stuff so who knows but react is used as far as I know react is used by more more companies and there are more react out there okay maybe it won't always be like that but that to me gives react the edge if your goal is to try to get a job you know with an established company if that's not your goal and you just want to build cool stuff and you know go with you also I mean I just I really I do like react I think they have a good team behind react there's a good ecosystem of things that work with react like material you I react router so anyway that's my take on it I have I have no hate for view though right I'm not I have nothing bad to say about view so if you like view that's awesome I think there are people making awesome things with you and with react and with angular and probably with a ton of other things so my thing is you just you got to use what's right for you and for your project you know based on the requirements of that project and and your abilities albrecht says you takes most nice things from react to an angular it's just as you may see on github view leads but of course it's personal stuff which you could yeah yeah I agree that's true view did surpass in terms of stars on github view did surpass reacts so that's true which I mean I don't know what's as a metric you know stars are kind of ambiguous right you know what does that really mean right that's what to me like for me personally like I love coding coding would be my hobby if I didn't already do it all the time and get paid for it but you know coding primarily for most people I think is a way to make money right so I think a more valuable metric for a framework if you're trying to make money is how many companies are already using it right have they invested in it because they're not likely to switch right most companies once they invest in something especially the bigger companies they're not gonna switch for a while so even if it turns out that view is actually better than anything else nobody's gonna switch the view if they've already put in money and to react or angular they're gonna stick with it for at least a couple of years so in terms of that like finding a job even if you is better I'm not saying one's better than the other but the suppose like let's suppose view was better just the fact that so many companies are already invested in angular and react is gonna say okay well I might have a hard time harder time finding a job with you as opposed to react alright but so that's I I usually recommend react for those reasons has nothing to do with the quality of you as as a library alright Joe says hi there I am a master's engineering in computer science with six years experience and C++ Linux real time then seven years into teaching what are my chances of reorienting my career again as a fullstack developer well to be honest with you I mean youyou have a very impressive background so if you can catch yourself up on some of the latest in the fullstack world then I think you're fine I mean you you probably have a better grasp on computer science like foundational principles then you know 90 plus percent of people on full stack out there all right and that's nothing against those people it's just you know a lot of people that are full stack developers right now you know the newer developers probably didn't get a traditional computer science education because they didn't really need it to get a job or to do their job right so I think you have a value especially it seems like larger companies like some of your leaders in tech when you look at their job descriptions they they tend to favor people with a stronger computer science background that may be changing but from what I've seen you know I'm thinking of like Google you know looking at some Google jobs they definitely like that if you have a strong computer science background even if you're going to be a frontend engineer it's it's still there at least it was the last time I checked out a job description so that's going to be a definite like plus for you you your thing would just be you need to prove to companies that you can build modern applications with the latest technology so you're gonna want to brush up on something like react you angular build some progressive web apps to put in your portfolio that's I I don't think as long as you are gonna enjoy it and be able to you know switch and learn things you know quickly I I think you'll be you know very valuable if I was looking to hire someone and you had that background plus you had some really nice stuff in your portfolio in terms of like modern web apps like my only thing would be like I don't know if I can pay this person enough to want to come here really because I think you're you're definitely in a good position Nino's says what is with styles I see that a lot in your app yeah so that's just what we need to use for form it's your UI when we want to pull in our see if I can find an example real quick so we have this with styles in here and that allows us to pull in and just use use styles like this okay so that is the the way and material UI that we bring that that in so if you want to know more about that I just check out the documentation for material UI and how we implemented that so I I never really had reason to dig deeper into all the theming options for material UI I just use a little bit of them so I'm not really comfortable explaining even more indepth as to what's going on behind the scenes but that hopefully I don't point you in the right direction if you want to research it a bit more Hyperion Jupiter says I'm passing out just by looking at his codes why is it is it ugly is my code just so sloppy or what Razvi says try Adonis J s instead of Express j s alright I've never tried Adonis I haven't even read up on anything about it can you Robb's if you're still around could you explain like some of the then maybe the differences between Adonis and Express and like why would we want to use Adonis instead of Express Michael Creole says that Burt Reynolds died so that stinks if you know what Burt Reynolds is was was an actor right so yeah I'm not sure I'm gonna he had to have been pretty old at this point I mean I haven't most of the stuff that he acted in was when I was a lot younger right Oh mayor says your bid off with pronunciation but it's fine is is it my ear let me know I really do want to pronounce it correctly so I don't I don't want to be constantly saying your name wrong lovneet says target container is not a Dom element how do I fix it I'm not sure I mean just off the top of my head I'm not sure about that error so I might need to know a little bit more info to help you with it krishna says this is so interesting awesome I'm glad that glad you find it interesting lebanese says i'm a beginner in react Jas any suggestions I would suggest like just generally try to do a little bit with it everyday that way you won't forget what you've learned and you're just kind of slowly built up and you know don't don't be afraid to just read like the react documentation definitely take advantage of using things like create react app to help you just get started you you don't need to know how to completely set everything up from scratch to be good with reacts you you really don't so don't you know don't don't feel ashamed to you know kind of use those things the same way with like routing you don't need to make your own router use react router or use something like next Jas with a builtin same thing with serverside rendering right you don't have to do it yourself there's so many good tools around that are really like high quality so you could get really overwhelmed and really kind of slow yourself down if you try to go and learn how to do these things from scratch when it's really unnecessary right you take advantage of the tools that have already been built and a lot of testing and work has been put into it but fazil says good days bro i like this channel awesome I'm glad you like it programmer says what are you listening to I'm just listening to Spotify so it's it's just a bunch of different songs it's one of like the daily mix channels so to be honest with you it sounds like I don't know like pop music really I actually try not to put when I'm doing a stream I try not to put music on but like I really like is then it's distracting I don't want to like pay attention to it so it's better to just have some random stuff going but the music in the background helps me number one I can't hear what's going on outside my door so it's not distracting me number two it helps me to make sure that I I talk loud enough for the mic to pick it up you're normally I'm I'm kind of softspoken and I have a tendency to mumble sometimes if I'm not really thinking about it so this helps me kind of overcome that so y'all can understand what I'm saying Oh No where the where the subtitles I don't understand he says I'm really sorry so we don't have subtitles for the live stream YouTube does those automatic subtitles so you may be able to catch the recording I mean I don't even know if you can understand what I'm saying now I'm sorry you may be able to catch the recording and have the automatic subtitles work we don't really have anybody that will like do the subtitles manually if anybody's interested in doing any subtitles for for this channel or for any of my videos let me know that would be awesome I'm sure we can we can do that and I definitely give you a shout out like constantly on my stream you V design says this is Carl from Twitter don't really understand everything just digesting everything and so I bring myself up to speed oh yeah cool um feel free to ask ask any questions you know I'll be happy to like stop and go back over what I'm doing so and that goes for anybody you know I if I lose you on something let me know I'll definitely go back and explain I want this these streams to be as helpful as possible to you all let's see this is an interesting character so I need to go do a little little translation here Melo's so me lo says Jessie what college did you go to or high school so the college I mentioned earlier was West Liberty University when I went there was called West Liberty State College but it like upgraded to a university so that's what it's called now and for high school I went to a high school called we're high so we're high school in in the town of Weirton West Virginia so it was it not that big of a high school I think there were around 200 students in my graduating class so anyway that's that was where I went na naman says I'm pursuing a Bachelor in computer science third or final year I have a little bit of knowledge about cccold sauce java HTML can you give me advice in what language I should focus on more it entirely depends on what you want to do right also Naaman says and what is trending in the market now okay honestly I feel like I say this a lot so sorry but javascript is just it's really big right now there is so much so like everything on the web is JavaScript right it has been for a while but even more is being built in JavaScript you know with electron thing like desktop apps for Mac Linux and Windows you have Android and iOS apps being built with things like react native and ionic you have now data science stuff being done machine learning stuff being done with things like tensorflow and brain j/s you can you have AR and VR stuff being built with I can't remember what the libraries are but you know there are JavaScript libraries to do almost anything that you could be doing and future science so if you're not sure what you want to do try javascript if you know what you want to do then maybe you want to research okay so from what I understand about things like data science and machine learning Python is the route to go if you're really into just building for Android Java or Kotlin iOS is Swift we're trying to think what else if you really want to go into like content management systems like WordPress or Drupal those are PHP based so it really depends on what you want to do right hopefully that helps if you give me some more info on what you're into maybe I could kind of give you some more targeted advice Meyer says Adonis J s is laravel of JavaScript so I don't know that much about laravel though right it's a is it PHP framework I think it is I it doesn't help me that much okay let's see Wladimir says what is the best books for starting to learn javascript for beginners there's a whole series and you can actually read it for free I believe it's on github it's called you don't know J s great series there's also another book available for free online called eloquent JavaScript those two books I think are awesome and they're great places to start out not only will they teach you Java Script but it'll teach you a lot of like basic computer science concepts MD says how to build a realworld application with react and how many projects do I have to for my own advanced user that's really a hard question to answer so I mean to build a realworld application I mean if you build an application like that's it's a realworld application right if it does something like that's it now if you're talking about like actually getting paid to build something I mean there you'll need to actually find someone who's willing to pay you to build it but it's hard to say how many projects you'd have to work on right because projects like you know you could do a project it's like a weekend project and it's this little thing right and it does one thing or you can do a project like what we're working on now that we've been working on literally all year right we started I believe in January for this project so it really depends so my advice is just each time you do a project try something new try to push yourself a little bit further and then you at least you'll know you're improving right and you know that's really all you can do right just keep trying to get better okay okay so someone is typing and so I think Melo's is typing in Croatian here is that it says you can find free books in PDF format okay cool so we're talking about Vladimir's asking about the books so I got my Google Translate open the other window so I think he says you can find free books yeah ome lo said Serbian not Russian I'm very sorry I did not mean to to confuse that so you're right I shouldn't assume that also Mila says are apps with with books on the Google Play Store david is react better than angular or is it about the same say truth I haven't used angular since angular 1 so I can't really give you a great answer to that reactant angular are not exactly the same so it could be that angular may be better for some things and react is better for other things the thing that I found really is you can build awesome stuff with anything and you can build terrible stuff with anything it depends on how you use it right and one framework or library is not going to be the answer to every everything right so better to just say look what fits the situation in terms of what resources do I have what are the project requirements you know what how much time do I have and what do I already know right now you know what is my team though so in some cases maybe it's gonna be rad maybe it's gonna be angular maybe it'll be view may be obese like amber who knows I mean who knows what it's just gonna be the hail says I want to become a backend slash full stack developer so do you think getting a degree in computer science is worth the money and time or just at end of boot camps of self teach here's my my normal advice for this now take it take into consideration this I live in the United States I don't know what the situation is like in other parts of the world in terms of what's required for jobs and how much college costs so here's my advice if you have scholarships that are gonna pay for your education or your parents are gonna pay for it go for it okay it may come in handy at some point and if you're gonna get it for free then take advantage of that right if you have to pay for it and it's gonna cost a lot and you're gonna have to get take out loans and go into a significant amount of debt don't do it you're gonna set yourself back a lot and it's gonna severely restrict your options later on right when when you don't have to pay you know let's say I don't know like six hundred plus dollars a month through your student loan payment then you have a lot more options to say like you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna work on this project even though I'm not going to make that much because it's gonna get me in with this company that could lead to something or I'm gonna be able to work with this technology and it's gonna look really good on my portfolio right you may not be able to say that you may have to say you know what I'm gonna have to take this job because it pays a lot or it pays enough right now working with some old technology you're doing something that's not really gonna advance my career just to pay the bills right so you may think like college is gonna give you an advantage but it may not it may set you back in in terms of what you can do after school to really put yourself in a position to get the job you want right so but like I said it definitely depends on your financial situation and and what's going on and what you want to do right if you want to if you want to get into like you said get a front backend or a full stack developer you could definitely get a job without the degree but it's not like that for not even for every job in computer science right so definitely do your research and especially like in your area right I don't know what it's like in other job markets in other countries Rasen says I'm starting my first developer job on September 17th got some advice to give I'll work with react oh yeah cool um congratulations first of all that's awesome definitely if you can come back to his stream after and let me know how it's going let me know your jobs one if you can't come to a stream just like DM me or something on Twitter let me know I'd love to hear how it's going but here's my advice when you first start out a job listen a lot right don't worry about proving yourself right off the bat I know it's a big temptation to try to like I got to prove myself but eh they believed in you enough to hire you right they went through that process that expensive difficult process of finding a new employee and they put their faith in you you don't have to convince them right they've you've already convinced them so don't worry about trying to prove yourself because sometimes you know you could you could end up looking foolish if you're trying too hard to prove yourself right so instead try to listen way more than you talk right because you need you want to figure out what's going on in your organization like not just technically but also like who how do things work in terms of the relationships you know in your company right who's now like it'd be great if everybody was nice and perfect right but we're not so it's like who is trustworthy right who's telling you good information and who's maybe not telling you good information right who can you trust to talk to honestly about things and who should you maybe like watch what you say around right so you want to be able to take all that in and and just kind of sit back and also like you don't want to accidentally offend somebody right if you step in and say why are we doing it like this that's a terrible idea you don't realize like maybe your boss was the one that came up with that idea right that's you know that's a mistake right so sit back right you will have plenty of time to prove yourself when you actually start working on your projects veda but that's my advice at first when you come into a situation like be very friendly be friendly to everybody certainly if somebody talks to you like be friendly and talk but you know in general like sit back and and relax you know I don't think anybody expects you to come in on day one and do amazing things right so just like take your time to get a feel for what's for what's going on there anybody else has any other advice for starting a new do developer position please let browser I know in the in the chat melosa is trying to teach myself and it's not easy okay so that was in response I think to somebody else we'll skip the jbs what kind of tech is typical for a frontend dev javascript HTML CSS that's that's your basics of you know every frontend devs going to know that or at least they should if they don't I'm not sure what like what they'd be working on but yeah your your frontend does and in a call from somebody I don't recognize the number I'm just trying to remember if I had I don't think I'm expecting it cause so I think I'm good yes so that's your basics now if you want to branch out and do other stuff you know so you can get into react are you to talk about testing maybe you're gonna use jest or something like that like you want to interact more with like like REST API is and things so like there's a lot of different routes you can go to start branching out and your knowledge but your basic stuff that you should for sure know HTML CSS JavaScript David says I'm about to lead a software development team for the first time and I'm not an experienced developer myself what should I be concerned about you know what I would say if you're gonna lead a team just make sure now I don't want to give you that advice here but if you're not as experienced as some of the people you're gonna be leading don't be afraid to admit that and be honest about it because it'll probably be obvious at some point to those people right so I'd be open about the fact that you know say hey like I want people on my team that know more than me or different things than me right to fill in those gaps and make it clear that your job in particular is to make sure everybody works together all right it'll be a lot more clear that maybe you don't that it's okay that you're leading people that may be better than you at being a developer right because your number one job is not just the coding your job is to make sure that the whole team works together right so kind of like establishing that right off the bat is good but then balance that too and I know this is gonna be hard to do but try to balance that with yes I'm gonna I really want your opinion on I respect your opinion but at the end of the day like if I'm leading this I'm gonna have to make some calls that may be different than what you suggest so you're just trying to have that balance of you know respect going both ways you know now I how you do that is it's really gonna depend on the personalities of the people that you're working with it'd be hard to say for sure but hopefully that helps a little bit Mila says Jessie it is a hacker he got your number joke I don't get it I don't know what the joke is I'm missing something and an Arabic says I'm very interested in programming programming I'm 30 years old and if dedicate myself to this will I get hired or accepted by companies or would they be interested in someone who's over 30 years old oh yeah for sure for sure I wouldn't worry about that your there's like AI seems to be a lot of apprehension about like age and the tech industry but if you can prove that you can do the work that's what's most important right so I wouldn't worry about that just focus on being able to do to do the work Vladimir this is he's gonna start it to build a site for survival cut many skills that's cool if you start building that share that that'd be cool I want to check it out and our back says is a Cisco certificate good to get a job well if you want to do Cisco Networking then yeah it's it's good it just depends on what you want to do I I don't really know what the job prospects are for that right now so I can't say whether or not it's it's gonna get you a job for sure or not neither says I'm referring to the unknown number which called you I'm terrible oh okay bye bad haha I totally forgot I was getting a call I shout okay it was my mortgage company so I'm looking to get like a home equity loan to do some remodeling in my house so my wife has wanted to remodel the house for years and so I finally am like okay let's get this he'll be the loan and and we'll do this so anyway it was somebody from the loan company calling me to remind me of all the documents I have to send in let's see I think I'm almost through everything JB says are you using a design framework on the project yes so material UI is what we're using David says thank you for your advice Jesse best of luck to you in the future oh thank you I appreciate that okay I got through all the questions if I miss your question you know let me know in the comments to the video or ask me on a future stream or DMV or something but yeah I definitely need to take a little break here and get something to eat and let me say well one more comment I'll read this I mean that says you're a lucky you have a wife do what you love and our happy best of luck to you too oh thank you I really appreciate that yeah I guess I mean I I have it pretty blessed in terms of having a good wife and a good good kids in your family here so yeah so definitely try to appreciate that all right cool so and my throat is gonna sore from from talking so
