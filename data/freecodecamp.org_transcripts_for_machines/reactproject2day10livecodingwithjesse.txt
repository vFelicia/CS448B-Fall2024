hey everybody it's Jesse sorry uh it started a little bit late I had um I guess I'm only 3 minutes late it's not as bad as I thought uh I had a um a problem with something I had made months ago and now uh basically um we we were using this plugin with Salesforce to let people register for events to come visit campus and the default styles were just really really outdated um even like to look at the code they were using versions of like JavaScript plugins that were like 10 years old it it was really bad so I went in and did the best I could in customizing it and bringing it up to like our brand standards so um it turns out that on May 15 15 all of everything I had done wasn't working anymore and it it reverted back to the default the only reason I know that is because part of what I did was add Google analytics code uh so that's the point when the analytics stopped coming in for those pages uh and I I had never gone on because they had been working well for at that point weeks at least weeks and um tested it everything was fine so didn't realize until today that it wasn't working so I was trying to figure that out at The Point when I realized that I I don't know what's going on uh then I I needed to send an email and get it forwarded on to the company we have an odd setup right now so we we're using a Salesforce product to take applications uh for people who want to go to our University and for for other things but we're using a product that's being resold by another company and they're all all they are doing is just taking this Salesforce plugin so that basically there's like two other companies between us and Salesforce so I can't go directly to Salesforce for support and I can't go to the company that made the plugin we have to first go to this company that's reselling the plugin so it's really complicated and I have no direct contact with any uh uh any people that can that can help me out so I have to go to my it Department first then they go to one of the companies and that company will Pro maybe have to go to the company that made the plugin it's just a big mess so anyway uh that's that's why I was delayed so again I apologize uh so uh let me I want to check and see if we how many people we have in here now uh see if we can get started Okay cool so we we have a decent number around 50 people uh so so let's get started I um uh let me start out I haven't given my normal uh starting thing so I know there have been a lot of new people from the live chat so just to let everyone know this this stream is just me doing my everyday work uh I I am employed fulltime as a frontend developer uh so this is me doing my work so it's not exactly a tutorial although hopefully you learn how to do some things when you watch this uh and it is very much interactive so I take advice from you all in the live chat and also pool requests for the projects uh of which I've had a lot recently which is awesome thank you um I do make a lot of mistakes and that's intended because uh I really want you all to see what it's really like for me to do this so I don't rehearse any of it beforehand and uh I just want to give you a glimpse into what it's like for me to do frontend development uh I I don't know if I'm like the average developer or not I'm not really sure how well my day uh relates to other developers but at least it might give you an idea of what one developer does all right so having having said all that um let me uh fill you in on what's been done since yesterday and what we're going to do today so basically let me get this was for a little es6 exercise I was doing so I can get rid of that these are some resources I was reading over uh that Kevin sent yesterday in the live stream in the live chat um let me show you okay so we've added we've added some things for testing uh in order to test the upload things so no one will ever see this unless you're submitting pool requests or anything but uh it's just going to allow us to do testing on the uh file upload uh input that we have and what else is happened a lot of refactoring has gone on and all this stuff was from pool requests so I had some pool requests from uh Patrick and some from Kevin and uh basically just refact factoring the service request page uh so you can see there's a big difference so I'm not going to go over it all uh for two reasons one uh it'll take up a lot of time because so much has changed and also the second reason is I know that it works because I tested it but I'm still trying to figure it out myself so I don't want to try to stumble through um explaining what's going on here when and uh I I wouldn't be able to do a good job of explaining everything maybe if I broke it down into small pieces but but for right now basically what it does is uh you could see the labels for the input elements are now here okay so everything's in uh in state now really uh so the labels are here for all our multiline Fields so really I mean you this is somewhat selfexplanatory so our single line text Fields labels here multiline labels here labels for our checkboxes here and we have two columns of checkboxes so they're split up into two columns right now uh and then we had um basically we were trying to make these controlled components so I had done it on maybe one of the components one or maybe a few of them yesterday uh just to start out with and uh Patrick went in and actually made it so that it applies to all of the components but it happens like without having to manually go to each component and do it right so that's what what this whole thing is doing is just making sure that the value of each component is determined by the state uh the the the state in uh for that particular element uh let me show you it's going to be a lot easier if I just show you this in uh Dev tool so you can see what the state is so let me do this uh some things are just hard to explain without a visual okay so let me bring this over so you can see the result of what all that does so this is the state now for that service request component so you can see each field has its own uh key in state and the value in state is going to be the value that shows up in the field so uh for instance I could go in here and change the state for name to just some nonsense here and it's actually changed it here in the field uh I could add something in for the phone number and you could see it changed the state here so what happens is on change and if you watch yesterday you know like I went over this yesterday but uh just to to reiterate for anybody who's new on change it changes first the state and then once a state change occurs that triggers the rerender and then the value comes from the state so that's the flow of of how this works so why would we want to do this um it makes it really easy for us to get all the values uh to keep track of everything so this will make more sense once we start sending this data somewhere I'm sure that this is not the only way to do it uh but I like this way to do it this seems to be common among people when I I've seen them do this uh this kind of thing like in tutorials for react so uh so anyway I'm just saying I'm not it's not like we're inventing anything new here uh but could be a little bit more complex than you're used to if you haven't done forms in react before all right so that's that's basically what's happened like I said a lot of the other stuff was uh for the testing um so you'll see that like when we go to commit some code you'll see the test run okay okay uh also I have the uh live stream going on Instagram as well simultaneously so if anybody's interested in seeing that it's uh it's just a shot of me in my office uh working so uh it won't really add that much uh to the actual coding part of it but it's there if you want it uh okay so let me check the live chat and just say say hi and see what's going on okay cool it looks like thank thank you everyone in the live chat it looks like there are some some new people who had some questions and you all took care of that uh for me and gave some great answers so I appreciate that I definitely want to make sure that newcomers to uh this stream always feel very welcome and you all in the live chat do a great job of that so thank you for that and uh and keep up the good work okay great I'm looking through it looks like you all took care of every question uh wow you you you uh you all are awesome yes John so John Hansen said save the Save State I guess is much better than the old Ajax stringify yes exactly yeah that's what that's what I was thinking of when I was saying like if you haven't done this in react the other way I was thinking of is well you probably used something with Ajax and and submitted like that okay Sebastian see you later uh Sebastian is frequently in the the live chat and helps out with a lot of pool requests and things and uh he's working security and Music Festival this week so he can't be here so he uh good luck with with that and uh hopefully there's nothing serious you have to deal with and you can just enjoy the music okay uh let's see Pablo Pablo's here you commented on a video I saw the comment but that was like kind of right in the middle when all the craziness was happening that I explained earlier and why I started late let me think oh you were asking about the Udacity course okay so I want to give you an answer to that the Udacity course is paid the the react Nano degree from Udacity is the course that I was referring to it is a paid course it is a little bit expensive they had a sale on it but I think the sale's over but um if you're looking for free resources right now I don't think Udacity has any free react resources they have a lot of other free things that are useful but not react uh so if you want free react stuff um code academy has a has a class for free that's browser based and um let me think learn code academy has some YouTube videos on it uh the beta curriculum for free code Camp I think uses react more I'm going to be honest I haven't checked out the beta curriculum in a really really long time so uh not sure what's in there but I'm I think there's react stuff in there so those would be my goto places right now if you're trying to learn react and uh don't really want to invest that much money which I totally understand uh if you weren't sure that you're actually going to use it that much then it's definitely not worth uh the investment okay let's um oh cool it looks like um there are some other suggestions coming up in the live chat as well so thank you all for contributing uh we're going to have to make I I definitely need to make like some sort of video and just bring together all of your suggestions that because there's been a lot of good suggestions for react resources so uh I need we need one place where I can just direct people to because I think I frequently forget good resources when I try to answer that question uh during the the Stream so I'll have to record a good answer to that so everybody gets quality answer uh and it's not depending upon my memory all right so today um all right I'm going to leave it up to you all what you want me to do today because I have basically two things what I was hoping to try to do uh yesterday what we kind of started is handle all this form data and actually send it somewhere now I want to maybe set up that somewhere and that would end up being uh probably I would use express and node.js to take that data and do some stuff with it that's going to be kind of difficult okay that's not an easy task um at least not for me because I don't often do it uh so I have done it before but only once before so uh we can try that or we can try to do something that's a little bit more beginner friendly and just build some of the layout for the rest of the pages uh and I will say for me today I've just been feeling really like not not motivated and kind kind of down I don't know what's wrong with me today so if you all want to put in the chat what you feel like doing I'll do whatever you want but me like my mind right now is saying do the easy stuff today uh but I don't want to trust my mind when I'm in this like depressed state uh because I'm I'm sure that we can accomplish a lot of stuff even if we do the hard stuff uh so I'll give everyone a minute just to uh weigh in with their opinions on what you'd like to see today uh which like I said either way is fine with me um it might actually be useful if there's a lot of beginners to maybe do some of the easier stuff and it'll give me I don't know more time to research uh what I want to do for the um uh the handling of file uploads and data uh actually let me I've never done this before on air but I I feel like I just I really need to to give you a quality stream today so um I know you all can't see this right now you might hear some of it so normally I get some caffeine in before the stream but because I had crazy going on right before the stream I couldn't so I'm going to mix up my energy drink right now it'll just take me uh just a minute and then I'll have it uh normally I I do this in advance so just just do a little bit I don't I don't need a lot I got a decent amount of sleep um but I ended up so yesterday I told you I think I was going to go to to see a doctor about my wrist so I ended up spending most of yesterday evening uh with the doctor well not really with the doctor in the waiting room waiting for the doctor and uh the good news is my wrist is not broken which is what they uh suspected uh that it might be broken um but it's not it's not broken but it is uh very inflamed so I uh I have a brace so so I I'm going to show it on the uh Stream So I have this brace and uh if you if you're joining in in uh Instagram you can see it and right now the brace is off because I tried to use the brace earlier and work with the brace and it actually hurt worse so it was really hard to try to move my hand around uh I used like the uh the magic uh trackpad thing for the iMac and it was it was crazy and to try to type with it was really weird I kept making mistakes uh so I took it off so that's probably not the best thing for it but I don't I don't have time like I got to do I got to code this stuff so I I can't I can't mess around with uh trying to use that brace so I'll put on the brace maybe like later on it does help a lot when I'm home uh because I keep forgetting uh it's my right hand and I'm righthanded I just keep forgetting and doing stuff and then hurting it worse so anyway just an update in case you uh you wondered about it which I think most people probably care about the code and not necessarily about what I'm doing but sometimes if I don't give you a update somebody always asks me uh about the update so so cool so I think that's Phillip is that Phillip in the uh in Instagram so Phillip thinks that that is a cool nerdy brace so yeah so hopefully uh they gave me these these pills that are supposed to bring the inflammation down uh but it it's probably going to take a couple of days so hopefully they work okay so sorry for the delay but at this point I think I should have enough responses uh to determine what we should do today all right so let me scroll up okay I think this is the point where I asked in the live chat and let's see okay so we got to vote for easy stuff okay uh bobic asks why are you depressed I don't know why I'm depressed and that's why I don't think I should trust it so I have like I have depression so I see a counselor for it I take medicine for it right so what I've found and I've had it for I don't know over 10 maybe like 15 years or something so at this point I realized that if I feel like I'm depressed and I think about reasons why I maybe should or shouldn't be depressed and I can't think of any good reason why I should be depressed then I should not trust those feelings and I should try to get over it uh however I can so today I don't really think there's a really good reason for me to be depressed there is some stuff going on like some family stuff uh that is is kind of I think well basic I think my wife's uh grandmother is probably going to die really soon so that's like a little bit sad uh I don't want to I don't want to downplay that but I'm just saying like that's something that is definitely legitimate to be sad about but to be sad to the point where like I don't want to do my work I just don't think that that connects like if anything I should be doing more work to just take my mind off it um and cuz really like I don't uh I'd rather be able to be there for my wife and not have to have her worry about me being depressed or anything so anyway that's bottom line uh answer to the question is there's not really a great reason why I should be this depressed today so that's why I'm trying to get over it so I've got my my gfuel energy drink and I've got my live stream and I've got you all which always pumps me up so I think we'll be okay so don't worry about me it's not like severe depression or anything okay so I think the only vote I got one way or another for doing something was do was easy stuff maybe I'm I missed it but that's fine with me we can do easy stuff yeah so Brian voted for easy stuff okay Dixie easy stuff Conrad beginner stuff okay awesome let's do that then uh that's cool I kind of wanted to research a little bit more um and I had some resources up on my other screen that I still hadn't read all the way through yet so uh it'll probably it'll end up being a better stream when we do that uh then I'll I'll make less mistakes and um we we actually we'll probably get it working uh in instead of just making something that keeps breaking uh okay cool thank you all for uh for your input on that I appreciate that and thanks for for giving me a break today uh and uh voting for the easy stuff uh bobic asked do you exercise regularly um not not like I should so I actually got back into exercising so two of the last three days I uh I exercised in the morning uh before coming to work for about like a half hour 45 minutes I just did some cardio uh today though this morning I didn't I woke up a little bit late and um I I didn't exercise so I'm guessing like that probably has something to do with it I I normally feel better when I exercise and that's what actually my counselor says I'm supposed to exercise like pretty much every day for 45 minutes so that explains why I'm probably feeling depressed cuz I haven't I've just been so busy it's that's something that's easy to cut out you know there's other things that I like I have to take care of the kids I have to come to work uh and the one thing that I can just cut out and nobody's going to get upset about is exercise all right cool so uh bobic I really appreciate that um bobic says uh notices that that it definitely helps with state of mind uh for exercise so I appreciate you um taking an interest in me and and giving me advice on that um okay let's get started so uh I really I do appreciate you all caring about my my mental health uh but I'm sure there's some people in here that came for some code so let's get let's get to the code and let's see what page we're going to do so we've done home uh logos we didn't do anything yet for Logos this is just um the demo card uh that road had made the card component um so I don't think we're going to do logos today we'll see if that's the last thing left over we have posters okay posters is fine letterhead is f Share story service request from tutorial H actually the tutorial is going to be really easy let's just start with that let's get a quick win right off the bat and uh set up the tutorial view so uh I'll start as as we've been doing and I'll show you what we currently have on the site basically what we're going to try to imitate uh and uh possibly improve upon if we can so the goal um we we spoke about this a few streams ago but the goal basically is to to make this as close as possible to what it is now just so that people don't get freaked out by it and they still know what to do but improve where we can improve uh so the changes to the UI are going to be minor but hopefully meaningful and in a good good way for our users all right so here's the tutorial look look how simple this is uh all I had was a card uh with a bit of text at the top and yeah that is really my work phone number so I don't care if you all see that you can get it online anyway um so it's just a YouTube video of me clicking around and explaining to people how to use this so that's all we really need to do uh we're just going to put it in here uh now the the one UI change that we have been thinking about and testing on some pages is to not use cards quite so much and I think in this case we can definitely get rid of this card because we have kind of this double card Effect going on here because we have shadows right now uh on the video and on the card so it just pops it up another level there uh which I don't really think is necessary I think it'll end up looking like a card anyway uh if we get rid of this one because we have a shadow in the video uh and then we can just put this text above it and see how it looks so let's try that and I'll have to I need to figure out what the URL is so I'll inspect this page uh on my other screen just to grab the URL so um I don't really think there's that much value in showing showing you all on on my the screen that you can see uh me just going through these elements actually maybe I will and then you can see you can see for yourselves whether or not this was built properly you can see the structure uh so this was my first project for when I started working here here we go okay so this is our our video and I think I'm going to grab I'm GNA grab all of this so copy element now will this copy I'm hoping this copies everything inside the element I'm not really sure if it will let's let's test it out awesome it did okay there's several options to copy when you go to copy from Dev tools and uh I'm always like not sure what each one does uh and i' I've never taken the time to try them out okay so we have that I'm going to leave that there uh so it's it's easy for me to get to and let's go to tutorial here we go so we'll go to the tutorial page and I want to bring this over here I have way too many pages open at this point uh so I'm going to get rid of some of them oh actually this reminds me uh before I get rid of this one I had someone uh message me on Twitter and say that they were getting an error when they were trying to run the program and the image they sent me an image of the error and it was uh snav .js on line 34 so if anybody else is getting this error let me know but basically uh the error was saying um handle close is not defined so that was the error that it was giving for this page and that's why it wouldn't run when they tried to do uh npm start so if anybody else has this error please let me know I'll I'll try to figure it out I mean it's it's a little hard to figure out since I can't recreate the error on my machine uh so I think it I don't think they said what operating system okay I can see from the screenshot they're they're on a Mac as well so yeah it's just it's really odd that that's not working so if you have any ideas uh please let me know and um because I mean I want I want you all to be able to you know pull this code down and and uh try it out out uh I actually had from the last project I had quite a few people who um pulled down the code for that last project we did with nextjs and um actually did projects based on that so they took you know what I had modified it to suit their needs and came up with some really cool projects so that was I I was like pleasantly surprised that uh that you all were doing that with I don't know that I can really call it with my code because we were collab atively on it so much but with art basically they took what we did and just ran with it and and did you know did their own thing and so that that was really cool uh so I'm going to get rid of the side na now uh I'm going to say don't save okay so here's our tutorial page and let's go to another page and just copy now that I look at it I don't really think there's much we need to copy from here this page is going to be pretty simple okay yeah I'm not going to worry about copying anything and this page can actually be a stateless functional component so let's let's make it a stateless uh functional component and then that way if if anyone's not familiar with that that or why you would want to do it or how to do it uh then this will be kind of a good uh a good demonstration of it uh so oops let me I forgot to start my Pomodoro clock so let me do that now as well oops there we go also I still someone sent me a Pomodoro clock that they had written I think in Java I still have not had a chance to test that out yet I've not forgotten about it though and I will test that out uh so if you're watching uh just be patient with me please okay so let's take let me bring up I just want to see if this is in in the react docks especi if there's someone that's new uh definitely check out the react docs uh but we'll go through this yesterday we had a situation where we did something and they had a really good explanation of it in the react doc so I think it might be a good idea that whenever we're doing something in react to have those ready and then that way like when you all have questions it'll be right there you can see it I can refer to that I'll be able to give you better answers uh than I normally would be able to so I'm going to try to remember to do this okay so our new component okay so here's so you can have a component as a function or you can have a component as a class right now we have it as a class um but we don't need it as a class why would you want to component as a class well if it needs to have State uh if you need to do some some things with it um like if you're going to have the um like use the component life cycle methods then you probably want it to be a class correct me if I'm wrong too in the live chat but this was my understanding of it but if you don't need to do any of that stuff uh then stateless functional component probably the way to go so let's take let me make sure I'm not missing something important before I go on Okay cool so don't think I'm missing anything important and let's see I don't think we did any stateless functional components yet in this project did we no I don't think we have we definitely did in our other projects though let's see I thought we did now now that I'm actually looking for it I can't find any there we go finally I found one all right so you can see like how much more simple this is so side by side uh instead of making a class and then having a render function and return we've replaced all that with just this right so we're making use of some an arrow function uh which that's some es6 uh stuff so if you if you're not familiar with that uh check out more on es6 uh but it's basically a Shand for a function and it has some other very nice benefits uh in terms of what the value of this ends up being uh but that's basically it that's all we need so you can see we have that and then we just export at the bottom you know as normal so let's do that and I'm going to check I'm going to check the live chat right right after I do this uh just because I want to make sure I didn't say something wrong when I was explaining that and I know you all will have corrected me okay so here we go and that's it that's all we need instead of what we had before so I mean it may not seem like a a big deal uh but it definitely make things things look a little bit cleaner and if you were making a lot of components you know that little bit of of time would add up not only in creating it but then also going back and having to read through components you know that's two less lines that you have to scan through you know with your eyes so uh I'm sure that that all adds up at some point okay so we want a container and actually it might it might be useful to grab our container classes from somewhere else so just so we don't type it over again so this is way more than we actually need but we'll get rid of a bunch of it and um now I lost Where I Was Here We Go tutorial so we need our container class and a row and a column so let's get rid of most of this and we'll just keep that first part there we go and we're going to keep our row we'll get rid of this column and we'll get rid of this okay now we can bring this over and we need to change our class to class name so in the last project we had oops guess that's it in our last project we had actually had something that let us use class um and it just automatically um work that out for us but I don't think I brought that over to this project so uh I may end up bringing it over but at this point I do need to change the class name that's probably better so that uh you all don't get confused like if if someone's joining in and didn't realize that I had that uh going and you know running then they might not understand why I can use class and they couldn't use class uh let's see I'm not sure if these props will work we'll see we'll try it out I mean it'll be obvious if they don't work so save that let's check out what's happening all right cool so what is this so it definitely doesn't look uh like we want it to look but at least we have it on the page so we we have the video and we have some some sort of Shadows going on uh so let's see actually this would be a good time to check materialize and see if they have something for um uh for video or I'm sorry material UI I think I said materialize I meant material UI actually you know what that's that might be the reason uh I don't have I brought over the classes for video container but I didn't bring over any of the actual code so that makes sense uh so I'm going to bring that over I I totally forgot I did say I was going to check the um the live chat so let me check oh okay sorry I forgot to start the enro server let me do that where am I at okay sorry about about that so if you would like to check out the project uh you know as we're developing it uh in real time you can go here I'll paste this into the live chat uh if you can't see the link in the live chat if you can't get to it for some reason um I'll leave it up on the screen for just a minute uh but as you can see you know here's all our connections um now you can you can follow along you can inspect things um you're not limited to seeing what's on my screen my boss just sent me a slack message in Latin I'm not familiar with one of the words so I need to Google translate this so I'm pretty sure he just I'm going to leave out the name of the company's product but he I'm pretty sure he just told me in Latin that this company's product is destroyed so maybe something that we use here at the university is has crashed okay he was responding to um a note a message I'd sent him earlier about uh the analytics code not not working so anyway I used to teach Latin so if you're confused as to why he's sending me a message in Latin that's that's why and then he he also knows quite a bit of Latin as well so don't normally just speak Latin okay so I don't normally get distracted by other people uh in my my office whenever I'm working but occasionally it happens and I like when it happens because that's like accurate uh of a normal workday is sometimes you you get interrupted with things okay it seems as if there's some good discussion going on in the live chat so I'm I'm just like looking in the middle of it here uh so I'm going to I'll check back in on this a little bit later and see if I can figure out what's going on but right now I'm not I'm not exactly sure okay all right it doesn't look like I'm missing anything uh that I need to address in the live chat right now uh if you did ask a question I am going to come back later on try to find uh all the questions and answer them so um uh just stick around if you can all right so that was definitely the enro was definitely on the screen long enough uh for everyone to uh navigate there if they wanted to so as I was saying there's um right now uh there's no Styles associated with the classes that we had on uh on this video so let's pull over the styles and let me see I think I had yeah these are just from materialize okay so let's go we have materialize here so let's pull it from here because I'm sure these are all from a much older version of material realize I'd rather get the newer versions I know that they did change a bit about their um box Shadows uh to make them a little bit more you know accurate to the material design spec uh so there's definitely been some some updates since I built this so I want to get the updates all right so video container we want this for sure and where are we going to put this okay we want to add this in our Styles I'm not sure how how small is too small for a CSS file let me show you what's going to go in it this is pretty much going to be it uh I do maybe I need to bring this depth over but if I'm going to bring the depth over I might want to bring more of them I guess if I'm just bringing the the depth this one depth thing over it should be fine okay I definitely don't I don't want all this stuff C depth one half no I don't want the half uh so I don't want it apply to all of this stuff because I don't want to mess with any of the material UI things so I'm going to get rid of all of this okay but yeah you can see so they've definitely this is definitely a different box Shadow than the one I'm seeing in uh the original version so they definitely have updated their box Shadow since then normally I I don't do the files like this but thought I'd tried the command line is definitely faster my editors okay good I thought my editor was going to crash you know right there in the middle of right here in the middle of the stream that would be bad okay uh let's let's link to materialize there we go and then now we're going to want to import these styles so this is actually really cool um in in react if you do split your Styles up like this into separate files you don't have to load them everywhere uh so normally if you were making a website you may have all your Styles in one file and they act they just load on every page whether or not they're needed uh so I mean you don't have to do it like that but that's kind of what people normally do or at least what they have done in the past so with this uh we're going to import this into this component and then whenever we use this component which in this case this component is actually going to be the entire tutorial view so the Styles will get pulled in when we need it and they won't need to be uh used right if we don't need it so that it just helps keep things uh smaller so let's I just want to pull over here we go no actually that's that's not what I want because I want I don't have anything else here we go dang it I wanted to copy to save time time and just copy this this import but I guess I guess it won't save me time since I looked everywhere already I'm assuming that we had here we go this is what I was trying to do actually I don't want it there I want it down below okay so when we import this in we have to we have to think about where we're at in the the folder structure uh so right now we're in the views folder so we need to go up one folder and then down into the Styles folder so that's why we have dot dot slash so that takes us up then down into Styles then into video. CSS okay so that's like the main reason why I just wanted to copy it so I wouldn't have to think about that and uh ended up not really saving any time and I copied it into the wrong file anyway not there we go I'm just I'm just laughing at myself now um okay now that's in the right file let's see if that had any impact on how this looks none none at all really what is going on it looks like why is video container not being applied um thought video container position relative okay so it seems like what's happening let me show you what I'm seeing which is a little bit weird uh so this video contain class um it's not the Styles aren't being applied what is this this is really odd Okay so evidently that these have all been brought in somewhere else and so that was being applied so this was probably brought in with the uh pool request for uh the upload uh input yeah so that's cool so if that was needed there let's see what's going on with our uh that's what's happening I didn't change it okay all right well that's slightly better right so we have um it's not going outside the bounds here but that's definitely still not what we want okay so in about two minutes I'm going to check back in with the uh with the live chat so let's see what's going on here let bring this over um I'm going try to make it so that we can see both things at once okay so we have this border it's quite it's quite thick there we go so I'm not sure what was going on with the Border but this is better right I mean that's that's much better we don't want the Border there okay so for I'm not sure where that border was coming from let's see okay I guess that was just the default and for some reason there was nothing um you know what there there's probably some stuff at the very beginning of the materialized file that gets rid of lot of the default Styles so I'm guessing there's just default the iframe you know default border they get rid of it at the top so we didn't include that stuff so that's why it was in there uh so I'm just going to put it uh since the video video container if frame was it on the ey frame yeah yeah so that border was on the ey frame so since we already have this here and it's already targeting uh the iframe let's just just put border none here and then see we'll double check make sure that works okay cool that's working all right so I'm not sure if I went too fast through that uh sorry about that but basically um if if you didn't know what I was talking about there are some default Styles so when you see stuff like user agent stylesheet uh elements get default Styles and usually if you use a framework a CSS framework one of the first things that they do in their main CSS file is just get rid of all the default Styles so they'll just sometimes they just set it all like to nine or to zero or anything or something so that it doesn't interfere with what they're trying to do later on uh so that's what I was talking about and so we don't have that cuz we didn't import all of materialized we just imported the pieces we need so we could if we really wanted to I guess import that part of materialize if I run into more things like this it might make sense but since it was just this this the only time I've seen this something like this happen so far it was made more sense just to put border none you know right on that that iframe since we're already targeting that in our CSS file uh so that's why I did it like that so obviously we want to do a bit more with this uh definitely want to make sure it's centered and uh that's going to be an easy fix we just need to fix our column classes and uh then everything should be looking pretty good uh we're definitely going to want some sort of padding here maybe even vertically align this uh so if we haven't already done so we might want to bring over the uh some of the vertical line stuff from materialize not exactly sure it'll work I'll have to see it might work uh without using like the whole page structure I think as long as we have our container row column structure uh it should work so that's what I'll do after the break is over and uh the break will be to catch up on the live chat uh also the Instagram feed is now finished so uh thanks for watching if you check that out and that will be available for 24 hours uh if you want to view it later the link for my Instagram's in the description oh man I just I just grabbed my phone and like clicked it with my my right hand which is the the bad hand because I just keep forgetting and it it hurts let me uh let me scroll up a bit I know I missed a lot in the live chat uh CU you all have been uh been talking a lot which is awesome I love when the the live chat's active so I'm going to scroll all the way up to the top because I'm I'm afraid I'm going to lose some of the messages uh because there's so many of them um it looks like right now I'm not not losing anything so I I shouldn't lose anyone's things and also I'm going to skip over some of the questions got really good answers uh already in the live chat from you all so I'm going to skip those so if if you answered if you asked a question early on and I don't get to it uh then that's probably why if you really want me personally to answer it uh let me know uh either put the question again in the live chat or send it to me on Twitter uh Zakaria asks said uh I'm new to programming is react a better version of jQuery um I I don't they're not comparable in the same way uh so I would say no but if you're going to use react you can probably do anything you'd want to do in jQuery you could do it in react without having to use jQuery so in a sense I guess you can pretty much replace I don't want it's not like you can just bring react into a project that you're using jQuery and and replace it so yeah so I I wouldn't compare them directly I guess uh but if you are using react then you probably don't need jQuery you could do everything with with just react um the only thing I'm thinking of that just like Ajax stuff but you'd probably want to use fetch for that anyway so uh cuz react doesn't have you know their own way of handling things like that uh Ron to Runner asked hey Jesse what do you think about semantic UI uh I don't I don't know really anything at all about semantic UI I've seen it mentioned uh before uh in the live chat but I haven't had a chance to check it out so sorry but I don't I don't really have any opinion about it uh at all uh ronto runner also ask what's the best UI for react uh I don't I don't really know how to answer that question either uh because this is the first project that I'm actually using a UI framework specifically for react I've attempted before to use materialize with react and to try to make it work uh the only downside is so things aren't organized already into components and it uses a lot of jQuery so that's why I've switched for this project to using material UI but I haven't really tried any other ones out so I I don't think my opinion is uh worth much at this point Zakaria ask should I learn jQuery to learn react or angular or can I start with them right away uh you don't need to learn jQuery to learn react or angular and in fact if you really want to learn react I say you can just skip jQuery and go straight into react um I don't know if it's still like this with angular but at one point angular had like a jQuery light that came with it I guess where you could do some stuff with jQuery and you didn't have to bring in all of jQuery so I don't know if they still do that with the newer versions of angular so um let's see okay ducon says uh and sorry if I'm mispronouncing that uh but ducon says react and angular are not using jQuery okay so evidently the newer versions of react have gotten rid of jQuery completely uh so yeah so then I would say I I don't know enough about angular to say for sure but I would say definitely if you really want to learn react you can skip jQuery okay so my five minutes is up I'm just going to scroll a little bit uh just because I as I said earlier I don't want to lose some of the earlier messages okay um Duan asked how long are you programming I'm not sure if you mean how long have I been programming or how long this particular stream will go uh this stream will probably go for like about another hour and and um if you were asking how long I've been programming um I don't I need to write this down I always have to think um let me think like five years I guess but maybe not like maybe like really seriously trying to be a good JavaScript developer for like I don't know like three or four out of the five years okay so let me um let me get back to some of the code I want to check so I'm stopping at the live chat at at the point where it was 222 p.m. for my time so I'm going to write that down so I remember and don't have to try to find where we were at all right that's another thing that I'm trying to write with my right hand and that's not not so easy right now okay so let's change these column classes and get this uh oriented properly so right now the reason it's over here is because we have it set to take up on medium siiz screens and bigger we have it set to take up only half of the screen only six of the 12 columns we are we have imported the column classes from materialize so we are using material UI but we've also imported some stuff from materialize uh so I I suppose like that's probably confusing so that's definitely worth repeating uh probably for every stream uh I think I have I think I put it in the description but I didn't really explain it in the description so basically what we want to do is just get rid of this and now let's see how it looks all right cool much better uh much bigger and at this point I do want to try to have this aligned vertically now we're going to use flex box for this so that means it may not work in older browsers which is fine with me uh especially this is a site that's Geared for an internal a audience and I'm of the opinion that I'd rather try to push everyone here at the University to use modern browsers because that's a safer thing for them to be doing uh so I don't feel bad about not supporting older browsers if it was an external site I might think more about it uh depending on the audience uh but internally like there's there's really no excuse uh you know no one even needs to update themselves in fact they can't update anything themselves their computers are all on lock down uh all they' need to do would be call or email the IT department and they would update the browser so given that given that all it takes is a short phone call or email I'm definitely fine with only supporting the latest browsers for internal sites which ends up being cool because we could do you know cool things and not worry about supporting older stuff so let's grab uh I'm not going to do the flexbox vertical line from scratch because materialize are already has some of that built in so let's find it and materialize and pull that in uh let me see I had to think for a second of what it was called uh so we have this Vine wrapper and why is it not all right well let's pull this in and then we'll also need a a Vine class which I'm I'm not sure why that is in a different spot so let's bring it I'm going to put it in here for now just to make sure it works but I think this would probably be better uh if I put this in our main uh CSS file because we're probably going to use this on every page uh so it'll be better there oops here we go actually that's weird I really thought there was supposed to be a Vine class and not just a rapper what is going on maybe um things got updated in a newer version of materialize and so I'm just I'm not familiar with that let me check the documentation then see what I'm missing yep wow okay so in the newest version of materialize they got rid of the need to so before the way it worked is you had to have a Vine wrapper on the container div and then inside I would have to actually put the class V align uh on this if I wanted it to be vertically aligned so I guess they've changed that and that that must have been pretty recently either that or I've just been adding that class for no reason for a long time and didn't realize that I didn't need it okay cool so that means we have everything we need right here and you can see uh basically you know here's what's here's what we're doing okay now there are some vendor prefixes so uh they're already there we don't have to worry about doing that which is good which is one of the benefits of just copying this over instead of trying to do it ourselves especially because we're not using any type of preprocessor uh ideally I I would have it set up so that I could use SAS and then also set up so that it would put all the um vendor pre prefixes on afterwards uh but I don't have that set up for this project um when I'm not using Create react app or webpack I do know how to set this up with gulp I have no idea how to set it up without using that uh so maybe one day I'll figure it out but not today so let's throw now I just need to figure out what where what I want to put this on so I needed to be all right see our container actually is not going to be a good thing to put it on because you can see the container is already completely filled up so what we what I want to put it on is H I may need to change change this a bit okay all right so I've added a Min height of 100 uh V8 so uh this is viewport height so that means it'll always be as tall as the the viewport um we'll see how this looks if I wanted to really get like a better vertical line I would also maybe do like a calc and then do 100 uh VH minus uh the uh top of this uh so cuz like right now you can see like it actually goes down even below so for now this will just give us a better idea if our V Line will work um but it won't be exactly vertically aligned in the middle uh the reason I did Min height instead of just height uh is that if I set height to 100 uh then what could potentially happen is that you know if our screen was like this let's say we were on a phone in landscape uh mode uh then it might cut things off so we didn't we don't want that so we want it to be at least uh 100 of the viewport height you know or more okay so let's add this on for a container we'll give it the Vine Vine wrapper and then we'll also give it a style of men Heights okay see what happens that's that's not good all right let's see what's going on okay we have our container it's the right height um okay we have display Flex good now let's see what's happening okay so our row is row column definitely not working all right let's try something different then so let's take the wrapper off of this one and let's save it all right so here's what we're going to do we're going to put it container let's put our height our Min height on our column and add the wrapper also to our column let's see if that works no again not working okay let's see what's going on okay display Flex that I mean that's that's what's messing things up is the display Flex so let's see what's going on here all right I'm going to look at the uh live chat in just a second to see if you all can know what's going on here well it's not bad I mean I we probably could have expected some issues if we're trying to mix and match uh CSS from two different Frameworks okay so it looks like right now it's our height yeah we're having issues with our height actually on the ey frame on this no that's not going to work actually minut okay let me check all right yeah it looks like I had a lot a lot of uh advice here so let me read through it for okay uh John Hansen said I figured out how to set up in web Pack 3 with SAS CSS loader okay said it figured so but it's giving errors can't resolve past the separate module s folded okay so uh John you'll have to let me know if you do get that working I'm very interested in that okay Patrick said the auto prefixer is on by default and create react app apps so I can delete the vendor prefixes uh I don't have to worry about it cool let's do that now so I don't forget I like that it it does it it makes everything look a lot more messy uh to have all these vendor prefixes in okay uh let me let me look where's our I think I have it on my other screen um I want to look at our original uh page since we have it working there and see what the difference is uh in the CSS oh actually no we don't we didn't vertical line that so I can't look to that let's look at materialize let's see what's going on h all right trying to see what's difference so here's our container okay both display block oh it's not a height problem is that all is that all we needed H I got rid of too much in my display dang it okay all right there we go okay so the problem was just I I had wrongly assumed that it was a height issue uh but it was actually a width issue so uh I looked and saw Zero for what I just assumed was the uh the width cuz I don't know about you but almost every time something like that happens it's usually the height that gets set to zero uh I don't know that I've ever had a a width set to zero when I actually had a height so anyway this works now we just have to make sure we set the width to of the video container to 100% it was 100% oh no that's the if frame so the actual container needs to be with 100% oops okay so this is with 100% And that was it I think that's all that was that that we needed to change okay now as you can see that doesn't look like it's vertically align Okay the reason being right we have we have this container div that is 100% height but it's getting pushed down by the height of of this so let's figure out how tall this is this is kind of where I wish I had uh SAS because I could put some variables and make it a little bit more automatic so that if this height changed I could have it automatically change here but we'll just have to remember to change this if we need to uh let's see height oh that's terrible how is my height that um let me see that's what I want I really want it to be I wanted it to be like a round nice round number but uh it's close enough to 64 that I think if we do uh let's see Min height is 100 VH how do we do um does Cal work if I set it inside of here I never tried it let's try it Cal minus 64 pixels okay so if you're not familiar with Cal in CSS uh it's let you do calculations so I want Min height to be the 100% of the viewport height minus 64 pixels which is the about the height of our our nav our top nav so let's see if that works cool okay so this is actually closer to being really vertically aligned does that look right to you is that vertically I wonder why I have that little bit down here oh let's check it out yeah that looks about right for being vertically aligned um cool okay what do you all think does it look good to have this vertically aligned would it have been better to have it a little bit closer to the top um I'm okay with this let's see actually we never put in the uh the text so let's bring this text over as well whoa oh because I'm using Flex all right that makes sense all right don't like that that messes up our vertical alignment so let's think what we could do about it uh we could put would this text make more sense being below the video this almost seems like what I would rather have happened is for someone to watch the video and then if they still can't understand what to do then they can contact me I actually I can't even remember the last time somebody contacted me about this so no one seems to have problems uh at least they don't call me about them um so maybe it would be better to put this below anyway let's see what do you all think and my uh pomodora timer stopped right now so now's a good time to uh get your opinion on this and check the live chat again okay cool it seems like uh we're in agreement then um it would make more sense below Okay cool so sometimes it just it just takes like uh I mean I hate to have like really long periods of silence in a video but I just had to sit back and look at it for a minute um just kind of think about it so um sometimes that's at least for me sometimes it's really helpful to just stop and just stare at it for a while uh or even things sometimes I just close my eyes and just think about what it what it would look like if I move things around and um that that actually really helps me at time times I can work out a lot of issues in terms of layout and design you know just visualizing it and not have to spend a lot of time trying to change the code to make it look like that and uh I'm not really any good with um like sketch or photoshop or you know any of the stuff people use so that that's why if you haven't noticed already like I pretty much do my design in CSS like right there because I'm I'm faster with CSS than I am with Sketch or a similar program okay so I've scrolled up a bit back to where I left off at oh man John Hansen said I hope your wrist heals fast it can take up to a year depending on how badly you wrench the tissue wow um uh thank you uh for for that I'm really glad it or I'm really I really hope that it doesn't take a year uh because it's like like I use my wrist for work constantly right it's not like I'm having any weight on it but I'm just moving it a lot and then lately uh at home so my my youngest is 9 months old and she wants me to hold her constantly so if if I'm home she gets so mad if I'm not holding her so so it makes it hard I'm either holding her with my right hand which hurts or I have her in my left my left arm and then I have to do stuff with my right hand so uh I really hope it heals fast okay I'm just I'm going through trying to find the questions right now uh through the live chat uh Doon says you should do something uh like talk with Jesse sometimes so cool would that would that be more basically like an entire show that's like a question and answer session then I've thought about doing that before I'll have to ask um on my own channel I can do whatever I want so um I may I may do that uh and then I'll have to see I'll have to ask Quincy if um he'd be all right with doing that on free code Camp because I don't want to do anything uh on my own for free code camp like change up the format without asking him because um he you know he invited me to do this uh I don't really want to take advantage of that but maybe it would be cool the only thing about doing things on my own channel is um I always get less people uh because they're just way less people subscribe to my channel so the alert goes out to a lot less people like my own channel has a few hundred I might be up to like 500 now I'm not really sure uh and free code Camp is up over like 180,000 subscribers so uh but that is cool maybe I'll do that uh at some point uh mobin I just saw your my Franciscan thing uh John Hansen says I was curious why the absolute top positioning on the top four in input fields are different than the rest let me go to that quickly um basically these are um single line text inputs and these are multiline uh so this is just set a bit higher to indicate that it's multiline okay I'm going to scroll down uh my timer's up I'm going to scroll down a little bit more actually let me check the time wow it's okay I'm just going to go uh right to stick with the live chat and get to the questions because there's still a lot that I haven't gone through yet and um uh we're coming up we've already been going for about about an hour and 40 minutes so I'd like to keep it 2 hours or under if possible so basically we've gotten this page I kind of thought we'd get further than this page but we had some uh some issues that like obviously like this wasn't showing up and I didn't get right away why so basically what I'll probably end up doing is moving this underneath and then sorting out the vertical alignment so that it looks okay okay uh I think I'll like how it looks better if I can find a way to include the height of this and this into the vertical alignment uh so that this will end up being pushed a bit higher which I think I would like anyway uh but it'll look fine because we'll have this at the bottom so like the hole will be vertically aligned even though this will appear to be slightly to the top uh I think that'll look nice also I want to make these are lengths so I want to add a link color so you could see right now right now they have this link color I'm not really sure if I want to keep this color because it can be hard to read so uh I might maybe make this color just a bit darker or go with a completely different color uh I do have some other colors I could work with that are in the color palette so um I'll see uh but other than that this page is pretty pretty much finished so this this may be our first completely finished page with all the proper content and everything uh so the other Pages we have we have the elements on the page we just never put in the right content okay so that's it for that let me let me commit this right now though uh that way if you're not familiar with Git You see how to commit also you'll see what's going on now when we do our our um our testing on Commit so let's check it out so we've added an entirely new uh CSS file here and then we've edited our tutorial. JS so I'm going to do get add and then just do dot because that'll add everything um you could name the specific file but it's faster if you know you want to add the file even if it's just one it's faster to put the dot uh now if we do a status we can see these are both ready to go ready to be committed so let's do get commit uh let's go all right so you can see oh we got an error component is defined but never used oops okay we didn't need component right so if you if you look here we made this a stateless functional component uh so we unlike our other Pages uh so like let's look at home JS right we were saying class home extends component so we needed to bring in component we don't need to do that anymore so we can actually get rid of this uh we do I need to keep react I believe uh so now we can just do this and that was you know we got the error which is great that we get the error erors now rather than you know getting the errors later on uh after afterwards we try to commit and uh so that's much much better so um let's check our status uh we see we've uh We've modified so I do want to do a get add and oops and also I didn't need to put the a in there so sorry about that we've already added so I can just do the M for the message if I would have left the a in that means we're adding and committing at the same time uh which would have been good since we we needed to add this anyway uh but I I don't want to confuse you all you don't really need the a uh if you're just adding a message okay so this first part is auto formatting and looks like that that worked now it's running the test there we go cool so uh you can see we have test set up right now for four uh of the components and it passed all of them it tells us how long it took uh you know all the all the tests that pass so really cool now I'm going to push that up to GitHub and now everything that we've done is avail aailable for you to check out uh in the repo uh on GitHub in the master Branch okay now to the live chat so if you're just sticking around for the coding uh that part of the stream is finished uh thanks so much for watching totally understand if if you need to move on and do something else uh if you'd like to stick around for the question and answer uh that's awesome too if you have a question please put it in the live chat now uh if you can't stick around or if you'd rather ask some something privately you can direct message me on Twitter or really on any other social media I've have people message me on Facebook um LinkedIn I'm trying to think uh where else I've had messages on Instagram so pretty much wherever social media you can find me on uh you can message me on there I've even had people email me I'm pretty flexible with that uh so I'm just going to go right through the live chat I'm about halfway through uh all the chat messages right now I'm going to keep going down through I'm going to try to get most of the questions um let me go for just a second I saw the head of my department just peaked in my door so I just want to make sure it's not any emergency thing be right back am d resp okay I'm back I I'll be just a minute okay I'll be right back it's okay I want to make sure it was an emergency it's not I okay I am back I'm really sorry for that that that was probably the longest uh Gap that I've ever had in my Stream So apologies for that especially if you're if you're watching this later on I guess you can fast forward through it uh or skip ahead uh so sorry it was I guess it wasn't exactly an emergency but um it was about the project that I'm on right now uh sort of so uh the live version of this is obviously live and people are submitting things uh through it uh frequently we get submissions every day uh but our um our project manager so we have someone who looks at all the submissions and then assigns them to people uh and she is in Iceland right now uh on vacation uh which is awesome but I now have to sort through all these submissions and assign them uh if they're um if they need need to be worked on immediately otherwise I can wait they can wait until uh um the person who normally does them gets back so anyway it was about a recent submission so I need to make sure that I double check that so I'm going to write a note for myself right now so that I remember to check that so let me get back to the live chat now I hope I didn't lose too many people it looks like we're a little bit below normal Al um but I'll still get uh I'm going to go a little bit past the time I wanted to so the stream's going to be a bit longer than two hours so I can get to the questions uh since I uh left you all hanging for for so long today has been like uh definitely an above average amount of um interruptions okay scrolling through okay it looks like there was a nice discussion here in the live chat about what to use for a back end uh so seems like everything was covered so I'm seeing node PHP python C Rubik uh so really cool great great discussion in there okay uh don Xavier asks how did you manage to get the zindex working with material UI cards I've tried CSS but material UI keeps on resetting the Styles tried to make it uh with Styles uh and same luck okay let's let's see let me check what's going on uh with our with our cards so we do have we have cards here on the homepage um I guess the I mean the zindex just worked I don't I didn't do anything with it Auto so I don't really know I'm not sure I'm not exactly sure since I I don't know what the uh what the issue is so uh don Xavier if you have a link like to a repo or even like a live demo I can check that out and try to give you a better answer uh but I have not had any ZN issues uh with uh the material UI cards okay now net is isn't part of the discussion uh bobic asks anyone know why he's using enr instead of node um I am I'm still using node uh in the background uh enro is just so that you all can uh can view the site so like my node thing is running on Local Host and then you all can check out the enro uh link okay it looks like that was that was already explained uh thanks uh who is that Kevin thanks Kevin for explaining that in the live chat for okay it looks like uh I could see you all caught the fact that I um had included component uh up here and I didn't really need it so thanks for catching I didn't see it in the live chat at the time but thanks for catching that and explaining uh that that shouldn't really have been in there it was just left over from copy and pasting Kevin said I guess in the precommit lint step it will be caught if he doesn't notice that is exactly what happened Kevin you're a smart man uh don Xavier there uh there's a discussion in the live chat about um small like size of CSS files and things like that uh don Xavier says simulate 3G and you'll see that smaller CSS is better uh yeah so actually I I recommend that sometimes I um I do all my development uh with 3G so um I wouldn't say oh like when I get to the point where I'm trying to speed things up on a site like I'm doing speed optimizations I try to just have it set on a 3G network all the time to really get a feeling for uh what's uh what users on a 3G network will um uh will experience also I just saw a video about this uh the latest version of Chrome I think Chrome 60 um will let you simulate not only a 3G network but also phones uh that don't really have a lot of processing power so I'm not really sure maybe it's just on Canary right now uh I didn't check to to use it yet so uh if Canary is like the latest uh version of Chrome I I don't have Canary open right now uh but that's also that also would be useful um you know because not only does the network connection matter but the processing power as well uh Kevin says in loading time optimization you need to take into account caching yeah that's true yeah so uh Kevin explains more if it's a big CSS file but it doesn't need to be downloaded again because it's cached uh and then you navigate around the site uh you actually might increase the performance instead of having a lot of small CSS files uh that need to be downloaded uh in aren't cash so yeah actually that's that is a really good point uh it might be interesting to I don't know if we'll have time with this project or not but it would be really cool when we get it to a more finished state to compare the load time s doing it either way so like we could have a branch where we've combined everything into one file and a branch where we have it all split up and then compare that might be really cool to do I hope I don't forget that idea uh because later on like before we before we launch it that would be the best time I think to test it out and then we would decide you know which one we should launch uh Jan thanks uh Jan noticed that I was trying to import the wrong CSS file a little while back so thanks you all always catch my mistakes before I do I should just as soon as something doesn't work I should just look at the live chat immediately I would save a lot of time like that let's see uh John Hansen says does everyone use Auto prefixer from post CSS or is that not needed nowadays um I I have used it on projects recently um I guess it depends on what you're working on so I think next and then create react app will Auto prefix for you um but if you're not using one of those then you would want to to use an auto prefixer so uh also it depends on what browsers uh you're you're targeting as well but really I think I mean if you're once you add it it doesn't really take any extra work and you might get you know compatibility with some extra browsers for it so I think it's definitely worth it sh oh okay Joseph thank you uh Joseph says don't forget to fix your props for the iframe frame border and allow full screen so let me let me do that right now that's definitely something that I would probably forget unless I do it right now so uh let me there should be I should be getting an error message for it so let me show you the error first okay um so we're getting these erors for a frame board and allow full screen so I think I mentioned this when I first pasted this over and I basically just said well I'm not sure if these will work we'll find out uh so I usually forget whether or not these work uh so basically to make these work we just have to camel case them whoops now that should get rid of the air yay all right cool iframe elements must have a unique title property that's interesting okay so our iframe needs to have a unique title I've never heard that so cool all right um all right these error messages always just show up locally um so cool all right uh Joseph again thanks for uh for letting me know about that oh okay uh a little while ago uh I was mentioning um using SAS with webpack uh and in regard to that John Hansen mentions setting up the the SAS loader with web pack is straightforward and works it's the post CSS Auto prefixer that's messing up uh webpack so um okay good to know oh Umberto says Chrome has issues with flex so I'll have to see says I just remember I was trying to use flex to position things on an admin dashboard in uh my home project and read about some issues with chrome and flex uh it looked good in IE and Edge but not on Chrome I think there was something about using inline Flex instead okay I'll have to keep that in mind uh at least for right now on Chrome you know this is doing it was doing what we wanted it to do so maybe there's some other stuff uh with uh Flex box that just doesn't work properly uh Brian says why is he only wishing he was using SAS and not actually using it yeah that's a great question uh I just never I didn't set it up uh so we just just kind of started working on this project and and didn't set it up so that's the only reason uh if I cuz I'm not really sure how to set it up so if if I have time and I guess I could set it up I just didn't think it would be that big of a deal um but at some point I guess it would be good for me to figure out how to get it working uh with create react app uh in this case and use it oh okay uh Patrick says uh like so we have a scroll bar bar showing right and we don't really need a scrollbar showing on this page so definitely want to figure out so we had like a little bit of extra space down here that was below the container so I'll have to get rid of that figure out why it's there get rid of that because for right now the scroll bar doesn't look bad but he rightly reminds me that on Linux and windows the scroll bar will show uh and not look that great so that's yeah that's definitely important to get that sorted out so thanks uh thanks for bringing that up Patrick oh okay Patrick says I'll set up SAS and make a pool request tonight if you want just let me know actually Patrick if if you would like to do that and you have time to do that that would be really awesome and helpful so definitely don't expect you to do it uh so don't feel don't feel at all obligated but I would be I would appreciate it a lot uh if if you did do that otherwise if you don't have time but you know you could send me a resource and then I could try to to research it a bit and do it as well um that would be cool too uh Brian says is it complex to set up with react meaning SAS I'm not a developer but I thought he was using gulp which is obviously pretty easy to set up with SAS with yeah so I'm not using gulp for this project but for previous projects I had SAS set up uh with gulp uh for this project it's web pack but since it's create react app all the webpack stuff is kind of Hidden Away um yes so I'm not really sure how it would work uh in this case oh cool Patrick says uh there are actually instructions in the readme for create react app to set up SAS so I feel like a noob now uh yeah I was actually looking through some of the create react app stuff today I wasn't looking it up for SAS I was looking up uh for how to do set up like a server.js file uh and handle some things with our our uh form inputs uh so so there is so much stuff in the documentation for create react app so from now on I'm going to go there first when I'm trying to do something because there are a lot of different use cases that are addressed there uh it's a really really good resource uh web says hi Jesse I I started your Series yesterday and I'm on day four now loving it awesome uh thanks for saying that I'm glad glad you're uh you're loving the uh Series so far uh and that's cool that uh you're able to join in live today oh cool John Hansen says I can put the text inside the same div container as the flex child uh that's yeah that's kind of what I was thinking is I'd have to put it um to avoid having them appear side by side I'd have to put them all in one container uh so let me let me do that right now let's do that now and see how it how it looks oops did I do that right yeah I did it right okay cool I need to I need to delete this okay cool much better is it just me or does it look like there's way too much space on this side now I can figure it out later oh yeah there we go that new div I made needed to have a width of 100% cool all right prob so uh thanks John uh that was definitely the way to go okay PA says are you creating a new branch and then merging it back in the master one nice it'd be nice to see how it's done actually I didn't for this one um I'll try tomorrow for tomorrow's stream I'll try to remember to do that and if I don't remember and you're if if you're able to join live uh Pablo remind me uh and then I'll definitely definitely do it I have done it in previous videos I don't think for this project though uh but I I don't want you have to go back and search through it's it's like a lot of hours of video content so I'll definitely uh do my best to remember to do it tomorrow uh mija says hi hey how's it going glad you can join us John B says take some notes you don't so you don't forget yeah that's true I should just write it down all right so I'm writing it down right now okay actually now that I think about it if you do look back at some previous videos I think it's actually in the video title that I'm like merging or something so if you want to see me merge something I'll still try to do it tomorrow uh I think I did put it in the title of the video so you could just scroll through the playlist the live coding with Jesse playlist and see uh See the title or Pro even search for it um I can't remember exact I'm pretty sure it had the word merge in it oh okay John B I just just clarified uh about the taking notes that this was in reference to caching a large CSS file over a bunch of small okay so let me it would be good to put that in in here so uh I I'll say four pomodora Cycles just to combine all the files uh cuz the actual testing should be pretty obvious right off the bat okay so now it's in there so I won't forget okay so John Hansen says webpack has a common chunk plugin that will build a common bundle file that will make two requests per page view the common files hold shared code it's cached and then dedicated files with specific code okay that's interesting so that may be like kind of Best of Both World scenario uh perhaps we may end up with three uh branches that we'll test uh Mike says hey hey just started this series last night I'm excited to catch up on the videos on your next five minute break could you just do a quick 10second click through on a couple of pages of this project yeah sure I'll do it uh also um so let me do I will do two things for you here uh one is I'm going to paste that link to enro so if you can open this link you can click through the site uh live right now if you want to and then just in case you can't go to that link uh I'll just click through a few pages uh so homepage just some cards uh logos this just is a demo card right now but it'll be very different later on just some cards these are cards uh these actually would normally have um uh it never works on local host for me but uh these would be images and then the card title below uh we got a Share story form our service request form and then the tutorial which we we worked on today which did I not save that yeah I didn't I just did it in Dev tools I'll have to save the uh with 100% on that container div that we added uh Patrick said so you are just going to email the request form I thought this was connecting to third party backend yeah it is so um what I currently have it doing is an email goes out with the data uh the data gets saved in a Google sheet and then it also gets sent to our um project management system uh we're using Reich uh and they have an API so I can send the data and files uh it's a little bit odd so I I can't send everything all at once what I have to do is create a new project and I can send data with that like all the text input data and the checkbox data then I get in return it gives me the ID of that project and then I can take the ID and then send the files but I need that ID first so I actually have to make two trips uh to get everything over there um but anyway yeah that's what's going to happen so I will it hopefully I'll be able to continue doing all those things although I'm open to setting up some sort of lightweight database and just not using the Google sheet uh so replacing the Google sheet with some sort of database uh but that would be a big learning experience for me because I've never set that up before oh cool Mike said uh that that link the enro link did work awesome okay yeah I'll leave the enro uh server running until I leave today so it'll be running for a little while after the video uh and then that way if anybody wants to keep messing around with it uh then uh it'll be there cool Patrick said I'm looking forward to seeing you hook all that up yeah I'm looking forward to doing it as well hopefully I can make it all work um I mean I made it all work with using jQuery and uh before so hopefully I can make it work again uh of course that was all client side now I want to do it server side all right I've gotten to the end of the uh the live chat so today was really long stream uh but that was at least partly due to me being interrupted uh which is cool it happens um we did we got some stuff done got a lot of questions answered so uh pretty good stream and um I'll be back I think my schedule is free in the afternoon tomorrow so I should be able to stream at the same time 2 p.m. Eastern uh so my normal time and uh we'll see maybe maybe we'll start working on some of that server side stuff uh to handle the form data uh tomorrow but thanks so much for all your help uh there really um as always you all make uh whatever I'm working on you know so much better uh than it would otherwise be with just me working on it uh thank you for um for the pool requests uh so Patrick and Kevin had pool requests uh over the last 24 hours uh thanks so much for for that and um yeah I'll see you all tomorrow have a great day
