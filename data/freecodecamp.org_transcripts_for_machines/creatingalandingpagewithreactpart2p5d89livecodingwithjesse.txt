hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're getting you want to try to finish that page that we started on Monday and before we get started I just want to take a minute maybe not even a minute to explain what the stream is about because there is a little bit of confusion that came out in the comments section of Monday's video so I think I've I've gotten so used to streaming and we have a lot of regulars that I've kind of stopped explaining what the stream is about him I do it occasionally but not regularly so especially for everyone who's new in this stream it's it's not exactly a tutorial although I do my best to explain things what the stream is all about is just giving you a glimpse into what I do as a frontend developer at a university so I what I show you is entirely unrehearsed it's what I need to do for that day at my job so we jump in we're in the middle of a project it's just wherever I leave off at and we work how I would normally work so that means I won't start from scratch or take some take you through step by step if we can copy and paste from somewhere else to save time we'll do that so if you want some more explanation if I don't give a good enough explanation you feel free to ask in the live chat but you know sometimes I I won't go step by step that you you couldn't necessarily just follow one stream and really be able to go and do it on your own without maybe checking out the code yourself and running through it so if you're still interested in watching after that then we're gonna get started and I I really think there are a lot of great prerecorded tutorials out there and that's part of the reason why one to do my streams like this I wanted to do live and I want to do just how I normally do things because that's I that's what's unique about what I'm doing I I really appreciate all the tutorials but one thing that happened to me when I was getting started is that it led me to think that I wasn't quite as good which I'm sure I wasn't as good as those people but it's unrealistic and it was unrealistic for me to base how good I was on pre recorded edited tutorials right so I just want to let everybody see I'm a real developer right so and basically I get paid to write code and build things so I mess up all the time I'm not perfect I misspell things I caused bugs I fix bugs right so that's the value of this stream now on top of that it's really collaborative so you all give me ideas and encode and we try things and sometimes it doesn't work but you know you all get to see that and go through that with me so anyway I'm gonna try my best to go through a shorter explanation than I just did right now at the beginning of every stream so that way new people are watching especially people maybe you just watch the prerecorded video and they just stick around for the first minute you know they won't be confused okay where's my berries okay so this is what I was working on just to bring you up to date on the changes since Monday I end up not streaming Tuesday or Wednesday because I was working from home last time I tried to see him from home the quality was was bad so I had to do some boring stuff anyway that wouldn't have made for good stream so I figured I'll just wait and I'll stream from the office today so here's what I've done my boss went through this menu so let me show you visually what this looks like I don't need this right now I don't need this right now don't sit okay so we have this menu oops that's not it there we go all right so we have this menu here and so all the information for this menu and all the dropdowns and everything are contained in in this file this drawer menu j/s right and we can see it's just a collection of constants that we export and each constant is an array so it's an array of objects so we can loop through all those objects you know use map filter you know whatever you want on these objects now each one of these constants corresponds to a section in the menu right so my boss went through all those and significantly decreased the number of items in there and even changed some items so some items are completely different they weren't in there before so what I've done is I've gone through and I made a copy of the original menu just in case my boss changes his mind or we needed to add things back in so made a copy of it and that's drum and you long Jaso you'll notice an extra file there in the data folder if you want to see the code for yourself the link is in the description so please feel free to check that out use it for whatever you want to for whatever you want to use it for so this is the the new menu stuff and what I've done is at least got the text in there so some of these items here at the bottom don't have the correct links yet I need to fill that out but at least we can see and my boss can see what the new menu looks like and yeah much much shorter so if you can believe it it's much shorter so that's what I've been working on mostly I've done a lot of other stuff with things on the WordPress side of side of it cleaning up data and generally getting routes to work with that server j/s file so that's what's new but today we're gonna go back to actually yeah I don't want to close that out because I'm gonna go back to this one I'm done so let's find those pages we were working on so we were working on this admissions j/s and you can see we for right now we're just kind of really sloppily hard coding a lot of stuff just to see how it looks on the page before we break it out into components so Phoenix you're on time Phoenix was worried about in the intellect only on time I'm just kind of explaining what I've done the last few days in this project so let's let's do a few things one I'm gonna start up and grukk so and rock will allow you all to run what I'm running locally on your computer in your browser and you'll be able to inspect it my dev tools just like you were running it locally okay so I just pasted that link into the live chat so if you click it and it doesn't take you the right place then try to copy and paste that occasionally there's an issue in with links in the chat window all right so that's ready you don't have to be on the same page with me either you can click around try things out if you see something really crazy happening let me know about it you can let me know in the stream or even better create an issue on github with a screenshot or something so we have that ready and we need to actually go to that page as we can see what we're doing so I think it's admissions great so here's what we have so far we have this here a section which will most likely have a different image in the background this is the same image we're using on the home page we cut down the size of the hero section just to see how it looks we may or may not change the size and we'll probably change this text these are just some kind of placeholders so these will end up being like testimonials from from former students and it'll be about the same structure but we do want to try to keep these all the same height so that's one thing that will change and then we have this section here that I had thought maybe we could list out all the majors that we offer if we break out in categories and it would look ok so what we've done is just very basically laid it out just to get some visual like is this even doable will this look terrible or not so I think what we can do for this section is actually make this a component so that we can start to put in some data we can we could actually pull in we may be able to pull in a list of all the majors I don't know we probably will have to make that list though because I don't think it exists right now in in a format in WordPress that we can work with yeah so well I'll have to think about that but that's one thing we may get to today and then we need all this is just kind of run over from what we copy and pasted before so this is all gonna change we just left it around for easy copy and paste all right but let's let's get rid of some of this then because now we've gotten down to the point where I think we should start changing that up okay and I see some some action there in the live chat so I have this timer that I'm about to start when this 25 minutes is up I'm gonna go back to the live chat and I'm gonna answer all your questions I'm gonna read your comments and then we'll go back to code and then we'll take a break so I'll try to go back and forth so if you did ask something just hold on I will get to it if you can't stick around for me to answer it you can always watch the recording later on and I'll try to answer it you know when I get time later on in the stream let's see I did see one question is emselves how long do these streams last at least an hour usually sometimes more okay all right yeah so let's get rid of I just want to get rid of all this stuff and just have it have it clear cuz this components huge and I just don't really want to scroll around any more with it so I'm gonna start here I guess at this masonry yeah it was started at this masonry component it did make it easier to leave it all in because now that we did that we're gonna have to take some of this stuff up or else we're gonna get errors there we go okay we may end up adding some of that stuff back in alright there we are okay and I did have let me bring up my my really rudimentary sketch so that we all can see it again I need to refresh my memory on what I sketched out for how this page is gonna look okay so let's okay okay let's try to zoom in here we are okay so we have basically these sections plus our testimonials that I kind of added in after the fact we don't need the online this was a sketch for a slightly different page but it's similar enough that we just kind of reusing this sketch so I guess what we could do now is maybe include how to apply section here I think if we if we put in a how to apply section and maybe leave in a section for let's get rid of these so let's let's leave maybe this section just as an example of you know what what could be done maybe I'll ask my boss to fill in some content there and then we'll just we'll add in a section like we see here where we can have how to apply and we'll just throw kind of this stuff in there then we can I can let my boss see it I'll send him a link he can think up all right what content are we gonna put there and then we can go back to it and maybe adjust it so it's funny my boss asked me about it was a different page but it's the same concept he asked me earlier he said what what's his page gonna look like I want to know what it's gonna look like before I think about what content is gonna have and I said well I was waiting to see what content we're gonna have before I figure out what its gonna look like so we have a back and forth with that the design is very fluid alright let's get to it so let's take out yeah it'll be nice when we break this out into a component way that's scrolling let's break out our vision and we're just going to keep this tech section and this nib is just kind of hanging out here not doing anything huh I must have accidentally oops you know what maybe I think my editor automatically did that since there was no content in it so that makes sense now Dave so within this div let's just let's grab what we did here and then just modify it I think it'll be a lot easier to do it like that so let's take this entire grid container component and put it in here inside of this content container which actually we can we can just remove this div because we already added the content container class on to this grid item so that's nice just get rid of that and what we've done here we can remove a bit so if you remember on Monday we added in some empty grids so that we could get this kind of gap here so we'll take those out I don't need those anymore what did I grab did I grab too much is it at there it is okay so we'll take those out and we only need three sections so let's remove the rest yeah we are okay so I already like these sections how they're set up so on extra small screen it'll take up 12 out of 12 columns across and on a small screen and up it will take up 4 out of 12 columns so that means we can have three items side by side and I do want to remove all of this stuff so to get rid of that and then inside of there for now let's just create let's just create a header tag for now so we'll make these H threes and see how that looks and I'm just gonna add a text placeholder right there whoops three can't type there we are okay so this will end up being our steps to apply where why would it I have there there we go application transcripts and letters of recommendation okay an application transcripts that is a recommendation all right let's see how that looks all right obviously pretty plain let's it's add a little styling here we could probably use some styling here as well so let's add some styling to this grid container yeah so we have our Styles here and you know what I'm gonna we had decided a while back that we were gonna move our Styles to the bottom or we were at least going to try that the reason being we can then if we move our styles to the bottom when immediately when when someone comes especially someone new opens this this file they can immediately see what this components all about instead of seeing a long list of styles so I think it's just a nicer experience if you're new to the component so if we just move them down here they'll work in same same way they normally work but now they're not kind of blocking the view of the of the component especially when we get a lot of styles like we do here I think it just it looks a lot nicer to put them at the bottom okay so content container right now we we're giving it a top and bottom margin of zero but I think I want to increase that and give it just a little margin so let's just try 16 pixels for now it's one of little separation so we just have a little bit up probably want to go bigger than that that seems let's let's double it let's try 32 pixels okay a little better a little better some things I'm noticing here that definitely need to change this h3 stuff is just it's not the right font and it's way too small I don't know what's going on there I I don't understand why it's not the right font I thought we were automatically making everything use Roboto so let's check that out what we are bringing in some CSS maybe maybe not hmm I wonder if we didn't bring in any CSS files for this it looks like we didn't okay okay I'm just wondering if we can import an existing CSS file without messing up the Styles too much I'm gonna try it so let's check out our CSS files don't want to do it like this I I don't think I want to do it like this but we may have to because we are eventually we are gonna be bringing in my concern is this when we bring in content from WordPress sometimes we want that content to be styled like there could potentially be HTML tags that we're bringing in we can't directly style them like we're doing here right because we we won't even see those components we can't put a class on them so if we have this external stylesheet that could select things like an h3 that's inside of you know a div and it's all living in WordPress and not here that that's why we're using external style sheets as well as we develop our data more in WordPress we should need to rely less and less on them but I don't think we're ever going to be able to completely get rid of them so if you want to learn more about that maybe check out some of the previous streams as to why we're doing some things that maybe we wouldn't normally do if this was just straightup react and we had total control over all the the data coming in so let's find our Styles here I believe our page CSS and let's let's move this over here so we can see both let me know if if this font is too small as well so what I'm looking for okay Maine has the font family of Roboto do we even have Maine here I don't think we do let's check out check out another page where we're probably using this all right hjs you know maybe we we do have Maine happening somewhere yep okay all right I see so are kind of our wrapper around everything does have this main tag if if we put a link to our page CSS here and have it apply everywhere that may be the best way to go and then we'll try our best to make sure that this file stays really small I'm here we can get rid of some of these right now could definitely get rid of CV link okay all right yelling I'm thinking is maybe material I already has some way to do this and I just don't know so I'm gonna check this it's a few s theme there we are okay so I'm just checking to see where we're importing our theme from so we do have this fu s theme and the lib folder let's check that out okay so for now it's gonna be a lot easier for me to just do normal CSS it'll probably be a lot easier if y'all to understand as well but there is a way we could probably style a lot of this through here and this may end up being the best way to do it but for now since we kind of need to mess around with the Styles a lot and get them right I'm just gonna go with get old CSS and what we're gonna do is whoops some of this over here and then open up that page dot J s this is kind of our default and where we we're gonna take this we're gonna take it out of here and we're gonna link it here yeah so we're gonna like to here instead what we're gonna have to do is really be careful though and make sure that this isn't causing conflicts you know in our in our other pages so you'll see how it is we'll also need to make sure we remove this this link from all the files which actually can we do that let's see if we can do that right now mmmhmm and I won't let us search for that whole thing all right cool thought it was worth a shot so not right now but at some point someone I have to go through and remove all these so it'll try end up being me but some of these files will have that same link we don't want to load it twice right but now we're gonna be loading it globally so let's see if any changes have happened oh yeah admissions let's see what's happening uh okay the font is definitely different right our font is Roboto let's check out everything else okay everything else looks fine it looks the same I don't know if any of you notice any other differences but that this looks good to me all right great so that takes care of that and that now gives us a way to add styles globally all right so let's get to work on this and this I wonder if there's icons that we could use if anybody thinks of any material icons so icons that normally go with material design that would work for these three things application transcript and letters of recommendation let me know in the chat because that might be a good place to use icons so I mean obviously if we had a letter icon that would probably work there transcripts I don't know maybe maybe something like a page you know I don't know what to do for application but maybe you have some icons and then of course we're gonna add in links and I kind of think that this section might be better off in a different different place I'll leave it for now see you my boss Thanks let's grab these and fix these right because that's that needs to be done we need to break these out new component and this is I really want to see the actual text here all right so whenever we make a new component I think the best way to do it is just copy the most similar component that we already have and try to use that so let's close out some of these things we'll leave this up because we're like we might change this and all right we have a sample schedule component here let's just grab this and we use this as the basis for new components where we go in our components folder here and I'll just click in there and make this list which we call this I'm gonna call it header list dodge is because we are gonna have a header on our list so make sense 50 header list all right so let's paste this in here and this is going to be may end up being useful because we already have some some mock data here so we may be able to just use some of this to see if we can get this to work for now you'll see how it goes probably have to copy and paste it out so we can keep so we can keep and we need to get rid of for now let's get rid of pretty much everything yeah we get rid of everything and just start fresh and this is what we're gonna grab you might think like what's the point if you just deleted everything but like this stuff this stuff saves us from having to type it out again we're gonna name this after our component which is header header list and I messed up when I named this because normally we name components with capitals starting with a capital letter okay all right so it's complaining here about indentation it is complaining here about the way we're styling this which makes sense let's get rid of our tabs and let's get rid of our grid let's get rid of this UUID for now we can always bring it back if we need it and we're gonna keep some of this list styling and apply them here but we can also move in our styles from here which we move down here so what we need to bring in then is our our list our list header major list item there we are all down here oops yeah so we can I'm gonna keep these in here right now do I need to let's just take a mom because eventually we're not we're not gonna need these everything will be in this this other component so let's pull these put these in here for now you may be able to remove some of this as well because some of these were for slightly different use although it's a list with a header again yeah see it's oh we already had it oh okay I didn't realize we had just repeated those okay well and we can get rid of this we you know what we may be able to use the same component for our sample schedule and in here that would be nice trying to make components as reusable as possible is always good okay let's set the fiveminute time Rick this timer just went out and I'm gonna go talk to the live chat try to answer as many questions as I can in five minutes Harvin asked if this is related python no this is JavaScript is em asked what we're using for backend nodejs although we do have content management coming from WordPress so we have done a little PHP as well misssara says did you use sequel eyes or have you taken data from WordPress using graph QL we're using graph QL and also the WordPress REST API in some places Blake's here Michael's here hey how's it going as M says do you use some thirdparty software to generate your objects during development no I do not but that probably wouldn't be a bad idea Oh Sean says is this new livestream because I'm having this feeling that it has been aired before I don't know I don't know maybe maybe I definitely repeat myself a lot so me but I'm really here you'll need to hold up the date on my phone I will prove it look at this July 19th I guess it's not really focusing let's see michael says michael le mu says could you post the video after live chat yes the all the all the videos from the streams are posted pretty much immediately after the stream is over it may take a minute or so to process but they are available actually if you want to watch the video recording I recommend watching it on like two times speed I think it's it goes a lot faster you can still understand what I'm saying and it makes me look really good because I solve problems in half the time and I tight fast so that's how I watch me if I watch the stream Oh Sean says Jessi worked on a similarlooking site months before yep it's still the same site still working on it definitely the development for this site has gone on significantly longer than I had planned originally Sahil says I got my first job last week free code camp was really helpful Thanks well you're you're well on behalf of free code camp you're welcome I don't know how helpful I was individually maybe not at all but I really excited for you about your job please you know if you can you know come back to the stream and let us know like how your jobs go on it will cool stuff you're working on if you can Phoenix says hey Jesse our site has no favicon any plans on adding it yeah for sure every time I notice it I I'm doing something else so yeah I would definitely need that in there I thought I added one somewhere I just never linked it up so I think the file exists somewhere in all of this stuff as M says do you ever use alternative styling solutions when working with material you I like using styled components or some elements that don't need to reference the thing I haven't used styled components with material UI I've used them on on other projects but we we generally try to try out a variety of of things so I'm open to trying a lot of different things tell you the truth last time you solid components it was a little weird for me I don't want to make a judgment about style components until I've used them more and can get used to them but my first impression was I was a little thrown off I'm I could understand what's going on but it was it would seem weird to me the way everything was working so like I said I don't want to make a quick judgment unless I really give it a shot I feel like I haven't given it a fair chance yet so I'd like to work with them on a different project though I don't really want to try we're so close to the end here I don't want to start it now but maybe on a future project we can we can use it on mpg says sometimes a bit confuses me to customize some to your UI elements sometimes not working when we just controlled it by with style yet their material I it's it is a little tricky sometimes and things change with depending on what version you're using so overall I think it does help but definitely had to modify things Michael says you watch your own streams I'm sure I could not I'm not sure I could watch myself yeah it took a while to get used to but mainly I watched my own streams whenever I need to remember how I did something and then they're really helpful because I can a lot of times when I'm done with the project I don't go back and revisit it for a while and I forget things that I did and during the project I just remember things you know because you're doing it every day but after a month or so you forget so I need I go back in i rewatch how i did it it saves me a lot of time okay let's my timer went off so let me start another session will do at least one more Pomodoro session and and then maybe QA we'll see how this it's still kind of early so I might get in three Pomodoro sessions but we'll see how that is the really really long streams like the twohour long shrimps take a lot out of me so we'll see I don't know if I if I'm down for that rate right now where was that oh I just brought the styles over okay so we brought these styles over and now we need to let's let's pull some of this over actually because this already has the yeah this already has things in here okay yeah this is good we'll bring this in yeah okay that's gonna save us some time so what we need to do though it's it's actually it's gonna be a little tricky to try to use this component in both cases because of the way I set up this data well this I mean this is how it was coming out of WordPress so for now I'm gonna make this work for the admissions page and then maybe sometime later I'll try to make it work on you know for the sample schedule since this sample schedule is already working as intended I'm not gonna mess with it right now but that's like I think a potentially good refactor that'll save a few lines okay so what we want to do we're not worried about the year the hearts value okay we don't need this at all this handle change or the state value we also don't need you don't need this okay and we're gonna have our styles of fine of course let's change this up alright so we're gonna get the data in and we will have a header and then course they're not courses majors but let's try to make it as generic as possible so we can definitely say here that this is going to be the header and so the text for this let's let's call this data dot header and then let's let's call this let's go data items map and then instead of course we'll call this item okay I for our key I think we can just use item you know what let's see let's just use this will bring this back this is a little bit safer to use so in in react when your your mapping over something and adding you know multiple components to the page you need to have a unique key so sometimes you can just grab some of the data you're bringing in as long as it's unique but in this case it's some cases it's possible that what you pull in may not be unique and in that case we're going to use this this UUID to just give us unique values okay so it's just gonna make random numbers and put it in there so let's use that and then we don't have to worry about it I don't think it'll be a problem I think every one of these will be unique but just in case we're gonna use that okay so the data this data is actually gonna live for now over here in admissions so let's yeah let's put it down here so what we need for our data let's just call this we call it data let's give it a little better name here maybe majors yeah we'll call it majors oops and majors is going to be an array of objects so yeah it's gonna be array of objects each object is going to have a header and so let's just say for now business so you want business and then it's gonna have Magers I'm just gonna call this majors array because I don't want to get this confused so majors and then within here we're also gonna have name and we can have a major said the best way to do it not really right we don't need it to be like that do we let me think about that might be like more complicated than we even need it to be right now so I'm thinking like when we go to loop through this could we we just leave it as an array right you know could I just say accounting economics I'll go through and put some real ones in here but all right so then over here when we pull this in as data we would say data this entire thing is gonna have to be okay so when data comes in it'll come in as just one one section right so it'll be data dot header and that'll give us business okay so that makes sense then we'll go down here data dot items so maybe we should put items here yeah let's do that and then we can change this back to just say majors all right so that would have change that to items so we can keep it here so major start items equals mmm actually you know what we can make this I mean I've been thinking in my head a lot not talking a lot so let me let me tell you what I've been thinking okay so if we pull in the data like this it's it's gonna be a little bit difficult right because for a data source this name could be different for you know a variety of different things we're going for so that makes this kind of difficult you know to put in here but what if when we actually pass this data as props we pass it as two different props so the first prop is the header the second prop will be the items and then it doesn't matter what this is actually called because we'll pass it in as just an array so when we pass it in then we'll have it it'll just say items all right so items dot map okay we'll just give us item right and so it's a literally it would just be the value of of item okay so I think that's that's better right that seems better to me let me know what y'all think let me know if I'm even making sense at all right now let's see how we broke out props here wow that's a lot of props I just like to copy and paste as much as possible I always have to look at other components to remember where to put things like within what set of parentheses and things do it and that brackets do I need to put this so since that works for this one I'm guessing it'll work over here so let's let's break out some of the props we know we're gonna have to put in here so we're destructuring and then that way we won't have to keep typing this props but I also really like doing this because as soon as you go to a component you know automatically what props are being passed in you don't have to search through through this component okay so we're gonna have the header as a prop right and we'll have the items as a prop okay so now you see the little squiggly lines disappeared from here we no longer need data right because header is just gonna come through as a string right so we can just put header in there all right cool that might be it so we need anything else for now I don't I don't think we do let's get rid of course data as well because we don't need that anymore that was shortened up this component significantly great okay all right not bad a nice small component great okay so let's let's just copy and paste this a few times just to give us some sample data and we'll just change this up I don't even know let's just do two three I don't want to take time to find actual courses right now just put that in there so we know which is which so now cost majors and let's go up here and we're going to add let's see this is gonna be kind of tricky since we have those spacers right hmm this is gonna be difficult what was I thinking all right this can still work it's just gonna be slightly more complicated than I wanted it to be all right well first things first let's just give this a shot all right okay so we're gonna say we're gonna add our curly brackets which takes us into JavaScript right so now we can write JavaScript inside these curly brackets we're gonna say major it wasn't majors yeah majors dot map right we can map over it because majors is an array and we're gonna say we call this list yeah list sounds good so let's say list you would do an arrow function here and then let's pull this in right so we're gonna loop over this and we should be able to say we probably need a key here since this is we're looping over this so the key here could be list dot header right that should be unique and then now inside of here we can do when we call this one header list header list and we need to pass it the props of header header is going to equal list dot header and items is gonna equal list dot items and we need to bring in header list right because we didn't actually import it and what's this import major from major that's weird all right but we're not using it so let's take it out so let's import we're gonna import header header list from and then we're gonna tell it where this lives it lives in the components folder and it's called oh it already did it no I forgot it okay so we had a question a few streams ago about how I should get some plugin to like automatically add these and evidently I do have it for whatever reason it just didn't work at that particular time but I guess I have it cuz it added editor list for me wonderful so this squiggly line is probably just indentation you have indentation okay so let's check this I think this should work yep should we see what we have classes is not defined did I leave classes in here where's classes not the fun header list 44 that's that's really weird maybe I just didn't save it from the last time yep that's it I didn't save it all right let's see what we have okay cool so write this this is now rendered these out awesome now here's the trick here's the tricky part we need we need these two to render but we need this spacing here or at least I want that spacing so there's there's a couple ways we could do this that I'm thinking right so I guess there's two thing two ways I'm thinking about doing this one way is we have two times that we map through the first time we map through and we get the index and we only get the first three items and then on our other map it's for that index row and we only get two items and we map through inside of here like you know inside of this empty grid component right and one yeah so basically right here where we have these which we can definitely remove these for now all right and that's definitely a possibility the other thing that we could do is have basically go through each grid item so we would leave we wouldn't map over this the grid itself so where we have this majors map so where we have this grid here let me make this a little bit easier to read that was gonna automatically format this for me I guess it's not one sir why is it not going soon all right anyway you potentially we could say we could do a filter and just say if the header like the name of the header equals this then render that now that I think about it two Maps is better than five right there we go I was waiting for it to do that okay yeah so let's let's add in some some more data here still just some test data to do we get this worked out all right so now we have enough data where let's see it rendered all these out right but that's not that's not what we want it's not what we want it to look like so we'll do now is say that list and then we want I as well let's put these in parentheses so what this I should be then is the index right of this this map so our index like zero one two right so we're gonna do this index and then what we're gonna say is we're gonna have to make some some brackets right because we need to do some JavaScript the parens the parentheses they auto return so we don't want to return just yet what we want to say is if I is less than three and Oh actually can we do this as less than three wonder if we can oops it's that's not gonna work shoot okay this is to say if I is less than isn't 3c this will work then whatever turn grade what am I doing wrong Oh yeah there we go what I do here I don't need that huh right in our system now I do need this one I need one two three baby and then I need another one too many going on here alright this is double check I need this outer bracket the outer part needs to be a bracket okay so the outer bracket is here then I need parenthesis then I need a bracket right to cover this one then I need another bracket to cover this one then I need for rent for that this looks terrible what am i doing all right let's see if it works mmm nope what did I do if I is greater than whoops less than there we are Thank You Kenny that actually works all right cool so that works now we just copy this paste it here and just say if I is greater than or equal to three there we go cool all right so that works it's I kind of wish I wouldn't have to do like the exact same maps twice I mean maybe we could if it were more than twice I think about maybe like just extracting this part out I don't want to put the grid in the component because it would be not as reusable right so this is it for now but that works so basically this works and we we cut down a lot right remember yet all this hardcoded stuff and now if we could get data like this in this format from wordpress we don't have to mess with changing this list someone who is in charge of that area could just edit that content so we add a major they can edit themselves so if you take one away whatever they can handle that and then I don't have to manually go back so that's that's always a good thing and let's see okay so that's my timer but I mean we successfully extracted this out into its own component potentially could reuse this as well which is nice and you know we've we've got it to where we're displaying it here so definitely not it's not finished right we're missing lots of content but this may be enough to show boss and say okay given this layout what do you want in these areas right do you you know how do you want to arrange it so yeah generally I tried not to mess around with the like the content of like what's the what's the text gonna be and things like that I try not to mess with that too much I'd rather just handle kind of the code behind that okay well that is my timer so I think now now is actually it was good timing that that went off so I'm not gonna do another Pomodoro session I'm just gonna end with with that with the successful completion of a a new component so always it especially for those of you who are new always remember you know we we do things here we get them done we get them working fully understanding that we could always refactor we could always make improvements right so if this was a tutorial and I was trying to teach you like this is the absolute best way to do it yeah we would do that but it's not it's a real project and we have to say okay will it be the benefit of me refactoring is that benefit great enough to take the time to do it you know given our deadlines so unfortunately the answer to that question most of the time is no it doesn't really make sense if I can remove four lines of code from this component like nobody's gonna care really you know even developers who look at this later on aren't gonna freak about four lines I mean unless I don't know maybe they're really sensitive about that so that's kind of what we're weighing so I would pretty much everything I do I'd always love to have more time to make it better right but we can't always do that so anyway just wanted to give that disclaimer in case some of you're probably thinking like this dude what is this dude doing I would never do it like that which is totally legit or or some of you may be thinking oh okay that's exactly how you should do it no that's just how we are doing it so it works for what we needed to work for right now okay so right now we don't need it to be perfect or even optimal right okay let's commit this so let's check our status see what we've changed like immune admission for this okay so we've actually done a lot so we're gonna do multiple commits here all right so yeah I'm gonna do this because I don't think I've really done multiple commits on the stream I usually just just like add everything so if you've done a lot and then you want to break it out in different commits you can do a get add and then just add a particular file so let's add pages dot page file and let's also we just put a space we could add another one let's add our Pages document dot a s file and did we change our page dot CSS I don't think we changed it what did we change interesting I don't remember changing anything but I guess we'll just add that as well oops static styles page dot CSS okay so those ones are all going to have to do to us moving that page dot CSS up to be global styles so now we're gonna do our yarn CM so yarn cm for us here is a just a little helper to help us write nice commit messages so if you don't have that installed to imagine most people don't then you can just do git commit and do M a M and then you can put your commit message right so we'll just say it's a new features so say make page dot CSS a global local CSS file okay as far as I know there are no breaking changes or conflicts with styles so what should happen and so there shouldn't be conflicts is anything that's paid specific would be loaded below so it shouldn't it should override right the cascading part of cascading style sheets CSS should take effect and so it's we should be able to still keep the styles the thing that would be weird is you know if Paige was never loaded and there's something that we don't have a ride so we'll just have to keep an eye out for stuff like that okay great so that's one commit out of the way let's do a git status just to make sure yep see now that those things are no longer there to be added now we can just add everything so we'll do a git add and then just put a space and a dot a period and that adds everything and we'll do our yarn CM again and new feature creates header list component no great thing changes you know it doesn't affect any issues so this will run through all stuff and once it's ready then we'll do a git push and everything we've done today will be available on the git repo our github repo link is in the description you get push awesome okay always recommend ending your day with a get push you should probably push frequently and beginning your day where they get pull keep yourself up to date and then keep the repository uptodate too if you have a lot of people working on the project you may want to push and pull multiple times throughout the day maybe if you're doing a Pomodoro's cycle like maybe at the beginning and end of every you know Pomodoro session try to push your pool you know whatever you said but it's it's a good practice to do and you can avoid some weird merge conflicts okay I'm gonna go back to the live chat and answer any remaining questions that I didn't get to last time if you have questions please put them in the chat I'm happy to answer questions about anything especially if it's code related it doesn't have to be necessarily related to this particular project though I see julio said hi hey how's it going okay so on mpg says based on your experiences which one would you recommend between bootstrap materialized semantics or other okay so it definitely depends if we're talking just a regular JavaScript site without react bootstrap is really nice if you want that material design style I would go with materialized CSS now if we're talking about a react site I actually like material you why I know there I there are people that I definitely respect as programmers that have a hard time with it but I like it I've gotten used to it I kinda I like the style I know my way around the documentation so for now I'm you know I'm happy with it there are other options but that would be my preference you know I have the most experience with that so I don't know that I'm the best person to make a recommendation since I haven't used a lot of different react UI frameworks in terms of regular JavaScript ones I have used bootstrap and I have used material as CSS I think they're both good and the main difference would be your preference on style because they definitely have different styles Nikki says every time he says let's I here go in my head Phoenix says that's too much pub G bro okay so I I haven't never played pub G or watching you stream so that's that's going over my head I'm assuming that that's they say that in in pub G Michaels Michael criolla says speaking and watching your old streams do you keep notes on what you do each stream so you can jump back quickly if you need to remind yourself I don't keep notes usually I can kind of remember when I did something and then based on the titles I can figure out where I was at but hmm so I threw the yarn it wouldn't be a bad idea to after I do the streams go back and change the titles and descriptions based on what we actually got done because I make the titles and descriptions beforehand and it doesn't always end up the way I think it's going to end up so that's just kind of a time thing like when I'm done with the stream I'm tired usually they have something else going on right after so I don't have a lot of time to edit and then I never go back to it I need to get an intern right that's what I need to get like a YouTube marketing intern or something and have them edit all my stuff we'll see maybe I'll talk to the the marketing department here at the University and see if we can do that on MPG sis usually for working with projects like this how much time or how long does it take to finish it for you this suspense really long I mean most of the reason why this is taking so long is because of the data if I were building this as a brand new site and I didn't have to pull over all kind of data it would have been done a while ago right I spent a long long time bringing over data you know editing the data trying to work with it so that's what's taking a long time so the stream is kind of misleading like the length of it that has been going on because when I'm not streaming most of what I do does not involve react at all or coding it out most of it involves either migrating data or editing that data so it's more like content management which kind of things I don't really enjoy doing that it's pretty boring but so I guess your question it's hard to answer the question but I mean I think what we've been working for this fraud on this project for like six months I mean I think we definitely could have been half the time if this was a new project where we didn't we didn't have all these restrictions and have to do all these workarounds based on what what data we had and things like that let's see Michael creo says it depends on the structure of the data you could do it as theta zero one okay so that must have been when I was figuring out what to what to do Michael creo says which page already has a list of majors we do have it should be there we go academics ug majors has this list of majors so I mean I guess we could pull out majors here from this list the problem is though like this list doesn't break them up into categories but I may be able to if I can decide on categories well actually I'll do see if my boss can decide on categories and then figure out what categories they could be in and then have my student workers enter that data in in in a format that would be better maybe I could maybe I could work let's see which pages Daniel says hola saludos Adeste Mexico so I know what all that is hey Daniel how's it going cannabis places why do you like this and then there's an expletive in there so Nicky says bracket para colorizer i know i keeps getting recommended to me a lot okay cannabis says this is insane spaghetti code yeah I mean a lot of it is so I mean it's kind of like I said earlier like at this point in it like it's pretty rough when we start to write it you know eventually as we keep going over it you know it gets refactored but you know the thing is you know we get it to a point where it works and you know we try to get the components as small as possible so yeah of course I mean I don't know if cannabis place is still around it seems like they were not happy with the stream I definitely welcome anybody to come a refactor stuff and usually if somebody has a good refactor and a nice pattern for how to do components I stick with it you know throughout the rest of the stream so the way we do things now is is really a it's a development of all your contributions right so little by little we improve and change the way we do things and that just kind of keeps building right so believe it or not this code is way better than you know when I first started streaming a year actually has been longer than a year ago now so definitely I'm under no illusions of thinking my code is perfect I can definitely improve so and I definitely appreciate all your suggestions on you know how to improve so Canada displays if you're still around right i i definitely welcome your your criticism of my my code as being spaghetti code but what would be like more helpful to everybody me and everybody watching is what specific things could we do to make it like what parts of it are the worst and what could we do to fix that right and that's generally like what this stream is kind of about is we all help each other and we get better so anyway so not sure if you're still here you're not commenting anymore but definitely would welcome a pool request was for just an open an issue on get up with some suggestions and if we can we'll definitely implement the suggestions let's see michael Creole says I know I'm a broken record but you're overthinking this perfect is the enemy of good yeah you're right i what i hope doesn't i hope that the idea doesn't just get thrown out completely since we spent i don't know what like 20 minutes on it 25 Julio says I recommend bracket pair colorizer to handle brackets frets these curly braces easily you know what let me get that now because people been suggesting it to me it seems like for months and I just never took the time to do it so if I do it now it'll get done C bracket pair colorizer reload yay that's really cool every to everyone who's been suggesting that to me thank you this is this is actually really cool when it's gonna be super helpful so I appreciate it I'm sorry it took me so long does anybody ever take this survey on visual studio code that keeps popping up it's behind that I always say remind me later I always want to take it but I never have time restart to fly latest update I'll restart after the stream ok Phoenix says hey Jessie I made a few designs for badges for free code camp Top Contributor meetup would you mind taking a look at them on here how can I share the link Phoenix do you do you have me on twitter you can DM me on Twitter yeah I'm pretty sure we have each other on Twitter DM it to me onto the link to me on Twitter right now and I'll I'll look it up that's actually really awesome I have a $50 credit still for sticker mule so I wonder if we could use any of the designs for some some stickers Julio says if you go to get tab and visual studio code you can see the changes oh no way I never use that tab that's awesome I'm gonna have to check that I just I never I'm not used to having that so I'm always like if I really wanted to see the changes I would just do like a lucky get div for something that's a that's super useful learning all kind of things today all right so Nikki says get commit em with so what I was saying earlier when we were doing get messages it says it only lets you put a title not the body if you want to do that as well just use git commit you'll have to deal with them if you haven't changed the default gate editor yet actually you're entirely right so you don't have to put the message in line when you're doing you get commits you could just type git commit it'll open up an editor for you depending on whatever you set is your your editor and then you can do a big long commit message if you want I just I never do that because it's faster to just do a short commit message and I almost never have to do a really long one but that can be helpful especially if you're doing a project where they have like a strict structure for how to do commit messages and they want it to have a lot of stuff Nino says I got a sign a new project and react I have to build the UI from the ground up what is your advice to start the right way Wow see you have to do the whole UI okay Nino if you're good with something like Photoshop or sketch or Adobe XD or whatever then I would do you start with your designs like that I'm assuming you don't have designs ready if you already have the designs then in business makes this a lot easier but if you don't have the designs definitely do it on their first get approval from whoever you know your client or your boss or whoever get approval of those designs first before you start developing it it'll save you a ton of time you all see how I do it a lot is that it goes back and forth with development I mean this it's just how things work around here like that's I would kind of like it if we could do design stages get things approved but to be honest with you it just seems like when we start a project it we have it's not even all thought out what people want right so it look people talk about scope creep when you have clients well like working here its scope creep is just a given like it's going to happen because there's gonna be like multiple people that find out the project's happening and join in and then now they have these ideas and so it's it's almost not worth it to even have these separate stages because so much is going to change ends up being kind of a waste of time so that's why our stuff is kind of very fluid right and I'm working I can't just say like hey this is the contract you agreed to this everything else is gonna cost more right there is no contract like this is my my everyday fulltime job so anyway depending on your situation this might work differently but just to get started do the designs first then go in what I usually do what I like to do that's kind of more comfortable for me is I just take like one component I start to build everything out in that one component and once the component gets big then I can start to kind of see naturally where you should break things out into different components like at that point then I start breaking things out that seems to be faster for me sometimes if you try to think like these are all the components I'll need beforehand you end up wasting some some work so anyway that's that's how I go about it I'm not sure if it's the best way probably not there's probably better ways to do it but that that seems when I can do it like that then things seem to go like pretty well hopefully that helps Nina Kath deesis I remember used to have a Trello board during strange what happened to it actually I still have a Trello board for this what I ended up doing is a lot of the code related stuff now is in github as issues and then I've been using Google keep which is small checklists to keep myself on track and then I've been using the Trello board to with my student workers to assign tasks to them so it's it's kind of easier they don't have to get a github account or anything like that or figure out how to use get up they I can show you much how I'm using the Trello board right now actually so like this is the kind of stuff I have a Trello now I'm like having them do things so add dates alright so I just had pilgrimages information broken up so there's separate pieces of data now so I can go in and create a page or component for that and then probably probably they'll be like a single page right so anyway so they just go in here and we can like talk back and forth it allows me to attach screenshots links like so now this one's done so I can move this over you see I have a backlog of things to test just make sure it was done right I'm very trusting of my student workers so anyway now like I need to add some more cards because these ones are pretty much finished as well so my student worker is probably waiting for me to give them more tasks now but anyway that's how I'm using that so I've just kind of separated things out like code related stuff is strictly everything's on github now and then content related stuff now is on Trello it's kind of easier with the stream so you all don't have to have another thing to remember to go to to check on things like so you don't have to worry about going to Trello like everything's in github for all the stuff that you all would care about which is is code stuff and then we are also using slack so I can also communicate with my team on slack as well slack and we have shared Word documents that my boss sending me wired documents and Excel spreadsheets with data on it too so there's quite a variety of methods being used here let's see Daniel says would you see my webpage and tell me what you think yeah sure Daniel if you have Twitter or whatever my link to my Twitter account is in the description if you don't have Twitter and you have some other social media thing then I guess you know what you can go to my youtube channel which is also linked there and then I have links to all my other social media so find me on one of those social media things and then direct message me because links don't really work in here so just message me like remind me that you're from the stream message me and I'll check it out and Phoenix I got your message and so I'm checking out your your badges right now let me bring them over we get when you see what you all think as well okay so here's Phoenix's designs for the lanyards oh very nice nice really cool all right how about that you know what I'm gonna copy and paste this link and anybody who's interested in giving some feedback on these you know you can go to this github issue and then you know comment here so I might have I don't know which one I like they're really cool but Phoenix is there anyway cuz I'm I'm just complete rubbish when it comes to graphic design stuff is there any way we could take some sort of design like this and make it into a circular button like okay so here's like the freaking let me switch up my screen so you'll be able to see okay so we've got this free code camp sticker here I think it'd be really cool to have a sticker like this but actually two things would be cool one if I de sticker like this that said live coding with Jesse on it that would be really fun but in regard to this if we had some sort of sticker like this that said something about a Top Contributor 2018 or or just talking tributary then we could reuse it I don't know but something like that that I can make this sticker which this is like I think this is a 2inch diameter sticker I don't know but that would be really cool and I think I only have a week left until my fifty dollar credit runs out so if we can if you need get me a design that I could use on a sticker mule I'll have like I don't know however many stickers I can get printed out for 50 bucks and then I can print those out that would be awesome so let me know because I don't I don't really know how long that would take you and if it would be a big deal if it's a big deal then you know don't worry about it but if it wouldn't take that much work to come up with something like that that would be really awesome so anyway I just I would have tried to do it myself but I like I'm not good with that stuff let's see michael creo says the categories should be the faculty department then majors i just couldn't remember the query to get that list categories could be Ethan says we're still here for you thank you Nicki says it's it's happening what's happening what's Nikki what's happening I don't remember what was happening at that part of the stream michael says okay so this is in regards to what cannabis well was saying was that the name cannabis plays was saying says well said I remember the beat down I got when I said the same thing when I started watching hopefully he learns like I did Michael I actually don't even remember he's saying the same thing I don't doubt that you did I just I don't know I sure I like honestly when I first started thinking about streaming like I assumed everybody would have that reaction to come in here and say like why would you watch this guy look at that spaghetti code like that is terrible so I'm always just like just so surprised that people don't say that so it happens so infrequently I'm just not really upset about it when it does happen so I don't play that like obviously I forgot when when you said it Michael Michael says he did it my work here is done did what oh wait are y'all talking about when I added the colored bracket thing Nietzsche says anyone here use emojis in their commit messages they're pretty dope I never have but that that would be really fun that sounds like something I should do more Oh Sean says you completed the nanodegree on react right yes I did the Udacity react nano degree so ocean I did do on my youtube channel which is linked in the description I did do a video review of that nano degree so if you're interested in what my thoughts are on it you can check that out but yeah I did do that I was in the like the first cohort so I imagine it's changed a bit there's probably some bugs they worked out since I've done it but so it was like the first cohort I think was last August I think it started so I I guess it's been almost a year now Nino says thank you welcome no problem Michael says you haven't taught your student workers how to use github that should be the first thing you should have taught them I know I should so when I have interns I try to teach them a lot more but with the student workers so when I first talked to them when I was kind of interviewing them I did let them know if you're interested in learning more coding stuff let me know like ask me any questions we can do that and no one really is interested so I don't know if they're interested and they're just like intimidated and don't want to ask me or or they just are here to get paid and or like I'm just gonna do well whatever the work is and that's it which is totally fine I mean I'm sure we've all had jobs like that we it's like I don't want to become a master at this thing I just want to do my working in my paycheck so yeah I don't know some I'm definitely open to teaching them more but if they're not interested then that's one thing I definitely learned from being a high school teacher it was really really hard teach someone something if they do not want to learn yes so I kind of leave it up to students like if they want to know more I give them as much advice as probably more than they want to hear but if they're not interested then I don't I don't push it okay I see Daniel he's putting his sight and here Daniel I'm opening up the sight on my other screen and okay cool let me pull this over actually let me know Daniel is it cool if I pull the your website over on the screen so everybody can see it or you just want me to look at it let me know in the chat see okay so when everyone was excited that I finally did something it was the black bracket payer colorizer okay and you realized you all were that excited about it that I finally did it then hey john Anson's here how's it going no John we did not join us if we had any exclamation for it important overrides today we didn't we didn't have to override anything daniel says if your screen is 4k it may not scale well I think the screen that everybody sees is only 2k okay so Daniels fine with me showing it so this will probably be the last thing we do on the stream before I end it I'm gonna bring over Daniels site okay it's trying to get this at a more reasonable ratio here okay so Daniel is there anything in particular that you you want me to look at with the site or just like kind of general general stuff and anybody in the live chat like feel free to you know check it out as well I guess I could let me copy and paste this link Oh Oh shun says is it my connection or Jessie's webcam oh no what's uh what's happening let me know something's up with the stream it looks okay on my end but maybe maybe something's happening I don't I don't see it let's see danielsan change pages all right John says no one great hope your day is great yes it's not bad not bad so far okay you see the next G query that's cool Daniel what are you using for the for this let's see what happened you have some sort of plugin for like this layout or is this all just like kind of custommade I mean so I meant translate this if you don't mind chapter it approaches opening crashing interesting okay okay cool CSS grid awesome daniel says put sombreros in the search some be sombreros that's pretty cool okay so no framework just shake we're put seda in the search cool let me see sowhat's so HT chapters it's the the site's really fast like the search just immediately pops up John says Nikki has got me running on the edge of Gatsby betaversion to learning a lot getting many hints from Nikki's blog awesome he says click some maybe click something on you ok cool it's really cool I mean I I would just say like styling was there's just some some stuff that needs so like there's some overlap stuff going on right here here so I mean the the little details it's it like yeah so I would maybe make sure that the the areas of overlap aren't aren't happening but in terms of functionality and speed its it's very impressive Nikki says how do you translate the toggle translate on a page if it doesn't just show up up and in this corner there's like this little translate page icon so I just click on that if that doesn't show up I'm not sure how but that's right I just I click there okay all right I think we're gonna wrap things up now so anyway yeah Daniel if if you have any more questions or anything else you want me to look at for there like I said find me on social media or and that goes for anybody if anybody wants to ask me a question or anything check out my youtube channel and all my social media stuff is linked from there and um you know my DMS are open everywhere I will I'm not gonna stream tomorrow so I'm gonna have surgery on my wrist tomorrow and so I'll definitely not stream tomorrow I don't know how long my recovery is gonna be and if I'm gonna be able to type so it may hopefully I can stream next week but if I can't stream next week then that's probably why so probably
