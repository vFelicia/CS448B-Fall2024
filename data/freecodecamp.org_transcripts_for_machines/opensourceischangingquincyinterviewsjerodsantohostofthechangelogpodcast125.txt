there's no such thing as lossless compression with human communication put that on a clip Quincy you should clip that put that out there all right we don't have clips for Clips sake we just want to give you a taste and say oh that's interesting and then come listen to the full conversation so welcome back to the freeco camp podcast I'm Quincy Larsson teacher and founder of freeco camp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by Jared Santo he's a software engineer and host of Chang log podcast in the Chang log News podcast which is newer and which I listen to pretty much every week uh so Jared welcome excited to be here Quincy thanks for having me yeah man I'm excited to have you back on so for any of you hardcore freeo Camp podcast listeners you may remember that hey didn't fre C Camp do a comprehensive interview with Jared and with his his uh with Adam his partner in crime over there at change log uh and yes I did uh it's like a really comprehensive ensive interview uh episode number 85 I believe so be sure to check that and that contains a lot of Jared's origin story as a developer so we're we're going to be able to kind of jump right past a lot of that and jump into like what's new because that was four years ago uh but before we do just a very quick highlevel explanation Jared of uh who you are what you do and why people like me are listening to you every single week and uh real quick for anybody watching the video for anybody watching the video it may look super dark it's just like storming like crazy outside I haven't heard any T tornado sirens or anything like that uh so hopefully Mother Nature cooperates and we can just uh record this without issue but I just want to let you know that I'm okay I'm not like turning into like a vampire or anything like it's just super dark even though it's like 900 am outside yeah Jared all right well thanks for having me always awesome I do recall that deep dive we did I think we all got together in the same room even yes and spent a day at Adam's house you interviewed us for multiple hours we interviewed you for multiple hours and we put out simultaneous shows because it was our 10th anniversary it was your fifth anniversary at free code camp and that was really exciting the nice thing about getting the origin story out of the way you know a lot of times the second superhero movie is better because you don't have to do all that where how did he get here kind of stuff so we can skip past all that it has been 5 years since we last talked I think we're doing mostly the same things that we were doing when you spoke to us last time and hey so are you just like you know a different day still toiling away at trying to change the world one developer at a time we kind of both are doing the same thing different angles right on at that goal and uh still a huge fan of Freo camp and the work that youall are doing I've for a long time had a stock answer for anybody who comes to me and says how do I break into software development and I used to have a hard time answering that because there's a lot of a lot of yah buts and if this and that but now I'm just like freecodecamp.org see you later if you can get through that you'll be well on your way so I appreciate you providing me such an easy answer for folks who are looking to get started but yeah we just been podcasting man we're trying to put out good shows host great conversations keep people up to date with what's going on in the industry and uh trying to make a living doing it yeah well I am really excited to hear a little bit more about how you do that with Adam because you're based in near Omaha Nebraska in the The Once independent city of benington that has since been kind of like aized or what I don't know what verb to use but basically like cities creep outward this happens all the time in Texas and it sounds like Omaha kind of came over and kind of the amoeba that is uh Omaha kind of like swallowed up Bennington right so you're you're now kind of part of that metro area right yeah so Omaha hits up against the Missouri River on the East and so you know we're done growing that way you just can't grow across the river that's a whole different state over there and so Omaha just grows West and then North and a little bit South and it just kind of eats small towns until it becomes a metropolitan area eventually it'll con connect with linkoln which is actually the state capital of Nebraska it's about 45 minute drive on the interstate to Iowa or to Lincoln but eventually I think these two cities will become one giant City and we'll we'll start to look like we have some population numbers but we're still pretty small I mean Midwest so we're not talking New York style Orla well uh you are a resident of that you've lived out there as long as I've known you and something that's really cool about you that a lot of people may not realize you've got six freaking kids I that's a lot that is a lot it doesn't feel like a lot to me anymore even though I know that relative to most families that's a large family um yeah my youngest is five and my oldest just turned 16 so she's out on the uh on the streets now which is a whole different experience as a dad you know Steve around know that job's quote about like children and like it's the first time your heart it's an out of Body Experience because your heart is out in the room walking around that's a paraphrase of Steve Jobs quote it's that but then when once they're driving it's like they're not walking around the room they're like driving around the city and it's a whole different terrifying experience I'm just getting to live that out for the the first time this year yeah wow yeah so uh I mean that's that's pretty good spread of Ages but like it's not like you accidentally had a kid when you were in like your late 40s and now you got to take care of I've got a lot of friends who are in that boat who they had two kids they thought they were done and then they accidentally had another one so the first thing I did after I have my second kid CU I was like Hey zero population growth achieved you know like I I've done my part on and I went and I got the procedure and now I don't have to worry about accidentally having kids but uh I don't know if you decided at some point to do that but uh sorry I'm not this is not a show where we pry into people's personal medical information it's all good man but I did volunteer that I did it and uh you did like it's all good I think that that is has got to be wild because it first of all it's got to cost a fortune to provide for six kids it it already cost me plenty just providing for two like it maybe you can talk a little bit about what your your daytoday life is like and like the pressure you feel to be able to provide for a family like this is Brady Bunch sure right I don't think you have like the the living like you know obas on like the lady that lived you the alpar whatever it was the bunch but um but that's like like you're filling up that entire tictactoe grid with family members right basically yeah I mean it's it's a lot you know we uh we don't really worry about it I mean that's just always been my stance so I'm a I'm a Christian guy I believe in God and Jesus Christ and all that and so you know I read the Bible the Bible talks about taking care of your base needs like don't worry about that stuff God will take care of it you go out and and pay attention to these things and just like it it'll be fine and you know I just kind of took that on as true and it's been true though so far in my life and it's served me very well so I don't really think too much about it there are times of course we had an economic downturn I'm sure you felt it I'm not sure you felt it at free code camp but you I'm sure you saw it we've had a lot of layoffs in our industry yeah um and you know we made less money last year way less money than we made the previous year and so that's a little bit scary but you know we were just fine and we just continue to be fine a large family is a cost burden you have to live your life different than most people we homeschool uh so we're at the house a lot but what people don't realize about kids is that they grow up and they become economic powerhouses of their own and actually a family is a huge huge economic Powerhouse once it's established and so we look at it kind of like longterm investing you know it's like the longest term investment you can put out there and actually pays huge dividends in the long run yeah yeah I mean like if you're if you're like kind of founding like a dynasty almost like a like a zatu like like you can have this uh entire kind of like you know station home and then you can have like all these satellite uh households with their own families and stuff like that and that's how like business worked historically the oldest businesses in the world are family businesses that have just passed been passed down from one generation to generation the skills have been transferred the actual assets of the business have been transferred and it just it's a continuation right and like I have profound respect for people who are able to to build that kind of like intergenerational momentum um that's a big part of the American dream in my opinion but it's not just the American dream I think a lot of cultures prioritize building out these robust families where there's some like if you don't have family and you fall on Hard Times that's really tough uh but as long as you have family and they're willing to like help and it just gives you a lot of like wiggle room or you know affordance uh for lack of a better word right so like I mean the pattern is a pattern that I believe in strongly is that the parents provide for the kids and then the kids grow up and then the kids provide for the parents and that's just the circle of life and I think a lot of people have not done that in America in the last 50 years where it's like the parents grow up the kids move out they go somewhere else and now hopefully Mom and Dad have enough retirement have enough Medicare whatever it is to take care of themselves to get into a home and sometimes that's the way it works out I'm not uh hitting on anybody for doing that but I think that because we provided for them everything that they needed in order to succeed in this life that it's not asking too much to in our old age for them to take care of of us and so I look at that as kind of a retirement in a certain sense it's not like I'm going to require it of them or or come over to their house and like say give me money but you know it's just the flow on a pattern that makes a lot of sense yeah I mean like my wife is from China we met in grad school and she's now a nationalized US citizen and like there's very much that like vibe in China that like the family is this big unit and uh as people age like they can move in and you have these multigenerational households and it's actually really good for the kids in my opinion that they're spending so much time with their grandparents and that uh that the the parents who are still in kind of like their their super productive years uh can can actually get some work done and not just totally focus on child rearing because they have the support of the the older generation yeah so and again like my experience is limited to just like being in the US being in China but I imagine a lot of other you know societies work like this and and I do think it is I mean we've had kind of like cautionary tale of like oh we can disassemble families and we can just you know the kids can go off and live in a different city and like you know every the parents go to the retirement homes and all that stuff like I I do think that that to some extent that is uh kind of uh you know a modern uh but retrograde some Modern uh in ter in terms of like you lose a lot when you kind of break break the family down into like different atoms like you're breaking the bonds and you're breaking people people out and right yeah yeah what you end up with unfortunately is a lot of very lonely elderly people there A lot of very lonely elderly people because their families aren't around so I do I agree with you that it's retrograde obviously uh Different Strokes for different folks but I think that that's a great way to live life and to be a family for life not just raise your kids till they're 18 and then you know wipe your hands clean boot them out the door go join the military see you yeah I'm done with you yeah no yeah uh well that's cool so again this is a podcast about software development and we're going to be talking about that I promise but I just wanted to get some insight into to Jared because you are the only person I know like I know tons of people my age who have two kids three kids even four kids but like six kids that's like that's like a serious undertaking and uh I just want to convey the profound amount of respect I have for you being able to uh to raise those kids and uh you know raise them well and not just you know let the kids run around crazily like like in the 70s and 80s it seemed like parents were just so hands off and there's been like that return to uh to like being a little bit more thoughtful about child rearing uh yeah again I don't want to slight like the previous generations and stuff for being lazy but like kidnappings way down you know kids getting hit car by cars way down you know kids uh just getting in Crazy accidents and being like permanently you know eating tons of medicine that used to happen all the time like there are so many kids who are walking around with like lifelong disabilities because they like ate an entire bottle of aspirin like you know uh or you know something like that like that sort of stuff used to happen all the time and life was cheap even here in the United States right like the the wealthiest place in the world it felt like life is cheap and you read about like how things were different in the 60s and70s then you get these old people like oh yeah we just let the kids do whatever let the kids be free I'm like no if you do that the kids are get an accident you're going to get killed um so like I'm much more of a HandsOn parent I don't know how you are but like I I just I think there's profound responsibility in having kids and I think that so many people like not everybody's cut out to be a good parent or they they could be a good parent but they need to actually like you know work at being a good parent it's not like humans are naturally good parents it's one of the hardest things you can do so you can't yeah you have to actually put the work in you have to try hard and uh I think 90% of parenting is just showing up and caring and I think most parents show up and care so a lot of us are doing really well I agree with you that we've kind of swung the other way from like parenting Styles this might tie back into our software conversation because we have kind of a correction and overcorrection uh culture in the in the West in modern times where we're like okay this was the way that they did it and I agree with you that a lot of especially my dad tells me stories of the way that he was raised and it was like he just basically was free roaming around the city of Omaha for days days at a time and like never saw his parents and like there was very hands off right and then we see that you grow up as that and you're like well that wasn't great now I'm going to be the opposite of that and we kind of go to the other side of the pendulum and now we have what you know we call helicopter parenting where you're like basically following your kid around everywhere they go and you're making sure they're all right and you're like overly safety cautious and you know both of those things have their drawbacks and so we try to find a balance I'm also like you very HandsOn um but I also I know that they need to have their freedoms they need to make their mistakes they need to uh be able to handle social interactions without muham and dad there to help them so they can learn how to do that as they grow so it's it's a difficult balance it's hard to strike it right I've Struck it wrong tons of times throughout my years and probably will continue to but um you know parenting is one of the most rewarding things you can do it's also one of the hardest things to do the way this ties back into software I mean the pendulum swing back and forth is just constant in the software world you know I you and I have both been in it for a very long time we've seen Technologies come and go we've seen techniques uh become all the rage and then you know 10 years later become not the rage anymore here's a new thing and then a lot of times we return back to the old way and we re invent or we reestablish the way they used to do it and realize there was actually some good things about that and so finding that middle balance is really I think a a thing that comes from experience and a difficult part of being a software developer is not going all in on an extreme because you find yourself out there in the wilderness sometimes yeah and I mean it's very much like you know concentrating your chips on like a specific thing and I mean you could win big if you've just focused on becoming the world's expert on uh large language models for example and then bam that field Bears incredible fruit all of a sudden and you're one of those very few people who can do this job well and has like all the published papers and uh you know knows all the people in the industry and you can basically name your price to go work at like Nvidia or Microsoft or open AI or some place like that right but uh a lot of time like if you were working on a different branch of AI and you spent your entire career doing that and that ended up being one of the branches that hasn't yet borne fruit then you know so but the people who kind of like just were interested in AI in general and didn't specialize as much but like went around and tried all the different things and kind of spread their chips across the entire table those people I think are pretty well suited as well um so so I mean that I I want to make sure that that analogy makes sense that I am it correctly like picking up what you're saying but um yeah don't don't overly specialize and don't jump from one interest like Hacker News thread to the next like like the sky is falling right chicken little syndrome oh my goodness like this technology is going to completely replace react and like all the time I spent learning react is gone or you know even worse like why why should I learn anything everything's just going to be updated right that kind of like paralysis that a lot of developers feel yeah yeah that's the main thing I see with inexperienced developers is this like myopic worldview or like short shortsightedness because they just don't have the longevity that it's required to see things come and go and realize that like everything that goes to number one in Hacker News is not going to completely upend everything you just learned and make you obsolete right react while it's now currently being kind of uh pelted as the technology of choice and people are kind of assailing it with with the the downsides and the problems and here's some of better Alternatives you're starting to have that uh pendulum swing away from react right now but reactjs is so relevant right now and will continue to be so relevant for at least a decade if not 20 years even even if other things come out and become that quote unquote new hotness so um a lot of us just need to chill out relax and not adopt every new thing that comes out and that's one of the things that I try to do with change log news is like keep people up to date on what's going on but realize that I'm not adopting most of this stuff you know we don't at change log we write all of our own software our platform is completely custom it's all open source I'm a working developer I have been the entire time I've been doing this podcast and I will continue to because I don't want to become a guy who just talks about software I want to be a guy who writes software and then talks about it I think that's important and I haven't adopted half the stuff that I've covered on change life I mean half is an overstatement you know I adopt like one out of a hundred things I think it's all cool I think you should know about it yeah and maybe you should adopt maybe you shouldn't there's a lot of it depends in there but just because people are excited about something new doesn't mean that new thing is going to actually stick around and provide meaningful value for you in your life in your business in your job Etc so that's a that's a hard lesson to learn I think you learn it kind of by making that mistake a few times yeah like you said Quincy you can make a big bet on something and that could pay off huge or it could be a complete flop and now what you know you want to be able to generalize enough that you can float above the es and flows of the industry yeah well said so let's talk about change log news a little bit and and how you put it together because this is like like uh you know orange juice from concentrate this is like you know open source and technology news from con like it it's difficult to imagine it becoming much more tur than it is how long is the typical episode it's like 8 minutes maybe yeah so pretty much always under 10 you know 5 to 10 minutes is kind of The Sweet Spot and then we also have the companion newsletter which goes out at the exact same time so I think we're the only one but we're definitely one of the few if there's more than one who's a podcast and a newsletter at the same time with very complimentary content so the newsletter is longer has more links because I don't want the episode to get too long um but basically the audio is the top five stories out of the newsletter and then the newsletter is those in written form um usually a little bit terser I I'll go into more detail sometimes in audio if I feel like it and then you know more stuff interesting things that weren't necessar top five and so you get more links in there um and that's how it works I basically take the five things that I think are interesting for that week and I distill them down record a show it's 8 to 10 minutes you know put it out every Monday yeah and it's so Punchy and like it just flows like I have to compliment your editing uh as I've told you and as I always say on the podcast like I have moved away from heavily editing toward just letting the conversation breathe and letting you hear the ums and O and likes and and you know hearing the real people like none of this is scripted right like that that entire thing that Jared and I that exchange we just had about like families and stuff like that that that was not premeditated at all and I hope you're getting interesting insight into who Jared is as a person you know his his thoughts his beliefs uh his philosophy on life and and similar to me uh and the goal for this conversation is completely different than the goal for the Chang log news and I think podcasting as as a medium is so flexible just like text newsletters right like you and I both have newsletters they're very different like my newsletter is like very turse and it's very focused it's almost like the the polar opposite of yours because you have like a lot of links it's still you know uh groomed to be very like concise and everything like that but You' got a lot more stuff in the newsletter and then the podcast is where it's really tight and concise and for me my newsletter is really tight and concise and my podcast is just like your podcast is really long yeah exactly that's hilarious yeah I didn't I didn't think about like that because you just do the five is the five things you need to learn this week or Camp resources worth your time basically it's just like free courses free books great I've been a long time subscriber of that I did not click your link when you're like come fill out a form cuz I'm not exactly your target audience so I think when you did the Great Purge recently you should you should do that so click it and uh yeah so I'll give context anybody who's interested in my newsletter you may have noticed like hey that's weird Quincy sent out this like link and he said like if you want to keep getting this you have to get this so I had a mailing list of 7 million people it costs a fortune to send 7 million emails each week it's it's like even the absolute cheapest commodity like delivery Amazon simple email service $700 a week which is a lot of money like you can have somebody work a l for you like like maybe not it's based here in the United States but but like you can compensate somebody for their time uh for like an entire you know that's that's that's somebody's salary essentially uh and uh a lot of people were getting it and they were like I don't even remember subscribing to this and yes every single person subscribed there's an optin process on free COC it's very transparent it's like do you want to get this email here's what it is and it's like sure no thanks and you know about half of people who signed up for a free Camp account say yes I want this and a lot of people say yes I want this and then they like later change their mind and they unsubscribe but uh I was like well I'm pretty sure because not every time I 10 7 million emails like 7 million people are clicking through to like the you know the Articles um so maybe we could pair this down and we could save everybody a lot of time and energy by not filling the inboxes of people who have since changed their mind and no longer want to get this but don't unsubscribe for some reason right and also 90% of emails that you send out to people are going to end up in Gmail like email is technically like an open protocol 90% of people use Gmail and Gmail was doing weird things where it was like putting my emails in spam even though people were like engaging and replying and stuff like who knows how Gmail's uh email and of course like when I compose these emails I have this big reference of spam words that uh are likely to end you up in the uh you know the spam box and one of them is free which is part of our name right but luckily free code camp that that string of characters does seem to be uh one but still like I can only mention the word free once I just mentioned it in the uh the you know the subject line I I don't ever mention free anywhere else in in the email just because I don't want to get like put into spam anyway sorry we want to learn from you but not just about the minutia of running an email newsletter but that that is something I sent out an email and and uh tens of thousands of people opted back in to continue to receive it but now we spend basically nothing sending the email each week and uh we're less likely to train Google like like fewer people are hitting report spam and stuff like that so yeah it's going to have higher deliverability going forward so it's it's kind of like winwin but uh yeah I just wanted to give you context to that and assure you that like yeah that's what I was referring to as the Great Purge because you went from 7 million down to like dozen like you're down in the yeah tens of character or five numbers now yeah yeah but but awesome I mean that that takes some that takes I mean obviously you're taking the financial hit but you know just the lack of ego required to do that I think is Honorable because you're like you know what I want to send it to real people who actually want it they've already opted in once but I'm going to make them opt in a second time and make sure it's super high signal super low noise and I think that a lot of folks would like to just have that 7 million number but they're probably not paying out the sces I just want to be respectful of people like a lot of times people their eyes are bigger than their stomach and I totally get that and I totally like I've been there right um and I unsubscribe to a lot of newsletters that I sign up for too so like same thing like it's just kind of like our privacy philosophy uh if somebody wants to unsubscribe there's a a single link they can click boom unsubscribe we're never going to email you again don't worry about it right uh and and then if you want to delete your account you never have to send free Camp support like hey delete my account delete literally everything you have on me like we get these kind of automated requests people that like sign up for these services to like go delete all my data from the web and they send these annoying emails to everybody and every single small website owner has to deal with these like automated mess Mees that are basically spammed out uh by these Services don't use those Services just just go to freecodecamp.org click settings scroll to the bottom hit delete it's like are you sure hit it it's going to delete not only your uh record but it'll delete like literally everything and and that record even our backup is deleted after like a week so so like literally there will be no Trace that you ever had a free Cod Camp account and it's not like we're like selling your email to anybody or anything like that if you read our pre privacy term they are extremely explicit like we wrote everything because we respect people's privacy and yeah anyway so this is something I feel really strongly about and I'm really irritated when people abuse like LinkedIn like don't get me started on LinkedIn I could talk all day about and they've been sued repeatedly for this but like they abuse your trust and they manipulate you and stuff like that with like these you know ux dark patterns and stuff but freeo games not going to do that we we do have a profound amount of respect for you back to change long news no oh good no ditto I think we're in the same uh spiritual Camp there absolutely we turned off click tracking on all of our emails we don't know what I mean as a author of an email newsletter which is kind of the yindi or Yan Quincy because 90% of the links in our email linked to somebody else's website right we're not linking the only ones that link back to our websites are just like here's the podcasts that we put out this week and then everything else is outbound to somebody else and so uh it is interesting to me as an author of a newsletter to say okay what is everybody what did everybody like out of this issue because I can use that information hopefully to make the next issue better give them more of what they like you know and so that information is interesting to me as an author but uh not interesting enough so we just turn it off and we don't do any link tracking so we have no idea what you're clicking one of the great side effects of that which is a small thing but for me as a nerd is heartwarming and I love it is that when you're reading our newsletter you can actually just hover over the link you know just like good old fasten HTML and it will show you exactly where that link is going versus being some sort of a redirect in between you know there's no redirects or anything like that so you go straight to the website I like that cuz sometimes I look at a link yours are actually just PL text so it's the same thing yeah I'm the only gu even better more big newsletter that just uses plain text and people marketers always send me emails they're like hey what's your email is not optimized I can design it why don't you do tricky tracking and sorry to go off and yet another rant but I'm not going to do anything with that data anyway like it's G to make me feel better I I swear like so much of this data collection is just to make marketers feel better about themselves and it doesn't actually have any like business you know people are going to click on it or they aren't and every single article is so different like how can you like are you going to like create custom emails for people that tend to click on like you know data science related things I mean yeah you could you could definitely do that but um I'd rather just like literally no track just plain text plain literal text no HTML file or anything um and I think it does improve deliverability I of course if you've got a nice looking template like you do looks very professional I think it's totally fine and I applaud you for not invading people's privacy with like trackers and stuff and showing them literally what they're going to get you know when they hover over yours I I I think that's amazing yeah it's a small thing but it's a it's a thing that we do and a thing that I appreciate as a as a reader um but yeah that's the newsletter man it's you know been going on for a long time now Chang log news as a podcast is is like you said kind of opposite of the free code podcast but we have also interview shows that we've been doing I mean our bread and butter over the course of the 15 years we've been a thing are interviews and conversational podcasts so this like highly edited 5 to 10 minute news thing we do on each Monday really is new I think we're on episode 94 of those so we've done less than 100 of those and it was really a break from that uh inside the same exact feed so one of the most recent things we've done with the change log is we've expanded into a two different uh a few different flavors of the same show so you can just subscribe to the change log podcast and on Monday you'll get that brief news episode on Wednesday you'll get our traditional Deep dive technical interview and then on Friday we have this thing we call change login friends which is a talk show and so it's more Freewheel in we bring in recurring guests we talk about what's going on uh in the tech world and just about whatever sometimes um and so it's less of an interview more of a conversation and those are all the same podcast it's the change log you can get them separately cuz some people I just want your interviews man why don't you go back to the old thing we're like well here's a feed for you to just have the interview that's cool you have multiple feeds we may do that at some point if we expand Beyond just having me talking to people and and have like some sort of new sh but like I don't really feel the need to do that because all the open source news is covered by Jared right yeah well thank you yeah I mean it's that's a place where we've been as well I mean we have other shows that we produce like JS party is about web development we have practical AI which is about AI we have go time which is about go and then but the change log has always been kind of like the polyglot overarching you know what's happening across the entire ecosystem or software developers um and a lot of other niches people have asked us please make a podcast for rust you know and I've always been like well that's some pretty good Russ podcasts why didn't you just go listen to those so I don't want to just make a podcast to make a podcast uh we want to fill an actual void and I don't feel like there's a void there people have also asked us to make Elixir podcast because we make pretty good podcasts and we use Elixir and there's people who like elixir and it's like well there's pretty good Elixir podcasts out there so yeah like why I'm happy to just promote you to go listen to those and so yeah um yeah we have expanded the change log to three times a week with the news and the interview and the talk and then we have these like little shows that do specific communities but we feel like you know people are pretty well served in software world with a decent op amount of options for good podcasts they said if anybody wants to get into podcasting like you know I think you and I could both say like it's fun I love listening to podcast I listen to I mean people don't believe me how when I say how many they think I'm exaggerating but I I probably listen like two hours of podcast a day maybe three hours cuz at listen on double speed are you a 2X are you a 3X a double speed I I've tried 3x I feel like I do lose a lot of the information if I go up above 2x um also that's the fastest Apple podcast we you will do I think and I insist on using Apple podcast because that's what most people use right especially outside of the US people aren't using spotify uh they're not necessarily watching this on YouTube though you know people listening to this may be watching this on YouTube like the number one way that people consume podcasts in the United States is through Apple podcast and if you have an iPhone it's built in and it's they keep changing it they keep moving little stuff around it is annoying I know but I insist on using it because that's what other people use and I want to be able to empathize with people like there are lots of spoke tools like listen notes is an amazing tool if you're trying to do research if you really want to like find cuz podcast is you know it's a messy kind of it's hard to search and find good stuff but thankfully listen notes is an amazing search engine uh for podcast run by win Bing Fong who hasn't been on this podcast but he has been on our Chinese language podcast if you're a Chinese speaker go listen to that it's a really great interview I practice my listening comprehension by listening to that uh super chill dude but um I think the the main thing I want to say is um on the Note like there is so much room for interesting Niche podcasts uh if you want to write if you want to create a podcast about you know what it's like to be a developer in Houston or something like that right like the Houston texting could absolutely have its own podcast if they wanted to like and you can go as deep as you want you've got people like me that are already listening like three hours a day we need stuff to listen to you've got uh truck drivers you've got people who uh are just at their jobs all day and are doing something that doesn't require their full attention they can continually listen to podcast it's really probably the most under appreciated and underexplored medium in my humble opinion MH it's a great medium I mean conversations are like as old as time you know and we just as humans we just enjoy conversation we learn so much from conversation and the amount of nuance and care and empathy that you have from just like listening to people talk and and sometimes we hem and we Haw you know and we we beat around the bush and like you can feel that versus the edited uh completely thought out preis you know pre thought out written edited blog post yeah scripted but like the way that you write an article it's like you think about it you write it you you draft it then you rewrite it you edit it blah blah blah and so like people hold that to a higher level of scrutiny there's so much grace in podcast casting you know just hearing a conversation whereas you know so we have this show called go time uh which is all about the go programming language and people who write it Etc and one of their Deals they have this unpopular opinion segment I'm not sure if you've heard this Quincy um it's where they basically they all bring an unpopular opinion to share and related to programing put them out on or is it like pineapple on pizza or like well it can be about anything okay like the show is about you know programming with the It Go and systems and stuff like that but the unpopular opinion is can be about anything so sometimes a lot of times they're about food sometimes it's about go it could be about AI it could be about whatever and all you have to bring something that you think will be unpopular with the gotime audience basically and so a lot of people come with this really Brash oneliner you know and we're going to put that out on social media for we we take a vote afterwards on each one like is it actually unpopular or not and what we find is really fascinating which is that the oneliner is off often unpopular it's like here's my oneliner and people are like no that's wrong nobody liked that yes but then after you say the oneliner everyone kind of sits there and now you got to explain what you think about that one line you know you have to kind of like uh Circle it out flesh it out and often times if you actually listen to the two minutes or what however however long it is of the person explaining their op by the time they're done explain you kind of agree with them it's like yeah okay I can see it like the oneliner was you know essentially vot bait clickbait but then with the Nuance with the full context with the it depends is all that in there it ends up being like well actually that's reasonable and I think that's just a a testament to the the way the podcasts work yeah yeah I mean like I think I've been educated so much by just hearing descending opinions on podcasts over the years and getting that Nuance that you don't get from headlines and what is Facebook Newsfeed you scroll through headlines what is Twitter headlines or I mean like literally tweets have been constrained to where you can only have the headline you can't you have to do like an entire threat if you want more than that it's a terrible medium uh so yeah like Nuance is kind of just lost and you know what gets clicks what gets bubbled to the top is whatever outrages people unfortunately um rage bait rage bait exactly and you know with podcasting it's it's completely different it's like almost like this dark matter of the content world because it's so impen I mean spotify's done a lot to like create like automatic little clips and share it and stuff like that and we don't generally do that we don't like cut out like the highlights of the the video and do that I know you all do that but I like listening to the conversation and its entirety take it all in I it's like when I when I read a book I don't go to the bookstore and get like Cliff Notes I go and read the the actual book you know I want I want to hear everything that uh this author had to say about the subject matter right and so I I do think something's lost when you compress like there's no such thing as lossless compression with human communication uh I like that that's a good quote okay cool is like just a little r that one put that on a put that on a clip Quincy you should clip that put that out there all right uh uh I agree with you we we clip for two reasons uh the first reason is you know we recognize that not everybody has the time to listen to 60 90 you know 120 Minutes um secondly obviously we're trying to draw people in I mean that's the entire reason that we do it like we don't have clips for Clips sake we just want to give you a taste and say oh that's interesting and then come listen to the full conversation so all of that stuff is just pointers back to what we think is really uh the bees knes and that's the full conversations but we realize that yeah some people I mean we have got people that just live off our Clips they're like you have the best Clips I'm like do you listen to the podcast no I just listen to the clips I'm like okay that's weird but I get it you know not everybody has time yeah but the nice thing about podcasting is how Works its way into everything else like it's not a zero some medium you don't have to stare at it you know the video yeah you can put it in a tab in the background now you're basically listening to a podcast but video requires you to stare at it text requires you to stare at it whereas a podcast you can be walking the dog at the park with the kids you can be mowing the lawn working out commuting like all the things it really works its way into your life and I just find that to be so much easier to consume other mediums I mean podcast and it's so intimate is the other thing that people don't appreciate is like you're literally hearing a conversation between me and Jared like where would you hear that you would have to like meet us at some conference in either like Dallas or or in in uh you know Omaha or more likely in like San Francisco or something right um and we you would have to be within earshot and you'd have to stand there at that exact moment that we were talking and you know who knows maybe we'd be getting distracted like all these other things would be happening around us you would not get this conversation anywhere El like this could very much just be Jared and I just catching up on like a video call and it's it's lost of time it was never recorded of course there is like a little bit of a um I guess Observer uh pattern I'm I'm trying to think of like how would you describe it but but like we do know this is being record we don't know we do know that there's an audience here so it does kind of performance we talk about a little bit but uh I mean yeah I would say this like how I am on the podcast is very similar how I am in my daytoday meetings with different people uh the only thing is like I'll like explain acronyms or I might um you know break out like I'll try to say something in a more simple way or I'll say things like to remind people to give people additional context if they're listening but I mean this is this is who I am and I get the vibe that this is who you are right you're like not guarded or anything you're just like you know exactly chill dude who loves open source software so absolutely so maybe we can talk about the the podcast and its origin story like of course we've already talked about the change log itself but the news show like what made you decide to do a news show yeah good question so we had a newsletter for a long time it used to be called change log weekly and we did probably 400 issues of those and that was just our weekly news we didn't have any audio news um and we would sometimes discuss the news so JS party is another podcast that we do it's all about JavaScript in the web and on that show it's more of a we we think of it like a variety show versus the change log wi is conversations that's like we play games you know we make up we we do silly stuff uh we have like formalized debates like there's a variety to it and they're kind of like segmented and like here we're going to do this then this then that and one of the things we do in there we have this thing called story of the week where it's basically like each person brings a story and we try to convince each other that's the most important story of the week and we say why and we basically just discussed the news and um so we had that a little bit like news discussion sometimes you want to just know what's going on other times you want to hear what people think about it you know and we never had just that in audio format so through my editing and and production of JS party and a lot of the different segments that we do and the music and the sounds and all this kind of stuff I just gain the confidence I guess it requires to completely edit and produce my own you know piece of audio from start to finish and thought about giving a try it was actually something that Adam and I is my cohost he's not here today but um partner in crime as you said at the top have wanted to do for a very long time we just couldn't really figure out how to crack that nut how to make it you know how does it make money how does it make it self sustainable we wanted to do daily for a while and it's like can we do a daily news show so we thought about that and it's like well that's biting off a lot is weekly enough so like a lot of just those you know you have an idea and you don't actually do it for a very long time or maybe that's just us and eventually I was like well and Adam one time a couple years AG uh recorded like a thre minute thing that was like a I remember listen pilot of a new show it was like incredibly dense like way too dense it was yeah it was very quick and dense and I was like well that's too fast and too much so it doesn't really provide it's like basically reading the headlines you know and you don't want to just read the headlines cuz you can just do that really quickly yourself what you want is a little bit more of like the why and so that's kind of where the Genesis of Chang log news began and I just tried it one time and put it out there as a pilot on the feed and I'm like let us know if you like this and we got a lot of positive feedback from the listeners and so uh we decideed just to keep going and it's kind of it's morph and changed you know try to make it better over the the course of 94 episodes but yeah that's where that came from and um yeah it's it's fun it's interesting people like it there's people who like it's their favorite thing in the world there's other people who like yeah I could take it or leave it and that's cool yeah um I enjoyed doing it and uh people seem to like it yeah and I have to say like it you put a lot of thought and effort into the production and it's incredibly polished like the sound design like there there's all these kind of like it feels almost like these kind of call back it's always like it's your boy Jared like like there're like almost kind of like memes and catchphrases and stuff that like tend to like happen in there and it it it seems incredibly well thought out and like every moment is like paste and everything uh one of the things I really love about it is like I said the sound design and like the incorporation of lots of clips and and you know ear candy essentially uh the sauce that goes on top of the news right the steak is since from Oma we'll talk about steaks right the steak and then you put like your A1 or your wor this year or your you know custom like sauce I don't know what do people put on steaks out there and again I want to apologize to anybody who in the audience who's vegetarian or Hindu or anything like that but but like please allow me to entertain Jared with this line of questioning yes uh what do people put on steaks here in Oma well of course you have the purists the one that say if you put sauce on it it's because the steak was bad and so it's kind of an in and if you do it at someone's house it can be an insult because you're like oh you're trying to cover up my steak and then of course we have people who put yeah A1 bold wores Shire um of course a lot of the the toppings like uh blue cheese you know kind of cheese what do you call those things on a stick yeah like the crumbles blue Crum Crum okay but not the dressing all right like a cream sauce yeah yeah yeah so people do that um I don't know is that is that typical there as well you know in Texas we take our Stak pretty serious I'm one of those purists like I don't put any sauce on it but um same yeah like I just love it like if they did a good job of preparing it and they used like the right seasoning and everything then I'm like wow this tastes amazing and I don't eat a lot of steak I eat it periodic if they don't do it good job and it's all dry and hard you know then what do you do I mean I I send it back Frank take it I'm like send it back I always ask for sake rare I want to taste the blood of the animal that was sacrificed so I could eat that meal I I mean like it may sound silly but like what I'm trying to teach my kids is like like when we walk down the curb we look out for Roly py all life is precious humans like I have two of my brothers are vegetarians right like one of them is even vegan right um they're raising their kids to be vegetarian but like as soon as they come over to Grandma in Grandpa's house they're like eating all the beef jerky and stuff but uh right you know like like I definitely believe that life is precious and like life should not unnecessarily be destroyed like when we walk down the sidewalk we all me and my kids in the morning when we're walking to school we look out for insects and I'm like oh rly poliy look out for the rly poy and we're very careful when we capture like a butterfly we we C captured a butterfly yesterday and we and I say we can only keep the butterfly for one night it stays in the the hotel the lson residence for one night and and then we release it so it can go back and it can find a mate and you know do all its butterfly business because this is just like you know it's not worth us having the joy of having this butterfly captured to you know keep the butterfly from its its own life uh so so I just want to say that like I do have reverence for the animal I never make light of the fact that an animal died so that I could eat meat but I do eat meat and I think that it's you know I'm I'm not going to try to talk people out of being vegetarian I was a vegetarian for like three or four years right and one day we were driving down the road I was you know my friend and I uh you know and and he's just like man like don't you ever just want me we looked over at the cows they were just standing there and like the population of cows is like much higher now than it ever was before humans you cultivated them right and I was like all right all right and I I I I reverted to my meat eating ways um and I think I've been healthier as a result may maybe I yeah anyway sorry this is going to upset a lot of people I don't censor or edit my podcast uh but I did want to kind of justify my carnivorous ways to the audience and the reason I mentioned Omaha and Stak and the whole thing this came up is like Omaha Stakes are held up as like the best like it is steak country right like it's a huge agricultural export for you all right yeah absolutely Omaha Stakes is one of the things we're known for also corn of course the Nebraska Corn Huskers is the name of our uh link you know University of Nebraska football team so people think about corn and they think about steak and they don't think about very much else you know because Nebraska doesn't have too many geographic features or they call it fly over country for a reason you know um but we do have Stakes the reason why you brought it up is you're asking like uh what do you put on your steak about back to the actual podcast like and stuff how do you the the ear candy as I said like how do you make it so compelling and it's like an experience like delightful I'm like walking around you know walking around the neighborhood walking around the gym and like ding you know cool sound bite that I haven't thought of from some '90s movie it's it's cool I mean the the amount of time and energy you put into it it it is definitely worth it for me anyway as a listener maybe you can talk a little bit about that like your philosophy as far as like finding things that is like sounds good enough or is like a pop culture reference that people are actually going to get and it's not from some like Indie movie or something like that it's something people actually like refence yeah that's the hard part so I definitely like I am definitely a reference guy like I love you know the pop culture and film and like all these things and song and of course my pop culture references are all very skewed towards like American grew up mostly in the 90s male right um and so because of that a lot of my references that I throw in when I first started the change doog news it was like really thick with references cuz I love that kind of stuff um pull them in reference things not ODS you know sound bites uh remember like VH1's popup video or whatever it was like I love that show where like in like tell you about that was so cool yeah trivia they have something like that onon xray or something where it's like it tells you kind of IMD that's cool that's a cool feature yeah it'll show like it'll show you who's on screen right now and that kind of stuff I love all that and I really started out I was thick on it I was very thick on it because it was like it was like a a labor of love that I was doing and I was trying something new and I probably overdid it for a while because you know we had some people complain like these references are stupid there's a waste of time like I don't get them and then we have people who love them and so it's kind of torn like well you know which way do I lean because they're not really all that additive except for the ear candy you know sometimes you want that little bit of sprinkle on top and other times you're like oh it's too sweet you know less sprinkles please and so I've kind of chilled out on them I've I've definitely dialed it back but that just comes out of what I would want to listen to I love things where people have taken time to throw in that extra little jab you know just because or make that reference then and if I get it then I'm in and if I don't get it then I might be curious and be like what movie from is that from and I would link up in the transcript where each reference was pulled from so like if you were super into it and you be like what was that sound you can go to the transcript and find the YouTube video which will link you back to the source material and stuff like that so that was awesome I still do it I just do it less than I used to and then the of our sound and stuff is all just like really awesome music and noises produced by breakmaster cylinder who we've had on retainer for years and we just request cool new you know I'm like hey can you make more Droid sounds for me I just need some more droids you know and then like make them shorter make them louder make them cuter make them uglier and like BMC just bumps out new sounds all the time so we're just incorporating those just trying to make it as as good as we can you know yeah shout out to brickmas cylinder and the brickmas cyinder music episode that the change log published a while back that was really cool to listen brickmas cylinder is like a music producer very mysterious character but not that mysterious after you brought them on it was amazing to listen to them and like hear about their process and their their philosophy uh and how they're so uh prolific uh I mean they've done music for so many podcasts like big time podcasts oh yeah I mean not that the change log isn't a big time podcast but like I know what you mean like like Main media like I don't know if I've heard him on like New York Times or Washington Post but but like I have heard him on some big like proper news wellfunded podcasts as well yeah yeah BMC kind of made a living on podcast theme songs specifically and so you'll find a lot of break master cylinder mentions at the end of shows because part of the you know agreement is like well you got to mention the the music produced by at the end people are happy to do it we're happy to do it as well and we first heard about break master cylinder because of the reply all podcast which was on gimlet back when reply all was a thing and gimlet was a thing in the early days of like the second Boon of podcasting and we just hooked up with BMC and a lot of people hire them to do a song but nobody does what we do which is like can you just stick around forever and just keep making music for us and so much we have so much music now original tracks written by and produced by BMC for our shows exclusively that we have a whole another thing called change log beats which is albums we have full length albums there's three of them currently that you can go listen to in Spotify and apple music and wherever you get your streaming music yeah and listen to like just break master cylinder beats you know produce for change log yeah and I love them my kids love them we listen to them in the car it's just cool so that's been an interesting kind of a what do you call it a an emergent phenomenon like it wasn't like we planned any of that it just kind of happened yeah and uh I love chip tune music and uh breakmaster like often incorporates kind of like those kind of blips and like really fast uh arpeggios and stuff uh yeah it's so cool to listen to and that's and then Adam and I are big like I think we're agem mates for the most part Quincy Adam as well we grew up in the late 80s early 90s and so a lot of our influences are um video game references so like we have an entire album called Next Level which is just video game themed songs that we've asked BMC to create over the years like hey make us another one that sounds like Castlevania you know make us one that sounds like Mega Man and we just have been incorporating those into our shows so yeah chip tuni uh8 bit 16 bit yeah a lot of cool stuff awesome well the show is amazing uh I'm excited to continue to listen to it as it progresses but I mean you've definitely found a lane as far as just really quick open source kind of highlights from the the open source Comedia Comedia uh Community there is so much going on in open source like I think people might look at like you know GitHub trending or other places like that just to see what's going on but there's so much going on that is never like really a lighted shined on it and I think it's great that you all are bringing a lot of that stuff to the Forefront and making it much more uh you're surfacing it you're surfacing the hard work of many developers around the world and uh also kind of like providing analysis whereas if you go to like a GitHub Project Read me and you're like why is this important like what is this relevant to me but you know when you put it in the context of Jared breaking it down for you telling you like hey this is cool because XYZ like this is in interesting facts about the project it just brings it to life and it makes me it makes it seem so much more relevant to me as a listener than if I were just you know scroll get up trending all day and like clicking on random projects and stuff yeah yeah so I'm really interested to talk about open source as a whole this is kind of sure so we can move from talking about the change log talking about uh the show which again like link to it in the show notes in the video description like just go listen to it subscribe to it I you will not regret this you're going to learn a lot let's talk about what is going on in open source because I think few people have their finger on the pulse of Open Source like you and Adam do and you especially doing these like Weekly News uh updates like you probably I I will say this and and I would love if somebody challenges me in the comments but I would go so far to say you probably know more about what's going on in open source than a lot of the people working in like developer relations at GitHub or places like that where it's like their business to know what's going on in open source uh right what are the big kind of macro Trend what do you see going on so there's a lot like you said um and of course open source is not just one big Community um probably never was there's lots of it's like made up of subcultures you know so there is no such thing as the open source Community because like if you said where does open source hang out like you might say GitHub but github's not really hanging out very much you can talk and you can post your code but that's not hanging out the answer would be like nowhere and everywhere you know it's it's on Discord it's in slack it's on GitHub it's hanging out in IRC still it's like all over the place so there's the community side but then there's like what's going on what is the community doing well right now there's a a lot of hubub around relicensing so of course open source uh is defined by the the people who maintain the open source definition at open source.org they call themselves The OSI open source initiative and this was defined back in the 90s and has to be guarded to a certain extent because a lot of people are uh trying to come out with products for sale and call them open source and then they aren't actually open source and so there's a lot of conversation about what it means to be open source or just public or free or these kind of things so that's like a Perpetual debate but it's one that's currently under a lot of scrutiny because the recent releases of for instance meta's llama AI model uh was declared as open source but but has a commercial constraint on it Quincy I'm not sure how up to date you are on all this stuff but that particular la oh it's a very specific commercial constraint I I know what you're talking about a very specific commercial constraint which means it's not open source actually it's it's like almost open source but it's not quite but they're going to call it open source and so this goes down to like well what do words mean and what do you get to say about your thing and so it's a huge debate because a lot of the open source definition going back doesn't actually apply to uh language models or any kind of models for that reason they're just kind of like outdated because they aren't just code they're like code Plus data plus training plus you know this other stuff so that's all going on very fascinating and then we have the rug poles you know we have hashy Corp who uh the purveyor of terraform terraform previously open source this is a a uh infrastructure as code tool um that was previously open source and they recently relicensed it so that it's not open Source anymore and this caused a big stir and a fork and so maybe you've heard of open tofu which is the open source Fork which is a response to the relicensing of terraform that's going on and then IBM bot has you Corp subsequently so lots of lots of details on that particular story but like this whole what really is open source and what isn't conversation is very active and vibrant right now and a lot of the AI models are pushing that because there's a lot of value a lot of Goodwill and intrinsic value in the open source brand making something truly open source that um businesses want to have that but they also don't want to comply to it and so there are um what some people call you know attacks on what it is in order to call your commercial product open source when it's not so that's definitely going on have you been privy to any of that conversation so I'm going to kind of like break it down for some of the people who didn't hear about the terms of uh Facebook's I'll call it Facebook instead of meta they Chang the name but it's still the same uh same people involved uh just just because a lot of people might take a cynical look at at meta and like them trying to Rebrand themelves and stuff just like like alphabet technically nobody calls Google alphabet right even though they've got like this holding company and stuff right but anyway sorry I'm not trying to split hairs or attack Mark Zuckerberg even though as anybody knows like I'm not a huge fan of Mark Zu so uh sure so Facebook spent a ton of R&D creating an open source uh llm that you can essentially it's they they've got like different sizes and stuff and you can run and fre C can't use this internally we use it um we haven't jumped on the chat chat bot bandwagon to like have how can I help you with your coding problem or whatever right like now we just use the form and that works better and you're actually talking to real people and you're learning from real people it's creating artifacts it's not just like throw away you know tokens and and also frankly like it cost a fortune to run a lot of these models um but it's really cool that Facebook open sourced it and made it available to everybody so uh at the same time Facebook realizes like hey you know Amazon could just yo like let's go use this and let's build on top of it in in secret and not contribute it back and all that stuff and like let's do all this so they put a limit I think it was it like 700 million if your service has like 700 million users or more or something like that monthly active users or yeah so fre something like that I don't know the exact number mon active users we might be up there in like 10 years or something but uh yeah I'm not that worried about it because we're not using for commercial purposes or anything free cams and charity and uh as a charity we're able to like use all kinds of stuff and it's not for commercial purposes oh yeah uh and and free C Camp as you probably know if you're listening to this we are also open source and we use the most permissive license BSD three uh which is basically MIT it's just there's a little Clause that protects people from pretending they're free Cod Camp because free Cod camps M work so hard to create this you know positive image and encourage people you know this Vibe and we don't want you know frauders to basically pretend they're free C Camp and like try to defraud people and and fortunately if you don't have trademarks things like that like you you get the people that step in like hey I created a free code camp for my community just a thousand bucks your kids can come and like learn to code right and like you get a lot of that stuff but so the only protection on our repo is that you can't pretend to be free Cod Camp you can use our code and lots of people do they they spin up white labeled versions of free Cod Camp to run uh like lots of coding boot camps were doing this for example a lot of universities do this a lot of people who are in prison are using free code Camp running on a local area network and they may have made like slight modifications to that so that people in America you can't have internet access if you're in prison which I I mean I can see the reasoning behind that but they they need to figure something out because it's a huge impact to people being able to retrain and prepare for the outside world anyway uh this is not a discussion about like those kinds of topics but my point is historically open source was open source like this is what open source is you can't call yourself open source if you're limiting the number of users that a company can have uh just because you don't want Microsoft taking your Tech and like you don't want Amazon taking your Tech and stuff like that like very few Services have more than 600 million users a month like I I think there maybe like few handful name them on maybe two hands yeah yeah and like like probably a lot of Chinese companies maybe some Indonesian companies I don't even think Indonesian because there aren't 700 million people in Indonesia right like like you're really just talking about like major apps that are designed for you know Mass market like Facebook has I don't know billions of users right like they don't want they don't want people to take their tools and compete with them so that's one thing and then the other thing uh what you said about uh terraform I didn't even realize that was happening you may have mentioned on Chang log news but I didn't realize that uh they had changed the license where do you fall on this you are somebody for whom open source is not only a passion but it's like what you work in like you are swimming in a SE of Open Source and you're you're kind of taking it and interpreting it and Distilling it for other people to to be able to keep up on top of what do you think about some of these changes yeah you just report the news and try to stay objective well no I mean on the new show I do not not even that I mean on the new show I don't think of like I'm a news reporter or a journalist and I'm trying to be an objective person reporting the news I'm like now I'm a podcaster who pays attention to what's going on I'm Just Jared and I'm going to let you know what's going on why it's interesting and maybe what I think about it sometimes I don't say what I think about it sometimes I do just depends on how I feel about certain things but um the first thing is that it's all very complicated you know this is not easy uh open source meets business is one of the most fascinating little uh intersections of things because of how complicated it all is I mean just even your Nuance description of your license you know which I completely understood probably was lost on a few people not because you didn't do a good job but because it's very complicated to say this license means this but you can't do that you know and there's a set of licenses that are are approved by the open source initiative who are the again the people who Define and defend the open source definition and then there are ones that don't and the ones that don't want to be called that they are and there's reasons for that and it's all very complicated so um it's difficult to say exactly where I land I can speak about specific incidents um Adam and Adam coined a phrase that I've been repeating since he coined it which is rug pole not cool um I think that you should come out and be what you are from the start and stay that I think that people that like what hashy Corp did was not cool because they built this huge Community around open source software terraform and then years years later when it became um against their business interest to continue that way they rug pulled they changed it they made it no longer open source and all these people who had given their resources supported the community whatever they've done over the course of years adopted the technology they all had to Grapple with a decision to make well do we now pay Hashi corpse for terraform or do we Fork it and and do our own thing and they decided to Fork it yeah um reddis is the same way reddis was relicensed recently no longer open source and that one's a little Messier because whereas terraform got like one big group of people that all said we're going to Fork you and create a new one redus has had like six of those Microsoft announced one um well Microsoft announced something very similar a team from abws announced one uh Drew devault from Source Hut announced one so now there's like six red as forks and it's like well which one do I pick which one's going to win you know it's kind of Messier and weird and so I think the whole rug pool thing is not cool and I wish companies wouldn't do that um that being said I understand the business pressures that are on them and why they would do that over time as they're giving away you know they're giving away the goods for so long eventually they're like we need to make money off this I mean like just kneejerk reaction when you're using open source is basically marketing uh first of all if free Cod Camp is incorporating tool like we don't use generally nonop Source tools I I can't think of any proprietary tools we use we use some proprietary software as of service things like like uh like U for example for authentication we use OCTA like ozero OCT acquired ozero a while back I think um so we used that uh and that is not open source to my knowledge uh and I can understand why like for security reasons they wouldn't want to make the entire you know all their security open source necessarily but uh at the same time uh that's like basically it like every database we use every web server every load balancer every uh you know Library we're incorporating into the free code Camp codebase which has more than 50,000 commits uh SL poor requests I think o over time uh maybe that's GitHub issues I don't know how many uh commits we we could take a look at it but it's a lot that we have thousands of contributors right and they have all come to freeo Camp like hey I'm going to invest my scarce time making this better so I can use it and it's going to be available to for example prison systems it's going to be available to uh you know schools that are out in you know places in Middle America or places in you know Latin America Africa uh that just don't have good internet like I think it's like 15 20% of Americans don't have like really highspeed internet they're having to use you know makeshift Solutions like czy like uh you know the Elon mus satellite thing right stlink which is not nearly as good as just having you know cable modem or something like that right like oh for sure yeah if you live in the city you can get like half half a gigabit or maybe a full gigabit and it's not that expensive right but if you're a little farther out it it can become really difficult to get good internet so so like people might be forking Freo Camp to create computer labs so the kids in the neighborhood can go and like learn locally on those computers right um and people are investing this time and energy with the with the understanding that we're not just going to rug pole we're not just to say hey sorry if you want to use free C Camp like you have to pay us a licensing fee right or um like hey we're just not going to support like you're you're orphaned on that like old version or free Cod camp and all the improvements are going to be on free Cod Camp Pro or something like that right like that is rug not I like it so um yeah like my my sentiment is like what hash Corp has done and it sounds like what reddis has done is like a bunch of marketers and money people uh basically said like hey we we got all this out of it let's Slaughter the Golden Goose and like let's see if there are any gold eggs in it what's going to happen the Project's going to be abandoned eventually there will be some people who are so locked in using that that they just grudgingly pay it's going to destroy trust in the brand it's probably going to people are going to be like putting the the company logo of the acquirer on a dart board and throwing darts at it when they're frustrated with it uh I mean it just seems so value destroying to take something that was working fine I people were making money they just weren't making private Equity level money you know uh it seems like a really greedy play uh so so that is my two cents on that uh again I hope that's not too spicy of a take but like if you start a project you were betraying the community by changing the license on it I would say uh so you know freeo camp like I agree especially if you make yeah yeah especially if you have a certain track record in history of being this way then all of a sudden you're like we're going to go 180 and be the other way I mean you wouldn't like that in a relationship right I mean that would be like what the heck why'd you do that to that would like destroy a relationship possibly yeah yeah and then you know then the meta thing or the Facebook thing if you prefer I'll use Facebook either way fine I just want to make sure people know what we're talking about not go to their Rebrand yeah yeah yeah yeah so the the distinction there is that uh if you look at the open source definition the way it starts is that open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect modify and enhance and So Meta comes out Facebook comes out and with llama and they say hey anyone inspect modify and enhance except for these set of people over here they can't do it and that goes directly against what open source is I mean it does but and so that's fine if they want to do that they're complete they can do whatever they want it's still I a net good over not releasing anything I'm kind of AAG pragmatist but call it something else yeah well I just I want to jump in in Zuckerberg doesn't care though he's going to call it open source till the day he dies he he's just like very pragmatic in everything he does um but but on a net like on a balance I'm very glad that it's available and that you know freeo camp like the other 99.99999% of organizations out there can use it as though it was and you know like these giant corporations that have trillion dollar market caps and stuff they can just trade money back and forth and and figure out a way to make it work right it's not hurting the little guy and it's actually helping the little guy so I would say uh I think that this sort of thing is fine but I agree it should not be called open source it should be called something else uh open source is a marketing term it just poisons the well it like makes people cynical um like I don't want people contributing to free Cod Camp to stop because like hey free Cod Camp's gonna everybody's just gonna grab their their their rugs and they're going to pack up their stuff and they're going to leave with all our contributions in tow right uh so so I do think it it's it harms the ecosystem for sure um but but again I just want to emphasize Facebook was very transparent in what they're doing I don't like the fact that they use the name but like I will be pretty pissed if they go back and they change the terms uh again to like oh actually if you have more than 10 million because we noticed free Camp was using it and we want free Camp to give us money right like I'll be very upset if uh those terms you know keep changing downward and if this is a trend of like kind of like a tightening of like cranking the ratchet yeah yeah because not every like free Cod Camp has a million people that use it every day right but we don't we're not a multimillion dollar like I'm trying to think of any company that has more than a million people who use it every day that doesn't have any money it's like a tiny charity right like there there really aren't very many like Wikipedia is probably the only other website I can think of that has millions of people using it that also doesn't have just a ton of money now and they've gotten some criticism for having a lot of money but like if you if you look at like hundreds of millions of dollars saved at Wikipedia it's a fraction a fraction apple has a 100 billion dollar in cash reserves hundred billion doll that's like the market cap of like 10 of their competitors or something right just in cash so so criticizing Wikipedia for having like $200 million in their endowment or whatever or it's it's to totally different and I I hope people don't fall for that kind of I guess anti nonprofit rhetoric CU there are some people that just want to watch nonprofits fail they want to see they don't want to believe that Charities can exist and they don't want to believe in altruism and all this stuff and they've got this weird worldview I don't see how calling things open source that aren't open source does further our cause though as developers who believe right the software wants to be free and also believe that if you build something you should be able to get money from it but like monetize something else don't monetize the open source part of it have like an open core model and I think there are lots of companies that have an open core model or my favorite model and I'm not sure how profitable this is but I met with Jeff Atwood founder of stack Overflow uh cofounder actually with with Joel pulin and I've interviewed both of them on the free cooking podcast uh both both interviews that in my humble opinion if you're a serious Dev you should go listen to they drop so much knowledge but I I do see how uh like with Discord it's free it's open source but you can pay them and you get a nice hosted preconfigured setup and like if you're a busy website owner and you don't want to hire like a freelance Dev have to go and configure this and maintain it and stuff just pay them like a hundred bucks a month and they'll handle the hosting they'll handle the security they'll handle everything so I I think that that is a good model and I think the model of like let's just get a whole bunch of critical mass around this project and then we'll just change the license and sell it to IBM I don't think that's good and I think that's really damaging and it may be good for that that individual firm but it's one of those kind of like uh like tragedy of the commons open source is the comment right the term open source the notion that anybody can contribute to software and this process that takes unpolished rocks drops them in the RO rock tumbler that is open source and you pull out these beautiful polished stones at the end of it because you know given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow you've got all these devs that care that want to make things better that are volunteering their time like that beautiful process that that we started uh that has been part of the hacker ethic ever since you know personal computers arrived back in the 70s like like we're losing that to cynicism we're losing that uh if if we don't protect this definition of Open Source so yes I am absolutely willing to say llama is not open source right if that means that we can keep open source protected in its current state and you know the bureaucrats over at like OSI probably don't get nearly enough credit for like doggedly defending what what seems like a pedantic distinction but you and I know that it's not a pedantic distinction this is if this Falls it's just like a whole bunch of other dominoes are going to fall and we're going to lose what we have right yeah the the strength of the brand of Open Source if I can just use the term brand even though sometimes that's a has a negative connotation but I mean it really is knowing something's open source it immediately speaks to a lot of people about what that means and the strength of that is how clear it is right like when you say open source I know what that means you know what that means and we can and and all let the Goodwill flow right oh yeah we can use it for our website let's grab it you know of course now there's permissive license and there's copy Left Right license and so there's that little bit of a rift inside of Open Source both those are open source things and so there are nuances there but generally speaking saying something open source means so much to so many people and it's very clear and so yes the people who want to muddy that definition and bring things in and call them open source that aren't they will characterize the Defenders of the definition the OSI and people who believe it's important as pedantic stagy you know whatever word nerds like all kinds of things like nobody cares you're the only ones that care it's like they have to care so that the rest of us don't have to think about it and once that Clarity is destroyed now the basically the the term is destroyed and now we don't know what it means you say it's open source I don't really know what that means anymore and we've lost something that's been really a huge value to so many people around the world 100% And I I just want to make it clear like I use the term bureaucrat not pejoratively I actually believe bureaucracies are good in a lot of cases like they slow things down and in a lot of cases that's what you want you want people whose job it is is to be pedantic and to split hairs and and to really make sure that uh nobody's getting away with like you know moving the uh proverbial Overton window to where like oh this is open source now it's okay it's like it's standard for companies to have all these restrictions on their open source software that didn't exist 10 years ago but now exists so I I just want to be clear if anybody from OSI is listening uh when I use the term bureaucrat I'm not using it pejoratively to imply you know some like dber esque figure in a cubic maze somewhere right like right pointy head pointy boss I think that bureaucracy is a lot like the helicopter parenting right like we need some of that but the problem is that we get steeped in too much of it and everything grinds to a complete Halt and which is why so many people see it as a insult to say bureaucrat because we got too much of it we but that doesn't mean we don't want any of it like we got to have it it's important but we got to also keep it in check just like that helicopter Mom or Dad yeah needs to be needs to keep their safety precautions in check right they should be there but too much actually is damaging and so I agree with you I was using it not that way either but people who will Lobby or will lob insults against the OSI and the work they're doing uh will certainly use it in that way now they are working on an open source AI definition it's not out yet they've been working on it for a while we had the executive director of The OSI on the show sometime this year it's in the feed for those who are interested he's going through the process with the community of like okay great we'll do that yeah he's been defining uh trying to Define what it means open source AI because if you noticed when I read that uh that blurb it's open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect modify andh that leaves out a a large part of what L what these models are right it's not just source code it's more than that and so the current open source definition doesn't exactly map one to one on these models which is why a lot of the clarity is starting to get muddied and so they're working on coming up with an open source AI definition they're working very hard and it's like a lot of con bureaucrats having conversations but people who are well intentioned and doing good work and they need to get it out soon so that we can start to Define what these models which ones are open source and which ones aren't yeah that's cool uh I'm excited to listen to that episode and again I'm going to link that in the show notes anybody who cares about this I I can totally understand like I'm a developer like a lot of the way I describe the audience for the show approximately one3 students onethird working devs one3 people that are working in other fields that are trying to transition into developer roles and I can totally understand how if you're like a student or you're like somebody TR to transition in the roles you have more urgent considerations then what is open source you know how do you define open source right but uh I do think like sooner or later like like it's good to give you some exposure to these Concepts and to this frankly this Battleground uh for the soul of Open Source uh and maybe we can talk about some of the other things going on in open source so we talked about like relicensing but what are some of the other macro Trends if you will I don't know I don't like that term macr Trend what are some of the other Trends macro Trends sounds very yeah it sounds very uh Harvard School business okay so like uh the big yeah exactly take me back to my economics days um you know the big Rusty right is certainly happening everything's getting Rewritten in Rust this was a big Push by Josh O's and the fine Folks at let's encrypt like let's rewrite a lot of the internet's core infrastructure which is open source projects you know largely let's rewrite them in memory safe languages specifically rust is the one that's getting most adoptions so there's a whole lot of things that we cover it's like it's X but it's written in Rust it's why but it's written in Rust and so that's currently the you know the porting language everyone's porting things to rust um especially things that were written in C and C++ that being said they're porting everything I mean the Linux jel is accep rust now yeah that's a big deal they're like the sest of Open Source like SAI mean like like kind of like very conservative and like Defenders again yeah yeah so the fact that rust has made an impact even over there even Lon of toal seems to be a fan of it uh and it's hard to make that guy happy right yeah encryption stuff you know uh TLS uh web servers load balancers anything that's running you know the core internet infrastructure is seen rewrites and memory safe languages a lot of them in Rust um go as well but rust seems to be the darling right now in terms of languages there's some upand coming languages which are cool gleam is a really interesting language which just hit 1.0 recently uh we have The Gleam Creator on the show last month very much kind of a a working person's language that has learned type safe learned from a lot of other great languages taking cues from Elixir taking cues from rust from go from Ruby uh from typescript and like trying to create one that compiles to earling code actually so it runs on the earling VM which is like rock solid uh actor modelbased BM that's been powering you know telefony for 40 years I don't even know how long so gleam is cool Tel by the way languages telephone related stuff is how describe it's a fancy sounding word but it basically just means like you know uh switch code and like I don't know yeah like yeah things that we don't think about much like uh remember the term pots I fig learned that one in school PS the plain old telephone system which was like you know copper wires I ran around on poles everywhere and now it's all of course fiber optics the different G's right the cellular networks but so Ericson erlang is from Ericson that's the ER Sony Ericson so coming out of that place in the world very much have been like doing hot code deploys since you know you and I were in diaper so these guys know know what they're up to and so the earling is a very Rock Solid virtual machine and um people are now building things on top of earling such as Elixir such as this new gleam language that's so cool I had no idea that erlang came from like Sony Erikson language yeah now I can see why it's like super old it's been around a long time yeah gleam yeah exactly gleam is a cool name like have you ever seen that movie gleam in the cube like uh Gleaming the Cube 1980s is that is that a Christian Slater skateboarding movie I think so is it about skateboarding is it about what's uh what is gleam in the cube I'm forgetting now it's about skateboard remember we Nam an episode Gleaming the yeah I think it's about skateboarding gaming the cube 1989 there's another great skateboarding or not but Christian Slater 80s movie about Pirate Radio called Pump Up the Volume have you seen that oh yeah Pirate Radio I remember that that's a great movie man I have yeah he stuck it to the m Slater was the man back in the day yeah yeah he's a cool dude he's in Mr Robot he's a cool actor um oh yeah he is yeah Mr Rob yeah uh so uh that's another trend is uh erlang man I still can't get over that Erics I I heard that I've heard people talk about so much over the years and I had no idea um plain old telephone system telephony you're like really shaking loose a lot of the connections in my brain I'm really rattling some things in your brain there Quincy other Trends yeah earling is cool so gleam the rust rewrite there's other language coming up there's one called called uh junee which is trying to be be like a rust successor that's got all of the benefits of rust but a little bit easier to use because a lot of the the hurdle learning rust is allegedly High I've never learned it myself so I can't speak to that but um if anyone wants to learn rust free C Camp does have a fully interactive rust course you can go through and you can learn while coding rust uh so just Google you guys have at all now it's crazy we want to be comprehensive uh but it we don't actually have interactive everything interactive is like we we got a grant from replit and we use that to uh fund development of this course oh nice yeah um that's cool very cool so lots of languages but like let's say you're a developer you're parachuting into Tech in 2024 which is when we're recording this and uh there's a whole lot of you know things whizzing past really quickly right it's like it's like The Fifth Element like all those cars and these giant grids and you just emerge from your like little you know glass coffin you're you're the the woman from Fifth Element though spoiler alert You're The Fifth Element right and and you see all this this crazy world run spoiler horn we'll get you yeah yeah U sorry spoiler alert for a 30o put in there but I know you don't edit yeah so um yeah what are the trends that you think that people should be like tapped into like what do you think that people should be paying attention to how do they find the signal in the noise yes so it depends on what area of the industry they're interested in but let's just take one that most of us touch which is web development because that one's pretty common right like if you're developing for the web which is most people um the trend right now is a return to server side rendering away from client side rendering and single page applications uh mostly powered by react but you know angular Ember uh and friends so a long time for a long time we swung away from serers side rendering right we wanted to have a Json API and a rich client that you deliver to the device that then uh handles all the logic and hits the Json API and renders the HTML for you that has a lot of complexity and drawbacks uh especially around routing especially around hydration especially around performance especially on uh resource constrained devices and networks which like Quincy said even in America we got people on slow networks on Old devices but you go outside of even you know First World countries and you find a lot of people on really old phones on slow networks and turns out that good oldfashioned Dynamic websites rendered by a server and then uh fancified from there progressively enhanced is a tried andr method method that I think people are rediscovering at the moment and so what's old is new again and what's interesting is the old things that have been doing it that same way the entire time uh the react team is now you know rolling out react server components this is very much an attempt to stay relevant in a serers side rendered world and I think they might succeed on that just because they have so much momentum but it's complicated because they didn't start there it's difficult to to completely change the direction in which you think about a program and that's what the react team is doing and they're going to have to bring all the react developers along with them to get there and so so many people have been thinking Client First Client First Client First it's very hard to then think server first unless you have a tool kit that makes that easy to think about and so we're starting to see uh tools like HTM X which is doing that we're starting to see Phoenix a live view which is providing that kind of thing we're seeing that return to Ruby on Rails and kind of a Revival of rails right now because it's just so batteries included to do that traditional web app that it serves most people most of the time pretty well yeah and so very much what's old is New Again returning to the server is new and just a more straightforward lifestyle I think yeah so kind of than the way we've been doing it the last decade Back to Basics like let's get back to what worked good enough that was quick that didn't have the ridiculous front end complexity uh like like like it used to be like people would joke like oh you know like I'm I'm a real program I do backend developer you just do front end you know but now front end is like potentially more complicated than back end in a lot of cases so it is yeah so it's really interesting to to hear that like rails is experiencing a Renaissance if anybody listening to this is a rails Dev and they want to potentially create an uptodate rails app we do have or rails course we do have a lot of requests for people teaching Ruby on Rails uh and our rails courses are sadly kind of outdated because they not that many people have cared about rails it hasn't been super relevant recently right no it hasn't but the to to the credit of the Rails Community there have been lots of shops that have just keep keep on plugging at rails and keep improving it I was a rails developer originally my first software developer job was working at a rails shop like maintaining this pretty large application telepan related application that would handle like yeah yeah pretty cool so other Trends I'm going to keep asking other Trends until you run out of interesting things to say cuz I'm learning a lot from run out of Trends yeah Okay cool so if we leave web development specifically and we go to kind of what we're seeing on the trending Pages um I think you know AI everything this one's obvious but really just trying to integrate different AI tools and and to land on a toolkit that is approachable and usable by most people most of the time really hasn't came out yet I think olama right now is probably the best one in that that place o l l ma it uh provides easy access to llama but also other models like mistol and probably Google stuff if they put anything out there um people are trying to Grapple with how we as working developers should be approaching deploying right productizing Ai and making our projects better with it but there's just a whole bunch of other things that are like you know I've slapped AI on a thing and just a lot of that I mean it's trending I think it's kind of silliness but it's certainly happening and so most of the trending projects on GitHub right now are AI related and it's been that way for a good 18 months and I'm hoping that it ends soon but I don't think it's going to what's your take I have to get your take AI sure in its current iteration lots of chat Bots like maybe people doing stuff on the back end where they're like having the machine talk to itself and like they're using words to get to evoke sentiments among machines so that it can paint in like a certain style or do stuff like what we we can just do a lightning around like like what are the yeah most interesting and impactful aspects of AI what what is stake and what is Sizzle okay so I've heard the current round of models described as calculators for words and that's stuck with me quite a bit I think Simon willson either coined that or told me about it and somebody else coined it but if you think about them as calculators for words now you can start to see especially we're talking language models I'm not talking image models or sound models but you can start to really think about them in a way that's very useful of course uh anything that is is um generating a prompt for you to be creative around whether Pros or code right so as starter uh autocomplete aut complete on steroids I think is a really valuable tool for anybody because now you've got steroids but they're not injected into your body so they're not going to harm you right um they could harm your over too much steroid use can harm your body I mean they they could introduce bad habits like I was talking with the primagen uh the the YouTube Creator and he said that he found that like he he he called it the uh the copilot pause like you type something and you just pause and you wait for copilot to do your job for you and it it how it weaken him as a developer but uh and I turn that off honestly I don't do any autocomplete myself but I've never been an autocompleter as a coder I've never been like types what they call it not type sense uh Intellis sense you know like tab I I tab complete but I don't let it like tell me all the functions that are currently available and all that kind of jazz that so many fancy tools provide because I do not like the I like that the copilot pause I really dislike that I think if I was less set in my ways a little bit younger a little bit greener in my development so this is is not for everybody but for me I have to stop and then think about something else which is like somebody else wrote some code I should look at right now and I don't like that code or oh I do like that code so the way that I use the tools currently is to go and ask you know so keep it in a tab basically I'm just a chat GPT and a tab guy at this point in my life and I will go and ask it I'll say hey write me a function that does this you know and I'll then I'll look at it and bring it in or not but the pause the copilot pause for me it just throws me out of my flow and I found it very distracting not just with copilot but I've tried uh Source graphs Cody I tried tab n and I tried copilot um as recently as about six months ago so maybe better now it really rips me out because now I'm not thinking about what I was thinking about I'm thinking about what somebody else is thinking about and I have to then decide to use or or destroy you know so I feel that I'm I'm I'm going to start using that phrase copilot cause copilot pause but as prompt as a I mean especially when I'm writing code that I don't write very often is very nice to just go you know calculate some words for me that I can judge and throw in my code if I want to um huge Boon a huge Boon for developer productivity and I don't see us going back for sure yeah Jared anything else we should talk about before we let you go back to your six kids and uh yeah everything else you got going on you're a busy man producing several podcasts a week being on a lot of these guest podcasts uh did yeah I guess instead of just asking like super open into question let me ask you what's going on at the change log what are you all most excited about okay well uh as we record this we're headed off to Microsoft build next week Microsoft invited us out to their annual developer conference is it a developer conference I don't know their annual conference where they invite people to the podcast AWS rein or what is it it's like a developer FOC I think it's way smaller than reinvent but yeah I would call it developer focused um it's been a few years since we've been there we used to go to it Ann we did it annually for a couple years and then I think pandemic stopped that and now they're inviting us back um they do a bunch of announcements a lot of it's kind of azure focused it'll be AI focused and you know we get a talk with the people moving and shaking inside of Microsoft which we don't otherwise do very often because we do really camp out more on the open source side of things but hey Microsoft is crossed the aisle you know yeah Darth Vader has taken his mask off and he realized that there was good inside him all along um that is such a such a poyant and accurate description of what we went from linux's cancer to Microsoft actually caring about open source and investing in it talk about a 180 you know that's like the rug push you know it's like the one that we wanted instead of the rug P they rug push it's a fine rug woven by my family yes yeah please take it free here's some free Azure credits too please sign up um so yeah it'll be interesting to talk about Azure and kind of what they're up to there because it's not really a world that I live in and I'm always curious um so we're doing that next week so that's kind of what's what's currently burgeoning but you know just trying to find what's interesting in the world and shine a light on it just the same thing we've always been doing uh have as great have great conversations and share them with people who are interested um our community is really thriving you know we have an active slack Community with people who are really cool and they like to hang out we play games in there there's like a Wordle Channel if you're into like daily games where everyone shares their scores there's conversations around our podcast there's like a channel for each language so there's like little sub niches inside of there it's an active slack but it's not a too active slack which I like like you people come in and hang out and they're working and they're not paying attention and it's like quiet for a long time and then there'll be a little burst of conversation and um I really enjoy that so that's that's happening you that's totally free to sign up for um on our website and yeah man just trying to talk to cool people like yourself and and see what they're doing and share that with the world man it's so great to catch up with you and glean your insights there's the word glean gleam gleam your insights no I don't think you can use that one close off by one yeah uh but it's so cool to uh to follow up with you man I'm looking forward to hanging out with you next time we're both at a conference probably in San Francisco uh yeah are you doing conferences yeah what's that are you doing conferences again or you would love to go to some confer uh I mean I probably I would want to like ideally be like speaking at the conference if if if I can if anybody is running a conference and wants quy Larson to come to your conference if you will I don't even charge a speaking fear or anything I if you fly me out and put me in a decent hotel where I can you know get eight or nine hours of sleep before I go on stage let me know I'm open to it uh and uh yeah just reach out to me cuz I do enjoy meeting people I enjoy learning from people and I enjoy having opportunities to be in the same you know under the same giant roof as Jared and be able to catch up with him yeah right and you know potentially eat a steak so yeah yeah yeah and uh I'm just learning so much from you man and both from your podcast and from this past you know hour and a half conversation you and I just had and uh I'm just so thrilled and relieved that you and Adam have figured out a way to make this work you've built a business over the years uh through you know relevant ads that's one of the things is like I listen to a lot of podcasts and it's just like these terrible Spotify ads like random you know products and services I have no interest in but like I actually really you know a lot of the ads we've heard on change log that's probably influenced decisions that we make around SAS products and stuff like oh yeah you know because they they're hip enough to realize like Jared podcast is worth advertising on uh then that means they probably actually know about open source they probably actually care about contributors it's not just you know a bunch of sales people trying to jam unnecessary products down people's throats right so yeah and we're picky as well like we have the great privilege of being able to pick and choose who we work with so we're not going to take uh money from a company that we wouldn't want our listeners to know about and so because of that our ads are pretty relevant we have a we do have a membership which people sign up for which you can make the ads disappear you know like a direct support kind of a thing and so we like that as an option we have people who sign up for that and they're like hey man uh just happy to support you guys but can I turn the ads back on because I kind of appreciate your ads I find out about new products that way and we're like sorry dude that no that's you made them disappear you can't do like you can still subscribe to the public feed but uh it's not how we designed the program it's kind of funny that's a that's a weird Edge case I am a change log Plus+ member I think I have been for several years and uh support frankly I just listen to the ad feed myself I haven't never bothered like getting the ad free feed so so you're one of those you're a supporter that just supports us but you don't actually listen I mean like if the ad is interesting I'll listen to it or I'll just like double tap on my like little iPod thing but uh on a whole I've learned about interesting things and sometimes your little interview SE segments with you know the founder or or some person like the C of yeah is interesting it's the extra content that I'm getting that I didn't even ask for or even know I wanted uh but yeah man I'm like so glad you all are making this work and that uh you're out there not just reporting what's happening but kind of advocating for open source you seem to care about the fabric of the community and to the extent that you're raising awareness of like you know Rogue polls and things like that and kind of I'm not going to say like naming and shaming because you're very diplomatic in how you do it but like just advocating for Developers advocating for people who volunteer their open their time to tribute to open source and again a huge shout out to the thousands of kind folks who donate their expertise to our charity in our community Through open source contributions I mean like this is what separates the developer Community from everybody else like whenever people are coming in the tech they're like I can't believe people are so forthcoming with information like there's so much free learning resources and like people are so chill they'll just like help you out right like you go to a conference and people are eager to help you out this is like part of hacker culture it goes back to 1970s right if you read hackers Heroes of the revolution information wants to be free right like that kind of ethos the the full quote is information wants to be free it also wants to be expensive right and that's why you know you have people deciding making those decisions like hey we've got valuable information we've got valuable software let's change the license and make people give us you know Enterprise you know pay for Enterprise licenses uses and stuff right but but right you all are kind of like helping uh propagate and maintain that culture of giving and uh like kind almost like a post scarcity you know Star Trek type society that open source represents like sure and for that I applaud you sir well thank you I appreciate that oh you're literally applauding yeah I'll do I'll do the quick golf clap I don't want to disturb anybody who's like listen but yes uh yeah I I I greatly value the work and I literally directly support you with my own funds this is not coming from fre this is coming from my own wallet and uh yeah uh keep keep it up man thank you I appreciate your direct support we appreciate I appreciate you bringing me on the Pod uh I can give back the exact same Kudos maybe even to a magnified extent because your impact has been so massive it's amazing to see I can't believe some of the numbers that you do just with the the YouTube and the and the number of people have gone through the courses and how many get jobs and like so cool I've been rooting for you for many years and just keep killing it because free code Camp I mean it's like I feel like you guys have like you offer almost everything that you need to get started and so I love having that stock answer of like just go to freec cook camp.org Quincy will take care of you it's not just Quincy he's got he's built an army of volunteers you know and they are working diligently to make sure that so many people can Thrive by leveraging software skills and I think it's such an amazing thing that you're providing I I really do love it awesome thanks for your kind words that's what it's all about getting more people into Tech helping people be able to sur you know not just like survive but actually provide for their families and feel like they have some degree of agency some degree of control over their careers they can take their skills they can go launch companies they can uh move across the country to take like an exciting new job they can do whatever they want right they can potentially immigrate to New countries uh we've had a lot of guests on the show that have been able to do that uh thanks to the exalted status that software Engineers have in contemporary Society so how do we help more people realize that dream and uh again like we're doing like a lot of the the ground level education you're doing a lot of the continuing education and and you're continually educating me about developments in open source going deeper going longer yeah all right well hey everybody well like I said appreciate you yeah I hope everybody enjoyed listening to this conversation with Jared be sure to check the links below listen to that podcast that we linked uh is the OSI um the rep uh the open source initiative um that's going to be a really cool podcast that I'm listen to later today when I'm going for a walk and uh until next week everybody happy coding
