hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse today we're gonna do some work with react and I must start out the stream by telling you a little bit about my morning so far just because it was out of the ordinary so if you notice I have a tie which I don't normally have so I thought that I had a presentation today and I was going to present this site that we've been working on to all the like the vice presidents and the heads of all the departments of the school and I thought that the meeting was going to be early like it was gonna start at 900 a.m. but I didn't know where it was so I thought wow I need to get up early and get in here early so I can get everything ready there were still a few more things that I wanted to do to the site before I presented so I got up at 530 a.m. and got on the exercise bike and started making some updates to the site then and my oldest son was actually up with me so I ended up only doing a little bit of work in the morning and then he and I watched YouTube videos and for the rest of my workout but then I got into work at 730 a.m. which is which is pretty early for me I never get in before 800 and I was working and working and it was almost nine o'clock and I'm texting my boss like hey where's this meeting at and he finally texts me back and says oh it's tomorrow oh so the good news is I have more ready than I thought I would before the meeting and I have you know more time now to get things ready so that's cool I'm gonna meet later on today and kind of go over a little bit more about like what basically about what the people that I'm going to present to are looking for so I can make sure I give them the right information but anyway I said is what it is kind of like I wore the outfit I wanted or where to look professional today so I don't know what I'm gonna wear tomorrow but anyway that I guess so I've been doing a few things to the site I'll go over them just really quickly and then I'll check out the live chat as well before we start so I guess the most technically challenging thing that I did and it's still not very challenging but the most technically challenging thing is that we have different logos now depending on screen width so we have this more narrow version of the logo and then it comes out to the full version so I just did that with the builtin hidden components that material UI has so this is in the app bar component if you want to check it out everything in github is up to date so we're all starting at the same point and I'm gonna start up let me start our bank drop before I forget so y'all can check this out as as I'm going over it and I'll put this in the live chat oops I don't have my screen up sorry anyway let me do this again so when we go like this the logo changes we pop it back out and it goes here so that's that's what it did sorry about that and then I changed this in the backgroundcolor I got rid of that purple that we had that was just kind of for demonstration to make sure it was full with and let's see I added in some some more cards with a Lum nigh profile and a faculty profile and so we went out some of those fairs and then I merged in a pull request from Harshit that fixed some of the errors that we were getting in the car I should say it warnings that we were getting and also fixed some issues we were having with clientside routing that I wasn't even aware of that we weren't getting the proper behavior with clientside routing because of the all the custom stuff we were doing with routing so if you want to check that out that's the last pull request that was merged in there was a lot to it so if you can go through I'm not even go through at all and in this dream because it could easily take up you know a half hour just going through it all but I appreciate that and some of the other things that it did do was harsh it fix this little hover so we get the correct color and I'll have to also do the same thing here so I'm just gonna have to look and see what he did and let's see that I fix I think I changed size and positioning of some things up here so a lot of little things nothing huge hearts should also did some work with the the cards to make them look a little nicer I still want to try it looks like right now everything just goes to two columns with some of these I think are too big like obviously these profiles like are getting just huge so might want to see about extending this to three columns at some point instead of just two but it does look a lot better than it did there's not as many gaps okay so today Sood I was working on oh sorry I said I was gonna check out the live chat first let me see what's in the live chat and then we'll be started hey josh says it's first time he got the first comment in its first time here so welcome thanks for coming in is here hey Emma let's see if somebody god so love 24 says hello I'm brand new a coating just got to the dedication page product for HTML alright cool welcome if you're just starting out there may be a lot that we're doing that may be a little bit beyond where you're at you know and you're learning so feel free to ask you so many questions as you can and totally understand if you know maybe you're not there yet and really don't want to watch that's cool too I'll do my best to explain as I'm going on hey a lot of other people saying hello Christopher you are not too late the live coding is about to start Michael says the even gooder news is that you can go to dinner tonight and look like an adult I actually I can't but my son has a karate class so probably not wife will be there because I don't think I'm gonna be home early enough to take him but I guess I will look alright Emerson said at least you're looking good today yeah let's see let's see Christopher brown says YouTube video on page is overrated try using custom video player I'm not sure which which you mean Christopher so let me know Lawson at 3 says shout out to my nephew Robert he's a 12 year old aspiring programmer all right awesome Robert that's really cool you your programming and twelve years old so keep at it and I'm sure you'll be if you're not already programming better than me you probably will be if you keep keep up the learning alright okay so that's everything right now that's in the live chat I'm gonna start my my Pomodoro timer and we're going to do 25 minutes of some coding and be working in react today after the 25 minute timer goes up I'm going to take a little break and go back to the live chat answer any questions that you have let's see also want to invite everyone if you happen to be on Instagram check out you if you want check out my Instagram profile there's a link to it if you go to my youtube channel that's linked in the description I have my links to all my social networks Instagram will be on there I think it's Jesse I go is my name but anyway I put coding stuff on there too and I also announce when I'm going to stream and I do on Twitter as well so if anybody's interested you like to watch a stream or like the kind of stuff that I'm doing that's just kind of another place where I I put some info all right so let's work on this top let me scroll down quickly actually let's let's do that this is what I was going through making sure that we're getting we have these set to the right sizes see cuz I kinda I don't want an image like this to be very small so let's go back here and change that while I I see it and before I forget there we go for now that'll just make it look a little bit nicer and yeah so we're not really it's not like this is the finished version of this or anything but if I do go to show a larger version you know on a larger screen tomorrow then at least there won't be gaps all right so let's look at this section here so what I'd like to do and I'm we have been going kind of mobilefirst with everything but I know that in my presentation they're probably gonna want to see the fullscreen version even if nobody asks I know my department had at some point is gonna say why don't you show them the full version so I want to get this cleaned up a bit I think that we could do without some of the space here and we could cut down on the space between these just a bit by a few pixels add more space and here lino saw better so there's a lot of alignment things that I think we could do yeah we can we definitely do some better things with that and that'll be the first thing that everyone sees so I'd say that's that's worth spending the limited time on that that we have before tomorrow's presentation well Christopher Brown did clarify about the video since you're using a YouTube video on the website rather than html5 video player which you can create your own style controls for the video player which is better than embedded YouTube video yeah we had thought about doing that I it's still possible we've done that on some other sites i popping a youtube video in here was just the easiest way to get something up on the screen to see how it looks so I'm still open to doing that the only thing I'm not sure about with the videos is and this is what I like about YouTube videos let me know Christopher if if there's something similar we can do as well with using the html5 video is for YouTube it will automatically scale the video resolution based on you know the user and what their connection is capable of can I do that somewhat easily with the html5 video tag and you know what would I need multiple versions of the video and if I go to switch video I need multiple versions of it every time because these videos are gonna switch out and the the people who are going to be switching them aren't really going to be video people or coders so taking into account all of that is there way we could use the video tag instead of the YouTube embed to accomplish the same thing and still be as user friendly if there is a way and I just don't know about it I'd love to know about it because we could definitely get a nicer UI I don't like having the big red YouTube button right in the middle here it's not really part of our color scheme let's see okay so let's go into your check first of all let me make this bigger this is probably hard for everyone to see I'm gonna try to shrink this as small as I can and still keep you know what we can we could probably make this bigger let's just pop it up fullscreen there we go I kind of like it here like really small and then that way I'll know for sure whether I'm making this too big and it will overlap anything so first things first this logo I think could be a bit bigger but you know what maybe we oughta try to shrink this first before we mess with the logo and then that that way we'll know how much space above and below that we're working with that seems like that maybe that'll be the more sensible way to go about it all right so the first thing I do want to look at it these options because I think I I just put too much too much padding in here where am I even getting the padding at huh that's a hmm maybe the sketch that changed I thought I had this setup differently at some point maybe I was mistaken okay all right see what we have here I definitely think that we can take this padding off of the top so having top zero whoops you know I don't I don't want it off of here so let's get rid of it on here just put it on this outlet there we go so that removes a bit of space in here which is exactly what I wanted and that looks good so let's go over to the code now and find where I need to put this style in line for that to work and you should be in the app bar component oops oh you see this is where I did the the logos we just use this hidden component so the the logo that's just fu s is hidden on medium and up and then the D logo that is the full Franciscan is hidden on small and down just ended up being pretty simple once I remembered that this was an available component alright so here are all our social media icons so down below that will be the menu that we're trying to to change okay our menu item okay call them to bottom let's check out that class call them to bottom display flex okay so that is this display flex center Center and okay great so if we put this padding top zero on to here then we should be fine and since we're just putting a number an integer in here we don't need the quotation marks oh yeah okay so we've gotten rid of that style we just put in dev tools and you could see should we wait a second we may need to let's give it a refresh and just just to verify that that style is not working we need may need to make that an inline style then yep so it looks like our paddingtop zero is being overridden by this so we could do we could put important here but I don't want to go too important that should be like the last thing that you try everything else doesn't work so since this is coming in a style tag this style tag evidently is being inserted further down the page than this one that's why it's overriding this one so it's also possible that this one is just more specific so if you see this just selects the class but this selects the class two classes right so the class that's the child of of this class so specificity could be an issue here as well but in any case we can without resorting to important we can definitely make this work if we just make it inline so let's go back to our code we'll take this out so we don't need it there and then we'll go down to our actual component and I know that this component is huge right now like this whole entire thing so eventually this will be refactor and everything will be split out into their own components so I just don't want anybody to think that we would like to leave a component like this because we won't but sometimes before things are finalized it's just easier to work with it in one place I find if I start to refactor too early sometimes I'll end up the leading components that I don't need anymore that I could have saved time and never even made them so on this grid item we're gonna add a style tag or style attribute and we're gonna put in double quote or double brackets which means we're gonna go into JavaScript first right with that first bracket and then the second bracket is since we're already in JavaScript the bracket just means a it's an object alright so we're going to pass it the script object and it will be paddingtop we can okay suit and then we can put the zero and let's close that out so now when we save and check out our website we should see that as an inline style and it should override whatever else was there and we can see let's give it a refresh just just to make sure that's not anything left over from what we had there we go so here's our padding top that's showing up in line and that overrides the only thing now they could possibly override this style is if we were to put important and that's okay so since I did it like this that still leaves that possibility open later on if I'm if I really need to have something apply then I still have that option of using important so that's that's why we don't want to go straight to using important if we don't have to because then you you don't leave any option for yourself or other developers if they would like to you know change that then you know they're really limited that they have to go in and potentially change more than they would like to all right but anyway just just a few CSS thoughts from me so that's a little bit smaller okay I like that I think I think that's more reasonable in terms of height it's probably still a little bit taller than I would like but we you know we have two rows here for our content so you know maybe we could shrink this by another few pixels but I wouldn't go more than that at this point because it will get too jumbled so I think I'm gonna leave that for now as is and we can always go back and try to shrink it up more if we need to so since that as is here I do want to if I can quickly decrease the space here I would like to do that but I need to figure out where where we were actually getting that let's see okay I was just checking out my timer see how much time I have so in about eight minutes I'm gonna go back to the live chat and answer questions so if you have a question in there right now just please be patient for a few more minutes and and I will get to your question so I'm trying to figure out where this this gap is coming in if you could see the gap that's right here and then maybe I'm missing something but why and we're not setting the width of this element anywhere nowhere here we don't have any margin we have no padding set for that side I mean we do have text a line Masaki the chat really quickly to see if anyone sees anything that I don't all right I'm just gonna start going through some of these and seeing if anything okay all right so if we get rid of this displayinlineblock that definitely that's an effect but it also gives us a lot more space up here as well and I'm pretty sure that we added this in for reason so I'd rather not break something hmm you can shrink things up a bit if we get rid of that line height okay umberto saying is there an outer container for those using something like flex yeah I mean here's our container with Flex which because of the delay that's what I'm probably seeing it before you're seeing it then Qatar Rahman then then Qatar Oman I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name I'm trying to trying to sound it out anyway they say can you check the box model on the Ally yeah let's check computers but we did have something Warbucks yeahit's guess it's not gonna matter either way hey Nikki how's it going this this is probably unrelated but it kind of bothers me that there's no ul for these allies I don't know how that happened but it seems to me that these should all be inside of the UL right so maybe we could keep the grid here but I guess we just we didn't put them inside of UL because we created these hat bar menu item components which I haven't looked at that component for a long time yeah so these are all just allies so we really should be putting this in a ul I'm just kind of wondering you like would it mess up screen readers and things like that if we if we didn't have this and I don't really know the answer to that but we have kind of more proper use of the HTML tags and it's it's not gonna hurt yeah it is all right yeah so that definitely did mess things up let's let's see if we can switch this there we go okay so if we just move the all this flex stuff down one to our ul and then that helps all right so let's let's do that I'm about out of time for this Pomodoro session but I I think we're it in better shape here by adding the UL and so the last thing I'll do before we go before I go to live chat answer some questions is I'm gonna put this class down on the UL see where that gets us okay yeah that's not bad we can work with that all right let me set my timer then for five minutes and my phone is buzzing a lot I just want to see if there's anything important water's being turned off on campus but not in my building all right okay and my wife is messaging me also I don't think it's an emergency all right I'm gonna scroll up just a little bit and it's not too much in the live chat so I may be able to get through it all we'll see you never know sometimes I talk for five minutes just about one question Oh Harshit says that he can watched live today because tomorrow is a school holiday cool cool that's awesome Harshit is there some other time of day that we could do the livestream that you'd be able to watch or is it just going to be too much for you when schools in session because I'm pretty flexible we could try to do this a different time if you want but I totally understand if that's just too much and you can't do the live streams because of school and I don't want this to detract at all from your studies but let me know if there is something I can do to help it be you know easier for you to watch if you want to today's at school all the day for my kids so they didn't have to go to school today which is why I could come in early so I didn't have to drop them off at school / beli asks what the best programming languages in 2018 I don't know if I could answer that I think it just depends on what you have experience in and what you're trying to do I can I can say I think this is a very reasonable thing to say that JavaScript is probably the most versatile programming language right now because you can do clientside and serverside programming there are ways to program you know robots with JavaScript VR a are native apps you can use electron to make you know desktop apps there's just a lot that you can program with JavaScript so it's JavaScript the best I don't really know it's what I like to use and you can do a lot with it but that's I don't think that's a question that's you can answer easily so hopefully my answer is okay but I mean I know it's not really an answer to the question but that's a good answer that question is beyond me how should ask did you read the notes in the last PR attentively I don't know if I'd say attentively I looked through all the code pretty attentively but maybe I did not read it as attentively as I could I often go back and read through more attentively because I know there's there is more that I need to do so I did read that part that there's a lot of stuff that needs change now I didn't have time though before the video to change those things okay so Christopher Brown if you remember from earlier in the stream we were talking about ways to present videos in a webpage and we're talking about YouTube embeds versus the video tag and so Christopher said you can do different resolutions for different size devices and pixel densities with source set however Christopher is not aware of a way to do this with network speeds okay so I guess I'm gonna stick with the YouTube embeds for now because I really like that we can take into account a user's network speed I don't I want to avoid to things that that are a bad user experience so on the one hand you just put in high quality video and you people without a good network connection you know have a lot of buffering it doesn't play or people have a good network connection and it just crushes their data right so I don't want that but then the other extreme is okay well let's just put in really low quality videos so we respect people's data usage but then everybody gets you know this degraded user experience because they don't can't get the high quality videos so I don't really see it I think it would be difficult to find a way between those two extremes if we go with using source set with the video tag since it's already built in and it works with YouTube embed we do have to live with some limited functionality and we can't customize it completely but but in exchange for that I think we're giving the users a much better user experience we're also giving them the option to like save our video for later so you know if we go down here the video I can share right from here so we have the sharing right there we don't have to do anything extra to get that we can save it for later which i think is a really nice feature and then that will also direct users to our YouTube channel for more content and that all comes built in so there's definitely tradeoffs the embed is not for every situation the YouTube embed but if you can get away with it and that your client is okay with having some YouTube logos going on on their page you do get a you know a lot of advanced functionality you know basically for free so that's what we're going to use for now I do appreciate the suggestion though and if we can yeah if there were another way to do it I you know I'd definitely be up for it okay it looks like my timer did go off here but let me look I'm almost to the bottom of the live chat all right so we got we have a vote for the YouTube player San Bay says you look it's a misspelling but I'm assuming it meant to say you look good and if that's what is what you meant to save and thank you I tried to look good I shaved like this little top part of the beard you know and under here I combed my beard like I tried to bet I didn't have my presentation today but I guess I look alright for YouTube okay so I'm going to when I come back I'm gonna start within his question so any questions do you enjoy being a developer and so that's what we'll start with when after we do this next Pomodoro session let me see the time okay yeah we're definitely only gonna do one more session we might not even do a full session so basically since I came into work so early I'm gonna be at the point where I put in all the time I was supposed to put in today really soon but then I also have a meeting later and then so I have two meetings later backtoback so to avoid me going over my normal time I'm gonna take like a break so after this stream I'm going to work on the coding challenge that I was working on over the weekend so some of you saw on my channel I need a live stream Saturday morning well it was Saturday morning Eastern Time so I'm gonna go back and work on that I may even stream that on my channel if anybody's interested I think I I came close to a solution but I don't it was not the best way to do it so I might just change the whole thing but it needs to be done before Thursday so anyway that's why I'm not gonna do a longer stream today so I'll kind of take a little break work on that and then when it's time for my meetings oh I'll go to those all right so let me get back to we're working on ok I just kind of messed this up so do we have these little yeah we have these little disks here textdecoration we need textdecoration on here as well so I kind of work now I need to put them on the El eyes now it's list I wasn't it yeah I don't know why I sent text decoration liststyletypenone there we go okay so that you oneís liststyletypenone we popped that you owe in let's go up and put it in our class might not be a bad idea to rename this class let's do this menu lists lists outside none and that's gonna get rid of that little that disk or that circle that comes right next to all our list items so I don't know if you could see it on on your screen but it was showing up as white it was hard to see but if it happened to overlap another letter before it then you could see it and now we need to change this to menu this down here I think is this will make this naming will make more sense that'll be easier for me and anybody else working on this to tell what we're talking about then you list let's save that and verify that it did what we want looks like it awesome so I'm gonna refresh yeah all right that looks good now we're gonna do some work in dev tools just to get the spacing looking good so let's put some padding around these a tags that'll give us a larger click area so let's do padding I want to do padding let's say zero so we want top and bottom to be zero but then left and right to be four pixels okay so you got four pixels here and then if we go up to the L eyes and we put padding zero for pixels okay that's too big gives us a gap yeah I think this was the gap that we were working with before oh nice a bonus from what happened is we now this is not lined up vertically in a much better place here with with the rest of what we have so that's nice okay I'm gonna let me know in the live chat what do you think that this is too much space am I losing my mind here or what to me it just seems like too much space if I drop that down to two pixels is that more reasonable I kind of like that okay so it looks like more space is better so it looks like you are okay with that okay I'll flip it back back up so this gives us like sixteen pixels space we have four on there a tags and then four on our allies so that means between these were four four four and four which is 16 okay all right I'm okay with that if you all think it looks fine because I'm going to point an hour I've looked at this for way too long like I mean I've been looking at variations of this for literally months now because we've kind of been working on this even before we started working on the rest of the site so I don't think I'm in a place right now or I can look at this you know and in the right way you know definitely no with fresh eyes okay all right cool so let's add these on so we need to add it to the a tag and we need to add to the Li so that means we're going to be in that component we made for each of those items that app bar menu component so we have our list Li and then for a class name and then their ul link what was I thinking when I came up with these class names I mean I guess it makes sense but I'm just not sure why I said ul link would we say padding0 for and then we're going to do the same thing here the reason that I'm not putting all the padding on one element is because I want well I want two things I want to have a larger click area so if you see that the area you can click actually starts before you even hit the text so I want that larger click area it makes it easier to click but then I also don't want click areas right next to each other so you accidentally click the wrong thing so by using half the padding we want on the LI and the other half on the a we get both so we have a little bit extra so we have four pixels all the way around that extends further than the text to click but then we also have four pixels all the way around here which means we actually get eight pixels right so four for this Ally and four for this Li of space between so you see as I run my mouse over you can see the cursor changes so there's an area where I'm clicking right now and nothing's happening that's that's good that's what we want oops okay that's why I did it like that now I want to see if we can decrease this space because one since I did this I added this ul and you can see this ul comes in with all of this margin at the top and we definitely don't need that and we probably don't need any at the bottom either so let's get rid of any margin for this so we do that with margin zero wonderful all right this is what I was I was wanting in terms of the look for this top app bar you know you can't make it really slim if you're gonna have two rows of content but this is about as slim as we can make it I think and still leave enough space for everything to be readable and clickable all right great let's add that on to that ul then in our code so we need to jump back into our app bar and go to this menu list up at the top here and let's add our margin zero okay and the last thing that I want to do up here I would still like maybe to see this be a little bit more slim as a button but I I don't want to nitpick right now hmm that's interesting okay this is kind of it let's see if it doesn't when the screen is larger okay it doesn't alright so there's going to be an odd situation where if the screen is narrow enough it's gonna drop down like that I don't like that I'm gonna leave it alone for now I'll leave it alone for now in the hopes that maybe we could get this we could change this name or yeah yeah I don't think it's likely to happen but I know not everybody that kind of has a say in this really likes the title being faith in life right here so there's a chance that this might change so I'm not gonna try to fix this if it's gonna change all right so the last thing I want to do up here is make this larger so let's see where we have okay so right now it's just controlled I believe by this max height 3 or M let's see three point one three point five okay yeah so I actually I don't want it to be I don't want to do the height on this this is changing the height I believe for more than one section and let's see what happens if I add an height 100 pixels all right that max height is so overriding header image but I could change the max Heights area all right so with it being this large I just want to see if we I see so if we do make it that large then at some point we're gonna squish all these what just happened that's weird okay so let's let's go here and then we can really see at what point I need to stop making that bigger so let's go excite pixels so I definitely don't want it to be on your pixels but I thought I'd just start there Wow 48 this is the largest I can make it all right see how 48 looks we make it bigger uh I think I'm okay with 48 and I'm okay with that for now let me know where did that go I think I lost it when I was moving in and out whoops huh so that was already what we had anyway huh so this is actually what we had exactly so I guess we're keeping that yeah it really only looks small compared to the height we have on this and the amount of white space we have above and below so I don't like that I think I just wanted to have less white space but I mean I I suppose that I could just use a media query so that once we get down here then it starts to get smaller yeah let's try that let's see if we can use choose a media query to change the max height and make it let's try 80 pixels of course if we do that we need to also change this just right now where we're setting this height all right so we need to we need to change two places let's do that now before I forget alright so in our app bar I should have our image our header image and in our header image we can let's grab this media query and just reuse it now this is kind of the a different way to do media queries it's not going to look like what you used to it with regular CSS but since this is a JavaScript object we're going to do things differently and I lost there it is we're gonna put a comma remember this is JavaScript objects we need commas between all the items here but then down here we're gonna say and small and down so in this case we don't want small and down we want large and up so I think that should give us what we want we want large and up and we want that to be max height 80 pixels and let's copy that and set this on the menu button I'm not 100% sure this is the right one but let's try it was set on the menu button and we'll make the what was at the height the height 70 okay now we'll save that and see what happens all right so it's it's large right now we have that height 70 okay we have the media query showing up great so right there right where we wanted it it changes awesome awesome right and we're actually on just by me kind of eyeballing that it was only by a pixel or two you can see just very slight movement so I'm not even gonna try to make that precise because who's gonna sit here other than us and go like this to see the difference okay nice that header is looking like it's looking like it should look I still think that this icon here is a little bit off the the vertical alignment is off so wonder how we can correct that if I do oops there we go wonderful okay so for all these items I had paddingbottom of eight pixels so I just added the same paddingbottom of eight pixels to this and that'll work so let's just do that now in our app bar menu item whoops that's not it so we put it in I think we have it actually in this component so on our SVG icon the class name is search SVG so we'll add it there search SVG or is it at a show kind of sushi clothes search SVG there we go paddingbottom eight pixels save it great alright cool I'm I'm actually I'm pretty happy with that right now this is yeah this is probably the nicest that this app bar has looked so far all right I'm happy enough with this that I'm I would I would present this at my meeting so I think we're I'm gonna stop messing with this now to leave time for other things let me check how much time I have left here all three minutes okay let's just do a git status here see what we've changed get add and we're gonna do a yarn yarn cm okay that's gonna help us walk through this commit message so uh nice let's do a fix and say it's gonna be a just item spacing whoops ad j ust just a boy I was facing okay that's pretty much what we did right yeah okay hopefully we pass all the linting and the tests and everything and then I can push that to get up and everything will be available awesome okay cool I'm gonna go to the live chat now and answer all the rest of the questions so if you have a question please put it in the chat now and I will do my best to get through everything see how I am on time okay good yes so like I said after I end this stream I may take a little break and then I'm gonna work on another JavaScript problem on I'm gonna livestream it on my channel so not on the free code camp channel on my channel if anybody's interested that's going to be its it's not react at least not yet it's just plain vanilla JavaScript I mean it's it's node so it's JavaScript on the server side so I'm just working through a coding puzzle just with regular regular JavaScript so if you're interested come come join me there on my channel about I don't know maybe about 15 minutes after I finish up here okay I'm gonna scroll up I know I said I'd start with his question okay so in ass do you enjoy being a developer I I do enjoy being a developer so there are some parts of being a developer that aren't that great but I don't think it necessarily has to do with being a developer it's just I don't know work situation so trying to think if there's anything developer wise that I don't like hmm I really I like it I like building things I don't even mind that much when they don't work it's kind of to me like like a puzzle I try to figure out where the bug is I I guess the part that I don't enjoy a lot of times is like at the very beginning of a project trying to think about how I'm gonna do the layout more of the design side of things that takes me a long time so it's and that part I'm not really doing a lot of coding I'm just doing a lot of thinking and searching through other websites there's fine inspiration so I don't know that part it's kind of weird for me if it takes a really long time I don't like it but if if I kind of get on a roll with an idea and it starts to work then it's really fun but otherwise I like it the part the part of my job currently that I don't like as much as I'm not a big fan of all the meetings I don't mind meetings if they're like like video chat meetings because then like I'm still at my desk I can still you know like looking's up on my other screen if I need to when you're at a meeting it's it's kind of rude to be working on other things like in person when you're out a meeting but a lot of times I attend meetings and there's a lot of stuff at the meetings that doesn't pertain to me at all so that just kind of like is mindnumbing sometimes also it sometimes it depends on who you're working with you know you get a client that has a lot of really strong opinions that aren't necessarily the best practices that can be tough and that's not that's not really fun to work with a client like that but otherwise I do I do like it okay I had asked hard earlier if there was a time I could stream that would be better and says now it's you know it's 12 hours between between us here so okay well that's too bad hard I really appreciate you being in so many of the streams and helping out and so I hope you do really well with your studies though and we'll still be working on projects together then cut says a new do stream so welcome thanks for watching how did you get your your work to let you stream also why did you move from tomato timer to pompom so all these for the second question first because heart should also already answered in live chat and he said because pompom is made by me yes so harsh it made the pompom timer and as he says it is a dark theme and I love dark theme stuff so so that's why I switched yeah when I should said hey I made this try it out I tried it out I liked it so so that's why I use that and for getting my work sorry huh forgetting my work to let me stream I just talked to my boss and said this was before I was even streaming for free code cam this was when I was just streaming for on my own channel and I'd get like one or two viewers sometimes out of no viewers how but I just came in one day and said I was thinking about it and had an idea maybe I could stream my work and it might be good for like maybe the computer science students to see it and maybe they might be interested and want to come work on projects with us and it'll help them with their portfolios and it'll help us because we'll have more people working on our stuff and so my boss thought yeah that's a good idea and then shortly thereafter I was invited to stream for free code camp and my boss thought that was a really good idea because it would be a lot of publicity free publicity for the university and also you know we have so many people looking at the sights as we're coding it's just you know you're gonna have a better product like that and so many times you all catch errors before I catch them you make pull requests and you know the projects are a lot better because of you so anyway so my boss realized you know right away that you know this was this is only going to benefit us my project roll with the source anyway so it's not like we're letting out secrets or anything but I am I'm very grateful that that he lets me do this and everybody my department is very supportive of it Christopher Braun says you can still give them the option of selecting different video qualities and then loading the one they select yeah that's true Christopher yeah we could we could have them select the video qualities yeah that's an option let's see see and okay um car says random question which is best for post on spring boot rest fetch or using Axios I prefer using fetch I haven't really had much experience with Axios so I can't do a proper comparison between the two but it just seems to me that you know fetch is already built in like why not just use fetch fetch to me seems really simple maybe Axios has more things available I denied use it and they're good developers so you know maybe there's something to Axios that I don't know about that would make it better but you know in terms of what what I use I I use fetch and I always recommend fetch Christopher Brown says why aren't you using a separate CSS file we are for some components and for other components for not so it's nice for me at least I really like being able to use the have the styles right here so that there's only one file you need for this component so the component is very reusable so I I like that I like to do it like that when I can some places I we're bringing in another CSS file and the way the reason we needed to do that is because we're importing some HTML from that we pulled out of an old database and we can't directly use this you know the CSS that we're putting in this javascript object we can't assign that to places because we don't have access to that like right here so the only way that we could style that the stuff that we're pulling in on the fly is is to use a an external stylesheet so so I guess the answers we are using it just not in every place so basically when we can get away with not using a separate CSS file we don't use one we put it right there in the component in the component form or reusability Christopher Brown says here's a tip find what whitespace feels good then double it I like that I like that I've never heard that but I will have to keep that in my let's see nasrullah says how are you I'm okay okay I was up pretty early had some unexpectedly prepared I prepared for a meeting that unexpectedly wasn't happening today it's happening tomorrow but other than other than that I'm okay how are you doing Christopher Brown says why not just use margin isn't two sets of padding a bit weird yeah I didn't think about that until now and it's kind of weird I could have just used the margin yeah you're right I guess in my mind the way I was thinking about it lead the way I was visualizing it was convincing these two separate components and how much padding they would have so when I went to write what it would be I just immediately wrote it like that but you're right it would have been the same if I would have just put margin and padding on the a the a tag so yeah you're right either way it's the same you get the same effect but in this case we're adding an it's a it's the same amount of lines of code to I suppose but yeah I guess it might be a bit a bit weird to do it like that software death said I would match the logo with the menu and make the social icons smaller on top says react looks neat though I've never used it before new projects ok cool I think thanks for the advice that let me check it out so I'm not exactly sure what you mean matching the logo with a menu but definitely make this social icon smaller we might go smaller I did decrease the size a little bit from what they were originally I might be able to go smaller I'll see I mean maybe they just look my screen makes everything everything looks a little smaller on my screen than it it seems like it looks on what I'm presenting so I'll see how these looks how these look what I'm presenting and maybe I can make them smaller cuz I really don't want to emphasize these too much I'd rather have users click one of these buttons than one of these buttons so I may end up making this smaller but I'm glad you said that because I wasn't sure if if it would be too small Nikki says how about a search bar replaces the links went open that could happen that yeah we could do that oh yeah that's not going to be something that I try to get done like today but that that would actually work and then it wouldn't matter how you know how many items we have in here we still wouldn't have to worry about it because anytime that's open they wouldn't even be visible yeah I like that idea what do y'all think about that just when this is open all this just goes away and this covers everything okay Joey says maybe use faith in life with the with an ampersand instead of an end yeah though that would actually cut it down a little bit often saw that stuff it's not gonna be my call ultimately my boss is lefty enough to make that decision but maybe I'll mention it to my boss and see see what he thinks let's see Jim Jim mugs I'm not sure how to pronounce that Jim is a Jim alex gameplay alright Laney Way says you can make a bar underneath the menu in order to fix that problem a bar I'm not sure are you talking about this problem where these stack on top of each other okay so Nikki saying the same behavior that the search does on firebase Google comm are this check oh wow yeah that gets that takes up all the space interesting okay let me know what you all think about that I kind of like that hmm see what happens when you'd say okay so it hit make suggestions okay cool mr. Brown says you should try taking a logo and cropping it so that the text can be HTML and CSS it says and look a lot nicer I am I'm pretty limited in what I can do to the logo so I don't know I mean assuming that I could find this exact font which I have no idea what font this is I mean maybe I could I could do it but the way we like the logo is pretty much set I can't change the logo I just I put the logo in there so I'm not sure if I'd be able to do that or not the cursor also says the social media should probably be at the bottom of the page having at the top is a bit odd and removing the clutter would benefit the overall design of the page yeah I could see I could ask my boss about this I don't like I don't even remember why we initially decided to put these up here so yeah that's that's definitely an option so I'll see what my boss says if he wants him up there obviously I'm gonna leave him up there but yeah you're right we don't need them up there we could certainly put them in the footer it's so Jim Alex gameplay says when the onclick event happens on that lens a bar should pop out underneath the menu more stylish and fixes your problem so you wanna click event oh okay so you're saying that the search should pop out underneath instead of scooting everything over okay yeah that's another option I have to think about that all right harsh it's asking if I can check out the messaging page for JavaScript AF I can I'll take a look at that after the after the stream casue Brown says your page is slow because you did the background attachment fix currently this has terrible performance so it'd be better to use separate div with a background and set the position to fixed okay cool yeah actually so whenever if I assume that you're loading this then on with Engram so it is slow on your machine because I haven't noticed that it's slow on any of my machines usually when I've used background positionfixed as long as I only use it on one element I don't see any performance decrease if I use it on a lot of elements on one page then I do see it but I mean this the machine that I'm on right now is probably better than what most users will have so if if you are actually seeing a performance decrease then yeah then maybe I need to do it a different way Nikki said the girl's head gets cropped have dev tools at the bottom okay Nikki so I'm assuming then like your window is pretty short then and yeah with things like that I'm not I'm not super worried about this happening on a screen like this because no one has a screen like this like they'd have to shape their window differently for that to happen so I mean if this happened on a normal screen size I'd be more worried about it off to check yeah you know what it is even covering it up here that's this is miss still isn't a normal screen size but yeah maybe I will need to drop this down a bit I haven't really worried about it because I wasn't sure if I would keep this image or not but we could probably do like background position wide drop it down a little bit and then that would that probably worked for most screen sizes yeah see my colleague Brian just reminded me in the lab chat that there's a 300 p.m. meeting today bring your laptop I will be there [Laughter] same basis as a problem with a lamp server as if we know some about it I don't I don't know anything about lamp servers does any if anybody in the live chat does please let let somebody know and maybe maybe you can help them out Nietzsche says use Axios recently it has a lot of nice things built in and it has better support without a polyfill for fetch which create react tab has by default okay all right cool so Niki saying Axios does have some other stuff builtin which I kind of figured that would be the case so I guess it's just you know your personal preference or what you have to do a lot of times I just do basic things with fetch maybe if you're doing something more advanced Axios might be the way to go Harshit says one big drawback I found using fetch is you can't add eventlistener to file upload progress okay that's that's interesting so that actually is kind of a big deal if you need that functionality are says then you have to use xhr and Axios is built with xhr so it can easily do that I'm quite cool Harrison says 34 year old father trying to transition to web dev currently at Costco do you have any tips my tips would be well I mean first of all times going to be an issue for sure because you're already working you have kids I'm gonna say I'm I'm 32 right now father of four so I understand the times gonna be an issue but I would say whenever you do have time work on projects work on tutorials your best thing that you can do to get a job and web dev is to have a good folio to actually work on projects have them on github have a nice portfolio site because that's going to be the number one thing that employers look for is you know can you do the job and you prove that by your projects that you've done so even if it's a side project do that if you can get somebody to pay you to do work do that too that's a great way to learn I mean I used when I was freelancing I used to take a lot of jobs sometimes jobs that were they didn't even pay that much but it was using something that I wanted to learn more about and so you take it you learn it you know while you're creating something and you make a little money and that makes it kind of easier when you have a family to justify spending that time away from your family you know because you are at least providing for them in some way so and in cases like that I just kind of saw myself as like I'm doing a paid internship right now I'm not making as much as I want to but I'm learning so I would consider myself in that position and mentally it just helped me to to work through that so I and I would say try to do a little bit every day so if you can go for a half hour or an hour of coding a little bit every day is is good you know try to get in like coding podcast when you're in the car or you know if I don't know when you're working out watch like a coding video I used to hold my kids and you know at nighttime they wouldn't sleep and I'd hold them and I'd rock them while I was watching something so you can watch tutorial videos like that yeah so just try to find those little ways but if you do a little every day that's much better than you know just saying like okay every Saturday I'm going to spend you know six hours doing it because you know by the time you get back around in the next Saturday you will have forgot a lot of what you would just learn so hopefully that those tips will help you I'm sure there's there's a lot of there you know good advice out there but that's what comes to mind you're right away and certainly if you can come back to the live chat ask you know ask any questions that you have you know I'd be happy to help and there are a lot of people to watch the chat that are you know more more advanced than me that can give you some great answers hey on LC how's it going Jay Frederic says what about moving the socialite comes to a position fix div on the side I thought about doing that I am I don't I don't really like to do the div on the side the dip on the side annoys me if it ends up blocking some element on the page and sometimes that happens now obviously if we were to do the bit on the side we would do what we could to make sure that that never happens but if I was going to move the social icon somewhere I guess I'd prefer to just move them down to the footer okay so Jay Fredrik says the nav section is a bit too crowded okay yeah maybe it is getting too crowded maybe we should just pull this stuff out I mean we could maybe we could do a whole row right here and just have one single row with this access fus your kind of button here you know in in its place here and just move everything up to be where these social icons were you know we could try like I said I have to talk to my boss before I make a change like that but we would definitely be able to get away with a much thinner header which I like I always like to have the the headers as thin as possible software dev says the menu in search box should be bigger Joey says the font looks a lot like spectral okay so I guess we're talking about this one the Joey says but then you would also have to load that extra font just for the few characters loading the logo might be better for performance you know what I didn't think about that but but you're right yeah I would rather not have to load an extra phone just for just for that little piece God so love 24 says yeah I agree with putting the social media icons at the bottom we'll have the search bar overlap the other tax law is selected okay so move the social media icons and then potentially have the search bar just overlap instead of pushing everything out of the way okay okay so Christopher said it is actually slow on a Samsung Chromebook plus okay okay hard saying is due to end Rock yeah that's actually that is a good thing to keep in mind so we're going to keep in mind that this is development build nothing is menifee nothing no images have even been optimized at all yet so in production the images would all be optimizing compressed we would be running a lot faster because we'd be in production build instead of dev dev mode and instead of running things off of my computer through Angra the servers are going to be running on much more speedy servers and yeah I think it'll I'm still I'm still open and that's definitely something that I'm gonna I'm going to test because I don't want bad performance through that but like I said I've used this on a lot of sites and I've never seen bad performance unless I've used it more than once on a page but I think that's something that we should definitely test before we launch on on old devices on different machines and things and that just see like is this something that we we definitely shouldn't do it Ishta meets says why are you using next yes when you could do serverside rendering using pure react and Express anode yeah well there's two answers that question one next also does come builtin with some other stuff that's nice to have so although we are doing a lot of custom routing with it next router is nice that's not really a big deal we could just use react router if we're using like create react app or something the other answer is I didn't have enough time to learn how to do that I've used necks before I'm familiar with it and I know we could do what we wanted but if if I would have had to have taken the time to learn how to do serverside rendering properly with reacts I I never could have made this as a deadline so the deadline for this was supposed to be the end of this month now it's gotten moved back not because we weren't ready but you know just for other reasons that had nothing to do with the coding so if it's going to get moved back a lot then we certainly would have had time but based on the time frame that I had for this site you know I I had to save time where I could save time and next is a nice a nice way to do that do serverside rendering without really having to to learn a lot about it it just works I would definitely like to know how to do it without having to use necks because sometimes I think next is overkill for some little things that I'm doing that I'd like to be serverside rendered so that's going to be something I'd like to learn how to do at some point but right now there's too much work to be done Michael so since you since you're going to be showing this you might want to delete two of the footer columns three makes it super long on mobile yeah you're right the I have three columns here maybe I should just put in the actual content that will be here that won't be too hard to do so we'll see depending on how much time I have I'll do that I don't I guess I don't really need to scroll the way down but that that's actually a good a good thing to do I mean yeah maybe I'll cut down the text significantly and then that way if I don't have time to put the real content here then it will look nicer so I like that idea Michael our Harrison said thanks yeah I get a again a 4 a.m. get up at 400 a.m. to code okay cool so Harrison was the one that was talking about changing you know careers into web dev yes yeah I find myself waking up earlier and earlier just to have a little bit of time like do a workout sometimes I code and so yeah I understand that our shits gonna leave AC arch I know it started to get late there it's a Tuesday already started alright well thanks thanks for coming a lot chatter they appreciate it Christopher said you should try aligning the mission summary div to the left and maybe confine it to the width of the video below it's yeah I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with this yet I kind of want to mess around with font sizes to make this bigger so it's supposed it's supposed to be a break a clear break between this section in this section so I like to keep it full width now keeping it full with having white space here and just cutting it down so that it does only take up half the space I'm definitely open to that that might look good to maybe I'll try that michael says since access FES is for faculty why not have it in the dropdown I thought this landing page was for prospective students it is it is for sure I have no idea why I'm being asked to put this up here to be honest with you I don't think it should be there I think we should have a donate button there because that's going to be the only other calltoaction we really want primarily we want students to apply or do one of these things and then secondarily this site is for donors to see what we're doing here and hopefully donate so I agree I do not think this should be there but that's not my call so maybe I'll bring it up again with my boss and and see why but you're entirely right there's yeah there's always been this weird thing since even before I got here there's been this weird thing where it's different departments have tried to get different content on the site that has nothing to do with prospective students and my boss has tried to keep this site more for prospective students but it's just been kind of like a back and forth you know like sometimes and I'm sure it's like this in other organizations if somebody high enough up with enough Authority says to do this sometimes you just do it you have to do it so sometimes that happened and you end up with just a lot of stuff so I'm really trying to right off the bat make this as clean and minimal as possible knowing that there's going to be a big push for people to want to get their content on the homepage really high up so this is one of those cases where we've already had had that happen yeah so for now this is here Harshit says will you use it now with CloudFlare for deployment then deployment will take ten minutes I guess it takes you four hours last time at digitalocean and I remind you to back up WordPress ok I did back at WordPress and I installed I have right now running like that weekly backups so I did get that up and running and yeah I I do want to start to look into different deployment options hard because you're right it did take a while to set up all the droplets before so yeah I'm definitely open to deployment options it basically it just needs to be reliable I don't want there to be any downtime for the users whenever I need to update things and I want it to be able to handle all the users that that were getting set said Chitra sorry if I'm mispronouncing that but just said shift row says highly appreciate what you're doing helped me to learn a lot of new things oh thank you for saying that thanks for watching I'm really glad that you you're able to learn some things okay I should say no downtime and insight you may be using oh yeah you did say now okay yeah I have used now before but it's been a WoW I think the last time I use now to deploy a site was in the summer of 2017 so it's been a long time so I want to read up on it more I'm sure there's a lot more features says you can scale a little balanced single command okay cool all right all right should I'm gonna read them more up on it this week is going to be crazy and I'm just going to be getting ready for my interview on Thursday and all my presentations so I'm probably not going to be able to look up anything I'm just going to be making small changes based on the audience for this site next week I'm hoping depending on all these go I may have even more presentations I'm not the one scheduling these my bosses are scheduling them for me so hopefully I'll be almost done two presentations and I can finally get back to like the normal work that we've been doing and at that point I really would like to look into deployment options and if I can get like a certain like a real date for when this needs to launch that'll also make a difference because then it may or may not be that important to look into deployment nikki says adding a subtle shadow to white text on a bright background makes it more readable it also makes it pop yeah we I do need to work on this text a bit to me I'll try that I usually try to stay away from from the shadows like like font shadows but I just kind of don't like the look of it but I do need to do something to make it readable okay all right should I won't forget to check the Twitter so I got Twitter open right now on my on my other screen so I won't forget to check so Nietzsche says just adding a text shadow and actually put the text shadow in here all right let's try this right now and see what the difference is let's try it out right here in in dev tools I'm not seeing a difference right now but that's probably because whatever is happening is blending into the shadow and actually I do so this text shadow actually matches the shadow I have the overlay I have over top of this image exactly so it's both point two I believe it's both point two so that's why it's not doing anything but if I lighten the background but keep the shadow on the text maybe maybe that would would work better Joey says you can also try adding a slightly more tinted box behind the text and buttons yeah I could do that I just stylewise I just don't like how it looks when I do that but I may have to it it entirely depends on what image we use and what are the colors in that image so that's going to be I'm kind of like shying away from doing too much because I'm not even sure this will be the image no one's seen this except for you all and me no one else at in my department has seen this so I don't know if they're gonna like it or not so I kind of like don't want to try to make this text do anything with this text really until I know for sure what's going to be the image we go with this is now that you have to do a presentation everyone's bringing up site redesign ideas we've been working on this one where we yeah today yet today was the day that like you all were just like hey let's change this let's change this let's change this I did wonder about that I'm kind of thinking like we've had the same thing up here for weeks and weeks and though it said anything and now today all of a sudden it's like yeah let's get rid of all this stuff I don't know but I I'm messing around now but I really appreciate all that stuff like even if you make a suggestion and I don't end up going with it I still appreciate it and it still may change or my design decisions down the road and other sites or other parts of the site so and sometimes it has nothing to do with whether or not your idea was a good idea it's other things it's like I know that if I do that this other person in that I work with is not gonna like it so like there's sometimes decisions for better for worse have to be made like that I can't always just say like what's going to be best for the design for the user or whatever so yeah so please you know keep the suggestions coming that's how sites that get better you know if I do something and it's ugly just telling me it's ugly you know I mean you could choose to be nice about it if you want which would be cool but even if you're not I'm okay with that so yeah and like like I said may or may not include it and that's not a reflection at all on you or your ideas there's just a lot of other factors that need to go into what I work on and when I work on it so anyway so I think we're gonna wrap things up soon there's a few more messages that just came in on live chat so I'm gonna go through those and then I'm gonna take a little break here and we'll see well I may not even have time to do that second stream like I was gonna do cuz it's already almost two will say yeah I don't know if I've time to do it or not you'll get a notification though if you're subscribed to my my channel let's see Nietzsche says here's the threat of awesome UI details oh cool thanks sneaky Biff BAFF says do you use color pattern sites for designing sometimes I look at those sites for sites that I make for the University I I have to stick with our color palette for university so I have very little leeway and deviating from that color palette but for sites that I'm doing on my own or like a lot of times clients businesses already have a certain color palette but if I do have freedom I do try to go on sites and just get ideas for different color palettes and things that's one of the things it takes me forever like to pick colors but I mean it's cool why it's kind of nice to see the combinations but right now I'm usually like I usually don't have a say in what colors get used let's see all right Nikki I'm checking out that UI details page right now this is really cool I like this yeah there's a lot here it's gonna take me a while to get through it all but I this looks awesome okay cool all right a couple more messages in here Christopher Brown says have you taken design classes no I I've taken like no classes on any like no you know university classes on any of this so it's all been I when I was freelancing I learned what I needed to learn to get the job done I have done some like Udacity courses so done free code camp things but yeah but design wise very little design stuff I definitely would would say I'm a developer I have to do design here when when in because there's not really a web designer you know here at the University so I try to use material design and fall back on that as much as possible you know because I know I'm lacking in you know that design knowledge but yeah so no formal design classes see Chris's looks great so a looks great work so far what's your educational background oh well thank thanks I'm glad you like it educational background is I have a bachelor's degree in business administration with a specialization in banking finance and economics other than that I took some courses in getting a master's in theology and I never finished that master's and then pretty much all of my my learning for becoming a web developer has been on my own almost entirely through free resources the only time I I paid I think I bought like maybe some udemy courses that were on sale you know another sale and you get a course for like $10 I think I did some of those years ago but I I did do the reacts nanodegree for from Udacity but that's that's it I did coke Academy courses free code camp stuff trying to think I've tried a lot of other things but those are the main ones that I kind of stuck with and did the most work with those like online YouTube videos books so usually not like paper copies of books I like the you know the online books like like that you don't know J s series or eloquent Java scripts you know they're available online all right cool I've gotten through everything in the chat now and yeah I had a good time it was like it was really interesting to hear all the opinions on what we're doing and I think what we have now definitely looks better than what we had starting out and we got a little I good good ideas to make it even better so some of those ideas might be we might be using them it just kind of depends on the feedback I get from my boss and yeah and the feedback I get from these presentations all right look I will be back tomorrow I think I got a double check and make sure what time I presentation is so I'm not exactly sure what time I can stream tomorrow but I think I will have some time at some point tomorrow to stream hopefully and until then have a great day
