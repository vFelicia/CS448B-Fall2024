hey what's up welcome back to css3 in 30 days this is day seven we're going to be doing some image manipulation purely with css over here in my browser check it out right here day 7 image manipulation i'm going to show you what we're going to do so basically we're going to use these nice beautiful images that i'm pulling from unsplash and i'll show you there in the markup in a moment how that how that happens but what i'm doing is i'm using some css3 filters to manipulate the images so here are the original images right here and you can see they're just normal images but then down here they have different styles you can see this first one is black and white and when i hover it can change changes back to its original color and the second one is blurred and when i hover it goes back to its original focus so it looks like it has this kind of cool focus effect and this one is inverted if i hover it goes back to the original image this one is sepia tone and then when i hover it goes back to original image so it's pretty cool you could do some basic photo editing and manipulation in css without having to go into photoshop so if you want to make it image black and white or sepia toned or you want to blur it a little bit or you want to play around with it like that you can just use css3 so head over to the code editor here and make sure you download the course files for this lesson it is seven image manipulation as always there's an index a final and a sandbox file and the index here i'm going to show you i'm just pulling some images from unsplash so basically this is like a placeholder image you can pull them in like so so unsplash.it 500 by 300 is the dimensions the query string image equals one uh 1074 which is the the id of the image if you change that it'll pull up a different image so it's kind of a cool way of showing images uh on your websites for placeholders or for images because unsplash is a free stock photography site okay so you can see here on each of the images i have classes so i have the image the first one is grayscale the second one is blur invert and sepia and in the final css you can see all this the styles here which we're going to be coding up it's pretty straightforward so let's go ahead and open our sandbox dot css and let's get started the first thing we're going to do is select all of the images within the sandbox so sandbox image and we're going to say webkit transition all 0.3 seconds and ease copy that and just have a fallback for transition here beauty just like that and what we're going to do is we're also going to say sandbox image on hover and we're just gonna say cursor cross hair just uh for something different when you hover over the image i want the cursor to change to across here purely for user experience nothing else okay and now let's get right to it we're going to say grayscale is the first set of the first image and we're going to do webkit filter this is the css that we're going to be doing you're going to be using it's a css style called filter but webkit filter is the uh the browser prefix for webkit and we're going to say grayscale and then in parentheses you put the amount you want it to be grayscale so i'm just going to say 1 for 100 because you could do a sliding scale and let's copy this paste it out and just do filter whoa that was interesting there we go save that and let's go check it out so here we go we've got the grayscale image here uh just like that so that one we've changed to grayscale so now if i go back to the code editor and maybe i change this to like 0.5 and see what that looks like you can see over here it actually is 50 grayscale so it's kind of a cool um effect you can actually have it be varying degrees it doesn't have to be hard black and white you know it could be any uh percentage in between which is really cool i'm gonna go back and change it to one and now what i want to do is on hover i want it to go back to its original style the original image so i'm going to paste the same rule here and i'm just going to change this to grayscale 0 and grayscale 0 on hover so now if i save that go back to the browser when i hover it's going to have that effect and i can see when i'm hovering here it's just turning it on and off it's not doing the transition that we set up so if i go back to my brow code editor here i can actually see that i've made a typo in line seven sandbox it needs to be sand box with the d naught sand box so now if i save that and check it out it should have that effect beautiful nice and subtle just like that all right so now let's move on to the next uh image and that's going to be the blur image so it's just the class of blur we have webkit filter again we're just using filters it's pretty simple and we're using blur we're going to say 3 pixel blur you can again you can change that to different values and i'm going to just have the fallback here just like so and let's go ahead and copy that paste it and what we're going to do here is change the blur back to zero on hover so we'll just do that right out the gate save that check it out over here in the browser now if i scroll down to image two it's blurred awesome hover going back to normal it's fading in and out looks really nice now what if we made it like i don't know what's a one pixel blur look like let's check it out in the browser again more subtle it's just kind of slightly blurred and if we did something wild like 10 pixels that that image is going to be super blurry you can hardly even notice it so that's kind of a cool little effect you know maybe that's coming you're getting some ideas thinking about what you could do with that you know if you wanted to reveal something if you have a portfolio website you want to reveal you know this is your background and you have text overlaid and then when you hover it the image kind of fades in or whatever you want to do there's certain things that you could do just in css just to give a nice user experience using the webkit filters uh okay so save that i'm just gonna make it three pixels again now the next one we're gonna change uh it to an inversion of the color so all we're going to do here is do the class of invert and we're going to do the webkit filter again and you guessed it invert parentheses this is going to be one or zero i believe we could do a sliding scale again we'll try it again in a moment and i'm going to change this to filter invert 1 and let's copy that do a hovered version of that and again you guessed it you're probably ahead of me now invert zero we're gonna switch it back to normal on hover save it go to your browser check it out it's fully inverted the colors are when you hover it goes back to normal now what if we changed it to a different value like 0.5 again just half does that actually work if you go over to the browser it doesn't quite look like it does what if i i don't know maybe i'll try a different value okay yeah it kind of does something there it looks like it's almost like an opacity if i say that to .09 so yeah it kind of does the trick there i wonder if two does anything no two doesn't do anything so it's just kind of one and it looks like you can do less so it almost looks like it's like an opacity uh how much of it you can see it's not actually inverting the color so much as it's just making it gray so it's kind of like it it's not even opacity it's just like you can't quite see the full inversion so uh if you want to stick to the inversion i don't really know when you use this anyway uh one and zero stick to a binary numbers here there it is okay now the next one let's move on to something else let's do sepia this is one that i can see you using sepia we're gonna do webkit filter again and we're gonna do sepia and one and we're gonna do filter here and we're gonna copy that out and we're going to paste that we're going to make it a hover and we're going to change that back to zero save that and let's check it out in the browser there is our sepia tone right there and you hover it toggles it in and out and so there you have it there are some examples of of the css filters now if you want to play around with them a little bit more you can actually check out the css3 filter property online google it w3schools.com is a great resource and you can see all the different versions and how to play around with them so here for example there these are the different filters so there's blur which uses a pixel uh measurement brightness contrast drop shadows grayscale hue rotate invert which is actually percentage so we were actually using uh just zeros and ones if we wanted to use a percentage here that might have been a better choice let's do 50 and 50 save that go to invert and again the 50 was kind of like the 0.5 so maybe i don't really know what goes on there but if i do 70 you can see it partially so yeah i'm going to stick to one for now unusual let's go back to the browser here so you can see there's opacity saturate if you want to saturate the image a little bit more uh sepia url that's if you want to use xml files that has svg filters and then just initial and inherit so those are the different css3 filter functions that you can use uh feel free to read up on it if you want or play around with it and experiment and that is it for day seven hang tight we have some more fun stuff in fact we have a really cool project that we're going to build tomorrow see you then
