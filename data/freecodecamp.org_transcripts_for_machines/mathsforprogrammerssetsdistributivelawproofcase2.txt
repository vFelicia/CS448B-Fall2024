in this video i have the proof of the second case for the distributive law in this case we're showing that a intersection b union a intersection c is a subset of a intersection b union c so let's start by saying that suppose that x is an element of a intersection b union a intersection c then we know that x is an element of a intersection b or x is an element of a intersection c and we know this because of the definition of the union from here we can then state that x is an element of a and x is an element of b or x is an element of a and x is an element of c from that we can deduce that x is an element of a and x is an element of b or x is an element of c and here we um we sort of factored out the x as an element of a and and then regrouped x's element of b or x is an element of c and from here we can by definition right x is element of a and x is an element of b union c which finally we can state x's and elements of a intersection b union c which is what we wanted to show so there you have it we've proved that uh x is an element of both of these and therefore this is a subset of this and we've shown that both sides of the equation are subsets of each other and therefore the distributive law is in fact true it's proven
