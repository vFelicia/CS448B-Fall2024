hey everybody its Jesse and I hope everyone had a nice weekend I had a little bit of a long weekend had Monday off so far there's no stream yesterday let's see today I'm gonna try something a little bit different so as you know if you've ever watched this before I only show my screen and so no one ever gets to see my face so I thought today I would have two streams so the first stream is just going to be the normal stream that that you all are used to and then the second stream is going to be the opposite view so you'll get to see my face as I'm doing this stream in that stream is going to be on Instagram so I could have done it like a little box on the side of the screen but for a couple reasons I decided enough to do that the most important reason being I don't really know how to do that and I didn't have time to look it up so right now I'm still rushing to finish as much as I can on this project by I think tomorrow is the last day that I can work on it so I spent a long time over the weekend I think Friday I stayed up pretty late on Friday working on this and did some work on it on Saturday so if you check out the live version of this site at catechetical Scone it's going to be a little bit different it won't look that different to you all since you've been seeing the development version of it but it's been a while since the the production version you know at the actual URL has been updated so so that's all updated and oh I'll fill you in on some of the changes that might then that were different that weren't even on the dev server I did make a few changes like that hey I just checked a lot hey everyone Oh Andrew sorry you can't you can't be with us in the live chat totally understand about work so andrew has to work so can't be in the in the live chat but hopefully you can you can catch the the live streams later in the week so okay all right the analytics were a little bit weird it was showing that I only have three viewers for a few minutes now I'm up to my normal right around 50 is pretty normal especially for the beginning occasionally I'll get more than that not sure why it probably just depends on who retweets the the tweet saying that I'm gonna I'm gonna stream and how many people that goes out to but anyway oh I I was mentioning I'm gonna have the second stream showing my face as I'm coding on Instagram and my Instagram account is its public so anybody can look at it it's just Jesse dot whyville so Jes se period WEEI GTL and I'll type that in the live chat if anybody's interested so I don't really know if anybody is interested but it'll give me a good idea I guess if I should look up and try to figure out how to put my face in a little box on the corner of the screen if nobody really cares then I won't worry about doing it but I had never done the live stream on Instagram before though so I thought this would be a cool way to try that out at the same time that I'm doing this so so anyway I just typed my Instagram name in the live chat there in case anyone's interested and I'm not even sure I'm not exactly sure how the UI and everything works for for Instagram live anyway so alright looks like some you saying don't worry about that don't need to see to see the face better to code that's what I always thought that's why I never bothered with it but then I see like a lot of other people who stream even streaming code also they have their face in there so I didn't know if that was that was the thing to do or what but I always just figured it's better to have the screen space for the code but you never know maybe people people like that so it's available if you want but it's on a separate stream so if you don't want it you don't have to see it okay so let me go through just a few of the the changes that I've made over the weekend and then we're going to get into just continuing to do some refactoring just like we had done on Friday we're just kind of gonna keep going through and clean things up a bit and bring in as much as we can from the WordPress API so that you know everything everything that should be editable will be editable from WordPress I didn't run into a problem just two minutes before I started the stream I'm trying to you know I'm using advanced custom fields in WordPress so let's see I'm gonna show you I'll show you what's happening and then maybe so if you look at this this is the the program info fields now we we created a field I think I did this on the stream last I'm actually created a field for URL and now it's not showing up because when I tried to add a field it came up with an error and then when I went back into this it had totally erased all the field so now I'm afraid to go into any of them to have all the fields erased luckily this section this courses section is not live yet so I know we we had made it so that you could import this would all be imported from wordpress but i didn't want to put this live with all the other stuff because i didn't have all this data ready yet and i hadn't actually tested it at all other than just went through it a bit in the live stream so for right now i'm gonna refresh but it still seems like it's it was working somewhat oh here we go no it's not so if you notice when there's a URL it's supposed to show a link like a little button to learn more so it's not so we basically lost we've lost that data now so I'm afraid to go into any other of these these fields and try to change anything because I don't want to get that error I don't want to have everything erase that would be that'd be pretty bad I do have a backup of the site so I backed up the site and then I upgraded WordPress and I upgraded some plugins that are were unrelated to this so I'm thinking that something with the update has messed up what's going on with this plugin so I'm gonna try to recreate the area here so you all can see it plus I didn't really have a chance to look at it that well myself since it happened you're right before I had to start the stream so let's just type in URL and that's I'm not gonna type in explanation now cuz it probably won't even work but let's add this see if it works for us okay so here's the air that we're getting so it's saying so it's in the advanced custom fields plugin see so I'm not exactly sure what the problem is and as you like I'm pretty sure I've said this before I'm not really great with PHP so I'd rather not have to dig into this to figure out what the problem is so for now I think I'm just gonna leave that since it's not on affecting the live version of the site right now at least I I sincerely hope it hasn't erased all the data we should probably should check it just to be sure let's see let's bring this up let's try to find some place that would have alright so the resources would definitely have a lot of custom fields ok so the categories are by default WordPress that shouldn't be a big deal but these are okay alright so luckily this it hasn't erased everything so what I'm thinking would happen is if I actually went in and tried to change any of other custom fields in WordPress then it would erase those as well so I'm gonna just gonna leave this alone for now I'm gonna leave this up on the screen I'm just gonna move it over to the side and check that out later on and try to figure that out cuz I expect it's just gonna be a lot of me googling things and I don't know probably just commenting out lines of PHP and so I figure out what the problem is so that's that's not really gonna be great great to watch but if anyone has experience with advanced custom fields with that plugin and it seen anything like that if you have any suggestions let me know alright hey we got somebody in the in the live stream on Instagram so awesome so thanks thanks for check it out I wondered if anybody would check it out said one person also I realize it may not be it may not be easy to get the Instagram live stream right now depending on you'll where you're at what device you're watching this on obviously if you're watching the the coding stream on your phone you're not going to be able to watch another stream on Instagram Instagram at the same time I'm gonna check the live chat quickly since I haven't checked it okay so Patrick says what some streams with the face even though it gets in the way either way it's fine okay so it seems like the at least from the people who have put in their opinion it seems like that you all do agree that the seeing someone's face just gets in the way of the code anyway so so we'll see maybe I'll do it again maybe I won't so our nod seems to be very upset about the face thing so so don't worry about it or not just don't don't look at my Instagram vasya asks about the deadline for this project yeah the deadline the forsure deadline this time I know there have been multiple deadlines that have kind of been like pushed back a little bit that's how it goes sometimes you know you you think you have a really hard deadline and ends up not being like that but the real deadline is I think I have today and tomorrow to work on this and then I'm done then I'm gonna start a different project so Wednesday the stream should probably it'll probably end up being whatever the new project is that I'm working on so okay Andrews asking for me to post the the PHP error and this is Andrew Ritter so I know there's another Andrew that frequently is on here but he could be in the stream today so I'm posting everything it's right now in the live chat oops it's too many I'm gonna have to break it up it was too many characters there's a two hundred character limit for posting in the live chat so there we go so the first part fits the second part I think the second part of the air is going to be too long yeah it's too long I'll have to break it up which is gonna make it a lot harder to read but I guess that's how it will have to be for nah Wow okay so I'm gonna grab I'll put it up on the screen just for a second so I'll just grab I can't I want to grab all this but it's it's over 200 characters so I guess I'm just gonna have to do it maybe three parts then Jools saying you spaceman yeah I could let's just do a paste yeah let me let me get this out I'm not I'm not really that worried about it for the stream so I don't really want to take up all the stream time over this error I mean if worse comes to worst and I can't use this i could just hard code some custom fields i'd rather not do it but because it would just be it would be more work but if i can't get it to work with the with the plugin then i don't really have another option okay all right so I did paste this into Faceman so now I put that link that links in the live chat so if anybody does want to check out that error I really appreciate it if you if you know anything about it but otherwise I'm going to I'm gonna get started so we'll go through let me bring over the my local version and I'll go through just quickly just a very minimal changes from what we had worked on before in the dev site but I'll show you what those are and then we'll get right into we're pretty much done with this page so I think events will probably our next page that we start refactoring and pulling in our data with so I'm going to start my timer and let's go alright so the home page alright as always my dev server needs restarted so obviously I still haven't figured that one out and if you want to check out any of the changes in more depth everything is on github and it is also on the live version of the site the live version of site is actually further ahead right now than the than the dead version then that the IP address for the dead version so the khattak addicts com the production version is where to go to get the latest so anyway all this is still the same the video changed they wanted me to not use a youtube embed because it had the YouTube branding and it was showing ads so that's understandable you don't want ads coming up you know in the middle of your site so I changed to use JW player the only thing about JW player that the only problem I've had and I didn't even notice this until this morning was that if I navigate away from it and go try to go back it doesn't load again so um there's a react plugin for JW player a react component so I'm gonna try to get that to work I just don't have the account information for the account they use JW player with so I'll need to get that to be able to get the plugin to work so for now it does work on the initial page load and it's fine there's just a different you know different image for the thumbnail that comes up but I think it it's it works and they're happy to people that I'm building this site for happy with it these are all the same everything else the same on this page on the resources page that's probably the the biggest change so I pulled in these used to be on the bottom like below this this section so this now I think this was black the last time we looked at it so I changed it to the red background these are all white now this section is now included in here so it still works the same way it's just the the colors have changed and now it's within this section and then for this I've made two changes one categories only appear here if they actually have resources attached to that category so there were a lot of categories that were put in that had nothing attached to them yet so in the response that we get from the wordpress api it actually lists how many resources are attached to that category so we can just check that and if it's more if it's one or more it shows up here otherwise it doesn't so right now it doesn't seem like there's a lot of categories but there there are and that'll be that's not something that I'm gonna be adding in but hopefully the people in charge of this content will be adding that in also the problem that we had on non Mac browsers I fixed that I just added in a little bit of CSS that made sure that these were always visible so they weren't visible on some in some cases like the the text was the same color as the background just depending on the browser and the operating system the way this displays just it looks different on between I think Firefox definitely I think it what it might have been every browser on Windows for sure looked bad and then Chrome on a boon to so so I'm pretty sure it was nearly every non every browser running on a system that wasn't a Mac was not displaying this correctly you just couldn't see anything so that's fixed now and I think that's it for the the changes so not you know not really a whole lot so now let's move on to the events oh the only other change which is minor I'm not gonna show it is I add in a button actually I did that on the stream on Friday so you already know about that the a change I made to that was I changed the text for the button so they had requested that I changed the text so for this page we just need to we're gonna go in here we're gonna pull in this day that these we may make these their own components so we'll see I'm not sure that that needs to be I did have to edit this a bit as well over the weekend on a small screen these were like huge and took up half so so these headers took up half the screen they're really big and so you could barely see any of this content so I made it just added in some media queries made it smaller maybe so that they would wrap before they weren't wrapping undo another line and then I had to fix the the heights and here to make them line up but I think it looks it's way more readable now than it was all right so let's check out the code for this and I was trying to bring in some data for this state weather displays or not I was going to make this this option to display the content or not I was gonna make that a true or false button within WordPress so that whoever was entering the content could set whether or not the content was displayed by default or whether you had to click to display it and that's when I ran into that error so I'll come back to that hopefully if I can fix that error but for now let's go to or yet courses no events we're gonna do events so let's go to events and it looks like yeah we aren't pulling anything in yet except for those events down the bottom there's nearby events so so we're going to need to pull in that data and let's see we got to decide I've I've pretty much been assured that the only there's always only going to be two things here so the bosko conference which is like the biggest events put on by this this institute and then this speaking the truth and love conference they're always going to be at the top here but I'm not really sure we probably be safe to just make these pages and pull them in and not have to make another custom post type long term I would suspect that maybe they would want to put something else up here and have more than two but since we're running short on time I think I'll just leave it as each one of these is going to be a page so this will end up being event intro event section 1 event section 2 and we'll just pull everything in from there it's gonna be we're gonna have to actually I don't know if we can right now because we're gonna need some custom fields to pull in some of these and if our plugins not working we can't pull those in so we can at least pull this and for now and then we're gonna have to hold off on this I may have this may have to wait until after we fix that plug in all right well at least let's pull this in and then that way we'll get some of the some of the code that we need in place that'll make it easier to do this later on so we'll go into where's my WordPress I'm gonna open up WordPress in another another tab since I want to keep that error message up I guess it doesn't matter since I put in pay spin but for now I'll keep that up and let's go in and create these pages oh that's some updates as probably things I am I worried about updating themes we're not really using them anyway so they'll go into pages and make a new page it's gonna be events intro so I think we've been calling them intro and then now let's yeah I'm just gonna copy this and paste it in and that should be yeah that's it that's all we need for this one okay cool so we have our slug events intro and that's what we're gonna want to look for so let's go over to our code and we're just gonna copy some of what we've been doing on our other pages so on the index page let's pull this over here so we can see them both so an index page we can just grab all of this oops I'm already already have that and threw me off because I had to state above it so we don't need to copy that but what we need to do is get okay we are doing some filtering here by date so I think that's okay we can still we can still do that but we need to pull in everything through this multiple post type so let's put that first so we need the multiple post type first and then we need to grab the type let's get rid of this that's what we need nearby event so let's put in our type equals nearby event and then we also need I'm gonna put this at the end just to make it more evident later on that all these filters are really for for this and I do want to see how this how this data gets pulled back so I've had some issues before with using filters when I use this multiple loops this multiple post type end point so I do need type page all right and I think let's just check this out in the browser and see what its gonna look like let's see if it even returns anything okay cool so we are getting a page and okay wow this actually worked a little simple things okay I see so this is this was the problem that I was running into before so when I put any type of filter on that end point it filters everything so right now the pages are being filtered as well as you know all of these which are all the nearby events are I'm sorry not not filtered but in terms of what we get back from WordPress it's filtering out all the things that we don't need so I'm only getting title in advanced custom fields okay so I do need more than that so I'll need the slug and I'll need the content as well so that should be it as long as I get the the slug and the content then that should be fine so let's make sure we add that in okay and I'm not gonna check it again because I'm pretty sure that that will work so now we're getting move this over so don't need anymore so now we should be getting all the data that we need we're still gonna have all the events but in addition we're gonna get all the pages so we can grab the page that we need to fill in this part all right so I will bring this over briefly let's see okay so we're gonna basically do this same thing here so let's just grab this and I'm gonna paste this in now obviously we don't want a blockquote for this section so instead we're gonna do don't want a pee thing no actually I don't I don't even want a paragraph tag in here I want they want to bring in this column and let's pull out all this we don't need this I'm gonna bring in this column hmm I thought I got rid of that I did it's I guess it's just messed up because I don't have a closing div for this so I guess for now I'm just gonna put this in I think it's gonna get taken out though whenever prettier runs whenever we say this it'll probably change that but for now it'll just keep in my mind when I see this it'll be easier to realize where all the dips go we do want to put flow text on here because we want that font size and let's get rid of this we don't need that and those content rendered go study yep that's it that's what we need the only other thing we need to change is this so we're gonna want to get events intro alright and that should give us what we need let's check back here on this page I guess it did not give us who he needed I'm gonna shadow refresh it just in case let me see what's on it so at least these are still showing up and my my dev server needs restarted and as soon as I get this working I'm gonna check the chat again it's been about 20 minutes and so check the chat just a mess something up hmm all right let's see what I messed up here let's go alright let me read this object keys Oh what did I do Oh area that's the problem I had this tag was actually closed and it shouldn't have been closed it should add all this in here now this will work that's why my highlighting was off I thought it was just it wasn't picking up this tag but in fact that I had closed that an opening tag all right okay cool so this is loaded in these are still loading properly awesome now we are gonna need to change a little bit about how we do this now so if you remember I guess a few weeks ago we had put in some things for instance we could move this around and see I should still working let's see maybe maybe we thought ahead about this my fear was that this would filter so these down here would filter through all the the data looks like it might still be I'm just worried that the pages that we're now getting up here will be counted in with the events yeah so we're just getting the data what are we setting the data the component did now hmm okay so we are getting the data we're filtering it so that any old events aren't displayed but so we may not have to worry about filtering it because it's possible that because the pages don't have the advanced custom field of dates that they're automatically getting filtered out but I don't want to leave it up to that in case that just seems to me like it's not really an explicit filter for those things and I'm a little bit worried about it so let's put in two filters and what I want to filter out is and I'll probably need to get I'll need to bring in type so we will need to get the post type as well so we're pulling them type in now that we're pulling the type in I can access type so I want type and I need it to equal and this is nearby event I think it would just be singular event we'll find out in a second as soon as I save this okay looks good I'm gonna do a refresh just to be sure all right great and to be really really sure we can always inspect and go over to react and we should be able to see our props and let's see so we have our page prop there but then this drops data yeah actually our our props own ups I'm sorry we're not the props are up here and that's fine that this is everything but we want to we want to set our state of data then so the state should be what only has the nearby events so let's see it actually it's not showing me anything about the state which is maybe I'm missing and how do I see the state in the react dev tools I know I've seen it before I'm not sure why it's not showing up now anyway it's it's obviously working because we see this we see this there's no crossover going on so in terms of seeing pages here what we shouldn't alright so that was good timing now it's time to go back to the live chat for at least five minutes we'll see what's going on here all right so I'm gonna go back up here okay hey Sebastian Sebastian said I need to add cursorpointer to the course title let's see actually I do that I have it on there I'm not working on let me check oops is it courses yeah actually it is working here so I'm not sure is it not working for you if so what what browser and device combination are you using alright hey everyone I see some people saying hi hey I'd have some questions so our play asks did you work with react native I have not worked with it yet I am going to be working with it soon probably by soon I mean sometime within the next few months so I'm taking a react course through Udacity and the last part of the course is deals with react native so hopefully when I do that part of the course I'll share with you how it is and I'm hoping that maybe I can have some sort of project at work that I'll be able to use react native with and then I could stream that so that would be cool maybe maybe I can do some type of video where I go through react native for whatever project that I'm doing for this course I'll have to see I assume it would be okay to stream stuff I'm doing for that course but I mean it's a paid course so I don't know if they want people streaming course material so I might have to double check on that just to make sure it's alright but anyway yeah I haven't worked with it yet but soon soon I will be rollin said just got here what's happening basically we're just going through what we did last week the end of last week just pulling in data from the wordpress api trying to refactor where we can and we had a little bit of an issue or we have an error coming up with one of our WordPress plugins so that's limiting a little bit what we can do but there's still enough to be done that you can definitely fill up the stream with other things okay so Andrew Ritter says sometimes cannot modify header info has to do with white space at the top or bottom of a PHP file okay that's uh that's interesting that's good to know I don't I didn't manually edit a PHP file so but I will check I'll definitely check that out maybe I can manually just look at the files and see if something's going on in there I don't see why I didn't update the advanced custom fields plugin was not actually updated directly so I don't know that it's that one I did update WordPress so it's possible that something with the newest version of WordPress is interacting with the advanced custom fields plugin but I don't know I it's I did hold off on updating WordPress for a while an advanced custom fields is a really popular plugin so you would think that any issues would have been sorted out but but anyway it's good to know Andrew thank you hey Zanna how's it going Suzanne has joined us in the live chat says Jessie you never read your Twitter while live have you sent me something on Twitter oh yeah I see it now okay I saw I saw your message so yeah that's true I don't always see what's going on on Twitter on when I'm live so I have my screen my third screen is filled up with the analytics for the chat or for the channel and in the chat window so I don't really have them and my OBS is up there so I don't have much space for for Twitter and actually I usually do see things that are going on on Twitter on my phone but I have the stream in what's Instagram so the Instagram stream is blowing on my phone so I'm not seeing anything which I don't even think anybody is watching me on Instagram so I suppose I could shut it off but hey Jeremy how's it going how Jeremy says always stoked to suggest these vids I'm glad to hear I'm glad you enjoy the videos okay so having some some comments in here about this air I'm gonna bring this air back up in case someone didn't see it from earlier since I'm gonna be referring to it now so I'm having this error or when I try to edit fields in the advanced custom fields plugin so Sara says the first warning was about for each and its same PHP page so header and for each are the problem Zanna says she's having a piece of cake actually the cake sounds really good right now I had I didn't remember to eat today so I went out and bought sushi for lunch so that was great but it doesn't really satisfy a sweet tooth at all and I tried nicely true I don't normally get like the canned coffee stuff but there is a cold brew canned coffee I don't know about it I'm not sure there's anybody know a good brand of cold brew coffee to buy I like it when I make it myself I haven't really found a store brought brand like a readymade brand that I like they always have this weird aftertaste okay so John Hanson says html5 video tag with source may be a better choice it's easier to use with JavaScript when you need an alternative to an embedded YouTube video yeah I hadn't thought of that so initially so Friday I think it was Friday afternoon or Friday night when I got the the new embed code saying like hey we don't want YouTube we want we want this so my my first thought was that that I would just download that video and then do an html5 video tag but I thought you know what it's worth a shot just to throw this embed code in and see if it works and I didn't expect expected to work in the same way that the YouTube embed code had worked because it's not even the same you know YouTube is an iframe and this one was actually a script tag so I was really skeptical of it and I'll bring it up here since I'm talking about it so y'all can see what I'm referring to you gotta have it on my index page so this is what what I popped in here in place of the YouTube iframe and it actually worked now unfortunately at the time I did not realize that it didn't work when I was using the clientside routing so I just realized that when I started working today and I was looking up some different ways to to fix that so I may end up going with that since I only have today and tomorrow to work on it if I don't hear back with the account information for JW player then I'm gonna have to go with the html5 thing the only reason I didn't want to do that is because it gives users a few more options when you have like the embedded player so they can pick different qualities of the stream and things like that and if there is any extras like closed captioning then that's available in an embed whereas I don't I have no idea if you if you can do that with html5 I assume there's some way to do it but I don't know how and I don't really have the time to do it so but anyway John that was my first thought as well so thanks for the for the suggestion some of my other sites I have known that route of using the video tag oh okay Sebastian reminded me I'm sorry I I got a lot of good advice from you all last week about how to fix my dev server and then I didn't I did never try it because so last week I had to if you remember I had to leave like immediately after I stopped streaming to go to a meeting with a client so I completely forgot what what you all said when I came in this morning I didn't I hadn't made I didn't even have time to make a note of it anywhere so I'm really sorry I'm over here talking about not being able to fix my dev server when you all already gave me plenty of things to try so I apologize for that I'll try that today I think I'm gonna work late today my wife is gonna have the kids at her parents house so I'm just gonna stay after and work so I'll definitely have time after the stream to work on that it kind of stinks though that I'm finally hopefully gonna fix my dev server and then I'm gonna move on to another project so but I kinda want to fix it now just just to say that I've fixed it and we've got one of my coworkers is joining in on the Instagram live livestream so so that's cool hey Liz how's it going but all right so I see I'm definitely gonna try to no Sebastian gave me some advice I'm pretty sure Patrick that you gave me some advice as well okay Patrick did say I don't need two filters I could just use you know an and one actually I think we had talked about this in an earlier stream and I don't know if you were watching at the time or not Patrick so I had I had proposed you know should I just do an x' or should I do the separate filters and the the consensus was that you don't need to do separate filters but it makes it more readable so that's why I ended up going with separate filters so I'm gonna keep going with that since I've got done throughout the site at this point but it is good to know for everyone if if you're watching if you're you know using filters like this you don't have to do separate filters you can chain together things in your filters this is just more of a style decision okay cool so I am earlier I had mentioned that I wasn't I wasn't seeing the state where's this in Devils so I was just seeing props in that state and several of you in the live chat have told me that because I need to actually click the component that has the state to see the state so that that is my problem and that's why I can't see the state so you see I'm only seeing props here so let me just try it while I have so which component I don't even remember which component I was trying to look at oh here we go okay so if you're using I don't know if this setup here is because of next j/s that it's it's slightly different so this I suppose this could look different in terms of how you're setting up reacting what you're using with it but for me at least the state it seems lives on this under slash class element here so yeah okay this is definitely what we're looking for so right here you can see we only have ten items in our array for data because we filtered everything out whereas we started with 26 items yeah we started with 26 and now we've gotten filtered down to 10 so that's filtering out anything that's not a nearby event in terms of type and also filtering out anything that an event that has already happened so it has a date that's in the past okay awesome thanks for letting me know because I I always that bothered me that a cait sometimes I could see the state and sometimes I couldn't and I could only see props and that's why so that's definitely gonna help me out now okay so Ennis has said something in another language so I'm not sure what that is but thanks for for joining the chat and let's see okay so Sarah says Fred Meijer has good cold brew so yeah I don't know I don't think they have Fred Meijer around here so I'm in Ohio so let's not all have to keep a lookout for it but I'm pretty sure that's not an option around here but I appreciate the suggestion okay so John says there is a way to build my own html5 player with all the stuff that I mentioned before like closed captioning and things and being able to pick the different options for video quality but it does take a lot of times yeah that would be really cool to do I would enjoy doing that at some point because I do everybody loves it when I put like the fullscreen background videos on sites around here I don't know what it is but if I want to impress somebody with a site all I have to do is put a background video in and and it's like they love it so that will probably be a good thing to learn how to do at some point okay I'm getting towards the the end of the live chat looks like there's some discussion about live reloading and hot reloading and webpack and different things which I'm going to skip over for now because it seems like there's a lot of good information being being spread in the live chat so I don't I don't think my contribution to that discussion will really be worth anything wait so alright Jeremy says Fred Meyers is owned by Kroger's really I did not know that gets nothing okay cool Rowland says Google has an open source project that covers front and backend for video players that's really cool and that's kind of surprising because you think Google would just say like go with go with the YouTube embed but that's that's cool that they have that and rhoann does say by the way Safari and probably Firefox will start to block a lot of place yeah I do I know Safari will block autoplay so I actually kind of just did a little workaround for that but yeah I kind of I don't like doing auto plays anymore I have done them in the past but I've kind of changed my mind on auto place and decided that I think auto plays are somewhat annoying so I right now like I've gone more like what I've done with this site in putting just a button to play I still think there is a place for auto plays to be used like I'm not entirely against them but it can just be annoying like I know for me sometimes the videos just autoplay depending on what the video is I can get motion sick from the videos not not really I'm not really into it I actually got sick I was developing a site before where I had full screen background video that would kept audio autoplay and I kept getting sick and getting headaches like at every single day and I couldn't figure it out and then finally I realized that the reason that I was getting sick was because of all this autoplay video because I had to sign up on multiple screens and I had it on a on a mobile device as well so even in my peripheral vision I was getting all of this autoplay video going and it was just so once I stopped doing that then I didn't get headaches anymore and I didn't feel sick anymore all right so I my stream on Instagram ended so if you wanted to see my face too late not that not like anybody did but I just wanted to tell you all that in case somebody who was joining in and and saw the link and wanted to watch alright so let's go back to this so basically at this point this is all we're gonna do for this page or I'm sorry we weren't on this page we're on the events page this is all we're gonna do for the events page this is the live site where am I so definitely want to pull this stuff in but need to fix that plugin first and I'm just so hesitant to work on the plugin because if it if it deletes this the fields for the other stuff then that's that's gonna be a really big deal when it's gonna mess up the live version of the site so I want to be really really careful about how I do that okay so the resources page is going to be pretty easy we just need to pull this in which is going to be basically the same thing that we just did with the events page we're gonna do here so we'll go ahead and do it it may be a bit boring let me start my timer may be a little bit boring since we just done it but especially for anybody who might be new then repetition is always a good thing to try to figure out how it's done all right so let's bring let's good idea we don't need this I'm gonna get rid of a lot of this stuff because don't say I don't think I have anything important there I have a lot of untitled pages so I that has nothing in it all right I don't need this anymore what is this I don't need this anymore and I need that okay this was from one of the earlier live chats I think this is something I brought over I don't need that okay awesome so now I'll actually be able to see what's going on up here and we'll move the events page over so we can just copy it over the code that we just used here and resources okay so and our resources and our initial API call we need to just do the same thing that we had done to the other one who want to grab this novel passe we're going to say and type equals resources the Titleist I'm sorry I think it I think it's singular as a resource how did we do it over here yeah and then where else we're gonna make sure that we get type and we need title we're also going to need content and we're gonna need slug okay and then finally we need another type equal page okay let me double check yep page alright so we have that and then now we're gonna set the state and for this data when we set the state we actually we want this table stated we want to filter this and we're gonna do the same thing we did before we're gonna filter out those type loose we have filter out those pages because we just want the resources in here now in the intro section that's here we can copy and paste and this will be yeah we can pretty much copy and paste this with very minimal editing and since we have the column already in there post that and then all we have to do is say make this the resource resources intro now I don't really have that yet so it's not gonna do anything so we need to go back in WordPress and make a page a new page the resources intro and ascitic shouldn't have saved it first but i can just grab it here and paste it in there let's publish it and now let's try again all right so that worked great and it looks like everything's still working down here awesome okay so that page is done and with the exception of that a little bit on the events page and then those cards on the home page that's everything that we needed to pull in in terms of you know data from the wordpress api that needs to be editable so we still can't make that live yet until I figure out what's going on with this plugin let me see what else we could do let's check I want to check this and catch us up a bit I definitely spent another definitely another Pomodoro session it was more than one according to the timer but I I don't want to I don't exactly want to count them as equal and when I'm doing the stream since I stopped you know occasionally and answer questions so what we need to do Oh actually I know what I wanted to do something earlier and I had completely forgotten so now it's a great time to show you so I had on fright I think it was either Friday or maybe Saturday morning I can't remember for sure Patrick had submitted a pull request to refactor the expanding section component so the I think it was the last thing we were doing on Friday was refactoring the component are attempting to refactor that and I didn't get it you know finished completely so Patrick went in and let's see of course you all can see this you know for your cell phone on github it's definitely available but I just wanted to give give credit where it's due here so you can see like how much nicer this looks and you can see this is just definitely like a much much more lean component here way easier to read so anyway so thanks Patrick I am I merged that in over the weekend when I was working on that and I really appreciate appreciate that so and as you can see it's being used right now on dev the only reason that it's not on the master branch yet is because I was I'm just having issues with that with that plugin as soon as I get those sorted out then everything is going to be used in the master branch on the production servers okay well I wasn't planning on doing any PHP stuff but at this point I kind of think I should I mean that's logically just the next thing that is blocking me from getting done what needs to be done so if there are no vociferous objections to me doing some PHP I'm going to so I didn't I didn't plan on it but let's just take a look at at what's going on here so I'm gonna move this to my other screen and I'm gonna bring up WordPress I'm just going to go through for now at least I'm gonna see if I can get to that first file right from this admin panel let me make this bigger all right so what we're looking for is controllers core controllers field group looks like not seeing all right not seeing yeah so I can't you can't always see all the all the fields are all the files that you need from here so it doesn't look like I'm gonna be see gonna be able to see it so this might be a problem because I don't think I have access to the files on this server directly but let's look up see if anything is on here there we go there's something in support it's a couple of things as ODS because I wasn't attempting to use the repeater field that one wasn't helpful yeah so this these are all talking about the repeater field which I'm not even using I don't think I can use the repeater field unless I get the paid version yep yeah not it all right I'm gonna check let me check the live chat quickly no evil s what is that Bell so this was right around 300 300 p.m. there's the Bell so so as you all know I work at a Catholic University so around 300 p.m. and my building a lot of people from the building get together and they pray together for like 10 15 minutes at 3 o'clock so somebody rings a bell to do the reminder for 3 so I obviously haven't been able to do it in in that because I do my live chats at 200 so but they usually do they do a prayer called a Divine Mercy chaplet 3 3 is like 3 PM's the traditional time to do that that prayer so that's what the Bell is for so that's why you always hear about at 300 300 p.m. Eastern Time all right so I'm just going up quickly just to see if I've missed anyone's questions Patrick says autoplays evil yeah Joseph says hi I'm jr. frontend I don't really understand what you're explaining but I just keep listening to you because your videos giving me more motivation awesome well I'm glad that it's it's helping you out in some way so yeah I'll probably towards the end of the project is probably more difficult to understand what's going on but when I start up a new project and it'll probably be way easier for you to follow along and then you know if you can if you can join in on on you know most of the streams then you'll be able to kind of work through it all and understand everything Sode says by the way which project are you working in sir I guess I'm assuming that that was of trying to see if you were he was having a conversation with somebody else said I this is the same project that we've been working in the katha catechol institute react website so in particular though right now we were trying to figure out an error that we're getting with a wordpress plugin and I was just taking a little break to check catch up on the live chat here since I wasn't really finding much that was useful I guess I should let's just pop in this and see if something comes up your PHP no it's it's still saying repeater PHP and and these alright let me finish with what I was going to do in the in the live chat here Joseph says I wonder if it's possible to see your previous livestream and and Zanna answered so Thank You Zanna and for anybody that can't see the live chat yeah you can watch all the previous streams on free code camps channel if you want to go really far back to like the first day I started working on this site the first few videos are on my channel which is linked in the description if you wanted to start from the beginning okay it looks like there's there is a decent amount of discussion about best practices in regard to streaming videos and like because we're talking about autoplaying videos and things so it looks like there's Google on Google Chrome's github there's a repo called sample media PWA and Rowin says that has a lot of good streaming video best practices so so check that out I just saw I had asked if there was any objections to doing trying to figure out the error in WordPress and I just saw Janet said I object but she was kidding those surfers Patrick cave the definition of vociferous yeah is that was it that's a decent word right vociferous not don't really use it too often but it fit Patrick says he is a vociferous opponent of PHP in general but not in this case so all right good all right Sarah saying three from bottom looks like it might be helpful and I probably changed the page before I saw that so let's see once I might have to hit back so let me go I'm just gonna open up a few more of these and see if any of them work oh this is do you see this this is ridiculous so warning you know the title of this thing just has it there's no explanation and just problem solved that's so helpful and being really sarcastic sorry I didn't upgrade so that's not really mmhmm I don't think that even has anything to do with it no I don't think that's not the same issue all right let's I want to try want to try something okay all right so it doesn't matter what I do or what let me change the field type I was trying to get an idea for like what this hmm yeah it doesn't matter field group PHP yeah so I can't add anything now I really this had to have had something to do with updating let me figure I need to I really want I want to look up which version of WordPress I'm using right now you see if there's some type of issue before point eight okay let me I'm gonna pull in some in this area no arguments who won't see it as the repeater field this is always what happens see I wonder well at least I'll be able to see what what's in this part of the file was on that line all right so this is the line is throwing the air and Nan says it's one o'clock in the morning here in India and I'm staying awake to see this livestream you're a great inspiration thanks for this man I really appreciate that I think it's amazing that you're staying up to watch me do this dream and yeah thanks for saying that I I'm happy that my stream is its inspiration to you and yeah that makes me anyway I when I hear stuff like that I do really appreciate it makes me want to keep streaming yeah someone had said earlier lefty said earlier there's always time to pray so yeah that is definitely true yeah so I do miss the prayer at 3 o'clock which a chemist thing I I did kind of like you know getting together with everybody and praying it's kind of nice because sometimes you know you don't always get along with all your coworkers but it's cool to come together you know and pray for each other so kind of helps helps get through all the the tension of normal workdays but but there's definitely other times throughout the day for prayer car I'm sorry I don't Musharaf pronounces cart car needs cook says hello is there a series where you start to hook up your project to WordPress yes so I don't know about a series but there's definitely a video where I hook things up to WordPress and I don't remember offhand what the title of that video would be but I'm pretty sure if you check out this plet the live coding with Jesse clay list on free code camp and just look for the titles that say WordPress then it'll be one of those and I'll show a show a little bit about how I set up WordPress about how I pull in data and things like that I'll probably end up doing some sort of tutorial video on my own channel about that because that would be I want to like do tutorial videos to show how all the sites that I make for for this university work and then that way if someone else if something happens to me and someone else needs to work on the sites then they'll be able to see what's going on from the videos and hopefully it can also help other people who are doing similar projects elsewhere to kind of just see how I did things okay so I think my here it is all right so let me see it was talking about the the post ID this was wait I mean this looks why would the post IDs be be the problem the thing is I think this file itself has not undergone any changes for like two years I think I think that's what it said I really hate to restore the backup because I I did add things and let me see what where that when the last backup is because I added a lot of data in and I think it was all done after I backed it up I hate to have to add that in add it back in again but I'm not sure you know what I don't really think that I have the access that I need to try to fix this because really what I really want to be able to do is check out I mean I could see this with this file supposed to be doing but I want to be able to see this file and right now I don't have access to that file so I need to I need to talk to the guy that setup the server and that's one of my coworkers set it up I need to talk to him and get access to this and see what's going on all right so yeah for uh probably for this dream I think now I'm just I'm gonna go to the live chat I'm gonna take some questions and then I'll probably wrap this dream up because I want to be able to talk to my my colleague about this this plugin error before he leaves I don't want to make him stay late trying to figure this out so I left the end I know I kind of plan on doing this dream until 400 it's 330 so it'll probably end around there depending on how many questions I get anyway so I guess it'll be about the same length as normal so I feel this just feels like a weird stream it's been a bit frustrating I guess I it's a little bit different I tried to do some different stuff at the beginning and then ended up ended up with this getting an error two minutes before the stream started so a little bit of a weird stream hopefully somebody got something helpful out of the stream which seemed like a few people said at the very least they got inspiration out of it so I guess that's just how it goes some days you just you just have problems so that we could get some things accomplished and so if anyone has any questions now would be the time to put them in the live chat or you can direct message me on Twitter you can put it in the comments for this video and I'll get to them as soon as I can right now I'm gonna scroll up a bit in the chat i'ma go through and see if I missed anyone's question and don't worry if you're new like don't worry about asking questions that you think might not be a good question or it might be kind of like a noob question to ask don't I it does not bother me you can ask me ask me whatever you want even if you think it's a silly question I'm definitely beginnerfriendly in terms of the questions here nobody is going to nobody will ridicule you if you ask a beginner question oh yeah I just went up up to the top of the stream and I saw so Jeremy was in the stream Jeremy I don't know if you're still there but yeah you you just got a new job how is it going did you start yet I can't remember if you started a job yet if so and you're still watching let me know how it goes otherwise maybe I'll catch you tomorrow or sometime later this week in the stream and we can get an update on the new job oh yeah I forget to tell you all so last week on Friday I ended the stream was gonna go right to a meeting with a client so the client never showed up turns out that she had emailed me while I was streaming and I didn't see the email so I had gotten so many emails during the stream they got pushed down in my inboxes normally I'll check at least I'll see him come up on my phone as I'm streaming and I can see if there's something important well I just got too many emails right around the same time and it didn't even show up in my notifications that had already been pushed down so anyway so I had rushed to the place where I was supposed to meet and she didn't come luckily that place had good WiFi well I wouldn't I don't know if it was good WiFi but it was good enough WiFi for me to get a do a little bit so I was able to to at least get a few things done while I was waiting before I saw the email that she wasn't gonna be there so I had a little bit of coffee and did a little work so it wasn't wasn't a complete waste inside wasted time to go but now I still have no idea what's gonna happen with this potential client in this project so I'll keep you all in front informed we might meet this Friday so we'll see we'll see how it goes but it's not really a good sign for a client if they if they bail on the first meetings it's not not really sure that this is a Frederick that I want to work on okay I'm scrolling down I'm getting down towards the bottom of the live chat so it looks like I had kept up pretty well with with the questions and you all do a great job on the live chat of answering everyone's questions most of the time you answer the question is better than I could before I even see them okay Patrick I just saw your comment when I was I pointed out you know that Patrick kid had done the pool request refactoring that big component so and Patrick says happy to do it it was a fun exercise and refactoring so well I'm glad you had fun doing and I do I very much appreciate the help that was those really awesome and when you all send that pool requests like I always learned so much from them so I always look I go line by line I check out what you which you've done and not that I don't trust you it's more for me because I learned so much just seeing how you do things as opposed to what what I had done and just learning a lot by how you improved it I'm I'm amazed at how much more I learned from looking at your pool requests then I I've learned from just looking at code or you know it's it's it's just a different thing when you see somebody else's take on your code trying to solve the same problem that you had and just making it doing in a better way just it's really really helpful just way more helpful and in educational than I ever thought it would be ooh Tom asks is there any SAS tutorial video from free code can't I don't I don't know offhand I haven't done a video so I know for sure that I haven't done a SAS tutorial video for free code camp I think I have used tonight you says I think I use some sass and some of my earlier videos but it certainly wasn't a tutorial it was just me using it so I don't know I'm sorry I can't I don't remember offhand if there is any videos on free code camp but free the free code camp YouTube channel has a lot of videos so there's certainly playlists that I have not checked out so there may be something in there but I just I don't know so if anybody else has ever seen anything on free code camps channel about sass please let us know in the in the live chat or in the comments of this video or again I know I have seen other tutorial videos for sass elsewhere so there are definitely some good ones which I'm like who uses I can't remember what I've seen really good ones but when you're talking about SATs I assume you mean like the scss version of SAS and not like the original success that is just all like indentation if you want to know about the original SAS that is different it let's say more different from CSS then s CSS so I confused myself with all this then travis has a guy named Travis does a youtube show called dev tips and I know he's done videos on that but he does use kind of like the the older version of sass which doesn't have any like punctuation everything's done with indentation so may not be what you want because I don't think very many people use use that format that much at least I don't see it very often I I have used it for a project the only thing I don't like about it is it's not you can't just copy and paste in regular CSS from somewhere and have it work with s CSS you can and that's that's kind of a big deal especially if you're using a framework for a project because off frequently you know you need to just copy in pieces of stuff so anyway sorry I can't remember any other videos other than that okay Patrick also mentioned def chip dev tips channel okay Patrick prefers the SAS format versus s CSS yeah honestly I wish I wish that you could that there was some way to copy in regular CSS into SAS and then I probably would still use the just the like regular SAS format instead of s CSS because it's so fast to type which is the indentation I really really like that it'd be cool if maybe you there was just some type of tag like and if you put something inside that tag then it could be regular CSS and it would work you know to break the flow of the normal thing I don't know if that would be possible to put in or something but that would be that would be cool that would make it ideal for me and I would I would still use it I think Rohan says he prefers s CSS over SAS but probably is because the muscle memory is trained trained for semicolons yeah that's true Rowan says I thought s CSS and SAS are developed in parallel yeah I'm not really sure that might be read I always just assumed that SAS was the older of the two but I might be mistaken now what I think about I'm not really sure where I learned that from it was probably just an assumption on my part Jay asks hey Jessie which do you prefer react or angular and why so I do prefer react but I will say I don't think I am experienced enough with angular to have a very good opinion about it so I think they're both really good for what they do for me I've had an easier time learning react I tried to learn angular a few years ago probably more than a few at this point maybe like three or four years ago and I didn't have it wasn't that easy for me to learn and I wasn't able to really make anything great with it so but I my experience with JavaScript in general was like really minimal at that point I wasn't that good with it so that probably is why I didn't have a very easy time with it but I think react is I like react because it seems pretty easy to to pick up on you don't need to learn a lot of extra stuff it seems like most of it I know there is some this huge debate on Twitter recently about saying that things are just JavaScript and I don't want to get into that whole debate but like saying that react is a lot of just JavaScript is a lot of it is like normal JavaScript syntax you don't need to learn all this extra stuff when I don't know what angular is like now but angular felt it felt like there was a lot more like the templating syntax that was specific to angular that I needed to learn but like in react JSX works just like normal HTML the tags are all really the same and in terms of like when I want to do more templating stuff like I use template literals which are a part of JavaScript so it seems like when I'm developing with react I use more of things that are already built into JavaScript to get things done when I was working with angular I always had to look up the angular way to do things like even things like iterating over elements or something like that there was like an NG something that did everything so I liked the fact that react with react I'm not just learning the react way to do things but I'm learning JavaScript ways to do things so that I could use with other projects that I'm not using react on so I kind of like that I like the fact that react works like react can be rendered to other things so you know you can use react native to build mobile apps you can go desktop apps you can even do VR stuff so that's kind of cool I really like all of that so anyway but as I said I don't I haven't used any of the newer versions of angular so I don't think it's really a fair comparison on my part between the two because I don't have any knowledge at all of any of the newer stuff but anyway I hope that answers your question and I know I've talked about this before previously but it looks like Karl asked a similar question hey Jesse after learning Jay s do you recommend react or angular so the similar question not exactly the same the first one was what do I prefer the second one is what do I recommend so yeah and you asked it like in terms of after learning Jaso after learning JavaScript do you prefer react or angular I I actually don't think you need to wait until after you learn JavaScript maybe it seems like that's implied in the question at least implied that you're saying you you're gonna learn jobs here first and then go to a framework I don't think you need to and here's the here's how I feel about learning JavaScript in everything like if you're trying to work and make money like if you need to pay the bills if you have to support your family or something like that like we can't talk about the idea if we want to talk about the ideal situation of what should you learn when and in what order like we can talk about that all day if we want to but there aren't very many people that are in that ideal situation where they get to spend all their time learning and don't have to worry about actually like fulfilling requirements from clients and things like that so my advice would be learn what you have to learn to pay the bills you know and to to make your clients happy and don't worry about saying I want to learn all of JavaScript first I'm not saying that's what you mean by that question but just in general I would say to anybody starting out don't worry so much about saying the guy you know I got to learn vanilla JavaScript I don't want to mix with anything that'll come if you want to pick up right off the bat egg do some basic JavaScript enough so that you can start to understand react and I would recommend react and for reasons mentioned above like I've just had a much easier time doing it and you do learn a lot more in my opinion you learn a lot more of regular JavaScript stuff when you're doing things with react and you have less of you know really and react in terms of react only stuff it's really like the component lifecycle functions and things that's the only like react only way of doing things that I've seen so anyway I would recommend going to react and I would say like don't as soon as you can start to understand react and build things with it then go for it you'll pick up a lot of the JavaScript like for me I picked up so much JavaScript like I had never used filter or map before I used react I had built a ton of stuff I have I've built websites using javascript for years before I ever used react and I never use filter or map so those are like things that I use constantly now that I did not use before I mean that's just one example but my javascript skills have increased while I'm learning react so if I would have waited and said I'm gonna learn all this stuff it probably would have taken me a long time and now at this point I'm getting better with JavaScript but I also now know how to use react so I don't think they have to be separate I think you can you can move into it at the same time and I think just in general you shouldn't worry so much like about the order of learning things like unless you're in the unique situate of saying I don't have to worry about making money I have all the time in the world I can try to do this the perfect way well then maybe maybe you do want to go in order of mastering plain vanilla JavaScript first but I don't I don't really know that there's much merit in that I think that you're fine to just go right into a framework and then and I would recommend react in in that case okay Patrick asks also in in regard to those last two questions definitely in the live chat now or in the comments and the video later on please I invite you know any anyone watching this to join in that discussion as well as I said I don't have a lot of experience with angular so I would appreciate someone who maybe has more experience with both giving their opinion on that Patrick asked what was the name of a newsmen park you took your kids to I went to some near you as a kid but don't remember the names yeah actually it was called Idlewild it's in Ligonier Pennsylvania so it was a there signs up all over Idlewild saying that it was voted the best children's amusement park in the world which I don't know I'm not really sure like how that who votes for that right but anyway it is pretty good X if you're anywhere near Pennsylvania and it's Ligonier is kind of near Pittsburgh Pennsylvania so it's in the like the south western corner of Pennsylvania but if you're anywhere near there and you have kids definitely check it out it's really cool there's a water park and an amusement park so there's a lot of rides the smaller kids can ride to not really like very many big roller coasters or anything so if you're into like really fast scary roller coasters that's not really the place to go but if you have little ones that can't ride those kind of rollercoasters anyway Idlewild it's a place to go if your kids like mr. Rogers or like Daniel Tiger's neighborhood they have a whole like you can take a ride on trolley and they take you into Daniel cider Tigers neighborhood and really cool like my one of my my sons is he's about to turn three next week and he loves Daniel Tigers so that was super fun taking him through the ride on trolley so been anyway really cool my only complaints about the entire place or the the food is so expensive which i think is normal for amusement parks like you get in there and like they charge you like double which you would normally pay for something and it's not even good so the food is expensive and not really that good I didn't I didn't like that also it was weird they had they were playing music at various like parts of the park and the some of the music had profanity in it and it's like this place is marketed as a familyfriendly like little kids theme park and I thought that was odd that they would choose to play music like that around around children so other other than those two things I have no complaints I've been there I went there when I was a kid and now I've I've taken my kids there for a few years now so anyway totally not related to coding but it may be useful to youth if you're near Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Alberto says traversée media also has videos web dev videos and I'm assuming that this is in regard to the videos about sass Oh Sara says try level up sucks yeah you're right yes Sara they definitely have videos on that I totally forgot about them I John Hansen says I you sass love it best way to learn it is to use node sass in production with a linter it's the fastest way to learn it yeah that's what I think that's how I had it set up as well yeah I normally do you sass I just didn't never set it up for this project so in future projects I'll most likely be using sass so if you're interested in learning more about sass it will be coming well okay rollin looked it up and said s CSS and sass syntax are being they're developed in parallel so that's cool when they actually have four different styles that's cool I never really okay and so sass is the original syntax and it's still supported and then s CSS is a CSS compatible format and it's the default format for sass three and up so okay cool so I wasn't just making it up it was that that was actually then so I was I was mistaken and the fact that I didn't realize that it was still being developed but it was the original one all right Amelio asked it's a question that could be difficult to answer but how much money does an advanced front end of make an hour all right so I don't yeah this is going to be difficult to answer obviously as as everyone knows it does depend on you know where your location is and things like that and also I don't know that I would consider myself an advanced frontend dev so I can't speak from experience to that but I will say my hourly rate ends up so I make a salad salary so but I have calculated my hourly rate before and I think if you factor in I think if you factor depending on whether or not you factor in my benefits and things like that I think I make between thirty and forty dollars an hour for what I do right now and that's like assuming that I'm not working any extra which currently I am working a lot of overtime that I don't like it's not I don't really make extra money for overtime so yeah so right now it's somewhere between thirty and forty dollars an hour for me freelance I can make more than that so now of course when you're freelancing like there's there's a whole there's all kind of extra overhead that goes into things that makes it not as desirable I guess like you you know you have to handle all your business taxes and client invoicing and contracts and things so there's extra headache that goes with that but I would say like as a freelancer depending on who the client is like if they're nonprofit or not and what kind of work I'm doing it would fluctuate but like right now I would I probably even for a nonprofit I wouldn't think about taking any project that would be like below fifty dollars an hour and I don't even know if I would go that low but right now I'm really busy I don't have a lot of time if I had more time I don't know maybe I think about it or if it was a really good cause and they didn't have any money I would maybe think about corn lower but realistically for like a business client like my price range per hour is is around a hundred a hundred dollars an hour if I lived in a like a big city it would be higher than that but the area that I live in has a pretty low cost of living for in terms of like the United States standard of living so I think I can get away with that but if I was in a bigger you know if I was in San Francisco I doubled for sure I don't know if I could make that or not but the cost of living there is so much more expensive I would definitely go more so I don't know if any anyone else has anything that to add into that but that's been my experience personally with you know pricing and things and I know there's like it's hard to find like reliable data I've seen a lot of studies and different things about like what do frontend devs really make but I always just wonder how reliable it is so I'm not sure but anyway Emilio I hope that helped to answer your question a bit I will say this so you did ask about an advanced frontend dev but I think it might be helpful to talk about like it just starting out and say like when I was just starting out I worked for $10 an hour doing like I guess it was kind of frontend dev work it I did like barely any like JavaScript coding and more like some basic like CSS HTML stuff but I started out at dollars an hour so there's definitely quite a range all right cool I just saw Jay said Jessie thanks for your great advice I'll get with react now all right cool yes I mean I'm not like I said I don't think I'm an expert with reacting for sure I'm not an expert with angular but yeah I do I am confident enough to recommend going with react I think you'll be you'll be happy with it there's a lot of jobs for react developers right now so I've had fun using it so far Rowen says you never completely learn anything in a coding world there's always new things changes etc there are features like map and reduce that are es6 plus and that you will be fine without knowing them yeah that's definitely true I hadn't even thought of that but realistically like javascript is a changing language so it's it's not even a reasonable goal to say you would want to learn you know let's learn JavaScript like you don't just learn JavaScript because it's changing and so you could never just learn it and have know it all oh cool so Patrick has been to the same amusement park that I took my kids do so cool it's uh there are parts of it that have not changed at all since I went there when I was a kid and then if they've certainly added a lot on since then but it's kind of cool that there are still parts that look exactly the same Rowan says amusement parks and movie theaters charging ten times the price for stuff not worth the original price that's for sure yeah to me it's like I mean I realized like as a business they're just trying to make a lot of money but I wouldn't I wouldn't be as upset if the food that they charged so much for was really good like I don't mind paying money for things that are of good quality and they're worth the money but if you're charging more and then the food is just bad it's like bet that upsets me like obviously like they you're paying enough that they could get better quality ingredients you know they but they don't jordan asks what about less so if you're not familiar with less or sass for that matter those are CSS preprocessors so basically it's it's a way to let you do things to help you write CSS faster and do things that you normally can't do in CSS like have variables and do different types of you know like things that are closer to which you can do in a programming language but being able to do it with CSS so less is one type of preprocessor sass is another type of free processors so some people you says some people use less I personally have never used less so I can't really comment too much about it it seems like the trend is towards sass so if you are gonna start to learn something now I would say go with sass but you know for instance bootstrap the popular you know library like CSS framework library is they used to use less and with the newest version of bootstrap they're moving to sass so like you know things like that where you know big frameworks are switching from less to sass leading me to believe that sass would be the better way to go but I've even heard people talk about not even using that anymore that CSS as a language is starting to support things so I think sass will still be useful for years enough people use it in projects that it's not going to go anywhere anytime soon at some point yes regular CSS will probably catch up and browsers will catch up and perhaps you won't need the things that sass can do but for now at least I though I still think is pretty useful Sahra asks what would be the best way or resource to start learning react after learning basic JavaScript I guess code Academy has a beginners course on react free code campus react stuff Udacity has a course and reacts that that is paid the the first two are free those would be good ways to start out with and react create react app and the react documentation are a great ways to get started in it if you need certain features like serverside rendering or routing built in you could start with next Jas and it helps you kind of get started without having to learn all the you know web pack and and things which can be kind of confusing at first there are a lot of good videos on react so those are my it's not super specific of a list but I think those are good ways to start out with and there's somebody last week at some point in a live chat somebody posted a link to a great resource on git that had all these different things to learn I believe it was react I can't remember what that link was though it's possible I still have it up on my computer somewhere but I have a lot of tabs and windows open so I hope maybe if I can find it I'll post it in the description for this video I can't promise that I'll be able to find it because that's possible that I closed it out and but I do think I starred that repo I did start it so yeah so maybe I'll try to find it among when I start repos and post it in the chat and if you want to you can send me a message a direct message on Twitter to remind me about that and then I can just send you the link to that resource as well if you'd like my guess what would you give for the hundred dollars per hour I mean what level of a site okay so yeah so the site if it was $100 an hour I mean probably this type of site that I would be doing would be like a react site and that's why it to me at this point $100 an hour that it's not so much of a level of like this is this is what you would get but more of that's what that's what it would take to make it worthwhile for me to take more time because I already have a full time job that's more than full time often you know I'm often working extra and I'm taking a course on the side and I have some some clients on the side that I'd be recurring work for you know and I just I already wish I had more time for my kids and my family and so for me to even consider taking any more time away from my family to do something it would have to be worthwhile in terms of bringing in more money for my family like a reasonable amount of money so that I could in my mind I could say well I'm gonna make at least make their lives a little bit better by bringing in this money and it's it's probably a poor tradeoff I don't know if this is the right way to think about it but it's like well if I can't be with them for that hour like I at least want to be able to say like I'm gonna provide some security for them or be able to give them something that you know it's gonna at least make up a bit for that and I got to think like well I need to be able to pay someone to like take care of my let my lawn you know cut the grass or do repairs on my house because I'm gonna be working and I won't have time to do that so it's not so much like I wouldn't explain it like this to a client but for my point of view the price that I said is like what is it going to take to get me to do that from and if a client wants to pay me that much they're gonna recognize like I really want this guy to do my site because he's good or whatever and what is it gonna take for me to get Jesse to do my site now if I was really going after clients which I'm not and I was trying to market myself to clients I would put it in terms like this is the value that the site's going to bring to you like you're gonna get so many more customers you're gonna sell so many units of this product or service and so this site is gonna actually bring you you know let's say this much money like let's just say like this sites gonna bring you in another like 50 thousand dollars a year and you're only gonna pay me ten thousand dollars or something so I'm gonna bring value so if I had to explain it to a client in terms of value I would explain it like that but you know in terms of my own motivation for it it's entirely based on like I just don't have that much time so it needs to be worth my while for me to work on it so it's kind of an odd I don't know it's kind of an odd situation when I was freelancing it was it was a different thing it was like I need to set a price that's fair for me but it's still competitive so that I can actually get clients so there's a whole different ballgame but when when you have enough work I really feel like the only reasonable way to set your price is like what's my time worth to me and the busier you are the more your time is going to be worth so my my rate of what I'm willing to work for change is based on how busy I am but I will say when I get when I get paid well to do a job I I do a good job I'm obviously not just in it for the money like I want to work on projects that are things that I'm interested in and I want to do a really good job on them so I don't really feel bad about charging more because I think people are getting a really good product from the work that I do hopefully that answered your question Mike dono asks can I get a job after completing frontend so I'm assuming that means like the front end certificate from free code camp I've heard of a lot of people I guess I don't know a lot is a relative term but I have I know that there are people who have gotten jobs after completing the front end certificate so obviously it's not a guarantee that you can get a job but if you check out the free code camp forum you'll see stories of people that have done just that and I would recommend that check out their stories see kind of what they did how they went about trying to find a job after they completed the certificate and that'll give you a better idea of if that's you know how close is their experience to your experience you know and give you a better idea what your chances are realistically of getting a job but but it definitely happens people do get jobs after the completing the front end certificate rhoann does says freelance depends on area of expertise location experience connections yeah don't underestimate the connections thing your your freelance the amount of work you can get and how much you can charge is definitely depending on your connections my best clients were just came from connections Emilia says thanks Jessie I've set my projects very low so I would take your advice I mainly do WordPress sites with strong design okay cool yeah hopefully and I mean it's it's it's hard to set your rate based on what other people are doing especially if they're not in the same market and to like geographically years so I guess the best thing that to do would be try to figure out what people in your own area are charging or or in like the area that you're targeting because you you know you can do remote work for people somewhere else like I ended up doing remote work mostly for people in around New York City because I could charge more and they that was a reasonable thing around where I was at people would freak out if they were gonna pay me $100 an hour they just didn't understand the cost of a quality website and the value of it so I just I completely just quit trying to get clients in my own area because it wasn't worth my time you know to try to put in all the effort to get a new client and make a contract and all that stuff and have preliminary meetings when they wanted to spend you know $200 and get a website you'll get an ecommerce website for $200 with you know that's just if they wanted that that's fine but I wasn't gonna be the guy that was going to do that for him okay all right there's some links so hopefully we had some people ask about react and there's been some some links put in there so there's some github repos so once called awesome react another repo is react Redux links so search for those on github and this will have a lot of information for you about resources for learning react alright so Mike says okay that makes sense I would love to go into doing some freelance just do not know where to be in finding clients alongside the two companies I'm already running and I'm terrible pricing yeah it it takes a lot I think it just takes time to get good with trying to estimate prices like just experience and to get the confidence to be able to go in and say like you know this is how much it's gonna cost and it was it was really tough for me at first starting out you know it's for all that stuff and it does it helps a lot now that I I don't like need the money in it really helps helps you be a lot more confident when you're in negotiations with a client like to just say like hey this is this is my price take it or leave it and be confident knowing that you could walk away and you'd be fine you can still pay all your bills but that's I don't know that there's anything you can just do to get good at that right away it's just it just takes time Emilia says I now charge two thousand US dollars approximately for a wordpress site that has some heavy design on it in some functionality that's cool yet and I would say especially with WordPress sites I thereof I have seen freelancers like seeing their websites where they have it set up that that they'll charge a certain amount of money per WordPress site and they have it like very structured to say like the client owes them this amount of money and this content and these materials by a certain date and then they deliver on a certain date and any deviation is not allowed in the contract like it's in the contract and so that they are really and they're booked up and they know exactly what work they're going to be doing for months in advance and if a client wants them to do the work they have to meet the requirements in terms of getting the content and the payments in on time that's really a nice set up and then you know you can do a wordpress site for $2000 if you have it like that the the problem I found sometimes is you do a site and you have a client that drags their feet you know they're they don't get you the right content needed or they don't get back to you with important questions that you know you need the answers to for a really long time so that a site that should have taken you know a small amount of time and all of a sudden drags out it's months and months and months and it messes up your other projects it's hard to so I suppose I wouldn't be as opposed to doing like smaller sites if I had some type of structure set up like that to where I knew I would I would turn over sites quicker I I mean if you're gonna do know it just is just basic math right if you're gonna do smaller sites for less money you need to be able to do a lot of them or you could try to go for really big projects they're gonna be a lot of money and you know take up months and months to do them so either way I like if you need to pay the bills you take whatever you can get and I've been there and but I think Emilio I think that's not bad you know $2,000 for WordPress site as long as you can you know get the site's finished quickly enough you know that's that's good money rohan says a good recruiter will value modern online learning tools like free code camp udemy etc free code campus trusted yeah this was in regard to the question about can I get a job with the free code camp certificate and that's true yeah I think some companies still like don't realize how things are well in terms of like developers in their education and they still require you know traditional degrees and stuff but a lot of newer companies tech companies and things they understand how things really work and that it's much more important that someone can do the work and so you're you're more likely to get a job with a certificate for free code camp at one of those type of companies then maybe like kind of you're more oldschool traditional companies so yeah Rohan is entirely correct and saying good good recruiters that know what's going on will realize that a free code camp certificate is a good indication of of what a good developer can do Amelia said I've made mistakes of putting that same price on the same level with PHP apps yeah yeah definitely and that takes time to realize like with different types of things like how much time it will take in different things so you just got to get a feel for that the level of customization that a client wants will definitely make it so much it can take something that's gonna be so easy and make it so difficult that that's happened to me so many times that I haven't taken a time upfront to get an idea of what a client expects and then the project ends up taking longer and I've had to go back to the client sometimes and say like this is outside the scope like we're gonna have to renegotiate you know and sometimes clients are okay with that sometimes they get really upset about that so definitely better to I kind of think it's better to overestimate upfront how long it's gonna take you it's much easier and it's happier on a client if you get to the end of the project and you feel like wow I this this was so easy and it didn't take me very long at all I feel bad taking this much money from a person if you need to to clear your conscience you can always give money back and the client will be really really happy and they'll probably tell everybody how awesome you are but if you underestimate and that halfway through the project you have to say listen I can't do any more work on this unless you pay me more the clients gonna be mad you know that even even if they're a really good client they're still not gonna like the fact that now to them it's over budget and you're less likely to get referrals so it's after years of going through it my advice would be always always overestimate the amount of time and money something's going to take if the clients still okay with that then that's probably great and they're gonna be a good client for you and I have had the situation before where I overestimated a lot and I gave the client money back or I simply said like in the case of if they hadn't billed them yet i billed him for way less than i said i was gonna build him for because and I just explained like this ended up taking being way easier than I expected you know here and and that built up a lot of trust and I ended up get getting paid way more later on for future projects from that client because I was willing to give you know I think I charged them I think I said I was going to charge them $200 and I only charged a month $100 which is a 50% discount that's big but at the end of the day it's tolling a hundred bucks I ended up making well over ten thousand dollars total from that client over the course of you know the time that I worked with them so in the grand scheme of things that hundred bucks wasn't a big deal but it really helped build up trust with that client that they were like willing to trust me with even bigger projects mayor dad asks where can I find the first essence of live coding yeah the very first sessions are on my youtube channel so it's a the link to it is in the description I think it's Jesse or waggle is then the channel name but I can't remember for sure but anyway the first few videos for this project are there so that was before I started I started the project before I started doing videos for free code ken Jeremy says well I've been working and had my volume down and you guys are still going awesome cool alright glad you're back Jeremy did you start your new job yet if so how's it going if not when are you gonna start Rowan says being in traditional learning environment currently so Rowan's right now in a traditional environment and having worked with people on realworld projects the difference is astounding and Santa says I agree rhoann working on realtime projects is the best way to learn yeah I mean I work at a college and I still agree like you learn a lot by actually doing things so that's that is the best way I mean there's definitely value in some degrees more than those of others of course but there's certain situations where you do want a degree but if you want to be like a frontend developer that's a job where I would say you most likely don't need a degree and if if you want the degree then you know maybe you have a good reason but I don't think it's necessary hey my it's here hey how's it going and aim high also has a new job so how is your job going to so I'm gonna wait I'm actually at the end of the live chat now but I've asked some questions of people so I'm gonna wait maybe just a few more seconds to see if I get any responses and then after that I'm just gonna add so I'll kind of give my ending some of my ending remarks right now while I'm waiting on a response but anyway yeah if you haven't gotten a question in and you still want to ask some questions you can put it in the comments for this video or you can direct message me on Twitter or just regular message me on Twitter I'd be happy to answer you know whenever I get a chance and oh I actually got some more stuff in the live chat now so Jeremy said I did start it's going good got some great workers and fun projects awesome I'm really glad to hear that yes so you'll have to keep us updated on the projects never I won't but I won't bug you about it every time but occasionally I will ask you how things are going and yeah that's um I don't know I just get super excited every time I hear that one of you have you know gotten a job and stuff that's that's really cool it's really cool to be able to get paid every day to do something that you really love that's kind of that's a great situation Jeremy said boss asked me to do some public speaking at high schools to get young generations motivated that's awesome that sounds really cool that's a really great idea that's that's cool that your bosses is interested in that so yeah that's awesome hopefully you have some success with that and get some I know it can be hard to speak I used to teach at high school so I know it can be hard to speak to high school kids but the good good luck with that Daniel says I want a frontend job to help me find for my degree I'm not exactly sure what what you're saying Daniel so maybe I'm just reading it wrong or whatever but if you want to rephrase it try to help me understand please please do so Rowland so it's the only good thing that happened to me with uni is making new friends yeah that's true you do get you make friends Joseph said and don't forget the beer yeah this that's true College seems to be the place where a lot of alcohol gets consumed all right EMI who also got the new job says it's been brilliant learn lots of good commands first week branching pool requests you name it my learning has just begun and all AK is awesome alright that's great that sounds cool yeah I get get is super super super helpful if any of you don't know how to use git yet especially from the command line I recommend you know learning that it's just it's really useful and a lot of jobs in the Job Description they like candidates that know how to use git and slack is definitely awesome I enjoy using slack brian says hi Jesse I'm a data scientist and wanted to know what your thoughts on using both R and JavaScript really want to go forward with three code Campbell will it add value I don't really have a lot of experience with R so I don't think I can give you a good answer I will say though in terms of JavaScript it seems like JavaScript is is being used in more and more places so I don't think it's it's ever kind of a waste to learn more about JavaScript because it's so versatile you know because I mean obviously anybody with a web browser like you can write stuff in JavaScript and they can use it so I mean that just puts it everywhere right away but there's also Internet things devices that you can program in JavaScript so and then with with things like react native you know mobile apps can be in JavaScript and VR can be in JavaScript and so I don't think it would be a waste to learn to do JavaScript things although if there was something really specific that you wanted to do that didn't necessarily need JavaScript then maybe you it would be more valuable to spend your time learning other things so it does somewhat depend on what you want to do but there you know there are just a lot of opportunities and jobs that use JavaScript that I mean generally speaking in most situations I don't think it would be a waste to learn JavaScript I think it would add value but like I said I can't say for sure in terms of data science and using our with JavaScript because I don't really have experience or very much knowledge of that so sorry I couldn't give you a better answer on that Brian Jordan says his bootstrap good to use yeah I think bootstrap is pretty good oz Anna say and she's gonna go to sleep all right good night Anna thanks for joining us thanks for all your contributions in the live stream are in the live chat I mean but back to bootstrap yeah Jordan I think bootstrap is a pretty among you know framework CSS frameworks like that bootstrap I think is one of the better ones so I don't use bootstrap currently for any projects I have used it before though and I think it's a good it's a good framework Jessica added that foundation it's also another framework that's good yeah I've Foundation seems to be pretty good as well and I use materialized it's not nearly as wellknown as foundation and bootstrap but if you like material design materializes I think it did a decent option let's see one ass says really nice dream Jessie I'm in backend learning front end greetings from Peru hey thanks for joining us thanks for joining us from Peru and that's cool so you're already in back in and now you're learning front end that's really cool I feel like I'm going the opposite way that I'm I'm in front end and I'm learning some back end so welcome you'll definitely be able to contribute in in the chat and help me out with some backend stuff then occasionally I do need to do some backend things so I'm very much a beginner in that area so I welcome any any advice you have for me Roland says don't drink so no beer for me but yeah lots of beer was used in general yeah that's probably a better way to go I think you you probably learn a lot more in school if you weren't drinking then if you were I know some people who drank a lot in school and never and never got a degree but they drink a lot alcohol this is quite expensive thing expensive partying since they didn't end up with a degree anyway but still paid for one dancer daniel said I want a front end job to fund for my degree I don't want a student loan oh okay alright so Daniels saying wants to get the front end job be able to make money to pay for the degree without getting a student loan actually that's that's a pretty good idea so yeah cuz you can definitely do front end work you know freelance stuff remote work and still be able to do you know do school at the same time so yeah that's a great idea I was very lucky that I didn't I didn't have loans a lot of loans that hadn't paid back or anything but I have I have friends and family that just have so much money in student loans there and so much debt it's really hard to get out of the debt from a student loan and sometimes Roland says freelance websites alright so this is in terms of like how would how would you make money freelancing is freelance websites and ask your friends and family just read the word yeah definitely previous websites can be tough to make a lot of money off of it takes a while to build up your reputation on them but then yeah friends and family are really good if you have them to be able to you know just have you know they can just talk to people I'm sure you know they probably know people who need websites and things and that's definitely a good way to get started aim high so it's been exposed to a lot of react Redux code since I started and immutable Jaz that's really cool yeah I definitely I'm gonna be learning more about Redux soon so maybe I'll have some of that on the stream too maybe it'll be helpful for you maybe you can help me since you're already being exposed to Jordan says I'm learning front and backend that's cool if you can learn both and be full stack then you can definitely make some good money Roland says freelance is good starting out in general to make a portfolio and to get some experience so yeah alright whoa it is been quite a long stream and we had definitely a nice chat got a lot of questions answered so hopefully especially for some of you maybe we're beginning and things hopefully get some good information out of the chat the coding portion of it was not what not didn't go quite as well as I wanted to but that happens sometimes but anyway thank ya thanks everyone for watching and I really appreciate all the contributions that you all made in the live chat I will be back tomorrow most likely at the same time I don't think I have anything that will interrupt that and until then I won't have a great day
