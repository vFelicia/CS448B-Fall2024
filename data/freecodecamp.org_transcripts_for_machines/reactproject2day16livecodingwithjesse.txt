hey everybody it's Jessie and today we're going to keep working on this section so I can get on the screen all right so I figure we'll finish up this section because we're almost there so it's kind of didn't want to move on to anything different and as you can see I've got all the correct logos in here now so I actually went back and looked at my original code for this and luckily when I first did this this is the format that I put all the data for the logos in I'm I'm not even really sure why I did it like this because it was basically like static a static page but I think I was using handlebars for templating and I just I did it like this obviously at the time I didn't use Const because I had no idea what that was whenever I did this but and I you know I didn't do it exactly like this but basically I had a separate logos DOJ's file and it had this data at the top and then passed it into a handlebars template which is awesome because I was really afraid I was going to have to actually type out this data I had forgotten until about an hour ago that I did it like this so I just copied and pasted this over and in state I why imported logos and instan state for data and now it's logos so down here I'm putting in I had that you know prefix this with the actual paths and some relative pass here and then I just add the relative path on to the end and everything's working so that was really cool that was that was definitely a timesaver so actually even for now I don't have to do anything I can leave these logos where they are I would prefer to house them somewhere else just so that I have better I guess control over them because I can't directly the directory that they're these are and now that this is referencing I don't have any access to that so what I had to do initially was send all these files like I literally had to email these files did I email him it's possible that I was given access to some sort of network drive but in any case someone in the IT department had to copy and paste everything over because I wasn't allowed to have access to it and I still don't have access so I'd rather have have these somewhere else so off the figure out where the best place to house these are and maybe you can let me know what you think I'm not really I mean obviously we're gonna have some sort of server for this but all right I don't know whose number that is sorry my phone's ringing I don't know the number so I'm not gonna answer usually if I don't know the number there's somebody trying to sell me something where was I unless my train of thought oh okay so obviously we're gonna have some sort of node server to run this but I don't really know should i house the files on that same server or is there a better place that I could house the files I'm thinking like maybe there's some sort of outofthebox thing that I haven't done before that might be cool to try so let me know if you know of anything like that and and then we'll see what like I said we don't have to figure that out really at all for a while I think I am just a little bit nervous since I don't have access to that folder I can't if something were to happen I'd rather get the files out of there and at least backed up somewhere else if something were to happen I'm pretty sure I have all these backed up at the very least on on my computer possibly in a cloud drive somewhere but I would still feel better if it's in a different spot so that's pretty much all I've done I had a few pull requests I think they're all pretty minor I had some from Kevin one from Sebastian kind of editing some environment variables so that we don't when you're testing it doesn't send a lot of projects to rike when when testing the service request form and yes you can check out I think it was like 37 38 and 39 with the pool request numbers if you want to check those out and I think that's all it's Oh big change I forgot that I changed this so I changed the layout a bit in terms of how the logos are displayed so yesterday we just had the logos and not in cards I wanted to see what it would look like if I put them in cards obviously I would want to space this out a bit I mean it there needs to be some space between these but other than that my reasoning for wanting to put them in cards were that currently these all have white backgrounds possibly some have transparent backgrounds but some of them definitely have white backgrounds I don't think all of them might I could do transparent and our background here is that kind of grey color but in the live site is white so it works that it looks like all the logos are just the logos but when the logos are up against the gray you can see the white outline which I didn't think looked very good so I thought okay well if they're gonna look like there's a square of white around them anyway or a rectangle why not make it a card the other thing that I needed was I needed a way to be able to click either you know JPEG or PSD so I'll show you what it looks like right now so here's the effect that I have right now when you hover these two little kind of buttons come up one says web one says print we went back and forth initially as to what we should call this like would people understand what a JPEG is what a PSD is and what they should use them for so we ended up going with web and print because generally that's what people would end up using them for I think I've clicked tracking on all these so I may be able to find out are people actually clicking these and which one they're they're really clicking more do we really need both but for now I I kind of I didn't really want to do the same effect and you all can let me know how you think this looks I'm just not I'm not sure I'm not sure that I like it just seems it seems like there's a lot going on I think maybe I've gotten to like more simplistic design since I've done this kind of less motion so I'm not really I don't really like that when you hover the not only does the logo appear you know to grow but then you also have these and then there's even a hover effect on these so I just I'm not really sure what I want to do with it right now I've just been kind of looking at it a lot and trying to visualize what it could be so I don't want to change it dramatically because I want users to still be familiar with what they're used to so we need do something with that we also need to do something with with these here not really sure that how they currently are I don't really know that I like that but I'm I'm not exactly sure what I want to do with that either so I'm open to your ideas sometimes when I get to this point and I want to make a change but I'm not sure I like design inspiration elsewhere so I'll go through usually like other sites that use material design and see how they've handled similar use cases and usually I can get some inspiration I I really don't like to let's say copy anybody's design exactly because I don't know there's just something in me that wants to do it once that my own kind of spin on it but I do like to see how it's how it's handled so maybe I'll do some of that we'll see but there are a few things that definitely need need worked on now so we need to connect the data to these buttons for the links to be able to work I'd like to be able to add the correct alt text titles to these images definitely add some space between these cars still not sure if we'll keep the cards on or not and possibly even some padding but I don't like how that is touching the sides there most of the other logos are okay but some of them some of them still touch all right so that's that's basically an overview of the the problems that we're gonna try to to solve today and we'll see how far we get and and what we come up with I just pushed to the github repo and let me check this time because yesterday I thought I pushed and then I had some errors and so I went like for an hour without realizing that the code wasn't updated but in fact it was updated and it didn't work so the latest version of the code is in the master branch in the git repo for this project the links in the description so you all can check that out I'm gonna check the live chat before I start the Pomodoro timer just to see what y'all think I know I asked several questions at the beginning so and I haven't checked or any answers yet so we're gonna do that also I guess a for anybody's no I I haven't done like the the normal what's this show about I think for a while so for anybody who's new that's watching I'm a frontend developer and this is me doing my everyday work so it's not rehearsed I'm gonna make mistakes we're gonna try to work through them it's not exactly a tutorial although I try my best to explain what I'm doing and at various levels even even some basic things because we have people of all skill levels in here feel free to ask any questions I'll take breaks periodically to answer questions and then at the end I'll try to answer every question that I had missed throughout the show let's see there's a second stream on Instagram that's a view of me as I'm coding and my office so you can check if you want to it's kind of just more like a novelty thing because obviously the main thing is the code and not not really my face but occasionally people check in and I guess maybe they're curious to see what would I look like what my office looks like and if you happen to be watching this on Instagram of the recording check out the free code camp YouTube channel and you get a better idea of what I'm doing because you'll be able to see the code in my screen okay so enough enough introduction let's check out would you all have to say about this project and some of the problems that I want to say problems so some some of the use cases and issues we're gonna we're going to deal with so okay so I did I had a comment a while before the stream started so I'm not even sure if so this is from mine blocks coder not sure if you're still watching but mine blocks coder said maybe you should try doing streams earlier I've thought about doing different times occasionally I do streams at different times in fact this week I've done I varied the times I think last week I did an early stream which it would have been in the morning for my time zone but I'm certainly open to changing the time that I do these this time in the afternoon seems to be a good time to where I can be most consistent I do have some meetings that I always have let's say like in the morning so if I were to change it to a different time earlier I probably couldn't be consistent every day with that time but I'm open to it just let me know let me know what you think let me know in the live chat but it might actually be more helpful to put a comment to this video and then that way I'll be able to see it you later on so especially for the people who are gonna watch the recording obviously the live stream is not a good time for you so let me know when a good time would be preferably if you could figure out when that time would be in Eastern time that would be great but otherwise if you don't want to do that just let me know what timezone urine as well so I could figure out what time that would be for me and I'm definitely open to trying that I think it would be cool to let other people be able to participate in the live stream but otherwise I'm gonna try to stick with this time unless unless I I find out that there's a significant number of people who would rather have it at a different time cool Mayank says great work dude thank you thank you I appreciate that thanks for watching Abhishek's is nicely done thanks to you thanks you all are very very kind today to start out with so hey everyone a few people were saying hi okay so I did ask a question about where to store these images Patrick says maybe AWS s3 Rohan says let's not go for the nucular off so maybe that would be overkill for what we need but actually I do these small projects and sometimes I do think that the way I do some of them might be overkill for that particular project but but keep in mind what I'm trying to do with these small projects is not only fulfill all of the requirements for that particular project but prepare for larger projects so the main website for my university with the Franciscan ddu knees redone I think it's badly in need of being redone because the site is very very slow and that not to mention design outdated you know there's there's a lot of things that need updated but the number one thing for me is nobody's going to stick around even see what it looks like because the load times are insane and I've gotten the load times down about as far as I think I can given the current system so all of these small projects I want to test out something that I know I'll probably need with a larger project so while it might not be necessary for a smaller project in in the bigger picture of what I'm trying to do as a whole I need that test I need to be able to prove it I'd like to be able to say to my boss and the people higher up who are gonna have to approve things all the I'd like to be able to either they have my plan to say hey all these things that I'm saying that I can do I've done them here with this site that site that site so they can actually go and see it and see that it works and that I've tested it because it is gonna sound a bit crazy when I propose all this it's going to be much different than their current set up which you know the set up is just a traditional dotnet based content management system hosted on Windows servers here on campus in our IT department a very oldschool set up so what I'm proposing just you know briefly is a react site pulling data from content management system maybe WordPress but then having just heavy caching to handle the load and load balance across I don't know maybe like half a dozen digital ocean droplets to handle to where like copies of all the react apps will be potentially drawing data from multiple WordPress installs from different sites so that concept is really foreign I think to to a lot of people so it would be great to be able to say like hey we've done it so if you notice in the last project we did the load balancing right we pulled in data from WordPress so anyway hopefully you understand what I'm saying because I have had people ask definitely more than once like why are you doing it like this do you really need to do that and that's really why I mean I do want to make really good sites so it's cool to try to use the latest thing even if I you know don't have to but I'm trying to prove by actually doing these things that my plan will work for the main site so anyway sorry that was a long time spent on what wasn't even really a question from you just they it just popped into my head but it does it it is an answer to questions I've received previously about the same topic okay david says what about storing them in manga or something yeah I'm thinking about that I'm I'm actually considering some sort of database they said don't really know if it's necessary but once again like it's not it's not just about what's necessary for the project it's about what what should I be testing and learning to prepare for other projects that I know I'll need to do Sebastian said card style looks good the hovering button kind of overkill yeah okay Sebastian says the card style so I'd asked what you all think about this so he said sir card style goes straight to the point you see the image choose the format really simple okay yeah that's kind of what I thought you you know the hover you have to actually hover over the image see it's not even apparent what you're supposed to do with these images you would think somebody would try to click but I've I've noticed that people who aren't really that familiar with technology they don't use it a lot they're not really inclined to move around and click there their mindset is well like if I don't move or click anything I won't mess it up which is kind of weird because obviously I'm sure all of us when we go into a website we're like I'm clicking and hovering everything like I want to see how this thing works that's because that's what we do you know but I can't rely on that you know other people don't always work like that so I agree Sebastian I think it would be better to have it more straightforward like this but still open I still don't I just don't love how this looks so I'm trying to think of a way to make it look a bit better I mean maybe it'll look better when I put in the proper you know spacing here we'll see well we'll mess around with it today and see what it looks like Rohan said watching the Instagram stream where is the mic you mean like like we're actually like you can't see the mic in the image or is the mic messed up on the Instagram stream so you can't hear my voice so while I'm waiting for the delay and the answer to that I'll get do another take another question so code BCC says what's a good resource to learn frontend development I'm experienced on the backend wanting to get into frontend and Sebastian says for basics check free code camp and then Udacity and learn code Academy yeah I definitely agree those are great resources that'll that'll get you on the right path for sure alright David said watching from Ireland so don't make it too early yeah that's the thing if I change the time it'll work better for some people but worse for others there's not really any way around it you know we have people from from all over the world so I you know I don't know maybe maybe I can try to vary so that I don't I don't know some days a week I'll do it in the afternoon some days in the morning and then I don't know I'll think about it okay Patrick must have visited the main site franciscans edu and he says it's brutally slow yes yes it is Rohan says I would suggest a common static content CDN or just a different droplet for all sites going forward I like that idea I like that we had thought about that before for different projects and yeah that would really useful rowan says clicking and hovering I have dev tools open all the time I didn't want to I didn't want to go that far with it but I'm the same way you know I have my my browser extension here right so it tells me what everything's built from all the time so I'm always looking at this and then also going to dev tools if I see something odd like you know or just I just want to know how did they do that so yeah I'm right with you there oh okay so we're gonna ask the mic for YouTube recording it's in there actually yeah it's hard to get the mic and me in the recording at the same time so yeah I just tried it I'm kind of like my face is way off to the side and you can't really see all of it so anyway it's a nod I have to have it at a far enough away from the mic so that it doesn't cause interference but then it also makes it so that basically the angle of it is coming like from where I have the live chat the screen that I have the live chat on so when I'm looking at the live chat it's a decent angle because I'm looking pretty much right at the the camera for on my phone but when I look at the code I'm I'm turned completely you know kind of sideways you get a side profile of me but not really anything I can do about it I'd rather have the mic be in the central location so everyone can hear because as I said I mean I consider the the Instagram just kind of a secondary novelty thing oh cool Rowan says the audio on YouTube is very consistent even though you move a lot awesome yeah the mic is basically like as in the middle as I can get it without blocking a screen so so far it's been working out well actually it was a really cheap mic I got it like on Amazon for it was a good deal I want to say it was like less than $15 or something but it got good reviews so I thought it was worth a shot okay let's get to some code so Gavin did ask did he complete the logo screen and the last live think so I didn't exactly complete it I we got we got to the point where we had some of this up here but we just had some like test testing so it wasn't these this content of these names and we had some like just one image in here to test but it actually wasn't even loading so we added a little broken image icon but it was enough to test that they were getting on the page and then when we clicked these up here it did it changed since then I put I pulled in data for all the images so that we could get all the the actual images that are gonna be on this once it's live and I put it in some cards and then I also put in the proper name so in terms of code you can see I just put these in up here it's not really a super long list so I'm kind of okay with it being here but I could see like it might make sense to move this somewhere else as well I could I could move it over here to this file and export that as well so we'll see I will if this starts to get long right now it's so short it just doesn't bother me if it starts to get longer maybe we'll move it maybe you know just to keep things clean but for now this is here and then all the data is over here in this logo data j/s and I have a new directory called data and that's where that's in so haven't haven't really done a lot it looks on the screen like it's a pretty big change but you know in terms of the code it's it's not really a lot so let's set the Pomodoro timer and start doing something so if you if you're not familiar with what we're doing here I set the timer I code for 25 minutes and then I take five minutes and I check in with the live chat if I need to check in with a live chat like I'm stuck if I have a question or something I will check in occasionally even during that 25 minutes but this just kind of keeps a nice pace so that I don't spend too much time on one or the other all right so first things first I absolutely know that I want to add some spacing in here so let's work on that first and then that'll give my brain like a little bit of time to think about what I want to try to clean this up so we need spacing here and then we need to add some padding to these cards yeah so that's yeah that's definitely I definitely want to do that okay so right now I probably can just add a bottom see so we have our sass file for logos so I'm gonna try to do as much as I can in the sass file otherwise something like this I would probably make an inline style but since we have a sass file let's try to keep this as clean as we can so at times we don't want tabs we want I'm trying I guess where I think the only cards will actually have will be logos I'm interested to see what this comes out as so it looks like alright we don't really have by default there's not really a class for those cards that we can use so I'm gonna have to add a class which is not a big deal I figured out out of class anyway so class and we're gonna do class name because in react you can't use just class okay obviously react is like you know using javascript in here and class is used you know for other things in javascript so we have to do class name camel case then we can add our class names just as we normally do so I think logo card is the decent name for this and so now we can go logo card and let me think twenty four pixels let's try 24 pixels anything oh you know what it looks like the class didn't it looks like the class wasn't applied so let's let's do this let's just take this up we don't really need that I'm sure there's a way to add a class on here I don't know maybe I did it wrong but this will work too oops actually what am I doing with these camelcase look it's the only thing I've noticed that messes me up and only sometimes when I'm doing you know react so with this JSX you switch back and forth between camelcase and then when you're using the CSS not in line you normally use hyphens so occasionally I'll use them in the wrong place let me make this bigger I'm sorry I forget I made this smaller earlier so that I could see more of the code and I didn't make it bigger littler container and then we're gonna say yeah actually let's see if it'll work just on the container I wanted to put it on the card but I don't think it'll really matter and I guess it will now let's see did this okay so the class did get applied it actually didn't apply our margin hmm alright I'm gonna check the chat really quick because this seems like one of the times where I made a silly mistake and you all would probably catch it it's misspelled okay awesome thank you cont a thank you I'm glad I remembered to check the live chat if you haven't watched before then you probably don't know what I was talking about but often it happens that when I have an issue I'll try for you know 510 minutes to figure it out on my own and then I'll look at the live chat and realize that right away somebody usually more than one person has caught my mistake and told me about it and I just didn't think to look over so thank you for that let's see I don't know there we go all right so we are getting that margin on the bottom I'm not sure where that's our marginbottom is not even showing up though in dev tools which is weird I have dev tools open on my other screen oh okay I see it it's just really far down down the list okay so that took longer than expected due to mainly just the type of yeah I like that I may put a media query in there and make it smaller on on mobile I know on mobile I might actually we'll see how it looks and how much time I want to put into this but I kind of like the idea of not having the cards or basically having the cards take up the entire width and then just having a line dividing them so it almost really wouldn't be a card anymore so you can see in the material design spec they there are examples of that I mean there's also examples of material design apps that will use cards in a row like this as well so I've seen it both ways we'll just I'll see I'll get out my phone and test on there and see what it's like okay now let's add our padding actually around our cards and maybe now that I think about it it would be useful to have a class on here where's our component okay what do you think do I need to pass this down as a prop and then put it on here because I'm I'm almost positive that this has worked before to just add the class name directly on to a component and it it works it comes out in the final markup I mean maybe it's just the way the components are set up okay classes whose there we go that's why syntax highlighting is really nice and that you get used to how things are the color it's supposed to be so you immediately know when you mess something up because it doesn't change to the color that you know it should be so in that case I knew I was doing something wrong here I didn't actually catch what it was immediately I ended up trying to adding this into here thinking it had something to do with with this in reality it was because I was I put this in quotation marks instead of in curly brackets but it's better in the end anyway but now it's more consistent so let's see if this works now so what I'm trying to do here then is just pass whatever classes that I want this to have down to this component to see if then it will actually work as a class name since it wasn't before yep and now it does work so now we do these do have the class name of logo card so now we can use that in our in our sass file the card if you're not familiar with sass you can nest CSS rules like that and basically that would be the same as if I did you know logo card container and then logo card and in regular CSS so it basically gets turned into that as soon as I save it and it gets saved in a the logos dot CSS file just a lot less to type out especially when your nesting things not really a great idea to nest things too deep it gets kind of messy but you know 3d I'm okay with three deep start getting like four more than probably not really necessary alright so on the logo card we want padding so let's give it some padding I don't want top or bottom padding right now let's see I should probably check to see now actually I do want there it looks like there's no top padding currently that makes sense see now that I think about it we don't really need padding on the whole thing we just need padding around this section around the image section so that currently the div that holds the image does not have a class let's see if we can find it and if that would be easy okay card media overlay I'm not the overlay we want the the image hmm if we're gonna put a clasp anywhere it'll probably be here so let's do it mr. container all right hopefully okay well that's not too bad it got actually on the outer div so that's I don't know why there it's nested two divs actually one two yeah there's two days probably because one of them ends up being the overlay and the other one is the container but for now since we're not having an overlay on these I'm okay with that and we can just select that image container and I'll spell container right this time and then now we can do let's give it a pixel all the way around I'm not exactly sure why I'm sure there's a good reason for it but for some reason and material design it seems like things go in 8th so you know you have 8 pixels 16 pixels and like normally that normally you see mostly just 8 and 16 a lot in the documentation so that's what I normally start with and that usually seems to work pretty well and it looks right with the rest of what's going on in material design all right not bad although now that I look at it it probably is a good idea to not include the padding at the bottom because we have quite a bit of white space here so I think that's that's just not necessary so let's take this and we'll go eight eight zero and then eight alright so if if you're not familiar with this way of writing this in CSS when you do all four it goes top right bottom left if you were just going to do two it's the first one is top and bottom and then the second one is right and left and it looks like did I mess it up I must have messed something up because it does not look what did I did what did I do wrong you still have our image container Oh silly mistake no and no commas there we go nope so I'm just gonna leave that up there for another second so do not put commas in between these I don't know why I did that okay I like that better it's not a huge difference I mean I can see cuz I was really looking for it not it's not something that would jump out at you as a change but I think overall if you're talking about all these cards it's a significant decrease in the overall amount of scrolling that you have to do to get around you know if you add up all those eight pixels then down the line okay that looks better we have some padding it could probably do with a little bit more padding but I'm okay with that I don't want these images to be too small in comparison to the cards because you know the logo images are the the whole point of the page it's the the focus all right so I'm gonna go ahead and commit this because you know basically this is just margin and padding stuff it goes together before we move on to anything else be good time to commit this will also be a good kind of example of how to commit I know I give I go through this example frequently but I figure I'm sure there's there's always you know somebody possibly new who hasn't seen it who's just starting out maybe hasn't even used yet before so in the terminal we we already have have gone through some installation and setup to have get running so this definitely there takes something to get to this point but once you have get running if you want to commit which is like basically a snapshot of your project at that point in time then here's how you do it first thing I always do is get status and that might be a little bigger I'd sight get status this look this lets me know what files have changed this is really good you may have accidentally changed the file will not realize that and then this will remind you but maybe you changed something that you didn't you shouldn't have and this is a way to catch it otherwise this at least will verify that hey the stuff that I wanted to change is in fact change and these are the things that we've changed so now I'm gonna do a git commit and this is kind of a shorthand we're gonna put a flag here we're gonna put the a flag which means add so we're gonna combine two steps normally you would get add and then you would get commit but we're combining them so we're gonna get commit and then with a and we're gonna put em em means we get to put a message right in line and with with this commit if we didn't put the M when we hit enter it would bring up whatever our default editor was and we have to type the message in there but for now I'll just say add padding to those margin two cars yeah and in terms of the commit message there are different ways that people like to do that and there are some standard ways so I'd say maybe just check out the way that is recommended by some of how other companies do it and things and you know figure out what way works for you if it's a small project is just you working on it not a huge deal but if you're working with a lot of other people you definitely want to have some sort of standard way to do commit messages all right so the commit has gone through normally you won't see all of this stuff this is unique to our project that we have all these tests running and some auto formatting but you will see this part here at the bottom if it's worked so three files change and it lets us know 14 insertions four deletions great now we want to make sure this gets synced up to a repo on github so we type git push that's gonna push the code up to github origin/master so we're pushing the master branch there we go great everything works now if we were not gonna go there but if we were to go to the git repo the code would be exactly the same as it is on our local machine great and that was perfect timing so now we can take five minutes go over to the live chat get answer some questions and then we'll come back to the code all right so I'm gonna swell there's a actually a lot in the live chat so you all have been busy that's awesome I like when the live chat is Lively all right so I'm gonna have a lot to catch up on I don't think I'll get through everything in this five minutes I'll have to have to catch up at the end okay I see you I've given me a lot of different suggestions for four databases for storing the images so I'm seeing all that I'll save all those so I can refer to them and then see about maybe check them out and see which one we should use okay Brian I just saw your comments there about the border on the links so is saying it's just it says not clear he's saying it's not clear UI without some sort of distinction between the buttons and the background so there should be some type of border distinction okay and just to clarify let me know if are you referring to these or these or both I mean obviously this does have a hover effect but I could see your comment could definitely apply to both so let me know what you were thinking specifically if you're still if you're still watching if you're still here please let me know tech neck technique Renault says Pomodoro bruh yes Pomodoro he says I can't even do more than 5 minutes of coding before I visit reddit /youtube you got it it's easier to focus if you do the Pomodoro because you know it's like all right 25 minutes I'm gonna ignore everything except the code I'm not saying I always do that but when I'm in the zone I definitely do like I do my 25 minutes I ignore everything and then I do my best during the 5 to just not think about the code and then just go right back to it so that's best case scenario that's how it works sometimes you get interrupted and you can't ignore it it's important but otherwise the Pomodoro is nice because you it it helps if you know you only have to focus for a certain amount of time and it's a relatively short period of time and then you can relax for a little bit if you're just saying like man I got hours and hours of work let's just get to it that's pretty tough right like if you're running a marathon like you don't just sprint the whole way right you're never gonna gonna make it but like if you if you would knew you could take breaks along the way then you might sprint and then rest and sprint and then rest and that would be legitimate and doable would be like interval training but this is the same thing with your brain right it's I don't know hopefully that made sense hopefully you all know what I'm talking about at least it works for me i but I've I think at least some somewhat that's the idea behind it técnicos says I'm 37 and my attention span is as long as my baby daughter Joshua says I did over 1 hour and 30 minutes of coding and I'm 10 Wow so Joshua 10 years old and doing coding that's awesome thanks for watching hopefully you're getting something useful out of this that's that's really cool my my oldest is 8 years old and really interested in getting him more and you know excited about coding getting kind of into it so you'll have to let me know let me know what what you really like about coding as a young person maybe that'll that'll help me out with with my kids let's see Blake asks what local web server is he using I was in nginx ok Patrick says it's a hot module reloading with webpack it said Joshua says question in my website when I put done the code for buttons the buttons only affect the first questions help me please ok cool it looks like so it looks like some of you in the live chat are helping out Joshua with with this code question so Joshua let let me know if you need extra help you know let me know I don't know if you're on Twitter or anything that usually if people need extra help they message me on Twitter but you can you can put it in the comments on YouTube or however whatever is best for you if you want to email it that's cool too okay my five minutes is up so I'm going to stop going through the live chat and I'll come back to it after our next session is over let's see I do want to see Blake's Blake's answer okay or I'm sorry not Blake Brian's answer about the buttons so Brian says the hover effect is good once you're hovering over it but a border would make it very clear for the user without having to navigate and guess okay okay cool let's check that out actually so I think we have more options than this built in to material UI at least there was for materialized I'm assuming we have it materialized so let's just check out what they have and see if it'll fit what we're trying to do so should be under it looks like they don't let me check out materialized I I really thought there was another another style but I remember seeing maybe not maybe where did I see that I guess I didn't so I the only the difference in materializes they do have this border here I kind of like that I may add this in I do like that distinction now they've gone with a slightly different so they the same color that's used throughout for links is used for the button so that would be a visual cue so I like that let's go to material design guidelines just to doublecheck and see what they're doing okay so similar so their basic example actually does look well it's so much the combination so it does not have the the line there the the border but it does have the accent color let's see what kind of options okay so adhere this this is actually the style that it's your UI is using okay okay here we do have the border so it looks like all of these options within material design are valid they're used but yeah so I'm not seeing not seeing a border so we're not really gonna get any ideas I think from material design spec because it looks like they're not using that but I'm almost positive that I've done it before so let me just check out a few of the sites that I've done I'm gonna bring up on my other screen and I'll pull them over if I find it I use cars that I know all right let's check this out hmm Wow I must be losing my mind even so I've been consistent throughout all my sites and that basically I have used the card actions without border but I have always done I've capitalized it and I've used the link color which is usually you know your accent color so a lot of times I do this sometimes I do a blue depends on the color scheme for the site I think I've even done I did read for the last project and I think I've gone with a slightly darker or a slightly heavier font weight so let's just see how it looks with that I kind of want to add I want to see what it looks like with that line I think it'll probably look a little bit better so I'm gonna add in the line I'm gonna change this to a color that is the same link color that we're using on the rest of the site and we'll see how that looks I don't think I use this hover effect in any of my other sites I'm not opposed to using it now okay color I should probably let me grab this color first and see how it looks I'm still I'm not really sure that I want to keep this color yet but at least it'll just give us something something to look at all right so if we go in here image continue should be able to do what I should do is put make all these colors variables and then have like maybe like a color CSS file and then import it which maybe we'll do that at some point but for right now I think this will be okay area okay so we have that let's see so dude there we go so we want here's a border let me bring this over because I'm I keep referring to this might be a good idea if I show it so basically I've just done on this div which contains our action items I've just done a border obviously I don't want to keep it that gray color let's go with maybe 54 see how that looks and that's still too dark there we go that looks better if I decide to keep it I'll look up what it actually is and materialize but actually I have a thought what we really want people to do when they go to the logos is download a logo but we're not actually saying anywhere downloaded the logo and we may be doing that here at the top so that I'd like to check out what language we we have there already okay so we are saying please select a logo to download so we're giving some direction so maybe we ought to have say download maybe we should say download here and then give them these options and then that would make it it would make it clear the action that should be taken okay yeah what do you think let's let me grab this and we don't have a class for that yet so let me just put it over here for now we'll see about adding a class but I think I need you I need a title let's go so you could see here so here's a generic card here we go card title yeah how do we do that I'm gonna have to look back at how we originally imported all the all the different options so I can't remember how we did it for that generic card component I thought I had it up available on a screen beforehand I guess not so let's go back we're gonna find so in actually in our logos view we had an example oops yeah this is it so we had an example of the cards there we go that's what we want to see so we can go back so this is one of the great things about get also in github that we can go back to all these previous versions and see so even though this hasn't been in that file for a little while we've we've had many save since then we can still check it out so what I'm interested in is card title there we go that's what I think we'll probably want and then we'll also no that's not what I wanted sorry about that what I wanted was this one okay so yeah here we go so card title and port that and then let's see yeah we did okay so we just put a string in and that's what title okay that's pretty straightforward but nothing wrong with doublechecking I guess so I'm gonna put it here just because this is how it appears you know on the page so it makes sense to me to be right there let's see how that looks not not really sure mm yeah okay I don't like that it's way too much space wait he was well Lisa gives us something to look at yeah this part is hard I guess it's hard to share what I'm seeing in my head with all of you unless I actually put it on here so so be some trial and error this part if I get rid of this part maybe he would look better okay actually I don't dislike this as much I'm still not sure I don't like that it's very repetitive saying download every time but I'm not sure all right I'm gonna go to the live chat cuz I've I've tried a few things here and I want to see what would you all think alright looks like somebody had a good idea except I'm seeing people saying like like this idea so let me scroll up and try to find the beginning of this idea okay John Hanson said asked with this material you I have a download icon that is a great idea so let's check it out sweet so download icon that could work now this material UI it has their own icons correct let's see okay you can't do it so I if you remember from the last project I prefer to use SVG icons instead of font icons for several reasons one if you use an SVG icon I usually now in this case it's I'm not sure how they're bringing in the SVG icons but when I do it on my own I only bring in just the one that I need and I put the the actual SVG you know code right there in line so nothing has to load there's no network requests with font icons I mean you have it at least one Network request to get the font and you're getting extra icons that you probably never use I mean really you only use I mean maybe I never use more than a dozen font icons on any site and probably usually no more than a half a dozen and a fawn icon set could come with a lot more than that you could do a custom font icon set which I've done before as well to try to keep it small but the other thing I don't like about font icons are I've had issues with different browsers not displaying them properly and it was it's been hard to troubleshoot because I can't always replicate the issue I've gotten screenshots from users so I know it's it is happening but then it's difficult to to kind of really see what's going on so I've never had that problem with SVG icons so that's why I prefer SVG's so let's check out how they do it okay so it looks like they already have some they already do have some components well let's see do they have a list of these somewhere so if they have a download icon which seems like a pretty common icon already we may be able to just use that like they're doing here actually I'm just gonna guess because if I added a file download icon and I was naming it like this then I'm gonna guess unless one of you already let's see I'm not sure you see or don't I come on it looks like brown already found it I it took a little bit of the fun out of it but it'll probably be faster this way I was just going to try to guess based on what they were naming I mess it up let's see my eye just saw as I was looking over the live chat Curtis asked can I use this project on my portfolio yeah I guess so I mean are you saying you want to help work on this project and put it in your portfolio then yeah I mean yeah that's fine because whatever commits you have are certainly yours or you wanted to use the project as the basis to build your portfolio on I'm fine with that as well so either way a hum is fine with me okay so since that link didn't work let's try this all right so what I've done here is I've just guessed really what the name should be and this is really I could have looked it up but I just thought it would be fun to guess so I'll try it if it doesn't work then I'll I'll look it up I went to that oh it's here icon style is just not define define like 50 all right so say it's not gonna work 950 oh let's get rid of that did you see okay so it didn't find the module all right we'll look it up there we go ICG icons actually did I add this I don't remember if I added this that might be why we can't get it let's check it out I don't I don't have it to you I I cough so let me I've obviously have some icons right because we like we have an icon let me get rid of this so how am I using icons so see like obviously we have an icon so all right so what do you think real quick I only want to take maybe like two minutes on this is it worth it to pull in the entire material you I I con do you think we'll use that many icons that it's worth it or should I just grab the SVG really quick and and put it in there from material icons which one when I just download that now just in case we end up using it okay importing named exports in this way yeah okay this might not even work because I might not be using that all right cool everybody thinks we should just do the SVG really quick and that is fine with me because that's what I am used to doing anyway so see look at that that's so it's so simple like this tiny amount of code like you just copy and paste it really simple there okay so let's do this let me see if I can let's see if I can pass it in here if it'll work yeah it works okay awesome so we have it downloaded not not ideal right now yeah I might just get rid of this effect and then we need to put in some text I'm not sure let's see if it'll let me do this where's the shot yeah they're not working so let's no that works well at least we get what we wanted on the screen I don't know why I could thought I thought that I could do the first thing now that I think about it it was really obvious that that would not work all right so I need to change obviously need to make this line up a little bit better but what do you think I mean it's for the hotel maybe I should line it up better because it looks really weird right now let's see what's going on here I could probably just make this bigger and then it might work sort of height with let's just double it see what that does well way too big yes you small for sure okay we need to make this bigger I just took a display flexalite I'm sorry all right cool thank you John Hansen I just saw your ear advice let me gonna get rid of that mmm nope see that on the wrong element I don't know okay okay try a line items maybe I should put this text in its own span and then I could move it independently that way like potentially maybe I could give it a little bit of padding and just bump it up that might not work who all right let's see actually I'm ashamed my time oh wow I did not hear that go off did I forget to start it or if I did I just totally miss I don't know who that alright let's see I do want to try I hate to have so many nested spans but I just want to I need to have it let's see and that's not gonna work all right Lily thing I had the same problem what project was all right I think I had the same problem on a project I did last year so let me see although it's possible that it was with font icons and not SVG's and that would be unfortunate because it might not work I have it up on my other screen was a phone icon and I was able to use verticalalignbottom I did not have the text in a separate span but the font icon itself was actually very clear line bottom so alright not sure that it'll work since it's a phone icon but it's worth shot oh not bad middle that's not too bad that's not perfect but that's a lot better all right let me copy this in before I forget on the SVG it's verticalalignmiddle all right great but see that does it did you do all right cool now let's make sure these are the same color I don't think we need I actually this would be a cool way to show a cool way to show how to do variables and incest all right so we're using the same color here more than once right that's that's repetitive anytime we're being repetitive we should be able to find a better way to do that what do they call it dry do not do not repeat okay so incest we have a cool way to save values in this case we're gonna save this color so let's call this fu s yellow so fu s 4 Franciscan University of Stephenville and then yellow because it's a yellowy color and then we can put this this hex color here now when we use this down here we can say fu s yellow and that's the color so if I say this we should have this color I think I can get rid of this now as well and then let's see Oh happen there I mess something up oops guess semicolons alright cool so see there we go now the font icon or the SVG icon and the text are both the same color and we've used this variable now I guess it'll be cool to see what the CSS is so on this side is the sass but this is what actually gets sent to the browser so you can see here like the the variable isn't even there anymore instead it's just the correct hex hex code for that color and then you can see instead of things being nested there's its proper CSS so it's pretty cool really useful feature and the cool thing now it doesn't seem like much now because it was only two but potentially if we had a lot of different components that we're all sharing that same color and then let's say I go show this to the other people in my department and they say I really hate that yellow all I have to do is go in here and change it I mean potentially I could I could name this something more generic like like link color or accent color and then I could change it to whatever color I want I get it wouldn't make sense change the color I guess if I'm calling it yellow so I could do something like this link color FUS yellow blink color and then I could save that and you can see it's already and my editor picked up that that's the color and if I go in here and give it a refresh to be sure see it picks it up too now that actually makes even more sense because now I I can still basically I can have color variables for all my entire color palette and actually let's do that this is the color palette for Franciscan University so let's get rid of I didn't want to there we go I actually changed the yellow to make it a bit darker so it's different I'm pulling these from the from the style guide I have it opened on my other screen so yeah I don't I don't know if I think I've shown you this before so this is a style guide I made us at some point last year this was the first thing I think I ever successfully built in react and I think this was done with I can't remember if I did this with create react app or with next I think I tried it with both I don't remember what I ended up going with but anyway it's not it's certainly not up to date with some of what I've been doing lately but you could at least see like some of the colors and the ideas of like the direction that I wanted to go with this so it probably wouldn't be too much work to get this up to date but until now I haven't no one except for for me and like one other person that I work with has ever even needed to reference this so it hasn't been a really high priority but anyway that's where I got the colors from and so like potentially then all I would have to do is put in like let's say F us dark blue in here and then it would change automatically everywhere that I've used link color so it could save a ton of time alright so let me get rid of this download text why haven't I taking that out yet let's get rid of that there's my title card too let's see okay not bad need to do the same thing for PSD as well I'm still not 100% sure whether I'll keep JPEG and PSD or whether I'll go back to the old web in print we'll see I'm not sure what do you all think people are used to having it's a web in print instead of select web print or the options in reality they have the option to get a JPEG version of the image and a PSD version should I switch it up because it's more accurate or should I leave it like this I mean I guess this is just a more technical way of describing it this is just describing what you would use it for you're not really sure but I mean it's not it wouldn't necessarily always be for web if they wanted to put it into like a PowerPoint that's not really a web but you could you'd still want to use this and not a PSD all right so last thing I'm gonna do I think yeah last thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna put the an icon here as well and then we'll we'll commit this and then I'll get to all the questions so if you have questions put them in there or start thinking of them now because I'll get to them on probably about five minutes all right so let's see let's take this see if this works without me having to put parentheses around it where did I put that Oh inside masonry I'll shoot now I'm confused and this up here at least makes more sense area I mean here I should've added this span I see I mean I'm probably making this more complicated but yeah then I should have but the idea was maybe I ought to make this into a component that I can pass in this text too and then there would be a lot more clean and I wouldn't have to have all this SVG stuff in here twice does that make sense okay Patrick said or just use the component that material you I already gives you four file download icon well that's I tried to figure out what that component was earlier and I couldn't I couldn't get it to work so let's see oh actually no you're right there was one that you just had to put the SVG a stuff in my mistake I forgot about that one okay yes so let's see what do we need SVG icon that is a great idea alright so bringing that in and then let's bring in yeah I could use that I do want it to I didn't want to be able to pass in the text there's something I can I can do that maybe I can maybe I'm just not looking right okay what I'm still gonna pull this in all right let's see if that works oops left an extra span in there it was even in red I don't know how I missed that one all right let's check that out okay yet I mean it worked it's just not giving me the correct color let's see why I guess it's actually added the color in it's what they probably want me to pass the color and yeah oh this this ruins all my efforts over here to have to pass this color and I almost want to just put important on the end so I don't have to change it but I'll do it like this so let's add color and there we go and then let's do the same thing here but then let's there we go all right now now we have our download icons okay not bad that looks a little bit more legit all right cool let me commit this and then we'll do some questionandanswer stuff here to finish up get this one in all right so looks like there's a lot in the live chat so I'm gonna scroll up to where I left off and try to get through as much as I can so since there's so much I'm again I'm not definitely not gonna read everything out so I'm just gonna focus on the questions most especially on questions from people who are newer I definitely want to help them to feel welcome not that I don't appreciate all of you that that are here frequently all right all right so that's the all up on github now awesome okay all right so found where I left off at oh it looks like at some point Joshua could not hear the stream so sorry I see that at the time so I'm not sure what the issue is it looks like it doesn't look like anyone else was having the same issue so anyway that I guess let me know if that was ever resolved and if you found out what the problem was I'm not sure if it was anything on my end but if it was I definitely want to know about it so I can fix it okay I do want to read this it says John Anson said Jesse styled components dotcom keeps your JSX code clean because you don't mess it up with CSS classes you build a CSS component and style it style that and CSS it nests just like s CSS next project yeah actually that sounds cool definitely check that out for the next project remind me if I forget though if if you're around cuz I'm not sure how much longer this project will take I'm thinking actually just to give you an update I'm thinking this project may end up being like another two weeks or so not that it would take us that long to complete it cuz it probably wouldn't but it's probably gonna take that long for me to get feedback so I did we had a department meeting this morning and I did tell everyone that we need to figure out what exactly we want to update and change in this and so I need everyone's feedback so I'm just not really sure I mean you know everyone's busy they all have their own things going on so it's probably not gonna be high on anyone's priority list so I will keep reminding everyone but really it's not like we can't launch this without the changes but it would just be good to know about them and do the changes before we finish because it could possibly save us from doing some work that we may end up either getting rid of or changing so anyway so my prediction is at least two more weeks I didn't really think we'd be working on it for that long but there's been a lot of really nice improvements to this project and a lot of extra things that are really great to have like all the testing that was I was not anticipating that but I'm glad that we have it now actually patrick said pretty sure that's what he used in the last project yeah now that you say that you're right I think that was called installed components I didn't even remember it I was reading through it yeah I think it was yeah I just remember the tag that I had to use was style and then I would have a space and then I read JSX and that was the tag so I guess that was style Cantona's not sure I remember what it was called but I still remember how to how to use it so I guess that's more important okay so skillful mess asks how do you install react Sebastian says npm install' save react yeah you can definitely install react like that if you're just getting started with react though I think probably using create react app would be the best way to go so look up create react app go to their github repo and then follow the instructions there so it just depends on your skill level right so create react app is going to do a lot of things for you to get you started so that you can get right to the react and don't have to worry about webpack so I'm not not really sure what your skill level is in terms of web pack but maybe you might want to go with something like that or next Jes also does a similar thing okay Sebastian I just saw your comment about making the buttons off each occupy half the width of the cards alright maybe I'll try that and see how that looks Wow okay so skillful mess is nine years old Wow that's awesome that you're you're able to code and follow you know follow this kind of stuff at 9 years old so that's great I'm gonna say the same thing I said to Joshua who was 10 years old as if you get a chance please let me know what what it's like what your motivation is like for coding and how you got into it at such a young age because I said I have an 8 year old that I'd love to try to get him interested in coding skillful messes you should do a series of the reddit programming challenges actually we have someone doing programming stuff challenges from reddit I believe it's from reddit on the this channel already so shoot what is it called I can't remember what the title was is called we have to look it up I can't believe I have to look it up I see it constantly the daily programmer that's it so the the series the daily programmer on this channel free code camp channel is is exactly that so so check that out I'm I do not have time right now to do another series and in fact the only reason I can eat have time to do this is because it's I'm doing my normal work otherwise it would be it would be really difficult to do something with this this many hours every day consistently okay cool I just saw Brian ahead commented the separation line with the link colors works well just don't think the plain black text makes enough of a distinction and we're talking about this here so that just reminded me that I did not leave that line in so I'll probably end up putting that back in at some point because I think I think that did make a nice distinction so maybe I like to see it on more than just one does I just tested on one to see what I think but what it really looks like but I think that was kind of a nice nice distinction than them just kind of sitting there okay I'm over halfway through the live chat now so probably just not too much longer till I get to the bottom so if you have any questions that you haven't put in here yet I probably only have a few more minutes Oh Patrick I just saw your comment about the file download icon being included already oh Rohan says how does it do circular hover animations where I'm not sure where it's doing the circular hover I mean it does like the the little ripple effect when clicking so I'm not I'm not exactly sure ever on if you're which hover animation you're referring to Emerson as does anyone know how to make the dev tools look black yeah so it looks like okay someone already answered so just for anyone watching later on they can't see the live chat it's really easy for dev tool so you go into dev tools like you normally would go up here to the icon for the menu into settings and then theme will be right up there at the top and you can pick the darker the light theme and obviously I picked the dark theme and that's it it's so super easy comes builtin Alexander I see now that you're trying to tell me to put the styles on the SVG and not the span and so yeah you were definitely right so I didn't see that sooner qsk i is the name says why is there no super chat I've never tried using the super chat so from what I understand the super chat is just if you want to get money from your stream so I'm currently not interested in getting money for this stream so I haven't tried super chat if there's some other reason why I should be using super chat let me know but I I thought it was just if you wanted money Isaiah says I'm having trouble deploying my portfolio react router website to github pages help okay Isaiah's if you use create react app for it check out Gavin's pull request on my project says Gavin just did the same thing for this project that I'm working on and it was maybe pull requests 35 somewhere around there so check out the closed pool request I think it's the whatever the last one from Gavin was if you follow those steps of how he did things it should work if you didn't use create react react app I'm not really sure I guess I'd have to check out how you did things but create react app the documentation on the github repo does have a section for how exactly how to get it to work on github pages okay when I asked you all about what to do what words I should use hear JPEG PSD or whether I should put web and print so some of the ideas here Gavin says keep what they are used to in my opinion okay Ron says go with web and print if people are used to it Curtis says leave it brian says JPEG PSD that tells me exactly what I'm getting I usually think of a print logo as some sort of vector format John Hanson says JPEG PSD it looks like we're pretty split ok rhoann says maybe you could do screen and print actually yeah that would be more accurate than web and print yeah maybe I like that idea yeah okay I think about that screen if I do change it from JPEG and PSD I think I'll probably go with screen and print instead of web and print David said you should define the palette in another file and then import it and the others at CSS files yes that's that's definitely what I which should be done I was just kind of thought it might be cool to just demonstrate it so I just did it all right here but obviously cuz I'm not even using these yet but yeah ideally since I have lots of different sass files I would want to have let's say my own sass file that I could call like palette or colors or whatever I wanted to I could even call it variables if I I could have other things besides colors in there and then any time I was going to use one of those variables I could just include it I could import it at the top and then have access to it in these other files so that that would be the better way to go so I'll probably do that whenever I work on the next page where I need to use these then I'll probably pull them out and do it properly Bryan says do they have vector formats of those logos I always prefer prefer vector yeah it's actually surprisingly like somewhat not straightforward to get different logo formats around here so I agree I prefer the vector formats so if I can get them I'll try to get them but it's not like I've requested them before and then been given like JPEGs so I'm not really sure what what's up with that but usually I just kind of let it go and but but I'm with you there the vector versions of the logos would be ideal okay Sebastian I saw Sebastian mentioned again when it wouldn't look better if each button occupied half the card with with the with centreline text I'll try it out Alexander says the top row navigation and logos page is not looking good on mobile will you fix that yes so the idea is so right right now this to give everyone an idea right yeah it looks terrible it's really bad the idea is to change this into a select input or I could drop down menu once it gets to a certain so probably I don't want it to drop onto two lines so probably really early on it's going to go to a dropdown maybe I could probably do with a little bit less space between these and it would still work but at some point it'll go to a drop down mine blocks coder says I like your free code camp website Jessie actually like the the free code camp website is not it's not a really mine so I just volunteer and do this for free code camp there's a lot of other people that volunteer and do other things and that it worked on the website and so I I haven't actually contributed at all to the free code camp website although that would be cool to do someday for now I'm just just on these videos but thanks though okay alright so I've gotten to the end of the chat I've got through all the questions still got a few few suggestions and you could try out on on this but definitely looking better than it did at the beginning and we learned how to use SVG's within material UI and to utilize their SVG icon component so that was pretty cool like what else yeah I mean other than that I mean use some basic stuff but I learned a little bit about sass along the way so not bad not a bad job if I haven't looked at the time in quite a while but oh yeah almost two and a half hours for today's stream so a good time to wrap it up thanks so much for everybody that stuck around we still have people still watching after two and half hours so thank you thank you all for watching and you know everybody that's gonna watch this later on and I really appreciate it I I'll be back tomorrow tomorrow's gonna be a weird time I have a meeting scheduled at 230 and then I also have a doctor's appointment at 1030 so Oh sometime tomorrow morning I'll put on YouTube and then on Twitter when I'm gonna strain I really want to stream tomorrow it might end up having to be a short stream at a weird time but depending on how long my doctor's appointment is maybe I can do a stream from like 100 to 200 Eastern Time that seems like that that might be doable but I'll let you know tomorrow so anyway thanks again for watching and for all your help in the live stream and for the pool requests and it's just it's just overwhelmingly generous of you oh I really appreciate it and I'll be back tomorrow have a great day
