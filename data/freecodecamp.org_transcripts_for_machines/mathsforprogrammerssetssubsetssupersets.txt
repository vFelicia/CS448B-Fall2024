In this video, I'll be introducing the concept of subsets and supersets The dots on the board here represent elements of a set. The lines represent the sets themselves. These lines have been labeled B, A and U We can say that B is a subset of A because B contains...because all elements of B are elements of A We can also say that B is a proper subset of A because all elements of B are elements of A and there are elements of A that are not within the set B. We can also say that the set A is a superset of the set B because A contains all of the elements of B. And being even more specific, we can say that A is a proper superset of B because A contains all elements of B and there are elements of A that are not elements of B. What we cannot say is that U is a proper subset of A. Although the circle here is bigger than A, it just takes up more space, it doesn't contain any more elements So all the elements...so U contains all elements of A however, U does not contain any extra elements. So U is a subset of A, and A is actually a subset of U U is a superset of A, and A is also a superset of U So the sets A and U in this case are actually equal.
