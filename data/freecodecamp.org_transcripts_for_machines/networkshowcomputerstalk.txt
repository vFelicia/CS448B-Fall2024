Hi, in this video we will see how computers talk. Before we do that, I would like to give you an analogy of how people talk. In this room we have John, Bob, and Mary, and when John wants to talk to Mary he says, "Hi, Mary! This is John. How are you doing?" Now, when they're in the same room they're sharing the same medium, which is the air and all of them, Bob and Mary hear (listen) to this message but only Mary responds because it's addressed to Mary. In the same way, when computers want to talk they share a medium. In this example all these three computers are sharing a cable. This is how networks were built in the past so you have NIC cards for each of these computers and they have their own MAC addresses. Now, let's say if A wants to talk to B, what A does is it sends a message to B which looks similar to this "Hey B, you know you use the MAC address to address B, this is A talking and here is my message "How are you doing?" Now, when this message is put on this medium everybody on this medium can listen to it. So in this case B and C can listen to this message. Now what happens is, when C looks at this message it sees that it's addressed to B so just silently ignores it and B, when it gets this message, it sees that 'Oh! This message is addressed to me, so let me reply" and when it decides to reply what B does is "I want to know who is talking" so, it looks like the original message and sees it's A who is talking, so it says "Hey, A, this is B" and the actual message "I'm doing good" that's how computer talk.
