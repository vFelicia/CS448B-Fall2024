everything in HTML is a node that includes the document all HTML elements the text in the elements HTML attributes and comments these form a node tree all nodes in the tree can be accessed by JavaScript nodes can be created modified or deleted in a node tree the top node is called the root node so inside the document we have the root element which is HTML and then every node has exactly one parent except the root this element head node and the element body node each have the HTML node as the root node and the head and the body are children of the HTML node a node can have any number of children also siblings are nodes with the same parent so the head element is a sibling of the body element and this a element is a sibling of the H1 element and both these elements El have the body element as their parent element so here we're creating an element document.createelement and we're making it a paragraph a paragraph tag element then we have to add the text to the paragraph so we're going to create a text nodes so we have create text node here and it's going to add this text into that node and then we're going to append them together so we have the paragraph element that we created and then we have append child child and then the node this is the text that we created so the text node we created is a child of the paragraph node now we just have to add the node we created to the document we're going to set parent to equal document. getet element by ID div 1 that's this div one up here in the HTML and we're going to do parent. appendchild perah so we're going to add a new child node to this parent so to this div 1 where we're adding a new child node which is the node that we created up here so let me run that and we'll see it up in the HTML see now we just added up above the world so high at the end here we appended the child okay let's try something new here I'm going to create another paragraph par 2 document. create element P that's the same thing we had in this line up here but we're going to add the text differently so one way to create the text is the create text node but you can also set the inner HTML to be the new text so this is also creating a new text node within the paragraph just this line is taking the place of these two lines and it does basically the same thing so now we're going to get another element on the page the child node is document. getet element by ID P1 we now have this node up here from the HTML and we're going to insert before before we did a pin child which always puts the new node at the end but you can also put in new nodes before other nodes so instead of parent. a pin child we have parent. insert before and the first thing we're going to pass in is what we're going to insert and then which is pair two that's this up here that we created and the second thing we're going to pass through is what we want it to be inserted before so we have the P1 up here which is the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and we want to insert like a diamond in the sky before Twinkle Twinkle Little Star so let's run that and see what happens yep just like what I said it inserts it before Twinkle Twinkle Little Star I'm going to show you two more things in this video replacing a child and removing a child so these first two lines we're just creating another paragraph element we have par of three and it's going to be a paragraph element and we're going to put in the text when the blazing sun is gone and now we're going to get the parent node that's the div the div one replace child and the first thing we're going to pass in is what the the new element is that we're going to be putting in the second thing we're going to be passing in is what we want to be replaced so remember Child is This P1 up here that's the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star but now we want to replace it with this new line this new paragraph so let's try that and it's replaced it doesn't say Twinkle Twinkle Little Star anymore it says when the blazing sun is gone and then the last thing I want to show you is removing a child so we have parent that's the div again remove child and we just pass in what we want to remove we want to remove pair three which is what we just added so if we run that it does not say when the blazing sun is gone anymore we've removed that child thanks for watching my my name is Bo KS don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
