hey everybody its Jesse and today I'm just trying to get more done a lot of the same thing is yesterday but I did notice as I was going back through a lot of these components that they could use with a little bit of refactoring so there are some some changes that we made the components later on that were beneficial that I never went back and made those same changes some of the components that were made earlier so I am I'm going to go through and I was just adding an image in here just putting in some some content to test out a new component I just made so share the component in a second and let me check the I'm gonna check the live chat here we go I lost my my window for the live chat so hey everyone hairy ass what is react react is like a JavaScript framework it lets you build web apps and you can build other things with it too but it's it would be hard to sum up on a video but just that the very short answer is it's a JavaScript framework and it lets you build websites web apps and actually you can even build mobile apps and desktop apps very versatile and actually I think I saw a talk at a conference that recorded talk on YouTube about using react to build VR things which is really cool I don't really know how to how to do that but I know people are doing it so hey everyone alright so I see alright so you got a bunch of people in the chat now and hey Thor how's it going I haven't seen you know uh I Fernando from Argentina hey thanks for thanks for watching from Argentina actually there's a conference coming up in Argentina that I'm going to submit a talk for so actually I filled out everything I needed to submit it and then I got to the end and it asked for a video explaining you know a few minutes just explaining more about the talk and I couldn't do the video at the time cuz I was no it was up late all my kids were sleeping I didn't want to wake them up by making a video so hopefully I'll get some time to make that video and I can apply it would be really cool I've never never been to Argentina before if someone in the live chat whose name is an solo so like Han Solo but without the age and their avatar is a fixture of Han Solo so that's pretty cool alright so I got some questions in the live chat I guess I'll just answer them now before we we get started with some of the code and I'll throw some code up on the screen just you can see what I've been working on this is the new component on this side and it's doing a lot of stuff I have I did push this up to github so if you want to check out the code in more depth it's on the dev branch on github but let me just check out few questions I've epic asked how I load data in page load and react tree Redux I actually haven't used redux for anything so I can't I can't be of much help to you I'm taking a course right now and I'm gonna learn more about redux so maybe in another month or two I'll be able to answer that question but right now I'm just not experienced with it so I know how to load data on page load without Redux and actually you can you see will be will be doing some of that probably during today's stream so I don't know if that'll be helpful to you but if so you stick around well Patrick says there's even a way to developed commandline interfaces with react that's really cool I didn't realize that ek Howard asks I'm attending a coding bootcamp and I have to choose between react and Rails which one well it kind of depends on what you want to do but I'm I'm partial to react since I'm using it on a project now and react seems to be growing and there's a lot of jobs for react I don't know the numbers officially on Rails job sources react jobs but it seems like the momentum right now is at least with react so if your goal is to try to be marketable then reacts a really good skill to pick up you can vote a lot of stuff with it I don't have any experience at all and working with rails so I can't really give you great advice since I only know about react but actually correct me if I'm wrong is rails is more would Rails be more backend isn't that Ruby right is it and react would not normally be a backend type of thing I don't know maybe I'm wrong like I said I don't know very much at all about Rails so so definitely don't take my word for it okay so it looks like okay I was right so rails is backend so there you get so that's probably the best criteria is would you rather learn frontend stuff or backend so I guess it would depend on your goals like do you want to be a backend programmer or a fullstack or do you want to stick with frontend so that's that's what I would say I would also say to you know if you're gonna do the react boot camp then your JavaScript skills will get a lot better and that can translate into a lot of different things not just react so I know my JavaScript skills have gotten way better since I started doing things with react whereas before I was doing a lot of things with jQuery which jQuery is nice especially when you're starting out but if you if you want to be able to easily switch between different JavaScript frameworks knowing basic JavaScript is the best thing so it has really helped me okay all right so I think I got all the all the initial questions here in the live chat so yesterday I tried out a new system here where I used a Pomodoro timer to remind me to check the live chat and then also remind me to stop talking and do some more code so I'm going to do that again today I'm gonna start it as soon as I kind of catch you all up on what I've been doing also I I did a stream earlier today on my own channel so I had a suggestion so XANA who's not in the live chat yeah I don't see you in the live chat so maybe she's not watching right now but she had this suggestion to do just streams where I didn't have to worry about doing commentary or anything but I would just show what's on my screen and what I'm working on I had never thought about doing that before so I thought it was worth a shot and so I did so earlier today for about an hour I just showed what was on my screen I did it on my own YouTube channel because I wasn't sure I mean when I was invited to do the channel on free code or the show on free code camp it was based on what I normally do which is a commentary question and answer and that kind of thing so I didn't want to just switch things up and start broadcasting on free code camp without you know kind of checking with them first so it was a little bit spurofthemoment so that's why I just put it on my own channel so if you're interested in want to check it out there is a recording of it I'm I think I'm gonna call the series quiet coding so I'll probably have like a playlist on my channel about all my quiet coding stuff so earlier I was just doing a lot of like refactoring every acts of pulling in data from the WordPress API a lot of the same stuff I was doing yesterday so I'll probably I kind of like doing it had my my microphone muted so I didn't really have to worry if somebody came in my office tried to take a phone call or something I just I could just do it and didn't it wasn't really a big deal so not sure if anybody's interested but just one of the less you know since did you all gave me the idea for it I want to let you know that I did try it out and I don't think I'm just trying to think if there's any other big things that happen between yesterday and today and I don't really think so so I'll show you what I'm working on right now I'm just gonna kind of continue on whoops let me start my start my timer here so I I was continuing to try to pull in all the data from WordPress into our react react site or at least as much as I possibly could so that it can be editable within WordPress and nobody has to touch the code so I went through the let me just bring that pull the site over here so I went through some of the pages finished we had done the about page already yesterday so I went through the team page and then now I'm on the courses page and I'm just pulling in the data so what I did have to do on this courses page is make some custom post type so this section and this section these are just normal like pages within WordPress so exactly the same as we have been doing yesterday with some things this little section here is just a page but when we get down to here this now is a custom post type so before the click handler was was actually changing a CSS property to show and hide this now it's it's not the click handler is changing the state and I'll show you in a second and it's showing or hiding based on that database on that so it's our you know three rendering the component so if that doesn't make sense now it'll make sense in a second when I show you the code so these sections and I guess I should bring I have the live set over let me bring this over to show you what it did look like so these sections have images and they have these links these sections don't they're just text but they're similar enough that I thought it's worth a try to try to make one component that could handle all these variations depending on what data gets passed in so that was that was the goal I wanted I wanted one component for all of these things and potentially I suppose the same component could be used elsewhere if we ever add pages on so here's what I came up with so I made a component called expanding section and I it it has its own state and it's simply just display content true or false so really easy but then I have all these you know if that we're not really if statements properly is that you know ternary you know operators but basically I'm checking to see if data is there so the first thing I check for so every section is going to start out and that be wrapped in this subsection div right but the first thing I do right off the bat is check if there's an image so if someone in WordPress has uploaded a featured image to that post then it's going to render this okay which is the template that handles images also once we get down to once we get down to here so you could you see from from this part here just handles that first part this you know this title once we get down to here this is where we show our high based on our state so if state is true then we showed this part within this part I also have a section for this link so we're using that out link component that helps us track so if you remember we we were using react what was a react GA so the google analytics plugin for react and there was a there was a problem with it and that it didn't really work properly if he wanted to set target blank to the link so we made our own kind of wrapper element and it fixed that problem and that was the show whenever we actually submitted the pull request which i've never heard back about that so not sure really what happened maybe that project isn't really being maintained I don't know I never checked on it maybe I'll ask about it if I get a chance it's possible that I know I didn't properly follow the the rules for testing so it's possible that maybe when they saw that they just didn't even look at it but we'll see I think it's worth checking up on again because there are other people that had a similar issue so this could be helpful but anyway if there is a URL added in to our custom post type which I thought I had it on the screen maybe I moved it over oh yeah I did so we can see like the URL here so if a URL is entered then this button gets rendered otherwise it does it doesn't so the other variation then is and then of course it displays our image here the other variation is just the text with or without the link okay so there are potentially right now for variations that could happen on this this component so we could have image text and a link we could just have text and image we can just have text or we could have text with a link I'd like to add one more variation because right now we alternate so I need one more variation to just flip these and alternate so this isn't going to be something that the content manager from WordPress picks I could make it another field to set whether it's right or left but I don't really think that that's important I can it's possible maybe that they would want to do it but in general these types of sections look better if it does alternate so I think I'm just gonna make it so that it always alternates and that can't be changed and I'm more comfortable with that then that way I don't have to rely on whoever is changing the content to realize that it looks better you know alternated so that's one less thing for them to worry about and it'll keep the same look that that we wanted with this alternating thing here this woman here actually works at Franciscan she's super super nice everything every web said I do she always says it's really really great and she loves everything I do so anyway most of these pictures in here these aren't like stock photos these are real people from the University which is cool because normally I work a lot with stock photos this is actually a chapel that's on campus it's a replica of one in Italy so anyway a little side note all right so that's it sort of to finish up this component we just want to make these alternate so the good thing is we don't have to make a whole nother section where we change the HTML at least I don't think we do I'm pretty sure that I can just change let me see how I did it because I did do you use some the way I I laid out this grid with the CSS I made some custom classes that can change the order of where these things are so I'm hoping that that's all I'll need to change if if I can't exactly remember I set this up because I set it up months and months ago on a different project and I just carried it over but if it doesn't work like I wanted to then I can just make this component a bit bigger and copy and paste everything over and then we'll make we'll figure it out but for right now I think it'll be it'll be ok we just need to check out so I guess the easiest way to test this would be I'm going to go here we can see now for this one we have text on left image on right so what I want to do is change I don't know if this is gonna work I'm gonna give you shelter I'm gonna change this order I think my order CSS might only work on a small screen now that I think about it yeah it does ok I think I have it so that it only works on small screens screens right now so that the image always ends up being on top so let me just make sure that's still working like that yeah there we go so this only goes like that all right so the solution then I assume that this is like I'm using a media query to make it so that that only applies here trying to think of what the most the best way to make this happen would be I can put off thinking about it for just a second because what we need to do anyway is we need to figure out which basically whether it's odd or even number alright so and this is not hard and we're probably going to need to do it here when we actually I'm sorry not where am I here we go so when we actually set up and and start going through this component this is where we need to do it so we need to we need to get the index number and then pass it probably will pass it as a problem I think that's the best way all right so if you're not sure what I'm talking about right now it'll be obvious in a second when I actually do it so what I need to do now is get the index number and I'm wondering I don't know if I have to put a bracket there now I'm gonna try it without the bracket hopefully I can do it otherwise I'll put a bracket in and now I need to put the index equals I and then let me save that and find out okay no errors that's good and did it render yeah it's still rendered okay great so we're gonna grab the index we're gonna pass it as a prop to our component now within our component let's I'm wondering if I if I ought to put something in state basically all I need to do is be able to tell if this is odd or an even number I don't think there's necessarily any value in putting that in state we're never gonna have a need to change that after the fact all right so I think we can we can change this I don't really need to do anything else with this with this index so let's change it here might be easier now we'll leave it here and then we won't have to rewrite a lot of this logic and really I don't know if we'll do it it might just be a little nitpicky to do this right now but really I should probably put as much of the logic that's going on here into the components and make it easier to put things in but some of it I think I actually do have to do here to avoid getting some error messages but for now let's move this in here and just say let's say is even I don't know that I even really need to make a component for this or I mean it's like a separate function I could probably do it in line but others do it here that's the right syntax right I don't know why I write this so often I don't know why I'm secondguessing it but I guess it's like when you look at a word that you spelled a million times and it just looks weird to you all of a sudden like you spelled it wrong so let's say index this drops index and I'm going to say oops if it equals I always forget I always have to double check what the correct with the true and false values are for the answers so so what is it like if it's 2 modulo the modulus operator and 2 we get zero so if it's 3 I'm on my other screen I'm just doing a little bit of math ok so that's how it is so what we want so if it equals zero then we're gonna return true because it is even otherwise oh yeah that's right that makes sense I gave me that I had to do the math to figure that out but sometimes this is this easier to just do the math make sure okay that is gonna come through as a number all right so basically what this is doing if you're not familiar with this operator what this does is give you the remainder of what's left over once if you were to divide this number which is our index number by two the it'll give you the remainder so if it's divisible by two we will have no remainder which is y of 0 if it's not divisible by 2 we will have a remainder so that's that's where where all this is coming from and I don't know why I'm getting such weird syntax highlighting did I do something wrong so I'm gonna check my time here and make sure I do check the lodge at oh okay I'm glad I checked the live chat because I'm Berto has just told me correctly that why do I need the true or false couldn't I just do this and it would return true or false I'm better you are correct and also who else Pedro gave that answer as well and and I messed up the arrow function thanks Patrick goodness all right so this is a lot better now oh hey zan is here now Zanna were you here earlier when I was talking about doing the stream earlier based on your idea from like yesterday or maybe was two days ago if not I'll say it again really quickly all right in the in the live chat I'm just gonna read through a bit since I'm I've already kind of paused the bet here John Hanson says I sort of knew a bit of jQuery for about a year then halfway through a project I thought myself your regular JavaScript not bad for sixty never too late to learn yeah that's awesome actually I think I mentioned this before but my dad is 57 I think and he's going to retire this year and I'm trying to convince him to learn a little bit of frontend development and so I'll have to tell them that that it's not it's not too late to learn the Indra has a question how to avoid rearending all react tap wind state change and rendering only children so and then there's some clarification Nikola is asking what kind of state are you talking about component internal state or something like Redux andrew says talking about the big app state want to do it without Redux or flux or set state as simple member and passes props to children okay so Nicola says any component that has its props change will rerender itself meaning if your top components props or state changes everything underneath it will rerender okay yeah so I would say without seeing the code Andrew yeah if you could keep if it's possible to have like keep some state you know within a component that would reduce rerendering everything if you could I'm not really sure I don't know I don't know that I can give you a great answer if it's possible for you to like link to a github repo or something you can like send me a direct message on Twitter or something like that with the link if you don't want to link it in the live chat and then I could try to check it out when I get a chance Gunnar's says hey Jesse hey gunner how's it going thanks for watching okay John Hanson says flex bucket flex block box added a class that can easily change the dome order flex direction row or row reverse so you may not get the toggle left right if the viewer skips one heading all right lift it shake I have to check that out as soon as I get this basically the next step will be whether I want to handle this like with CSS or whether I want to actually make another component so Zanna I just looked at the link that you posted that had pictures of dogs with squishy cheeks oh that's that's uh that's pretty cool made me smile so here's some examples here for you all later watching let me see all right so we had a Cathal asks what theme do you use for Adam I use the SETI theme SETI Oh Sebastian's already answered that sorry I do that all the time you think I would have learned by now to read the next few comments before I answer yeah now I can see that everybody noticed that I messed up my error function before I noticed yeah so this is a Pomodoro so I had a question here in the live chat about the Pomodoro yeah so this is a poem of over timer so what I'm gonna do is use this I use it all the time when I work but I'm gonna use it during the be live streams now to give give me a better idea of just the time when I'm working and also you know every time the timer goes off I will remind me to check the live chat and then after the five minutes is up it'll remind me to go back to coding so I broke off from that a little bit early this time because I suspected that I was doing something wrong anyway so I figured you all would have caught it let's see ok Nicholas but is there a reason you're not setting your initial component state inside the constructor she talks oh I'm not sure are you talking about this component here so oh wait there's a little bit of delay oh wait so Nicola let me know if if I'm in the right spot there also anyway Zanna I think I had asked if you had heard what I said earlier but then I didn't see whether or not you answered me there's a lot of stuff going on so I'll just say it so you had the idea a couple of days ago of me just doing like a quiet stream with I didn't do any commentary but I I just would do my work and you could watch the screen so I actually did that this morning on my own YouTube channel for about an hour and I think it worked out pretty well I didn't have that many people watch it but that was okay because I really liked I didn't I couldn't handle if people were asking questions and stuff because I was just trying to get the work done so anyway I think I'll do that more frequently I think that was that was actually a good idea and I was able to keep my normal workflow and my normal pace it didn't really bother me knowing that the screen was being recorded so so that was a really good idea and I'll do those on my YouTube channel not on free code camp and less like someone from free code camp asked me and says they really want me to do that but otherwise I'm just going to keep doing this this kind of stream for free code camp and then I'll do the quiet stream on my own channel okay Nick alright that makes a lot more sense that one so anyway Nicholas question about the constructor was because he was just joining didn't realize that the component or I'm sorry that that the entire thing was done in in next j/s so let's see alright I think I got through all the questions okay I see Sebastian had me copy and paste something but now I see I'm just gonna I'm going to avoid the potential copy and paste like invisible character errors going on here so I think this is exactly what you had so it's even equal zero this problem and X modulo two equals zero okay so that's cool thanks Sebastian it's always crazy it like never fails that things that you do frequently that work when you're not being watched somehow you seem to mess up when you are was so anyway that's just the way it is all right so we have this now so so now we know whether or not this particular instance of that component is even or odd and okay there's my timer so I will say two I have I have a few things that are like not coding related that I do need to get done before I leave and I have a meeting at 500 so I need to make sure that I have enough time before then to do this stuff so actually one of the things that need to get done I can probably do on the stream so I'm just telling you all mostly so that I hear myself say it and I don't forget but if maybe if one of you also remember you can remind me if I forget towards the end of the stream so I need to make sure that I actually changed the links or tomorrow the site is going live that this one links to so I think I I think I have it up here somewhere so it doesn't really matter so the learning management system that this site needs to link to is going to be live tomorrow it's already live right now I don't know if you can log in or sign up for courses yet but at least the homepage works so I'm just going to link to it today so don't have to work on it tomorrow so I need to do that before I leave so I needed to switch to the master branch add the link in the proper place and then push the code to both of our our servers and make sure it works before I leave today the other thing I have to do is get some data to the head of my department so that she can use it for a meeting that she has on Monday which oh I won't be here on Monday I'm gonna take my kids to an amusement park and so no stream on Monday but I will be back Tuesday alright so having haven't gotten that out of the way let's sort this out now so let's see at this point I kind of just want to I kind of want to just put just take just this section because that's all that would really need right just this section and just say like you know if it's if it's even do it this way if it's all do it that way so I will just copy and paste this which kind of stinks because I don't like to repeat it so much the same stuff but I know like John said that you can do this with Flex box but since I haven't done stuff with Flex box like that at least for a while it'll be faster for me to just switch it around so let me do that now so this date display content so if we are displaying content and let's say n is even don't need up front you do this is even right this is even then we're gonna do it this way yeah we want the first one to be like this so because the first one will be zero so that'll give us a zero so that'll register is even okay and then I don't know I can't I don't want to do it like that I'm sure you all realize my my mistake so no cuz I wanted to either display or not display so what I want to do is make another one inside of this one so I always want the image to have order 1 so I'm going to go through I don't know if this will give me an error or not but it won't take me that long to try it so someone else will try if is even you do this else why did I just copy that again that was silly I also gonna do this and then I'll simply flip this around so it's really ugly now but it'll all get Auto formatted in a minute oh I was so terrible and I need I swim there you go okay uh based on the highlighting this is looking weird I'm not sure to work but yeah it doesn't work okay Isis she's arrived in closing today yeah I need I don't know that that's gonna work alright I'm gonna check the live site so I'm sure you all have been giving me advice while I'm doing this phone this is this seemed like it would be the fastest way it looks like it's a mess but basically the reason it didn't work is because I now then have adjacent elements that aren't enclosed in one element and you can't do that in react so if I want this to work I either need to wrap this in a div which may or may not mess up the formatting it's worth a shot to try I suppose or I need to go out like another level here and you know do this but I'm not anyway I'll check the live chat see what you all think that's what Susanna's comment about me always being polite okay she said I could just do talking for like 20 minutes at the end or after each 20 minutes yeah that's what idea I think was to do like after each like big Pomodoro session to then take a few minutes to talk yeah we'll see yeah I'll try it out and see kind of what the best mix is I did I used to have the idea of just waiting until the end to do all the QA but the problem is if there are too many people in the live chat the the questions that they asked at the beginning get they get deleted they're just there's like a limit so I can't see them anymore so then now I take a few times throughout the stream to check questions okay so all right so say this here need some advice here it says says I should I won't be able to please everyone because I always try to talk to everyone so better focus on the questions related on what you do at the moment and answer the others at the end or find a way that works for you yeah you're right that's that does make sense to try I do i do get sidetracked I I try I guess to save some of those questions for the end but I do occasionally get sidetracked and the reason being like especially if I see someone who's new I haven't seen the chat before even if they ask an unrelated question I really do like to answer them before they leave the chat because I want everybody to feel welcome like after for those of you that I see a lot I know you're not gonna get upset if you know I'll wait to answer your question to a little bit later because I mean you understand like I'm trying to actually get some code done as well so anyway that's why I get sidetracked so I kind of feelings about that I do think it would be easier to follow the stream for you all and I would get more work done if I didn't you know take those little those little side trips to talk to people but I also I do think it's important because I mean you never know they somebody some people come on and say I just started to learn how to code yesterday and I don't want them to get discouraged you know when they're you know when they're just starting out I mean oh it could if they feel like they're being ignored and they just started maybe it took a lot of courage for them to pose so anyway maybe I'm thinking too much into it but I would rather I would rather not be the person that is the reason why they quit coding or or just have a bad day so but I'll probably as more and more people watch this and chat I probably will have to come up with a better way to make sure that I stick to things because they'll just be way too many questions maybe I'll have to get like a moderator or something in the chat and they'll pick out the questions or something okay so John has an idea this is back to being related about to our problem at hand John says could you use an event listener on click to those headings and then toggle like flip the order based on that okay so I don't I don't actually think we need to to change it on click no I don't think we need to because we still it would basically be the same the same problem either way we just need to have like just a slight variation here another set so whether or not we're just checking for even or odd or were we're adding in a click there I think if we added the click we would still need to know whether it's even or odd am I missing something am I missing some reason why we should have a click handler involved in this as well so let me know class thing and I'm getting I'm getting distracted again in the live chat a Sebastian just talked about the YouTube dark theme yeah if you haven't tried out the dark theme on YouTube try it out so you got you all know that I am a fan of the dark theme so I really like it I have found that I did have some things that just weren't working right because it's a newer UI and everything so I did switch back to the the light theme because I couldn't like respond to comments on videos for some reason so it's probably fixed now alright so here's what I'm gonna try I'm just gonna wrap this in a div hopefully this won't mess things up I'm just I'm worried that it'll mess up or something with the knee of the column classes and like the grid system and with materialise but I think it's worth a try so we do a div here and then what do we need hmmm I think I messed up somewhere and pasting yeah I did okay yeah I did myself because that should not be there and then yeah so this this is the right spot no is it no it's not alright I'm gonna I got to think for a second so I can figure out what how I mess these divs up all right so this all right goes all the way up here with that so then we need a div inside directly inside this one right yeah okay so we do need a div that's gonna be I guess here this will need that death we may not need let me see what this one is okay we do need that device so we're good on those these two are necessary within this we're probably gonna need some sort of enclosing just yeah we needed we need a div here to close this column I don't know how I messed this up so badly yeah this has to be close it should have paid more attention when I was copying pasting originally all right so that's there this is the outline Oh actually I don't need it there I need it there should be here there we go okay so that didn't need to go there and then this whole thing ought to be wrapped in closing div all right so we need so it's the class name div no I don't need I don't need this but I need one down here this kind of thing takes the most brainpower it seems like for me than anything just figuring out where I messed up this is this same problem happened to me a few hours ago do you think I would have learned my lesson at least it was easy for me to figure out the problem now since this happened before okay I think all the divs are in their proper places now yes all right awesome hmm all right so that one didn't have why is this doing this so this is not working the way we wanted to I'm gonna refresh okay we'll see so the Maya dev server did quit working so I'm not gonna now don't worry until I get it back up and running I actually did take time this morning and try to figure out why my dev server keeps stopping and I couldn't figure it out I thought like well maybe I should update node on my machine which I did I updated it which is probably I probably needed to update it anyway but the update did not fix it so I tried looking up the error on line and I found some other people that had the same error and the solutions it it didn't work so there were three issues on github about that error but for other nothing with next j/s so it's probably not an XJS problem two of the issues never got resolved and then the third issue the the resolution was just I tried a few things in it but a lot of it like just wasn't really applicable to my situation so anyway the end result was that the time I spent on it I only succeeded in upgrading node but I did not succeed in solving the problem so let me check out I'm gonna inspect this and my dev tools is on one of my other screens right now which I'll bring it over if I need to okay so it seems like wrapping that div around everything is not it's not gonna work which that stinks because I said judge took a lot of effort to make sure all my dad's messed up okay all right so here's what I'm gonna try this son let's take out these divs now I'm gonna try to be very careful when I take these out so I don't mess things up again so there's one and there's the matching one okay and I just need to do that one more time so this is a div so there's one and there's the matching one okay great so I'm gonna I'm just going to confirm that I'm getting the same error yep same air okay so we're back kind of where we started and here's my idea for a solution right now so I think what I'll do is I'm gonna try to add in I'd say I want to try this is I just want to see if it's possible I don't feel like looking it up I'd rather just just do it here's what I want to try I want to I want to do I want to try to put a ternary inside that's her name there's no way there's no way this will work but I think it's cool to try all right so I am gonna need a closing div here and now I'm also gonna need another closing div here and let's see display content so this even so within this all right so this is our alternate and then we go down here and which they're closing trying to find out where our other ternary actually closed I guess it's not there it was there but I don't think that's doing anything okay all right let's see what errors we get all right that's not what I was expecting let me see what I did oh I have a div I don't need any more right if I want to be really excited this actually works it works all right I'm pretty sure we're gonna add in like one more thing just to doublecheck but we didn't get an error like all right so check this up it is in fact possible to nest turn Aries and it works it looks a bit messy it's like a lot of mental effort to keep it all straight for me and it's probably giving a mess if I ever want to come back in here and change it so I don't know that I would ever recommend it or do it again but it definitely works that's really cool I though that was fun I don't know if you all what you all think about it but it's sometimes it's fun to just do things even if you're not sure if it'll work all right I'm gonna check the live chat really quick because I'm sure that that some of you had something to say about what I was doing did my a actually that was great timing all right so I'll do my five minutes now or the live chat let's see okay so John said I have asked before if I was missing something about why we should have a click Handler and John said it's because what if a person skips one or two or three headings will not add an even order in those headings along with the open and close elements oh I see what you're saying now all right so sorry I didn't get that until now so basically the idea was so yeah if everything's open in order let me use this one for an example so if everything does get open you know in order you get the audio in effect right it's nice but what if somebody just skips right so you have to line up here so I hadn't thought about that I think I actually don't think the effect is is bad when there's this gap and there's obvious that there's another one in there because I'm thinking basically what would end up happening I think would be more jarring than this so that if I had these open like this and then I opened this one I guess it honest on a shorter screen it didn't really make a difference but if you could see them both what you would see happening is this one would open up here and then this one would flop it what this would flip flip flop right here so I think I'm okay with this happening but that's definitely a good thought I didn't even occur to me at all yeah so I think I am going to leave it like this but I appreciate I appreciate the thought and you're explaining it to me since I didn't understand right away no man I never noticed this picture is a little bit old so this isn't there we get a new food service vendor for the for the University and I don't think that this is the name of this coffee place anymore so I'm surprised nobody noticed because my boss is usually like he notices every little detail like that she must not actually looked at this picture cuz I bet he would have noticed it I don't think it's the big deal but I think we usually like to not make anything in the image that could give a date so that people don't realize like hey we're using like really old images or something in our sights anyway let me put in one more I'm gonna put in the data for let's see yeah I want to put in the data for one more so that I can actually see if we're getting the correct ordering happening because right now I really I can't tell so think the only one is crucification kind of context FastTrack okay so this is the only one that I haven't put in yet so I'm entering this into WordPress oops and I should probably while I'm doing it I should probably just put in this link like it's supposed to be okay sorry about this this is boring stuff but I definitely think you need to test this before I move on so I was I was pretty sure it wasn't gonna work and so since it did work I'm very I'm still a little skeptical since its appearing to where I Creighton huh it's made this image the other nice thing is that when I get all these images into WordPress I can take them out of the the react app so they don't need to be stored on the same server right now they're not in gonna be tracked and get anymore so it'll make everything just a little bit smaller oh man that's huge image I need to go in and sorry I just lost my train of thought right in the middle oh I need to go in and get better image sizes for this this was on my list of things to do and then I got pushed pushed into doing some other things and never got back to doing the images okay so let's refresh and we should have everything nope all right so I'm really glad I did that because we are not getting the alternating like we want did I actually change the order of these yeah I did okay so this definitely has us a different order all right so what's going on alright I'm gonna check the chat really quick to see if anyone has any ideas if I'm missing something oh yeah Sebastian did say about the dev server it is definitely just this machine because I can use it on my my laptop and the repo works fine and the dev server is fine so I don't know what is going on with my machine okay Patrick addict the idea to refactor those these chunks so I'm assuming you meet within this within this componentry fact there are a lot of this stuff that I'm repeating into stateless components and then that way it'll be a lot easier to read yeah you're right when I first was doing this I didn't think it would get this this huge but maybe I should just make those into components now and yeah that will be so much easier Todd John says Jesse you live on the edge you only learn by being fearless I like that thanks Jeff yeah I mean what like what's the worst that could happen I just get an error message right and then I just you know hit hit ctrl Z or command Z and then it's all good it's back to normal again and I'm using you know get as well so I could just go back to previous commit so why not like it's not like I can it's a local deficit might as well try out whatever I want John I saw you just said he said it could be jarring meaning like the backandforth that I was talking about with the order unless you he said unless you animate JK's yeah I always I always think it'd be cool to animate things and I would like to do it but I just like don't have time right now only because like you all know like I need to be done with this project by neck like by the middle of next week so there's definitely things that definitely things that I would like to do that I'm just not gonna be able to do Sode is asked a few questions hey welcome to the channel I don't think I've seen you in here before so welcome this is we're using JavaScript and it's in particular to react the react framework in JavaScript and sawdust can you teach me and want to be an expert in programming languages please can you teach me well if you watch this you'll get some idea of what my job is like so it's not exactly like a teaching like tutorial based thing I am gonna release some videos on my own channel hopefully sometime soon if I can quit having these crazy deadlines and those will be more tutorial oriented if you have any specific questions or want me to check out your code you can direct message me on Twitter and I'll try to check everything out when I get a chance yeah and Sudd said would you say PHP yeah so I did a little bit of PHP for this a custom plugin for WordPress so everything else has been JavaScript okay so Sebastian is giving me some alternate syntax that may be able to help me out here okay and see let me let me show you let me show you some of what is being pasted in the live chat so I said didn't didn't catch everything so something like this okay so let me so I'm getting some some good advice here in the chat so let me let me go back in here and let's try to do so basically I don't need to nest my statements or wait let me see what school all right so basically this is this syntax is is saying I just want to make sure I had it right before I told everybody's sorry for the pause saying if it even then do something else don't do anything so you're saying basically so I can basically get rid of like areas where I'm using like the question mark and the I'm trying to find an example oh if I'm on the wrong page that's why sorry yeah so like normally I use the question mark and then the here so I wouldn't need to use those then but I think in this case I I do need the else right so for like for this if it's even I need to render this if it's not even so I need that else I neither under this correct now for these ones I could try that out for these ones right because I'm rendering nothing here so I could get rid of so and so this so like for this one I could do this props URL oh actually I don't know if I could do it because I'm not checking for true or false here I'm checking to see if it's if it's blank so this was probably only work if what I'm checking for would be true or false if I'm checking for anything else then I couldn't miss I might not be able to do it or could I still do it but I would just have to put the end right here all right so let me let me share this and then I could do this alright cool let me just see because this should I'm pretty sure that that part of the template is the one the only one is rendering right now cool really cool I don't know what this this should actually have a link in it I want to double check to make sure that the link is there I guess I never put put the link in so it should have one okay I'm gonna get rid of these as well inside here cuz I don't I don't want to see the doubles anymore that'll shorten this up a bit okay okay let's make sure Ricky okay let me bring over it's a little awkward right now I had my terminal underneath this the window that I was the live chat was on so I'm gonna bring it over bring it over here so you all can see what I'm doing on the terminal as well okay son I see I see you gave me your email they're just uh do you have a github profile where you have your codes so you could give me the link to that then I could check that out also all the links to all my social media stuff are linked up somewhere in the description this video some are links from my youtube account so you can you could contact me in a variety of ways but if you want to send me a link to your github then then I can check that out okay cabbie and says the the empty string is false II so I don't even have to have that so where was I at here so I should be able to just do this right yeah I just thought the same thing Patrick so Patrick put in the live chat you titled this refactoring you're getting a lot of refactoring advice yeah I accept itíll this refactoring because I wasn't sure what else to call it but I was only billing some refactoring but I thought I don't think I've ever titled a video refactoring so let's let's do that and now it's it it's actually nearly entirely refactoring at this point so it was appropriate Oh Patrick just had a good idea saying that I should try cloning into a new directory on my machine to see if that will fix the server issue I'll have to try that I I had not tried that yet so I'll try that out if that works that will be awesome all right let me let me see all right so did I say that let's see make sure that really works okay cool whoa did you all see this somehow I'm getting the images now right how is this rule where are these coming from they are in fact coming from WordPress so I don't know what I did I didn't do anything but now all of a sudden the images are working and you've seen that like they'd never work locally they'd always oh well I'm not complaining all right so basically what we need to do then is figure out why it's not flipping the order like we wanted to and rendering this other thing maybe my nested ternary operator just does not work and that's certainly possible we could also let's see I said only to let me um I'm gonna check on dev tools and I'll bring this over to the other screen now since it may be beneficial for everyone to see this so I'm gonna check on dev tools and see what exactly the props are that are being passed here to make sure we're getting the right index okay so this one has an index of one so we should be getting okay this was index zero all right so it looks like the index yeah that's that's what we want so we should be getting like true and false alternating but we're not all right so let's put in oops this oh no I forgot this I even made sure that I use the arrow function so that this would work okay cool so now we're getting what we need so we have false true false true false who so we're getting a value so then the problem is we can at least move down here and see maybe it's within our return area just can't show those persons okay our bad I see since you've been using this props URL a number of times so I can D structure that to Const URL this props yeah I probably could do some D structuring I'm gonna I'm not gonna do it right now because if I turn these into I want to see like how much I can reduce the usage of it by turning these into their own components okay so let me see I was just reading I'm reading all the the advice here and the live chat I probably should have read it out loud sorry to everyone who had to sat through that silence I think someone mentioned I should be calling it like that oh that was it all right let me let me figure out who said that so I can thank you properly I can't believe I miss that heavy in art so Kevin thank you so much so here's the problem I was using this even this is even instead of actually calling it like that and that was it that was the problem it's crazy because I even did it the right way up here so really good catch with that one awesome so now our even odd thing is working and I need to switch the order of this but I'm not gonna do it on the stream because I'm actually gonna do it in WordPress I'm just gonna change the date the published date of this to make it publish after and then everything will be in the right order all right awesome so this is the this needs to be populated with a huge list but I'm not worried about that now I might I might not even do it myself I might have the Amy who's doing the content management put all that that data in I should probably have her do some of this anyway and then that way it'll be like training for whenever I'm not working on this anymore all right awesome so the courses page works now we should probably clean this mess up alright so I'm gonna let me get rid of this I don't need this but I'm gonna commit this because it works and then we'll refactor and if I make a big mess of everything at least I will have a working version that's been committed that I can always go back to whoa okay I gotta get rid of I originally had different components for each one of those before I changed my mind and did it in just all one component so there we go also this is no I was gonna say it'll make everything look nicer and it'll be easier to work with where do we add please fix them okay I forgot to remove that that's an easy fix so I was directly using out link and since I moved it into this component I don't need it anymore so that was the the air there so let's do that again great all right looks like I have an update for NPM available all right cool so while that does this thing let's work on this oops okay so first of all first of all oh I'm gonna try to figure out what should be put into its own stateless functional component and so basically things that I'm I'm repeating are really good candidates or potentially things that I might not be repeating now but I could see you needing to repeat elsewhere somewhere else on the site are also good candidates for this all right so let's see I guess this could be this probably could be I'm kind of hesitant because I don't really want to do the work of doing the click and then sending the data back and all that so let's we'll see oh I mean I'll do it if it really seems like I obviously should do it let me see how many times I use that twice actually that is a really good candidate I think because I potentially this could be used in other parts of the site too all right let's do it the reason I didn't want to do it is because I have done it before where I I have a clique that changes state and apparent component but I've only done it like twice and so I'm not real sure about it so since I've already messed up so much on today's stream I'm not in a hurry to do it again but oh whoa I guess there's only it's the only one way to really learn something and remember it and that's to keep doing it in practice so let's do it I definitely need to change the song I'm listening to it because it's really annoying all right let's see so we're gonna call this component I'm trying to get a name for this component try to name it like based on what it does since it's gonna have a click handler basically it's gonna show hi but it doesn't necessarily have to show hide the click could do other things it really it makes sense with the way we're handling this SVG that it is a show hide but it doesn't necessarily have to be so I guess I'll just call it click heading alright cuz it's it's an h3 tag it's a heading and you click it yeah cuz a lot of stuff I could potentially make a lot of the stuff in here changeable based on the props so it could be pretty versatile alright so let's do that let's call it click heading Oh what happened oh I shoulda used to wait what's that I remember someone gave me the advice of how to use the command to use if you've accidentally run something that you should have run in sudo and there's a way to run it in sudo without having to type everything out again it was like s Oh with with two exclamation points awesome what's wrong one use my password for my labs up and not for this machine alright cool thank you so much for giving me that command so quickly it's been a really long time since I had to use it so I didn't remember wait a second alright cool it worked that was really fast I thought it was an error for a second because it was so fast but let's touch components and Woody's is gonna be click heading all right so now we have this component and I had I hid this earlier just to give some more give us some more space I'll probably decide it again if you use atom this is actually really cool light I used atom for years before I even realize this shortcut command so like you know the slash that shares a key with the question mark I can't ever remember which ones forward session which was back slash that one automatically comments something for you but if you use the other slash the one that's just below the backspace or delete key depending on what it says on your keyboard that one shows in hi it's this little thing in the corner super useful alright so so we're gonna do let's take let's see if I have a stateless functional component to just steal from and I don't oh sorry yawning I didn't have my normal energy drink today before the stream so I'm a little tired yawning said I had no no G fuel to the hey alright so I'm I want to try to type this component out without copying because it might actually be faster than trying to find one and I think I can do it so I import react we can import reactant reacts and we're gonna do Const and what do we call this click heading equals alright now I'm stuck now I need to look all right let's see which one did we do this with there use it with this now we didn't I don't know that we have any in here because this one was one but then we added I think we added State to it okay I'll have to check my other my other project I know I use them in my side project that I'm doing for my course right now so I will check that okay Sebastian Sebastian has my back there we go props I couldn't remember what went in there just FYI I've only probably built maybe three stateless functional components so far in my entire life so that's why I can't remember the syntax ok this probes and then just put the brackets I can't remember I don't think I need the brackets right no I just need parentheses right okay all right so that's all I need for the beginning and then I need to export it and I don't need this what I need my that's what I want Oh click heading why did i camelcase that when I needed to capitalize this I'm gonna have to rename it I don't know what I was thinking okay all right so that should work I'm going to need to copy over sorry h3 all right so how h3 let's figure out what props we need to pass in so we need to make a click function here to handle the click and change the state in our parent component and so in here I'll put this so this is going to be doing the same thing now on click what we want to do is and see what am i I think I'm doing something similar in another component so let me let me look on my other screen I have my other project open so that I can just check this before I start fumbling around okay all right so that should be good I know we're calling it clickhandler here but I want it to be do I want this no I don't want it to be because yeah I want this to be reusable for other things other than just showing content so I don't want to call it that so I guess we could just call it click click Handler and we'll just so we'll have the proper name the same thing all right yeah and okay cabbies I see I don't really even need this part right I can get rid of that because I'm not doing any anything other than just saying there's a clique I don't need to pass any data okay all right so over here let's pull in this component and click it all right so click heading there and click heading all right so we definitely want to pass as clickhandler so will this a penny this okay and what else will we need we need to pass the state down and then we need the title okay it's my content it's gonna be this states content and then title I'd off to be rendered this profs title rendered okay so now we can do trops display content and drops title all right let's check it out what did I mess up nineteen I mess this up up here copied over an extra one maybe that was it this drops click Handa is not a function where I do that Google Chrome thinks that my this error message is is Catalan so it's s wants me to translate it I wonder what it would translate to interesting there we go whoa all right definitely messed something up let me see alright I'm gonna check and checking the live chat quickly alright let's say there's some discussion in the live chat about Lanie's commands okay Kevin so yes I removed the parentheses let's see okay I didn't remove them here okay I forgot no wait I did but I did pull the side one did I do this right these props title render this props title twice the title not being rendered actually yes you'd Sarah's in the lab chat hey Sarah glad you could join us okay I'm gonna need to probably wrap this up and do a few more things before I have to go I have a meeting with a potential client later on for a side thing I'm not sure if I'm going to do the website is gonna be like a really basic WordPress website I'm just not sure that I'm really interested in doing it but the person that wants me to do the site is a friend from from high school and she was friends with my wife and so I felt bad because she hired somebody to do this WordPress site and she was gonna pay him $250 up front and then $250 when they were done and all they had to do the first step of all they had to do was just redirect a domain name which is no big deal and then just kind of like make the theme look a little bit better potentially probably just find a better theme and just apply that theme instead of the old theme so it was really basic stuff and I think it's been months I think it's been since December and she hasn't heard from this person and she already paid him half the money so I feel bad so I still kind of don't want to do the sightly I'm not excited about doing the work at all but I do feel bad and I don't really I don't know we'll see I'll see what she wants I'm at least gonna meet with her and see what she wants for the site and if it's something I can do really quickly I guess I'll do it and maybe I'll just say like whatever you're gonna pay the other guy just pay me the rest of it you know whatever's remaining which will probably 250 and then and I'll just finish up I did he did do some work but I found like a test WordPress site but it wasn't great looking all right so as a as I was going off on the little tangent there about my meeting I was trying to look through this and try to figure out why the title is not showing up actually let me look there's my dev tools that I want to see what the what's being passed down to these components spanning section click heading okay so it looks like it's not getting the say it's not even showing up that there's this title prop at all this props title rendered Oh because it's not title rendered right because we're inside of a component we're passing the data in as title right so let me see on our course page every way I can just see where I'm using title elsewhere right this props title yeah I don't have to put render that's the problem okay oh my this should should fix the problem yep there we go all right great so our clique still work and now we've taken some stuff out into a component awesome so now we can replace all of our h3s which i think is just to not not a huge improvement but still helps I mean that when it's all spread out like that that's you know that's a number of lines right there that's all right save that just check make sure it's working yep I mean dear refresh just to check for sure okay great actually you'll see this why is there a gap between this and this that's weird I don't like that that's weird okay see all these other sections are 35 pixels tall and this one's 54 pixels tall why is that it's not leave its the site isn't being defined anywhere what is going on because this h3 you see this tip here probably don't think I can see is there's it just as classic let's take that so that would be the second option here and it would be this div right well there's not there's no difference that I can see here in terms of in the code it looks the same but inin dev tools they have different heights oh I may have to wait and just figure that out at a different time because I gotta add a move on here alright so oops where am I kind of save I'm not sure what I edited but save it click heading all right so I got a switch to master and make one update before I go yeah I see sarah said CSS though yeah it's got to be something with the CSS oh off to look for that I don't want to do right now sometimes if CSS stuff is just pretty boring it's just a lot of like clicking on elements and seeing what comes up in dev tools so I don't think that'll be that fun to have on the stream and I got a yes it's um I have a meeting in less than 45 minutes so I need to get this done so I'll do one of the things I have to do I can do on stream and that'll be fine the other thing is just me getting data out of Salesforce like manually actually copying pasting data and doing math with in a Google sheet so that's not gonna be fun to show and has nothing to do with coding it's just a test that I wish I could automate I can't get right now so now let's go to the all right whether I page you will be the courses page let me refresh yeah okay so definitely I'm gonna make this a link and I probably should make I'm not sure that people will realize that this is a link but I'm going to just make that like they in the last meeting I had that they wanted this to be a link but I think I ought to put something maybe right under here have a button like this kind of button but under here I'm just not sure what to call it we we threw out some ideas at the meaning on what to call it and it never came to a decision on what we should call the button and I don't really have time to talk to everybody and get them I'm not even sure if anybody's still here I mean it's after 400 on a Friday I'm sure a lot of people are gone I'd hate to call the button just say go but I don't want it to be too long like I could say if there's a Franciscan oh I don't know if you'll have any ideas yeah I know I uh yeah I don't know who's gonna expect to click that's what I said I didn't think anybody was gonna expect to click on the title because we don't really have clickable titles anywhere else on this page and pretty much nowhere except for the the blog the news page do we have clickable titles so but anyway they wanted to be clickable so I'll just make it clickable but I do need to put a button of this style up here I think they they kind of wanted like two buttons side by side they still want this link to the PDF of more information see the originally this was supposed to be the link to go to Franciscan at home calm and I only threw the PDF in there as a placeholder but now they want to keep it and so it was gonna be really simple I was just gonna replace the link but now I actually have to do something else all right well I may as well just throw some things in here see what they look like so what's this course is all right so now we're back to the the old version of the courses phase all right so here's what we have here's our button so let's put it here let's see what it looks like oops I put in the wrong spot here we go this is where it needs to go oh well not I don't really like that too that much all right let me see I'm gonna take the live chat since I was see if anyone has any ideas Kevin in response to the Google I mentioned I was doing some stuff in Google sheets the Google sheet automation is not a problem because that's done in just JavaScript so it's not really a big deal the problem is on the Salesforce side of things is getting the data out of Salesforce and into the Google sheet the data that I need because it's not just Salesforce it's some like old plugin that I'm not really thrilled with for Salesforce so I can't even use like the normal documentation for doing things in Salesforce also the account that I've been given doesn't really let me do that much so even if I knew how to do it I probably don't even have access to send that data to the Google sheet and then I'm also getting data I am getting data from another Google sheet so I'd have to pull in data from two different places in the sheet which is not a big deal in terms of the Google sheet but anyway so for Salesforce that's that's the problem like it it probably I mean in the long run it would probably be good to learn how to do that but I'm just I haven't had a great experience with that particular like plugin that we're using I'm not really impressed with it and the documentation for it is is terrible like and actually nonexistent for a lot of things so it's just really hard to figure out how to do anything I don't know if anybody else has ever worked in like higher education before but the people who provide like software and web services for our education like the products are not good but I always try to say positive things as I say it nicely as I can but they're not good I'm really really really disappointed and everything even like the service like asking them for things or like can we do this or could you do it's just really really bad and even to the point where like when I've actually gone in and changed code to make it better and told them like hey you know feel free to give this to your other clients because I'm sure they need to do the same thing too and we're not talking like big deal stuff just simple stuff like making making things responsive so that they work on a phone things that people expect to get and the response was like no we're not gonna give it to anybody like well are you serious that's gave you this free free code but and that the excuse basically the whole reason was they're trying to get people to pay more money for a different product that was going to be responsive and so they didn't want to update their old product anymore even though everybody was still in their old product they had only sold their new product to one school anyway sorry for the rant it was just really frustrating so if anybody wants an idea for an industry where you could probably break into and do a great job it would be in services for higher education because if you do a halfway decent job you will be better than most of the services that are out there right now all right really the only thing that's stopping me right now is from finishing this is just figuring out what to call this this button and normally I wouldn't care so much but I know if I call us something that the people in charge of this project don't like I'm gonna get called either in like an hour when I'm at a meeting or tomorrow morning or something they're gonna call me and say can you change the name of this button I really want to say begin I think this came up with like basically the idea of saying something like begin is they didn't like that because they didn't want people to think that they're like immediately starting a course I think people are like smart enough to know that they're not gonna immediately start the course especially if we're gonna keep this as learn more I need to get rid of this this border at the top maybe I have that margin top yeah I need to get rid of that don't need that margin there we go that looks better all right let me change this there we go I just want to make sure okay yeah it is it is in fact up so this is the site that it's being linked to the learning management site that's better than air okay and let's make this title a link so I'll grab this and oh I did it again I went to the wrong title keeps rolling up too much is this one that I want now probably I need to work with this color it might automatically change the color yeah dead so let me make this like text all right cool all right so now this can be clicked or this can be clicked and I mean their links they should work but I'm just gonna click alright cool and I wish they would have used the same color favicon up here I'm not sure where they even got that one I guess they made it by they I mean like the company that built this oh well I kind of wish that they'd consulted me more about the design so that it could have been consistent so like they're little things like a lot of like borderradius shadows things like this like this is not the behavior that happens on all of our other sites when we have an interaction with a button so yeah these are all I don't know I mean it's not like the information wasn't available about how to do this there's lots of sites lots of our sites that already use this and we have a style guide so oh well I just have this fear that at some point I'm going to be asked to redesign all this to match the University style and I've been assured by my bosses that that's not gonna happen but at one point I was not supposed to be working on this site either and that happens so I'm still like not convinced that it's not gonna happen and if it is gonna happen I'd rather just know it now then have a situation like this where I get pulled in at the last minute and and do this I would have liked to have had more time oh well that works let's commit that okay let's go to our servers so that'll do its thing an update and then we'll update the other server all right and while that's working i'll check the live chat and i need to keep an eye on the time to make sure i can update the data as well before I go so I may not be able to get to everything in the live chat so I apologize in advance for that but I scrolled up about halfway in the chat I don't think I missed anything from the beginning okay I'm gonna skip it it looks like there's some discussion about them and different things and some different Linux commands stuff so I'm gonna skip over a lot of that just for time and try to get to everyone's questions even though I'm sure there's some good information within those conversations I'll try to read them a different time if I can okay so Sebastian says stop your dev server go into the project folder and delete the the dot next folder check if your dev server works okay if it doesn't then clone the repo in a new folder all right awesome I'm gonna try that not right now but I'm definitely gonna try that so thank you John Hanson asks what happens when that course page gets really long with some kind of pagination or something some other system need to be built into the code it's possible right now it's the course section is not supposed to get longer so this is gonna stay pretty fixed for now and this will pretty much be be fixed but if that happens then I guess I'll have to build something in at that point it could be something like that it could be potentially like decreasing the font size and doing two columns although on a small screen that wouldn't it would still be large so I have to come up with something for that but I don't think it's supposed to grow any soon so so we'll see it actually it's taken a lot of time to build like each one of these because there's they have to do like video production and editing and everything for each one of these courses and so they'll be along you know a period of time of developing it before this would ever get added so I should I should have time to to do that if necessary okay Saad I thanks for giving me your github account so that's cool I'll check it out and then yeah let me know like any specific questions that you have about your code or anything you want me to look at in particular send me a message on on Twitter or I guess you could put it in the comments in the video I mean I'm more likely to see it directly if you put it on Twitter so that's probably the most reliable way to get in touch with me oh don't worry son don't worry about it you're not bothering me not at all yeah I just XANA you say you're out dressing your dog cuz it got colder so is that like legit your dog has a sweater on now or something is that Kevi and i just saw you're talking about the I just noticed the component is not stateless it needs state to know if it renders the SVG rotated or not or it may receive the orientation for the triangle in a prop yes so it does receive it and I'm sure you probably saw that afterwards but yeah we just passed the state from the parent component down to the child in a prop and then the child doesn't really need to to have its own state which I can't see right now but now that you're think you're saying that I wonder I'm probably not gonna change it now but I was just kind of wondering like would it have been better no it wouldn't have been but I was I was wondering if the that component for the headings should have had its own state but I don't think it because I needed to use that same that state to show and hide in the other parent component so it's better I think for that state to live there especially if I put the content sections into their own component then that needs to be able to pass that same state down to two different components so I think it's better to just keep it in the parent and passed it as props to the children components but I may be mistaken if there's some good reason why I shouldn't do it like that I would like to know and you're asked if anybody has worked with graph QL I haven't worked with graph QL yet I mean I've like mess around a little bit with it but not not any serious work with it but I'm really impressed with what I've seen so far and I'd like to use it more Oh kevie and I see you're saying that for a debug tip render the props inside a pre tag in the stateless component cool thanks for that tip Santa said never worked for your distant family or friends yeah I'd I know I like all the clients that I still have better recurring clients are all either family or friends and it's like you can't what am I gonna say tell them I'm not gonna do this anymore I mean I guess if I had somebody that I don't know I don't know I like keep thinking maybe I should just get like subcontract the work that's somebody but even then like it's not enough money for it to be worthwhile for anyone like I have a client right now that's a family friend and last month I didn't even send him an invoice because they only owed me like 12 dollars I thought it's not really worth my time to even create and send an invoice for $12 so I'll have to see but I think this month they're gonna owe me less than $30 and I'm like thirty dollars a little bit better but is it really worth my time to actually like take time on a Saturday or something and you know go into the invoicing software and send it I don't know it's but it's it's hard to quit B it's hard to to get rid of a client that is a friend or family member so I just never should have done it anyway I should have said No Leonard's ass how often do you stream this type of project is this ongoing in parts and actually it looks like everybody already answered that question all answered for the sake of people watching this maybe later on I do stream Monday through Friday usually at 200 p.m. Eastern Time occasionally I have to change the time and occasionally I'm not able to stream on a day but I usually will put it on Twitter like earlier in the day to let let everyone know whether there's a time change or whether I can't do it okay I'm seeing all the stuff now that everyone said about the like the weird spacing between those two headings so thanks for that I'll take a look at that later on too and try some of those things okay I see Sarah that you had said maybe don't make it a button just a link so sorry I didn't see that earlier so at this point I'm just gonna keep it as a button because I'm running out of time but maybe at some point I'll see how it looks like just as not a button in just the length hey Jeremy so if you're watching yesterday you may remember that Jeremy had a job interview today and Jeremy just came in the live chat and said that he got the job so awesome congratulations super excited for you so yeah awesome if if you're able to come back to a stream in the future please let us know how the jobs going that's really cool yeah Patrick I just so you said about the button animation very 1999 and moves in a very incorrect way yeah I agree I'm not really a big fan of the button animation on I guess I closed it out but earlier I had the site yeah this button I'm not really sure about this button animation because it the way it graze it out usually when something's grayed out like that that means that it's not clickable like it's not it's disabled so it's a little bit odd and it you know moves sideways and down which it makes it look like you've already clicked it when you when it's down so it's just it's it's not the animation doesn't really make sense for the purpose of that element so it's a little odd and then on top of that it's just this is not then you know we have a certain way of doing animation on buttons that we use across the board on all our sites and this is not that way so I think it's better to keep it consistent okay then I just saw that about the the project yeah I'm not sure let me so I am I'm gonna meet with the fraud I'm gonna meet with the client here it's very soon and actually I'll see what they want and and then I'll see if it's worthwhile if it's if it seems like maybe I'll let you all know if maybe one of you are up for doing it and Zanna maybe all depending on how the meeting goes maybe I'll send you a message on Twitter and let you know if if it's even worthwhile but that would actually be cool it's I think it's gonna be a really easy project like I don't even think it's gonna involve much coding at all it's just gonna be like customizing a wordpress theme most likely and that's you know that's that's not really a big deal so anyway I have got to go now so I need to get this data updated in about five minutes and then go luckily my meeting is only a few minutes away by car so I should still be able to get there on time but Kevin hey how's it going Kevin's here from Trinidad so glad you could join us sorry I'm about to end the stream so sorry you came in right at the end but you'll be able to watch the recording in just a few minutes it'll be available on on this channel in the free code Kent Channel so anyway thanks everyone for all your help today and let's see oh this is Friday right so have a great weekend and I'll see everyone on Tuesday so no stream on Monday and not working on Monday Tuesday I'll see you if anybody has any other questions he's helped with anything Twitter is the most reliable way to get a hold of me so you can message me on there otherwise I'll see everyone on Tuesday and again thanks so much for watching and all your help have a great weekend
