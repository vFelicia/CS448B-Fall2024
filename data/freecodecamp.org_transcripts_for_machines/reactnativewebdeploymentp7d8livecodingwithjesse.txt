hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to deploy our app so if this is the first time watching just a little recap we are on day eight of a project we're building a web app game it's just a very simple math game to help uh children who are new at math learn addition and subtraction multiplication and division so we build out basic functionality really really basic ui and i'd like to actually deploy this so that i can start testing it with my kids and you all could check it out and play it um or give advice on what which should be the next set of updates uh without having to actually actually pull down the code and run it locally so that's the plan for today we're going to deploy uh before we start i just want to give a shout out because we had another pull request uh so uh seduce i'm not sure i pronounced that it's sidou so let me know how to pronounce that if you're watching or if someone knows how to pronounce that because i'd love to get it right um we had a pull request and it's a restart button so we didn't have a button once you won the game you had to manually refresh the page to go back now we have a restart button button which is a great idea so just want to go through this really quickly is to bring everybody up to speed on what's changed so in our app.js file we now have this handle restart function and that just dispatches an action okay and here's the actual button so just a normal react native button it even has the accessibility label which is awesome and when you press the button it just calls that handle restart function all right and then that triggers the action here in our reducer our appreducer.js and that's going to change our state at some point restart state so we have our mode and our operator so remember the mode is whether it's like multiplication addition you know whatever and then our operator is the actual sign uh that will appear in the ui all right so that's awesome i've already merged this pull request so if you're trying to follow along definitely do a git pull um update or if you forked update your fork uh because those those changes are now in there and that's what what we're gonna work with today uh and hopefully what we're gonna push so uh i see a lot of people are in chat what's up everybody um if you have any questions i'll get to those uh after our first break uh so it looks like there were some questions some of them got addressed by other members of the community here so i think we're good right now somebody just asked for a link to this repo it's in the description to this video along with some other links uh to some of the tools i use some of my social media accounts my youtube channel so this i try to put every link that you might want from the stream in the description so check there first if it's not there then you know by all means ask and i'll i'll put a put the link in the chat or put another link in the description i'm going to start my timer so when this timer is going this 25 minute timer i'm mainly just going to be focused on the code and i'm not going to glance over at the chat often once the timer goes off i'm going to go back to the chat and i'm going to try to get through as many of the chat messages i can within like five minutes and then we'll go back to the code uh today we might not we'll see i don't anticipate this work going longer than one 25 minute period and the rest can be for questions but you never know i could mess something up and it could take a lot longer so that if you've seen my previous streams then you know that messing stuff up is uh a frequent occurrence uh on the streams uh let me check i was just checking the stream health quickly before i got started i don't want to get into anything if you all can actually see what's happening all right so here here's our app right um i just want to verify like the things are working before we deploy so let's just go through a round and hit that restart button and then we can deploy um let's see oh you know what i still haven't implemented the enter key to be able to work here and i keep forgetting to do that um so if somebody wants to make an issue in the github repo about that right now then that would be awesome otherwise i'll try to remember to do it this time all right we got that one right i keep trying to hit enter i know it doesn't work all right so now cool it says victory and we have a restart button we can restart yeah and it goes back awesome now let's check out deployment so i don't know if if anyone remembers when we first started this project we did uh we used create react app and it's like in our package json this this might look familiar if any this is like the standard create react app package json the only thing that we've added really i think is react art and react native web everything else is exactly as it is normally in create react app so i thought hey we probably could just deploy this like any create react app app so i've gone to the create react app docs and i went to the deployment section and i'm going to scroll down and get to the some of our different options so you can see we can do azure there's firebase but we're going to try github pages okay so i i considered a few other options for deployment but i think github pages would be nice because it'll keep it all centrally located in github right now um and this is a nice feature like to demo because this costs nothing it's it's pretty simple and it's linked up to your your git commit so every time we push to master it will update our github pages so i think that's probably the simplest way to go at this point all right so a few changes we need to make we need to add this home page right to our package.json so let's just copy and paste and update a bit here so this we can we can add this wherever we want i'm going to add it in right here so we have a home page and this is i got to replace with my username so jessie r weigel and then the name of the app which is battle math i'm going gonna save that i'm i'm gonna double check that i named the github repo the same thing though too yeah battle math occasionally i'll have the project folder locally be named something different than the the github repo so always worth a double check okay so that's step one done can y'all see this font is it too small let me know if it's too small make it bigger you can also go here if you want i'll put the link in the chat right now if you want to check out these um these docs yourself so uh whenever you run npm run build you'll see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to github pages okay cool um but let's add our deploy scripts right so we're getting we need to add gh pages first of all so the it's a package right so let's go here to our terminal yarn add gh pages so we are using yarn instead of regular npm for this project so i i prefer yarn but regular npm is will definitely work all right cool so now you can see we have gh pages as a dependency and we need to add some scripts so we're going to add a predeploy and deploy which this is going to come out weird because of that plus sign but we'll deal with it let me get in there and just deploy okay i was just reading with this set down here and this is only for github user pages and not project pages so we should be good with just this this deploy script all right so let's add these i'm addies here at the bottom let's do that okay so we have our predeploy which dis runs our build right and then we have our deploy which will actually use gh pages and deploy i'm assuming build here would be trying to find our build directory right and final step deploy the site by running uh npm run deploy or in this case we can just run yarn deploy and since we set up that predeploy and everything i believe this will save us from having to um manually do a build first right so i think the way it'll work is if i hit deploy it'll run plea predeploy automatically first let's verify that make sure i save this yep and let's do yarn deploy yep so it looks like it's it's running the build first so now we can see we have a build folder that's appeared what it's doing here is it's going to take all of our components and everything and turn it into a set of javascript files right and so we could looks like it's done so we could check it out so you can see we have a bunch of these like settings files we have an index.html so this can run as a static website basically like you could spin up nginx and just point it to your index.html and it would work so all of our actual files that we made are now in our css and js and you can see they've been so we have our map files but we also have this which is minified javascript and this is all the stuff that we've that we've written uh but it's all kind of condensed down right and we can check out our css this is minified you know css it's all in one line right so that's all that actually gets pushed when you create when you when you use react it's just some javascript and css files just like like that um so it's pretty cool now we have another step on the github side of things so we need to um make sure that we enable github pages the the branch so we'll go into github it should already be yep already in there uh so let's go to the settings for this project so these are the the particular project settings not your your uh profile settings so i think it's on the main page here yep github pages all right great so it automatically did this uh which is awesome um that might be like the default now for some reason i remember like years ago you had to manually set it you couldn't just default it to that but i think maybe that changed or maybe i'm crazy and i'm remembering wrong but it seems to me like at one point this was necessary uh to enable that um and you could point um to different brand you can still point to different branches it looks like all right cool um that should be it let's double check in the docs here but i think that's it all right we don't have to worry about clientside routing at least not yet because we have no routing going on right this is all just one page the url does not change at all if you did have some routing going on it's a little bit more difficult to use github pages but not impossible okay we have no problem so far so we're not going to troubleshoot and that's it okay and you can see there are other options like if you want to deploy in heroku netlify now now was probably what i was going to go with if we didn't do github pages i love now you could check out like some of my earlier streams i i use it that's a great a great way to deploy very simple um s3 cloudfront surge i have you surged before i i usually use search for my presentations like my conference talks and stuff uh i always do my slides as react repos and i deploy them like with with search oh and you can publish to npm that's pretty cool i didn't realize that was oh i guess it's not built builtin functionality so you have to use a tool okay all right awesome now we should be able to go here and see our site alright awesome and you can see everything's small again because i didn't increase the size artificially but let's just test it out make sure it works um what's that 11 4 let's get one wrong cool 12. six all right awesome and we should be able to switch and get these crazy changes alright cool so now let me put that link in the there in the the chat and i also want this link to show up um on our github repo so let's go back in here and let's provide here our website right and we may as well give a little description there we go so now when anyone comes to our our repo uh not only can they see our code but they could click right here to get uh the actual app okay um so that's cool and i mean of course you can put any url you want there you're not limited to github pages um let's see okay we still don't have still i still haven't changed the uh the readme and let's add that issue that i keep talking about right here um so um add sorry what a terrible uh mistake to make on the keyboard if anybody caught that that was like those keys are right next to each other um add submit on enter enter key press okay oh cool wow related issues that's interesting yeah i'm gonna try that has anybody seen this this is a new feature github um will automatically try to find related issues so that you don't make like the same issue again in our small repo not a big deal but on bigger repos this is a big deal of people duplicating issues instead of looking through the backlog of issues so uh yeah i'll definitely try that that's cool uh i'm gonna submit that great all right so now we have two issues and let's see let's check our labels see if we can i want to label both of these as good first issues so they're both pretty pretty basic and help wanted okay oops i didn't i wanted to actually label them as help one and all right label help wanted there we go okay so i like to keep the issues labeled uh in the repos and that way people who come can see uh what issues i would actually want worked on if anyone's interested in working on them sometimes people put in an issue and it it may not be something that i even want in the project but this way everybody knows like yes i do want to help on this issue so it's it's up for grabs and also label these as these are good first issues they're pretty easy this one is involves no coding it's it's just um writing in english although if we want to have readme in different languages i'm cool with that too um and then this one is add submit on enter keypress so a little bit more code involved but this is a pretty common thing uh that we need done in react so um not shouldn't be a too difficult thing to to add in all right let's see sorry about the yawns again all right so here's what i'm going to do we've gotten that done without running down our timer so i'm going to go to the chat now and answer all the questions and we're going to see how much time we have left at that point and determine whether or not we want to code more or just save it for for the next stream okay uh let's see i'm scrolling all the way up to the top try to get through all the chat at this point so if you do have any questions you can put them in the chat now um i'll take you know any questions fine as long as it's not like inappropriate right um sohail wants suggestions for python courses um you know what the udacities udacity has some free courses along with paid nanodegree programs but their intro to computer science i believe is done in python so you would learn python syntax alongside of learning a lot of computer science concepts so i i recommend that we did have a question about like can i watch this even if i've never learned react native and yeah definitely it got answered by other people in the chat which is awesome thank you but just for anybody else who maybe is not looking at the chat don't worry if you don't know react or react native or even javascript or anything right ask as many questions as you need to a lot of this stream is just figuring out problems and figuring out problems is the same no matter what programming language you're using and really in this stream like we didn't even do any javascript stuff we we edited a package json file right this was deployment which in this case required no coding changes edwin says sup how's it going thanks for watching rabbitworks says what's up hey how's it going humberto's here how's it going let's see um someone asked what's this website uh yeah so if you didn't catch at the beginning there it's a game it's a a math game which now we we have it here a basic math game for children it's built with react native web which allows you to build and react native but run it as a web app in a browser we will do builds for android and ios later on too so those are coming and uh if we can think of something else to build to i'm open to doing that too i i actually do want to try out there's a way that you can do a windows 10 app um so i want to try that as well so there'll be more deployments to different uh platforms coming up joodle says i've never watched before so well welcome thanks for watching um there's some discussion about a windows forms app tutorial uh so my moon says anyone know the react and ask.net full stack tutorial um yeah isn't there one i thought there was a video that on on the free code cam channel here that came out like that uh umberto says there was a full c sharp project tutorial by i am tim cory but this his tutorial is for a windows forms app i don't know if you're asking something showing both react and ask.net yeah actually you can do a windows forms like app um and use a chromium embedded framework so there's it's it's called cefsharp cefsharp and you can basically point it to a url with your react app but run it as a windows forms app on windows so that's that's possible it would be like similar to what you can do with electron except you wouldn't actually have your app like packaged right it would be running elsewhere um there actually is a electron.net that lets you use dotnet i believe.net core but i'm not 100 sure but i'll let you use net and react or whatever javascript you want bundle it like an electron app and then run it run it on windows can you hack nasa for me no i can't and even if i could hack nasa i don't think i would do it because i'd get into a lot of trouble for that um we had a question about what what is a react native web app so since i just answered that uh i'm going to skip that question hopefully um so master asked that hopefully you caught the uh the answer there um akeem says this is first time watching welcome akeem thank you so much for watching um let's see rabbitworks says are you going to make this mobile friendly like what was the point for react native for just building a web app okay so like i i think i just mentioned this we're we're gonna do mobile apps um as well and maybe desktop apps so this is just stage one uh i think in some of the like the earlier streams like day one or day two i explained more about like why um why i'm doing it like this so if you want a fuller explanation then check that out there but yeah we're the web is just the first step for this project um umberto had tried to post a link to a net project uh tutorial and it got blocked so i just uh showed that link so if you're interested in that scroll up a little bit and find umberto's link it's it's now visible no face says how's it going you still need to improve the colors yeah for sure we need to improve the colors i know i said i would uh maybe be able to look up some color schemes but i i didn't things have been really busy at work and at home for those of you don't know i have four kids uh and they're all small so nine and under uh so i obviously am busy with that but also i'm in the process of buying a new house uh for my family so we're trying to pack up everything now and i'm talking with like banks to get a loan and a realtor and insurance people so it's been busier than normal i'm also trying to be healthy so i've been going in a couple days a week going into work early and working out at the gym there so i have less time than normal so i'm trying to keep up with the stream as best i can because i i think it's it's a really awesome thing and uh so i'm gonna keep trying to make sure i carve out some time for this stream but i don't have a lot of time to work on this project aside from my stream time run says hello from japan hey how's it going what time is it right now in japan uh dave asked does anyone know if these are recorded here yes they are so you can check it out all the videos of this project are in their own playlist i think it's react native web project playlist or something like that and then every live stream that i've ever done for free code camp is in a giant playlist called live coding with jesse and i also have other live streams and tutorial videos on my youtube channel the links in the description uh mustafa says udemy has some great python courses okay so i haven't checked out any python courses on udemy or udemy i don't know how you say that i've heard both um but i've seen some other good courses on there for other languages so that's probably a good place to check um dave says thanks for this jesse is this a series and uh for bass foundational idiots like me know nothing about react uh well don't be so don't be hard on yourself um yeah this series i i want this it is a series and i want this series to be as beginner friendly as possible um we work on stuff sometimes that's really beginner friendly and sometimes we work on things that are um more advanced uh but i'm always open for questions even if you have a question you think is just so basic don't worry about it i'd love to answer the question there are probably um a lot of other people that are have the same question either live or that we'll watch later so and it's good and it's a good opportunity for me to make sure i understand the basic stuff um as i explain it right and it helps me to realize what i don't know you know if i get questions i have no idea what they are then i know where there are like holes in my learning right so it's i love the questions and um if there's anything i can do to help for beginners like speak up i mean i want to make real projects so it can't always be beginner level but i still want to try to be helpful okay dave said there are also python courses in edx and coursera and free okay um miup all caps says uh is coding hard uh i'll say this it can be right um there are parts of coding that seem pretty easy and there are parts that seem pretty hard uh it it just kind of depends on what you're working on like and when i first started out a lot of it seemed hard now that i've been doing it for a while there's a lot of stuff that's easy but now there's even more stuff that i didn't even know about that is hard right so um that's i think that's cool though right there it's there's always a challenge in programming um so it's like anything if you want to be good at it you have to practice so i'm not going to say it's impossible it's because it's certainly not it's doable for anybody but it just takes work facundo says can you clean your room it's disgusting you can't even see it i have a bookshelf and some uh some tablecloths hanging up anyway this is my basement so this is not my room it's a corner of my basement right now so i am going to get a real office when i move um i'm going to have space to build an office so this is just temporary um let's see no faces how about have math questions moving down or across the screen and you must answer each question before they reach the edge of the screen that would be a cool mode i don't want that to be the base mode because um that's like an added level of stress for people who are just learning but i think that would be a cool like advanced mode we also we have people saying hello from just all over the world so i'm kind of just skipping those for time but i do see them and hello i appreciate it let's see um creative girl says hello is the free co curriculum uh the same as the free character and coke videos free code cam videos on youtube um no so the the curriculum is is different um it it covers a lot of stuff so basically like full stack web development is covered in the curriculum it is um i guess we should just go there right now so freecodecamp.org has this uh this curriculum so if you if you like kind of go through a little bit uh let me try to find one i wonder if it'll let me just go into one there we go so like in in a lot of the lessons it gives you a little instruction here and then you have a little spot where you can like type stuff uh and it will show up here right so you have like a code editor and then it live refreshes all right and then some of the later lessons you actually have um there's the projects running libraries so you'll you'll have these objectives user stories so you build it on your own using your own tools right but yeah they're not linked to the videos the videos could be helpful resources to learn how to do that but they are separate separate programs good question um the valerie i don't i'm sorry i'm messing up your name valerin says uh first time watching this uh thanks for watching and i hope you like it let me know if there's anything anything i can do to make it better um let's see it says how long will this video be uh we'll probably go for another i think i'm almost to the bottom something in like maybe another 10 minutes let's see um uh fakie says p7 stands for part seven um project seven all right yeah maybe i should explain that so the videos all have um this it'll have like to today's is p7d8 so that's project seven day eight so this is the seventh project that i've done on free code camp um live coding with jesse series and this is day eight so that's another good question so each project has its own playlist but also if if you were just looking at the big playlist of all the projects you could easily see which project and which day of the project were on um cuadwell says got four kids two bro i feel you all right you know how it is i love them i love i love kids i love my kids but four kids is um is a lot of work like i want to like i want to make sure i spend time with each kid every day so a lot of the time that i do have where i don't have to work um is taken up by that uh so it's just like yesterday i came home um and my twoyearold wanted me to read her a book and then my nineyearold has been doing some like really basic computer programming and building like minecraft stuff and he wanted to show me all the stuff that he did so i went there then i went back out and read my fouryearold a book um and then i um grabbed something to eat really quick as i was starving and uh then i went and sat down and helped my uh sevenyearold with her math homework and then at that point it was time to get them all ready for bed so i did all that so it's just um uh it's busy right like you just you know if you're trying to be a good dad and spend time with your kids like there's not a lot of time left for anything else but again like i love the kids like i love being able to spend time with them so um not a complaint just just the way it is um yo says uh hello what i miss um we deployed to github pages that's pretty much what we did today so if you want to see how that went uh you could always check out the uh the replay of this that will be available a few minutes after i end the stream uh majid says i'm studying unity 3d i want help please i don't know anything about that so i can't help you but if anybody else is watching um and can offer some help you know throw a comment here in the in the chat please mario says thumbs up for you thank you i appreciate that uh we have a question not sure how to pronounce that so uh but the question is hello can i pass my app and react js to react native is this easy it depends on how big your app is and how much you've done you can't there's not an easy way to convert react app to react native app as far as i know if it was a small enough react app maybe it would be doable um like i've i've done it but i've never done it with a fullon fully developed app right it's usually like at an early point in the project i make the switch so yeah it may be difficult to do it's not impossible to do but it may be difficult on mpg says um in terms of performance is there any bad side effect for running python node.js php or other as a service in the same machine um i don't really know i mean the more stuff you run on a machine like you're gonna have performance effect but it just depends like what are you running and how powerful is that machine uh the rasboy says is it open source yep yeah everything we do on the stream is open source so feel free to use it for whatever you want i don't think i added a license yet uh we should do that release making s let's make another issue for that and mit add mit license i'm a new issue all right now at least i won't forget to do that dave says wow you made my day i can't believe this is free plus my monthly donation to free code camp um that's awesome that you donate to free code camp so uh thank you for that but yeah everything free code camp does is is free hey nikki's here says uh good morning um or noon what what time is it where you're at everybody well where i am it's about um a little after 9 00 a.m um a user named donald trump says can you it's this is a hidden message so uh i guess i'll show it says can you help me here my son wants to learn it dm me on my gmail realdonaldtrump gmail.com thank you um well i i mean i need more details there and what what exactly your son wants to learn but let's see oh it says nothing is in display that's weird it make can everybody see what's going on i think i only got one complaint about it so let me know if everybody can see it uh donchi says uh it's 2pm in germany that's cool jeremy i had the opportunity to go speak at a conference in germany um at the end of so like in november maybe i think it was november i was in munich it was awesome um i really liked it there uh creative girl says i have a problem about the method of learning code what's the effective way just following tutorials learning on free code camp and knowing the whole curriculum from start to finish is boring yeah i doing the entire curriculum from start to finish you know i i didn't do that right so usually like you do some stuff on the curriculum you do some real projects you switch it up with some videos some other tutorials like that's the route that i went like i learned what i had to learn to get projects done because i was freelancing at the same time as i was learning right um so yeah i would say switch switch up your modes of learning whether it's tutorial uh like free code cam tutorial or video or a blog post a book you know whatever if you get too bored with one switch it up to the other you know that's totally fine sometimes you just need to work on a project you know and just like try stuff see if it works look at documentation right um you know do what you have to do to keep things like fresh for you um you know you definitely aren't you don't have to stick with just doing the curriculum all the time you know hopefully that helps answer your question a little bit uh let me know if it doesn't uh min says hola amigo hola let's see muhammad says sadly i have to go back to work is this going to be available later yes it definitely will be the recording will be available james says it's 4 p.m in kenya uh varun says when will the next project start uh whenever we get done with this one so i'm not sure i just depends on how this goes you know if if it gets fun and we start working on it and adding features maybe it'll go for a little while um if it doesn't seem like there's a lot of interest then we'll figure out another project to start and to work on it's it's pm in indonesia all right that's a huge difference um let's see is it difficult going from react to react native so this is from tom um no i don't it's not very difficult at all there's just a few things that are different um once you kind of get past those few things it's very very similar like your life cycle methods are the same the way state and props work is the same right it's most of the core react concepts are exactly the same uh nikki says what are your thoughts on google stadia from a technical standpoint i think it's awesome but i'm also scared for everything it means like you own nothing everything can be monitored etc actually wow i never thought about that that's a good point so yes so if you haven't seen google stadia look for it on youtube i'm sure there's a lot of videos about it but it's like basically google will live stream games not just like watching somebody else play but you can play the game as a stream in your browser so you don't need a powerful pc or the latest console to play the best games you know at high resolutions you just basically need something capable of streaming content so that could be a phone tablet television obviously a computer right i think that's awesome i think it is really cool that you don't have to put that big investment into hardware to be able to play but i didn't think about that idea that yes like you won't own any games so that does kind of stink although any more like you don't really have physical so many things are digital downloads now it's almost to that point i mean i know like technically you own it and you've downloaded it but i don't know for me mentally i'm like more used to that part but the idea too that everything is monitored guess that's weird i mean i do take it for granted like any game you play online can already be monitored but now i suppose like even an offline game would be monitored as well uh so yeah i didn't think about that so i don't know what i think about that because i just i have to think more on that um probably my gut reaction is like you know what like what i guess it doesn't really matter if google knows like what video games i play um but there could be some issues that i'm just not thinking about uh so yeah i guess there's good and bad to it uh let's see h s b e t e i'm not yeah i don't know that how to say that name but anyway says you're doing the lord's work man with a uh like a fist emoji so thank you i appreciate that um run says it's 10 12 p.m in japan i am sleepy but i want to watch this video all right that that might be the biggest time difference right 10 12 p.m yeah that's that's pretty crazy um dave says how many coffees have you had pre9am to be pumped enough to do this are you an early bird it's 12 13 a.m in australia wow wow that's okay so actually i haven't had any coffee so um like for for catholic people right now it's it's lent and during that time of the year like we we give up something um we it's been like a sacrifice right we give up so i decided that i'm only gonna drink water throughout the time period of lent so i actually haven't had any coffee i haven't had any coffee for weeks now and i love coffee and my wife makes espresso every morning and i smell it and it's i always smell it at work but it's a little sacrifice really like it's not compared to what a lot of other people do on a daily basis like it's not a big deal but it is hard in the mornings right like trying to get pumped in the morning is difficult normally i would have definitely had like at least a couple shots of espresso dave says what did you do jesse to get where you are from square one did you have a different career um like do you have a blog um etc so i do have a youtube channel and i do have some videos on that channel kind of explaining like how i got here so you check those out i think i have a whole video on like my path to becoming a developer so you get a better explanation there but like the short explanation is like i started freelancing um i have a business degree originally i had a couple of just kind of like jobs just to pay the bills right a manager at a fast food place a waiter um i was a high school teacher for a little bit and then i decided like i hooked up with um a friend of mine uh who had a media marketing business and needed someone to do some like freelance contracting work so that's how i got into the coding stuff and started getting my own clients um and then eventually got a fulltime job as a frontend developer and now i'm a software engineer so that's like the very short version of my story like i said you can get a longer version on my youtube channel uh links in the description to my channel um zelalum says how about java uh i haven't done anything with java so um sorry about that i'm not the person to ask about any java stuff um donchi says how can i get started to contribute to open source when do i know i'm ready you're ready when you get a pull request merged right like that's it you know don't try the worst that can happen if you submit a pull request is it doesn't get merged right so just if you see a project and you think like hey i think i can do this i think i can fix this issue just give it a shot try it right like so you don't get it merged like maybe somebody will be mean to you right hopefully it wouldn't happen but it's possible but that's bait that is the the worst thing that could happen really uh and that's not that bad so just give it a try maybe they'll come back and say actually could you fix this or that right and then hey that's awesome because now you're you're getting like some mentoring happening right um but give it a shot maybe you'll get accepted and then once you get that first pull request accepted and merged like you've contributed to open source you're an open source contributor so it's it's definitely a scary thing to get started it was for me for sure but i'd say the only way to know when you're ready is is to actually do it you know give it a try um let's see wired roach says it's 9 16 p.m in the philippines uh let's see do you have any advice for freelancing i'm not sure where to start but i really want that real world experience i'd say the best thing to do would be talk to people in your local area even like talk to family just let people know that you're interested you're interested in doing some work if you really really can't find any work anywhere you could always pick a company that has a terrible website redo their website without even asking them like just do a prototype and then show it to them and say like hey this is what i did or would you be interested in anything like that at the very worst they say no and you've gotten some good practice right um you could try some of those freelancing websites i have didn't ever really have that much luck with the freelancing websites but you know some people some people do um so that's another option but really like just trying to make those connections among friends family people in your community that will spread and then that like they'll tell other people like hey i know this person that can do this work and that's how you'll really start to get uh more freelance business uh i stay julian says do you know how to connect my sequel to json um i i mean i don't know what the official way to do it but i mean basically like if you had an api that would accept json and then save it to a mysql database like that's that's the way to do that you could pretty much do that in whatever language you're comfortable with so i i don't i mean like step by step i don't know like off the top of my head how i would code that but um that would be that would be my approach if i had to do that i would say like all right let's set up my sql backlink and connect it to an api that accepts json and then puts the data in the database right uh robust misconception says jokes aside how long will it be until web development is um fully automated uh actually will it ever be i don't know if it'll ever be but who knows right like trying to predict what will happen in the future is i mean just you're just guessing right um yeah so i don't think it's going to be fully automated mated anytime soon but will it ever be i don't maybe oh also i skipped one uh robust misconception says it's uh 1420 in north macedonia uh reacts uh is is react a bit hard to learn for the first time i know javascript but i'm not an expert i don't think react is actually that hard to learn um it's it's not like you pick it up immediately right it takes a little bit of work but i don't think it's it's too difficult so like don't be afraid to learn react it's it's pretty the concepts are pretty straightforward it's just a matter of like shifting the way you think about how to interact with the dom and once you understand like that you only ever change state and never change the dom directly then i i think it starts to like make sense um and it's it's easier to reason about so um but i'd say like you know only one way to find out how hard it is and that's that's to try it right um oh um nikki says in response to the question we had about um contributing to open source uh nikki says a good way to start is to contribute to documentation it's often overlooked and almost always appreciated especially in a friendly environment like the freecodecamp.org guide that is great advice for sure uh muhammad says just joined what are you doing um we're just doing some question and answer right now earlier in the stream we did deploy um our web app uh to github pages um so if you're interested in checking that out you can watch the recording later on um julian says is it possible to make a web in three days to make a website in three days yeah for sure it's possible um a simple website is is pretty easy to make it just it depends on what you need it to do dave says on scrimba tutorial i saw react but i'm not sure the benefit since it looks like javascript and html why learn another framework not joking just confused a little all right yeah that's a legitimate question so um react definitely has some benefits right it's it's um let's see it's definitely a very different way of making websites than just straight javascript and html for sure um like technically speaking there are definitely some performance improvements and things because of the way it actually handles rendering things in the dom uh it also allows for server side rendering like really easy so if you're trying to make a progressive web app or single page application it's a lot easier to make that search engine friendly with react than it would be like let's say if you made your own like javascript web app or even using something like jquery or something right so um there there are definitely benefits so i guess i'm trying to think of a resource that would list them i don't know about a resource right now and um but that is a good question like why another framework right um but yeah i would there's uh in general like i would say yeah like why why learn another framework that's usually my mentality too um but i do believe that react fills a it has a purpose and it makes making web apps a whole lot easier like i from from coming from making web apps with just regular javascript or a bit of jquery and html to then making web apps with react uh it's so much easier with react right things that were the source of a lot of frustration and bugs now like i don't even have to think about and it just works right really really simple all right uh ibrahim says hey i just did my first pull request on this project should i comment or something else uh to point to related issue um oh awesome yeah you can you can add it to an issue if you just comment with um like the number of the issue i think it'll automatically tag it um yeah i think it will uh but anyway that's awesome thank you so much uh so i'll um i'll get that pulled in soon or maybe i'll pull it in like live on the next stream but i definitely appreciate that um i think cozy thing cozy sorry if i'm mispronouncing that says getting uh advice on getting an internship as a frontend developer if i have html css javascript basics and es6 c some vam and some python um i would like apply so first of all like keep applying for internships but also try to like network and get um so if there's any conferences you can go to or meetups or events try to go to those try to talk to people that may be looking for interns right like let people know be active on social media like especially twitter and let people know that you want an internship so that's it i mean sometimes it takes a while and you gotta you gotta do a lot of you know trying to connect with people but that's that's definitely the way to go um nice nicely says sorry about the pronunciation says what do you think is the best marketing strategies to sell our web mobile app development service um i don't know i guess it depends like on what market you're targeting if it's just maybe like small business markets then you know you could like locally go to like um uh business groups like a lot of times cities have a chamber of commerce that a lot of business leaders are in sometimes you can convince the chamber of commerce commerce to let you speak at one of their meetings and demo what you're doing um you could just cold call a lot of businesses you know just call them up say here's my product can i get a you know can i do a demo can i do something right like um that's hard work it takes a lot but that that also is a possibility um you could think about doing targeted advertising right so those would be off the top of my head those are my my ideas but you know i haven't i haven't been in the freelance business for a while so i guess i'm a little bit rusty on like marketing myself and my services so i would definitely get another opinion too run says which is easier python or javascript um i don't i don't really know i mean python syntax is kind of cool because you don't really have a lot of special characters but i don't know if that necessarily makes it easier all right let me i'm going to log in real quick to my email for work to make sure i'm not missing anything important i'm almost done with the live chat here uh let's see daniel says amazing work jesse i'm almost done with the full stack track of free code camp what advice can you give to a nigerian looking for work in the u.s um i guess like just keep working on projects um definitely like work on your your written and spoken english for sure you're written english right because people won't um if they're looking at a resume or something and they see that the english is not exactly right like that might have a negative impact i mean it you know so just make sure like in terms of like the american style right of of writing right try to like match that because i do like i see resumes from people from other countries and a lot of times they're way different than what people in the u.s expect so like make sure that you look at like u.s type of resumes online and try to match that right because that can be a big turn off to employers if they see something really different and they think like you know doesn't this person know you're not supposed to do that or right so like i would say that would definitely be helpful like as a noncoding thing but in terms of coding like always be working on projects make sure you put it out on github open source if you can uh so that people in the us can see how good your your quality of work is and then you know just keep applying to like everything that you can think of don't be afraid to apply to stuff that you don't feel like you're qualified for you never know you you could definitely get you know someone could give you a shot um so just keep keep after it um karth karthikey says can i add mit license on your project um yeah for sure that would be awesome thank you uh fn cozy says does experience always count i am second year student doing software dev uh i have more knowledge of languages than personal projects experience yeah well i mean you got to think of it this way right like it's hard for a company to know your knowledge of languages it's much easier to be able to see someone's github portfolio or see the projects they did right so it's all about what can you prove to an employer so you need to have something to show your knowledge right so that's why the the actual projects and things are are important so um yes like you may get coding interviews and stuff but being able to even get to the point of having an interview somebody's going to look at your resume and they're going to want to see your projects and stuff before they even think about actually talking to you so try to make sure you do have projects like i know for me if i'm looking at resumes and i see somebody doesn't even have a github uh um github account at all like they don't even show it to me like i'm way less likely to recommend that that person actually be interviewed because i then have no idea if they really know what they're talking about right so that would be my advice is you know at least from my perspective that's what i look at it's like i want to see the code because the code is to me is the proof uh that you actually know what what to do um all right cool okay so i've gotten through all the questions so i'm gonna finish up now and uh get to work on some more react native uh for my my normal job and i'm gonna try to be back maybe friday with another stream i might have to go into work friday so i'm i may not be able to do a stream but anyway keep looking out on your notifications for free code camp i also put out messages on linkedin facebook twitter and instagram on when i'm gonna do a stream so if you like any of those social media you know give me a follow on there to be able to see the the messages about when i'm doing videos and stuff um you follow my youtube channel i do some streams and videos on there sometimes too uh yeah and if you like free code camp you know subscribe uh consider donating we don't charge for anything almost everyone that works at free code camp does not get paid it's volunteer um so anyway and if you think you'd like to contribute to free code camp in some other way other than donation then you know uh let us know you know um get a hold of uh quincy um or beaucorns if you want to do um youtube stuff so anyway have a great day thanks so much for watching and uh especially thank you to everyone who's submitting pool requests is much appreciated and very helpful uh so um yeah i'll see y'all next time bye
