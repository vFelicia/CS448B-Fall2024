hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse today we're going to continue on with what we were doing last week and that's adding routes and components to our react site and we're going to be creating some more graphql queries so a lot of the same stuff we'll have we'll have a lot of new content uh so i've been working on migrating some content over so i think i have maybe like four new custom post types and a couple of new taxonomies so um i'll try to do front end work on the stream and then do the data migration stuff on my own and that way we'll always have new new content to try to set up on the on the frontend side of things so i hope everyone had a good weekend and hey i see you on the live chat i um i was recently doing some reading about obs which is what i used to stream and i've changed the settings and i managed to get the cpu um usage down i think like by a third so let me know if the video quality seems okay i don't want to drop everything down too much i should still get 1080p and we shouldn't have any issues with stuttering uh and or dropping frames or anything uh so hopefully it all works out right uh but so far it looks like this is this would be the right setting all right so let me let me switch over to show my screen okay let's move this down a bit and increase the size here all right so just a refresher and also if you're new to the stream i break the stream up into 25 minute segments and i'll try to do some coding for 25 minutes and then i will take a five minute break go to the live chat answer as many questions as i can in that five minute break and then we'll do some more code and then at the very end i answer all the questions in the live chat so the streams usually aren't longer than two hours sometimes they're only about an hour but if you uh if you do ask a question please be patient and i will get to it eventually if you can't stick around you can always check out the recording all the recordings of these streams are available on the free code camp youtube channel all right cool it looks like uh you all have noticed that the fans aren't running yeah it's really quiet in here now it's amazing it's like i never really noticed how noisy it was until until now i can't hear the fans at all that's pretty wild all right so hopefully the audio is a little better for you all as well and i really i didn't even realize it was that bad okay so today let me all right let me give you i'm trying to figure out where we left off so we left off with department pages it looks like so here's basically kind of what we've been doing uh in case you haven't seen the streams or you missed some we create new pages right so we're using react and in particular we're using next js and next has its own routing system but we're kind of you know adding our own routing on top of that so within this pages folder we'll create a new page and then we'll also create a new query for graphql and we'll create a new route in our server.js file and once we complete that process then there'll be a whole new section of the site that'll be available to pull in content so we've already completed that for several sections so we have a section for faculty members a section for academic majors we also have a section now for academic departments so we're going to continue on today and some of the things that i brought in since then are we have um associates degrees which i don't think i'm finished bringing all the data so we might skip that uh as well as miners and we have institutes and organizations i think it's institutional organizations i just shortened it to institutes for api purposes and then we have some staff members i also brought in a bunch of videos as a custom post type but i can't really do anything with those yet i'm going to need someone to go in manually and sort through those and then assign them to a category so that we can pull them in uh to places where we need them so basically that's just like a youtube embed tag inside a wordpress custom post type all right so let's pull in let's see let's go with miners for now okay that's all that minor agreement yeah let's go with miners so the first thing that i want to do is i want to go to the current website and i want to check what the url is because we need to match that with our route wherever possible we're going to keep urls from the old url to the new one which i probably should mention for those of you who are new we're taking an old website for the university the main university website uh here at franciscan university and we're making a completely new website but we need to migrate the content and we want to keep the urls the same wherever possible alright obviously because i'm sure there's a lot of inbound links and things that will break if we mess up the url structure obviously would not be good for seo as well because i'm sure we'll still show up in a lot of search results for urls that are now broken and then as soon as the search engine realizes that we will drop out of the search results so it's very important that we double check these oops wrong site there we are see how long it takes today to load so from the load times alone it should be obvious why we need to build a new website wow and this website is actually hosted on campus so it's just maybe i don't know less maybe like less than a mile um maybe a kilometer i'm less probably less than where i am right now it's insane that it takes that long to get here uh okay so we need to find our miners undergraduate uh another thing that i'd like to do if possible is kind of you figure out where people are going the most and where people want to go based on analytics and then make those sections very easy to get to so we should have a section for miners there we are so let's check out our minor programs and see hopefully we have some consistency with the urls if not we may have to you know take another oh studies creek closed captioning not available hmm all right this is going to be tough so it's probably hard for you all to see what the urls just were because they're so small um let me all right i see you are asking for ngrok i already started the server i just forgot to paste it so here's the here's the link for the ngrok server you can click that and check out the site as we as we make it worlds asks what is is this what people call migrations um uh migration i mean we're migrating data we're moving the yeah i mean i guess we're migrating we have to migrate the data uh from one database to another so that we can use a different content management system oh goodness okay so let me explain to you what is messed up about these urls right now so here's all our miners like legal studies for instance is just franciscan.edu legal studies but then classical latin is franciscan.edu classics slash classical latin so there's not really consistency this one is kind of the odd one out because it's formatted like this all the other ones are formatted based on the the department um or the the major program this is probably the department oh no but so franciscan studies is just franciscan.edu franciscan studies all right this is going to be more difficult so i guess here's what we'll need to do for the ones that are just straight up like dot edu slash something we're gonna have to create their own routes to keep the url the same but then we're going to need to i don't know we're going to need to figure out an alternate route so we want to keep the old urls but then within the site we want to keep things really logical and clean so i'm going to need your help just thinking through this would it be more logical to make all the miners have let's say franciscan.edu minor slash classical latin or whatever or would it make more sense to have it franciscan.edu classics which would be the department name slash classical latin let me know if that question even makes sense at all to you and then let me know what you think i'm just yeah i'm just kind of wondering so i think we do we we are making the majors let's look at our our router for a second oops where are we at our server.js file here right now what we have going on is yeah so we have like these kind of routes for our majors but then we're also making a route and this will be kind of our new structure that we're going to encourage is major slash and then the id for the major okay so it looks like a few years saying to do department slash program is a better way to do things okay okay let's go let me go back here and and let's see classic streak minor okay the um the slug actually with some of them already says miner in it i think that's not a bad idea to keep it to keep the name of miner in there so just i just want to double check and make sure that these are linking to pages that's just for the miner okay good so film studies minor okay uh stephen says i can't get the ngrok site open is anyone else having trouble with the ngrok site uh let's see jeff said it opened uh on his phone but not on the workstation it could be the firewall all right let me know uh what's going on with that you try to copy and paste the link as well because sometimes um links with uh with youtube are are weird like in the live chat okay all right so i'm going to take one last check at all these suggestions before we actually create the route michael's saying we could do department and then program and then major or minor okay maybe we could yeah maybe we could do that let me let's see access biology department commercial theology classic social classes political science all right yeah so these are already categorized under department i suppose so for now let's go with um slash department slash and then we'll put the name of the the program the name of the miner okay yeah we'll do it like that and that will actually match up with the current way of doing things so that's okay for some of them we'll have to account for the the current url and then also direct things into the new system okay there's also maybe some changes um restructuring like departments and things so i don't think any of those changes will happen before the site launches but i guess it it wouldn't it would be almost a little bit of a waste to i suppose overthink this because it it's likely that it may change at some point this year um i like i don't know anything for sure but i've just heard that's a possibility so we may have a different organization i i would hate i i really wish that i could know for sure how that's going to play out before we made these because it could mess up the organization of all the academic stuff on the site but oh well we'll do what we need to do for now okay so let's go to our code and let's try to set up some routes here so i'm going to grab this for now and let's see department department list okay i see now what i was trying to do and i just never finished that okay um so what we'll need is um actually i'm not sure how i'm gonna do this all right let me let me think through this with y'all um so basically we need a double parameterized route so we would need something like i don't know id1 you know so it would basically like the department and then you know the id for the miner um but here's the problem with that we have you know this isn't the only place where we have this type of thing happening all right let me know if if anybody first like if you see the issue too or if i'm just like missing something big here let me think about this for a second all right i think i think we need to go back and just do do it like this and now it makes more sense why i did this with the major because i think that's really our only our only option so yeah there's just not i just don't know of a way to do kind of like a double variable here and to have that work out essentially because we're units we're dealing with a lot of different custom post types so like right now a lot of our pages were directing these two are very very similar but they're not always going to be similar they're going to have different things so it's like what would i direct this to would i have to keep i don't know lists of all the different names of the department so it's if one of these names is the department and then if one of these names is a minor then we send it to the minor route so i i don't know i think this would be it whether or not this is the ideal url i think this is really our only logical option at this point i i don't think it's for one thing it will keep our url shorter um yeah i we're just gonna we're gonna have to really try to make sure that all our urls can fit in in this type of thing where we just have like the descriptor like category and then we have you know with the the variable the parameterized route would be i think we can do that um let's see michael says uh the issue is that whoever initially set up the site didn't make a standard and have everyone stick to it yeah i mean that's that's kind of like what happened uh part of the issue too i think is at i don't know the full history and i didn't work with this site that much but there was some functionality that the site was supposed to have that then didn't have um and then various things just quit working during the time the site was there so some things were done that wasn't really part of the plan but it had to be done just to get pages up and i think that's part of the reason why there's so much weirdness also i i know there's been a lot of different people working on it student workers and things like that so it hasn't been hasn't been one person working on it and i guess there hasn't really been enforcement of a strict standard for things it's possible that reorganization has happened as well like maybe some things are categorized used to be categorized differently i don't know um nick says do you need something like a nested resource like slash department slash department id slash minor such minor id yeah actually would that work all right let me paste this in and see what you all think i think it's gonna end up making really long urls but you all let me know if you think it would be better so what if we had instead of minor id we would have department and then whatever the department name is and then minor and whatever the minor name is that might work i'm i'm not sure we could try it but i'm not even gonna try it if you think that's gonna end up getting ridiculous all right a few of you kind of came in and said hello hey everybody that just came in um all right i'm gonna give everybody just a few seconds to think about that and let me know hmm let me just put it in here for now and comment it out because even if we don't use it right now i do i like that we that that's a possibility if we end up finding a case where we have to do something like that what the heck is this trailing space is not allowed there we are um okay all right in any case what we can do right now is we can make a component and we can make our graphql query michael cruz says can't you override the actual url in the route um i'm not i'm not exactly sure what you're referring to um the the thing is so um i need wait how do i do this wait uh michael oh man um you just reminded me so the issue is i need to be able to grab the url as it currently is and direct it to the right place and if i can't do that then we're just gonna we're gonna have to break the urls and we can't do anything about it so essentially i need to be able to do this where it's like so i need to be able to do this and then i also need to be able to just grab and i mean i could always there's not that many miners so potentially i could just hard code what's in there i'd hate to do that but i i'm gonna end up with so many things hardcoded i just i don't really see any way around it especially when we don't have consistency with with urls tomorrow's film studies so this like i'm gonna have to have like stuff like this uh jeff says try utilizing the web server to do the rewrite for the incoming request i mean i i could well i think we're still going to have the same thing though is i'm going to have to have a ton of of rewrites so i mean whether it's here or whether it's in the web server which will be um well we're going to use nginx as a reverse proxy so either way we're just going to have to have a list all right all right so here's here's what i'm going to do so i will have this minor and then our id and then that is going to send it to the component that's minor but then we'll also have this sort of thing it's going to send that to the component that's minor but then we're going to manually give it the id of film studies well as a string uh jeff says i would put the rewrite rules at the web server side keeps this code cleaner uh harsha says maybe do those using a loop uh to save some time um we could how about all right so here's what i think about that one yes i'm definitely open to cleaning this up somehow loops or whatever to clean things up or potentially like what we probably should do at the very least is just get this stuff out of here and put it in a separate file i'm also open to redoing this in for for like nginx for now though i'm going to do them here just so that i can see what i'm i'm working with and then that way they'll at least be in a place so that later on i won't forget what i was trying to do so as long as we have one example or at least one example for each type of url that's currently being used on the site that should be enough we don't have to type them all out right now uh we just need to have one example make sure it works and then we can move on to the next type uh hey everybody i have a few people saying hi coming in uh den antonio dallet and inna hey how's it going all right so all right let's move forward so i think the suggestions are good and i think we should do them for right now though i'm gonna do it like this and then once we get a better idea of the scale of everything then that should give us um a better idea of like what would be the best way to clean this whole thing up and to do it differently so for now that's what i'm going to do i'm just going to try to comment things and make it obvious what what these things are so that when we come back we can easily see like all the the groups here all right so we have that route in there we need a component new file miner it's really possible that some of these like major and minor really don't need their own post types okay so this is actually i mean this component is done for now assuming that we're getting similar content that we do for majors that's done so if you want to check more of this out about what's going on uh check out the repo the links available in in the description of this video and now we'll go to the queries we're going to make a new file i'm going to say miner.js as a query and we can grab the major query and we're going to do the same thing here whoops did not copy that copy paste there we are and so now let's change this minor and then miners where name id content select okay wonderful all right so now we have our query uh what did i do i don't know what i did there and i messed it up don't save that put it there save that major one needs to be deleted okay let's make sure i didn't mess that one up all right that looks good okay so let me try this um so we should be able to go to minor and then actually i need to see what the slugs are for these um let's see greek minor what's our slug okay oops i don't think i restarted the server and i also don't remember exactly okay we did say minor okay um let's restart this do there we are okay cool so we have greek minor classics department little text here um some of the courses wonderful okay cool so our data is being brought in properly from our content management system which is wordpress we wrote a graphql query that's bringing in the data that we need and then we're displaying it with our react component here on the site okay looks good i mean it looks it looks adequate right it's super plain right now um but in terms of being able to pull the data that's good uh okay okay let me check two things one i never took my timer so i never started my timer so let me just check the time oh yeah i'm definitely due to go back to the live chat here all right so let me go to the live chat right now then the second thing i was gonna say is let me check the live chat so uh i'm gonna go to the live chat let me take i am going to start my timer now and i'm going to put it on five minutes and go through as much as i can on the live chat hey rowan's here burlings has finally joined after so long yeah i haven't seen you around for a while how's everything going uh world's asked is ngrok is the ingroup website the new website you're rerouting to uh the ngrok just uh yeah that's just a way for you to open the site on your machine and see what we're doing as we're doing it i mean you could go navigate wherever you want on the site inspect it in devtools and when i change something then it automatically would change for you as well um i'm scrolling through looking for a question there's a lot of comments about our routing options all right so michael's saying the loops don't scale well make an array and then do index of of the array okay that with harsh says with loops only seven to eight um lines can do the thing um niki's here hey how's it going says hey everyone just got back um from physio in english i think i'm not sure are you trying to say like your your normal like doctor's appointment stuff i think anyway welcome welcome back this person's handle on youtube is display block i like that um it says hello what time do you study to reach this level of coding um i have been i mean i've been doing this for like five years sorry ah oh i just got so drowsy all of a sudden um yeah so i it all it's so hard to estimate really it just depends on your situation like how many hours a day can you study um you know how good are you retaining new information you know what your background is before that there's just so much so it's going to be different for everyone i would say though if you're just getting into coding like don't expect to be able to do everything in a few weeks right don't don't get discouraged that's unrealistic expectations so you know don't think it's going to take you years and years to get you know good enough to to build anything meaningful you know but at the same time um you know be realistic uh so i guess there's like two two different places you don't really want to be at you don't want to be you know thinking that you're going to learn everything really fast and then get disappointed when it doesn't happen and then you also don't want to be thinking that there's no way you'll ever be able to do it right so be realistic with that i mean i i i see both things with like you know people that ask me questions is you know some some people expect like i'm going to be able to do everything right away and then some people are like you know i've only been coding for you know so many months there's no way anybody will ever hire me right i don't think either one is really true uh so just kind of you know be realistic about that but in terms of your specific question i it's it's really nearly impossible to give a timeline for how long it would take to get to a certain point all right harshet's giving some examples of things that i could do to clean up that code for all the routes so thank you for that um no life says hi how are you uh not bad not bad how you doing all right i only have just a few more things in the live chat so even though my timer went off i'm gonna answer a few uh just so i can get everything in here before we start up with coding again um the the lathe says do you have eslint setup and in that case which rule setup do you use um we follow standard js i think we're using that's what we usually use for the project so the standard js rules andrew says how do you get started on big projects like this i'm looking to get into react how do i get started um i don't i we just you start like you start every project and you just keep you break it down into small chunks and then just keep going every day and getting things done um that's that's about it uh stephen says jesse how often do you use loops like for if 4h in your job um we use loops a lot uh sometimes i don't use like a for loop as much and i'll try to use like a dot map or something like that or filter or sort if i can i like using those better uh stephen says i'm spending a lot like a lot on javascript loops and i worry that i won't use it to the level that i'm working with it yeah um hey being able to do loops and having that concept down i mean it it's important uh you will probably use loops or something like a loop frequently uh steven's asking about dot map yeah i i really do think dot map is easier to write it i don't know like for i don't know if dot map is easier to reason about i mean when you can see like a for loop like you can see the how it's gonna increment in things so i don't know it uh it might be easier to see how it's how it's gonna work but once you get familiar with map and um like filter and things like that i do think it's easier all right nikki says those array helpers are all things you can do with a basic for loop they are just written shorter your understanding of the basic for loop will surely help yeah i agree i completely agree i think that's a good answer all right last question then we go back to the code anna says how often do you visit the gym uh i actually have some workout equipment in my basement at home so i just do that i haven't been to like an actual gym and i don't know maybe it's been over a year i think it's yeah it's definitely been over a year um so i have i have an exercise bike i have like a a bench you know bench press some weights some like free weights and things so um i could do like a full body workout um so not quite as as nice as having like all the different options that you have at a gym but it's definitely convenient to be able to just you know roll out of bed and go right into uh right into a workout so for now i i really like that i mean it i can actually get into there's a gym on campus here where i work uh so it's it's pretty nice they have um you know all your standard stuff you'd see in any gym and um it was like rack i used to go and play racquetball before work with a coworker of mine um but then i heard my wrists so now i'm like i don't really think that's a good idea uh for me to do but um anyway so i don't really go to the gym but i've been working out every morning for the last two weeks so today officially is um is two weeks so i'm really proud of that before that i hadn't worked out for a really long time it was just really sporadic like i work out maybe a few times a month here and there um but anyway let me go back to the code and all right so we've basically proven that the concept here works and it works with our new route let's make sure that we can also make it work with um have so like the old route will still work all right see and it says that that is nice keep training thanks i appreciate that i'm like i'm scared though that if i miss my workout once like it's just gonna throw me off so i'm really like i've been trying to go to bed super early so i know i can wake up and work out i mean i know it's going to happen eventually i i probably i can't keep this up forever but um for right now i at least want to build that habit i want to keep it up for like at least a month and then hopefully it's enough of a habit that i won't you know be easily um you know thrown off all right i'm gonna copy this route and paste it in just to test and make sure that this works and see film studies i have to double check to make sure that that's the right slug so if this doesn't work i'll check that all right yeah it's not the right slug let's let me go back here i have wordpress open on my other screen so i can check the routes film studies there's this slug film studies minor all right so this one is film studies minor and i'll probably need to restart this huh there we are okay yeah so that works so we can use com arts film studies and that should work for us and then we should also be able to do minor slash film studies minor all right great now what we can do at some point is clean up those slugs in wordpress so that it doesn't say minor on the end if we don't want it uh so we don't actually have to you know have minor here and then minor at the end because that's a little redundant i don't think we need that so that can that's something though that i could have someone else do even if they don't know about coding i could just you know give them some instructions and say go through all of them and do it like this so i'm not going to do it right now let's see all right so let's go into let's see let's check out a let's see another post type okay you know what i i do um i want to do this so let me see programs all right here's what i'm gonna do i'm going to grab this because this is going to be almost exactly what i want to do for these programs okay so whenever this associate degree programs and right now let's check this out and go to associate degree program so our url then is let's see what our url is going to be waiting just waiting okay oh goodness academics ug associate are there really no links for these programs oh they just have them within here but this is a okay all right so these links are also not standard all right and there's not a separate page for this associates degree it just links you to the main accounting page so there may not even be separate pages for associates programs yeah there's no separate pages okay there we are here's a separate page for an associate's program all right so we may we may only have one actual page for associates programs who okay so wow these um these routes are going to be the hardest part of this whole thing i think okay so we'll do for the associate degree programs for now i'm going to i'm just going to leave this as associate and we're gonna have this as associate but we may not even need this if there's really only one page uh i don't know if it's worth it although i may we may think about like okay well shouldn't we have a separate page for each associate program so i'll have to talk i don't handle content um and i don't really want to handle the content so i have to talk to my boss about that and see what he thinks for that that might be something that gets added in so i'm going to leave it in here for now and then up here let's say we're going to say associate here and then i want to take this to the associate page as well and then i want to give it the id of um let's say home remain let's give the idea of maine uh so i i was been thinking about how to do this and one way so we have a situation where we'll have let's say here like departments so the slash department i want to just have a list of all the different department pages so that when you go slash department slash id you can get to those pages so my original thought was okay i'll have it say when it slash department i'll send it to an entirely different component right meaning department list which will work but let's say the components are close enough that we don't really need two components so i thought why not try it like this and just manually pass in the id main and then make sure to say okay if the id is main then do this and then we'll make the slug in wordpress match so we'll make the slug say main being the main page so i'm going to try both different ways just to see maybe if there's some issue that i'm not seeing but this way we'll cut down on the number of components that we need to make and like as long as the components are are going to be very similar then this works if we need minor changes between you know how one of these pages display versus the main page we can work that out within a component if it's major changes then it might make more sense to have two different components but right now let's let's test this out so let's save that i'm going to go into wordpress here and i guess i can do this over here so everyone can see so i've just gone in this associate academic programs uh text which is right now the only piece of data that we have in here and i click so that to make the slug visible and i'm going to make the slug main which should be fine and won't mess up anything in wordpress because it's it's under the associate programs and then main so we don't have a program called main so this should work and not conflict so now that that's main we should be able to get this and we're going to need to make a new a new query i wonder there's probably a way that we can clean this up and not have so many different queries as well but i'm gonna wait and that can be uh some you know kind of an optimization that we do later on if we need to so for right now let's make a new query new file and let's call this associate dot js wonderful let's go to minor oops minor query and associate.js and now let's just change things to associate okay let's save that and let's also make a page so this is just the component and we'll take what we did here with minor and let's put it here so we need to change every instance of the word minor and make it associate and let's make sure we're getting our capitalization correct all right so what will happen is we go to the url the id part of the url will get passed into here and then that will be available to pass on to the query we'll get the data back the data will be stored in props and then the data will be used to render this component if you want a more thorough explanation of how that works you can ask me the live chat or you can go back and rewatch some of the streams that we did earlier on uh towards the beginning of project five and i i do go you know in a lot more depth into you know how this works alright so we need to restart our server because we change some routes in our server.js file and after that starts up we will be able to go to associate oops let's make sure i did that right all right so we do have associate we have this associate query and we have this let's see if i did this right on the server city you know let me see how what i i made this in wordpress so i think it was more than just associate so here's our custom post type in wordpress and i believe i made it associate program there we are associate program so in our query we need to look for associates program i think like this i think that's it i guess we can double check news all right well let's give it a shot no programs hmm all right let's check i don't think i can use a hyphen here no i can't all right let's see did i never restart my timer no i didn't i'm just gonna have to keep an eye on the clock uh so i'm gonna work on this for just another few minutes and then i'll go back to the live chat so it's saying cannot reproperty edges of undefined so if we see in our component here see edges here it's saying there is no data for associate maybe that's because it's supposed to be associates um associate program there we are all right that was the whole point so here's my problem so i had well two problems one i was trying to get data under the name associate and that's not the name that i had saved the data under uh and i was trying to do that in two different places so i just had to change it in both places and now i can get the data here's how it's coming in for us so um i'm not thrilled with how that looks especially like the main headline here is smaller than all the sub headlines but i mean it's in at least we're getting the data and it works and it has oh no it has weird stuff like this so the um this is taking us to maine.aspx admissions main.aspx so i was hoping that most of the links would work but links that have.aspx at the end are obviously not going to work i didn't realize that was a thing happening on this site so definitely have to address that that just might be that'll be a thing that either i can find like one thing to go through all the database and remove that or maybe i can write something that'll remove it as we import things or that'll just be something that as we're testing the site and as we go keep going through every time we find it i'll just have to change it or have someone else change it in wordpress okay so the idea though is that you have each of these and then a page for each of these and when you click the link it would take you to associate slash and then let's say theology and then that would show you the associates in theology page but you're just a slash associate page would have your list of everything and we're gonna do a similar thing for the majors for the miners for departments you know anything that would make sense to have a list of everything first which is gonna be most of the sections we're gonna do it like that looks good i'm going to go back to the live chat now and even though i forgot the timer i think we're basically staying on about the same time frame that we normally do so i'm going back to the live chat right now i'm going to try to answer all the questions that are in there so if you have a question please put it in there now and if you don't want to stick around for the question and answer that's totally fine i'll see you tomorrow if you can stick around though i would appreciate your help in answering the questions uh most of the time you all have great answers uh much better than than what i can come up with okay michael asks can you set up a database with department program degree type um were we at that point were we still talking about routing just to be able to i guess grab those or i mean i guess it's possible michael says you or one of the students is going to have to hard code some stuff you're gonna have to deal with it yeah i mean uh yeah that's just the way it's gonna be i mean eventually who knows maybe after a couple of years all the links will be or at least most of the links will be switched over to a more sane system but i i don't know for right now we just got to cover it and try to get as many links as possible to work michael says you really should only need three queries department program degree type uh then branch out from there hmm yeah i'm wondering i'm thinking about that there there's there may def be a much better way to handle this data it's not going to be ideal i mean unfortunately i in migrating the data it right now the data is not organized in in a way that makes it easy to find stuff um so that makes it kind of difficult when i'm trying to bring it over but then also i'm bringing it over into wordpress i want it to be set up in a way that it's like makes some sense so i'm making everything as custom post types so that whoever's editing it can quickly see like oh okay it's the major custom post type that's where i put stuff for majors so i'm not sure how i could set it up differently to follow that hierarchy the other way potentially could be set up a different server a graphql server that i don't know organize things differently i have to think about that i mean right now i do have a category i say the problem with the way that things work with wordpress is like i can't grab i don't think i can grab multiple custom post types like with one query i'm gonna have to look into that i was reading some issues on it on um on github anyway i agree that this is not ideal this is just kind of we're making it better than it is now but it's not probably like the most ideal way to organize everything uh michael says i might not know much about react wordpress or bjs ninja but i do know about databases i just think that way all right that's cool i don't know a lot about databases so any advice you have for me in that area is is definitely welcome michael says not sure why you are so worried about major slash minor um i mean i'm not it's not major minor in particular it's just kind of in general like the way things are happening with the urls on major and minor are also happening i mean that's just kind of the way things are across the the site so it's not that major minor is so important it's just that the way we're going to have to deal with this everywhere is definitely important and i want to be consistent so that's kind of why i try i'm putting so much thought into it now because whatever i decide we need to use that going forward if i change my mind later then i'll have to go back and redo it which isn't a big deal except that you know we need to get this launched in like a month and february is a short month so we're missing out on a few days okay uh i've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so i think i think underwraps savage banana says you cutie jesse thank you i try i've been uh combing my beard lately so i'm glad you noticed my beauty so um all right so i'm going to get back to bringing more data over and the more data i bring over the better picture i have of what we're dealing with so questions like how we're going to deal with um like moving you know how to deal with urls and organize things so i'll have a better idea of what what we're dealing with um savagement says it's laughing say yeah the death the death side of the beard uh all right i i really enjoy doing these live streams with you all um yeah so i should be back tomorrow probably around the same time i don't think i have anything conflicting on the schedule and we'll be doing some of the same work uh same work tomorrow so it's gonna be a lot of the same for a little while and then depending on how much data we get moved over how much we get done then maybe we can move on making it look nice optimizing things refactoring and testing lots of testing as much as we can all right well i'll be back tomorrow until then have a great day
