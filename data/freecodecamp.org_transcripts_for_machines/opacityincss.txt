did you know that in CSS we have a property to adjust the transparency of the elements yes it's called opacity opacity can take values between zero and one zero means that the element is completely transparent and one means that it's completely opaque here you can see how the opacity values change what the circle looks like we go from totally transparent to totally opaque this is very helpful when you want to create multiple layers of elements and only display them when certain conditions are met or even create nice effects when something happens on the browser for example we can make the element appear more transparent when the cursor is on it with the hover pseudo class and transitions
