I want to begin this video by reviewing our definitions of the union and intersection after that I'll be introducing two algebraic laws for sets so the definition of a union b equals set containing elements X such that X is an element of a or X is an element of B also a intersection B is defined as the set containing elements X such that X is an element of a and X is an element of B so when I in introduce the inm poent law it should be clear that a union a equals a because a union a is defined as the set containing elements X such that X is an element of a or X is an element of a which should yield or you should see why that equals the set a also a intersection a equals the set containing elements X such that X is an element of a and X is an element of a which it should also be clear why that is the set a um next we have our identity laws so identity laws are U laws where we have a given set and we're performing an operation on that set with a given element uh these elements are the identity elements so for this case we have the null set and the universal set are our identity elements so a union null set equals a and by definition that means that a union null set equals the set containing elements X such that X is an element of a or X is an element of the null set but since we know that the null set is empty we can't possibly have any elements in there um so it's really saying that a union the null set is equal to the set containing elements X such that X is an element of a or more simply uh it equals a
