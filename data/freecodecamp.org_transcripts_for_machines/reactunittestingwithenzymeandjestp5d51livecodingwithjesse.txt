hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse and I'm Jesse and my beard decided not to stream with us today oh I have a face I forgot what it looked like anyway today we're gonna do something that is very new to me and that's unit testing so if you've seen a lot of the streams then you'll probably remember me admitting this several times and being called out for it that we do have testing setup I just don't write the testing oh no noble noble and Savage is gone now they were only here for the beard I guess oh whoa my coworkers thought I should just shave half a beard that would have been the best of both worlds I guess maybe I'll try it let's try it next time it shouldn't take me too long to grow a beard again that's probably a month and I can get it nice and bushy again but my wife's really happy about it so she'll be happy I just hope my kids recognize me sometimes the little ones like they freaked out a bit if I shave my beard so we'll see you later on when I go home see I was gonna say something was I gonna say oh I have a lot of updates so I've been working on the site so I didn't stream the last two days I work from home the last two days and to be entirely honest with you I was feeling pretty depressed I haven't worked out in a while and I I just was feeling depressed and when it like that it's really hard anybody has depression you know it's really hard to interact with people and do things so I would just think like okay what am I gonna do what am I gonna stream about today and I just couldn't think of a topic to stream about and the time just ticked by and I didn't I didn't do it so today I had to come in for meetings I got a haircut so like it was I did things today that helped me to feel better and so anyway I apologize for not streaming I I could have found time to stream but anyway hopefully I get back on my workout routine and kind of get back to normal with things tomorrow I think I'm going to do a stream but it's not going to be about this project tomorrow will be we're gonna work on so Alex Castillo and I are gonna work on a braincomputer interface with JavaScript so we're still trying to get the headset that I purchased working so we're working on like that connection with how to take get the data from Bluetooth and get it into a format that we can use you know Java scripts to do things with basically so we'll see hope hopefully that'll go well I haven't decided whether I'll strain that on my channel or on free code camps channel if you're interested in that please subscribe to my channel the links down below just so you don't miss it I haven't really talked to Quincy about whether or not it's cool if I do that on free code camps channel so we'll see I'm sure he'd be ok with it all right but enough talk let's get to the code and I haven't taken my G fuel yet so I accept GQ and coffee so I'm gonna be switching off as always G fuel I'm open to a sponsorship deal and I mean you need to get on this there's 28 viewers you know G fuel you're missing out and also my Elle Fanning which is supposed to help with brain function and stuff like that so now that I've properly enhanced my brain with these things let's get started yeah Nikki the beard is gone yeah I do want to say what's up to everybody in the chat I see a lot of you are saying hello no boom seven says I can see why your wife snagged you though I always appreciate your comments that they're always very entertaining one question I do want to address so Siberian says do I have to watch the other projects to be able to follow along with this one no you do not so the projects are but you don't have to watch one project or the other so I try to do a good job of starting from scratch each time and yeah and actually the first projects may not be the best to watch anyway because they'll be some of the stuff's outdated you know they've come out with new versions of the things that we used so I don't want to say they're entirely useless because we do cover a lot of things that are pretty standard and don't change but if you had to pick to watch something I'd say watch the newer whatever the latest project we're working on it probably the best to be able to get you know the information that you could use immediately to help you in your projects Ryan says add row' I don't have a dural I've never tried at a row I've heard things about it but I've never so okay I did want to show you all that I made a playlist for this project and I know a lot of you have been requesting this for a long time and I haven't done it is just pure procrastination I could have made time to do it just wasn't a priority for me so I finally did it so now you can see all of project 5 videos and I put it so that project the day one shows up first and it goes in order like that I think this will help for new people who want to watch them in order so for those who have already seen them and want to see the latest one it'll be a little odd because you have to scroll down but the latest one comes up like on the front page of free code camp anyway so it should be too hard to see that so anyway this is now on the playlist I'm still gonna keep that long playlist that has all the live coding with Jessie stuff in there just people are probably used to that I'm sure some people you know have saved that playlist so anyway I have it set up that it so that it should automatically add the videos to this playlist every time I do a new video so but we won't forget anything everything should be there so I'm gonna see after I do this video if this stream that we're doing now automatically goes there not hopefully it does but that's one project I think I have a playlist for project four and I want to get the other project soon so everything will have a separate playlist and we already have this is will be video 51 for this project this is insane a lot of videos Nikki sy no YouTube dark theme for for this YouTube thing I'm on the free code camp account and I keep it with the light theme I don't remember why I didn't there was some reason why I kept it with the light today maybe so I just tell it apart because and so this is in chrome and Chrome Canary I'm logged into my own YouTube account and that is on the dark so it does help me because I don't want to accidentally like reply to comments as free code camp and stuff like that so helps me keep it straight but I'm gonna close that since we don't need that anymore and see let's go brian says add row' helps him a lot I now let me know if I'm wrong on this but you normally can't get a duro unless it's prescribed for something correct I can't legally like I can't just get out at all to say like hey I want to you know stay up and do a lot of coding right I my pharmacist wouldn't be cool with that it's unit testing that's right oh you know what before we do that let me make sure I start up and grow up and give you all the link so we won't necessarily be doing that much with it in terms of like any frontend stuff actually changing but you could maybe see some of the changes that I've done on the site and you know mess around with a site on your own someone that's why are we talking about adderall uhhuh it just got brought up so anyway yeah so I don't brian says you have to have a TD or ADHD I don't have either one of those so I guess adderall is not for me I'm really sorry I'm having trouble with this name but presume is law I'm sorry let me know how that's pronounced because I'd really like to get it right but anyway they asked have you ever used docker for your projects I tried using docker oh maybe at least a year ago maybe maybe almost two years ago and I started to work with it and then I had some projects come up that were like tight deadlines and so I I just kind of set it aside because I wasn't good enough with it yet that I could do this project and I never picked it back up I'd really like to learn more about docker and use it but at this point my doctor skills are not good enough for me to you know work with on a you know real project ok so let me give a very quick summary of what I did what I've done in the last few days you can always go to the github repo links in the description and check out the last few commits to see what I've done inside the matrix as your vs code as an update autumn alright cool I'm not gonna run the update right now just you know for time reasons I mean usually they're really fast but I just I just kind of want to get started but thank you for letting me know I will run that update maybe later okay so I've added this Travis fought what was a gamble that's how you say ready for YAML files the mo file anyway I've added this in here if you're not familiar with Travis look up Travis CI it's for continuous integration basically it links in with sorry it leaks I got distracted reading the live chat it links in with github so that every time we push code to github it runs before that that commit actually like goes through so it's kind of another layer of checking right because you know potentially it wants I'm really the only one committing so it's maybe a little bit of overkill right now but I wanted to have that that extra layer as a safeguard but then also because we did that we were able to we have Travis we're able to hook up what was it green keeper so green keeper is a it's a green keeper bought something like that green keeper will look at our package JSON file and anytime there's an update to one of the packages we have in there it will either auto update by automatically submitting a pull request with the update or if if it's really out of date and in Mike hello just like breaking changes then it may just kind of alert but that way we don't have to keep up with all the updates ourselves will automatically get pull requests with those updates so I had to use Travis to be able to do that I mean it probably didn't have to be just Travis I'm sure other systems like Travis little works but we had used I'm using Travis on a side project so Harshit who's in the live chat frequently but it's too late in this time zone to watch right now and he's done a lot of work on these other project he set it up in the side project so I just kind of took what he did and tried to adapt it so basically I have the unit test running but I don't have the endtoend test running so I ran into some issues with the endtoend test mainly due to trying to run a headless browser with Travis and I decided that it's not really important right now and I needed to just move on and get some stuff done so we're gonna go back to it and at some point but for right now I thought you know what we don't they have test coverage on all of our components like not even close so if we're gonna have this setup let's write some unit tests also how to request from somebody on Twitter about doing unit tests so said all right let's do it so that's what we'll be doing today and what else that out I'm sure I worked on some other things that I'm forgetting I I know I did a lot of work on the the router adding new routes making sure links work so there's a lot more pages that work now cleaned up a ton of data on the WordPress side of things just kind of combining things that were all separate that didn't need to be separated making sure the slugs were were correct so doing a lot of that kind of work which is not really fun it's just really kind of timeconsuming it needs to be done so I don't really like to stream that that kind of stuff okay so let me let's first just check out some of the tests that we have right now so I'm gonna get rid of some of this stuff we are going to use enzyme and jest so as far as as I know from what I've looked up the last few days on unit testing okay we have a question about explaining what unit testing is I'll do that right now let me start my timer there we are so 25 minutes of code then I'll go back to the live chat and answer questions so a unit test especially in the context of react would be like you're testing one component all right or you won if it wasn't react you could test like one function right so it you're not having this entire page and then you know rendering the whole page and seeing how it works you're just saying like okay like I'm gonna if I give this component these props this should happen and the test just checks to make sure the that actually happens so for each thing that you had each component each piece of a component you want to write a test ideally the way you're supposed to do it you write the test first and the test fails and then you make the test you write you change your code so that it passes the test so you think about what are all the things I want this code to do you put it all into the test and then you know your code is good once it passes all the tests and you make sure you have test coverage because you you test you grid birth to test first now we've already done a lot of code without testing so we're gonna have to go back and write the tests usually when you do it like that your tests aren't as good but that's where we're at so maybe moving forward we'll start doing tests first you know at first when we started this project I was on a much tighter timeline and then things changed and now I have more time so now we can work on testing so let's see what tests we have first since I have having index page open here so let me let me make some space and open this page yeah that's not what I wanted to index all right so here's the test that we have for the index page and now this is not a complete test this is just the start of of the test that we have so oh I didn't explain what just an enzyme is so just is a testing I don't we call a framework a testing tool I believe Facebook created just that's what if I remember correctly I think they did enzyme is created by a different different people created it so not Facebook but it is recommended by Facebook for testing react so enzyme can enzyme makes testing a bit easier and it can work with different things so you don't have to use it with jest you can use it for different things alright cool Aniki says enzyme is airbnb awesome Thank You Nikki that is that is correct I do remember saying that I was on their their github repo yesterday all right so you can use enzyme with a lot of different testing frameworks so we're gonna use it with Jess today but it's not just just so I I really am not familiar enough with it to tell you all the details about why you want to use enzyme I read and watch videos about it yesterday but I didn't retain everything so I'll just take you through this basic one first so we describe right so we're saying index so the component index which is this whole component right so index should render right it should render all right we have our little arrow functions here if you're not familiar with arrow functions like it's just pretty much like a regular function for for our purposes right now it's it's pretty much like a regular function so if you see this weird error thing just think somebody's putting function making a new function so it should render this cost repair render index expect wrapper I didn't write this that's I'm just trying to figure out going on what's going on so what does this mean are we just rendering it renders a component called index are they really that basic so I guess we're just testing whether or not it renders period like does this component render at all so I mean this is the most basic of test we need more than than this so we're gonna try to pick some piece of this and add it now we have pieces like this like here oh that's its own component like we can write a separate test for that component so what I'm talking about a piece I don't mean a separate component I mean you know something within here that's not within its own component which it looks like everything else is in its own component okay um do we have any special stuff going on no we don't do it Wow all right so we do need to make sure I guess that some things are rendering right Neela says how about using shallow instead of pure render yeah you know what I was wondering the same thing if we can just use shallow render I don't see why we need to use regular render here everything that I saw it was saying to use the shallow render so let's try that out shallow hmm okay so render do we have to replace this with shallow okay Nikki says then expected with to match snapshot yeah okay all right so we've got a lot of chat about all the differences now in the live chat so I mean I may wait and hold off and go over that after our 25 minutes here which it may not be a bad idea to bring up the basic documentation for this as well so let me get that I'm gonna get that ready on my other screen and then if I think it'll be useful I'll pull it over and share it with you always whoa oh my I have a bunch of windows open with just an enzyme resources on my laptop I'm currently on my my iMac so I don't have any of the same stuff okay now's a great time to mention that this is me doing my regular work and it's a totally don't prepare things ahead of time because I want you all to see my mistakes too so that also means that I frequently don't have the the links ready all right so I do have something useful so this is cool right away it says shallow rendering renders only the component itself without its children so if you change something in a child component it won't change the shallow output of your component or a bug introduced to a child component won't break your components test it also doesn't require the Dom okay so that's the difference which is actually pretty good I think that I like that right because if there's an error in a child component but it doesn't nestled all the components I'd rather just have that child component fail the test and not the main component anyway so that makes a lot of sense I like this for sure let's see is the difference okay icon component okay cool so it doesn't actually render out the components this is awesome so this is what I kind of like the basic test that we can do or let's look at all the components that are supposed to be on the index page and let's make sure that they're actually there alright so here's some snapshot testing oh cool here's some cool stuff why Jess why enzyme let me just paste this link in because I'm not gonna read through a page on the stream but I will put the link in there so that'll answer a lot of the questions that I just saw on the live chat about why would we use just an enzyme Oh even has you know how do you set it up now we already have it set up in the project so I'm not going to go over that and I someone else set that up so I'm I'm definitely not the one to tell you how to set it up there we are so now let's just write some basic tests and so this for most non interactive components our index page realistically is is pretty non interactive we don't have anything going on that responds to user input at least not yet oops yet nikola says the links of 404 try copy manually copying and pasting the link there's there's something weird that happens with links in the YouTube chat okay it's night remember too much snow shot just all right I think I'm gonna move this over to the other screen so I can go back to the code and still see this so at least on this page on our index page I don't think we'll need to test events but at some point we're gonna want to test events like on click and things like that so let's see let's see if we should change the way we're doing this and I just want to make sure my syntax is correct also and make sure these aren't out of date where I'm getting the syntax room okay so we're describing index okay now okay you know what I didn't need to change renderer so the things that are inside these are just what should happen index should render and so we want to shell a render check for index and we've named it this Const wrapper and we're expecting wrapper okay so now let's do another test I believe we can do multiple tests right whoops let me make sure I don't lose track of it should show Nicki says it should shallow yeah that's good yeah sorry about that I just did my you know control I did like my multiple cursors here and did them both at once and not exactly what I needed to do okay mmm we're gonna do snapshots I guess I guess the first thing we should do is just see like have our changes so far mess up anything right since I'm learning this along with you all let's go incrementally and we can just run tests that's I forget what the command is for for just running the unit test I think it's just unit actually yeah let's just try that let's go yeah unit test hey cool all right so the test did pass so we haven't messed up anything too badly which is awesome all right cool Nikki thank you for putting that in there that's what I was just reading that on my other screen and wondering like should we do that so we're not going to just expect wrapper you want to expect it to match snapshot okay so you want to do that and then yeah I believe that we can just go down through here and make sure I don't have to confirm any of the terminal okay let's do that yeah that's so we should get a snapshot yeah we get a snapshot file now so you can see now we have the snapshot you sent your snap of yeah I won't help with snap follow snapshot tools anybody use this let's try it I want pretty colors on my snapshot do we need to reload all right Rilla remove w from wrapper or make the other one capital all right let's see your snapshot is okay now we have pretty colors Wow that creates quite a bit Wow alright then okay so Aniki says all you're getting all that extra JSON you snapshots yes yes it looks like we can add something else in that might help with that I mean I guess it I guess this should work for now so I'm not going to add anything if this is working for now but Nikki I guess yeah we can make this Nikki you say we should make this a lowercase W I'm cool with that all right so let's let's add some stuff in here just to see if we can do it and if it breaks then we know we can't do it so I want to add another test in here and we want to describe let's see hero hero and let's see chorus signing snapshot doesn't exist yeah sorry I'm trying to scroll down and see how they did this they don't really have examples and what I'm looking at now of doing multiple tests all at once and it looks like yeah isn't that terrible when your tutorials all are doing different things really quickly okay all right cool actually we also have some other stuff here so let me grab this so this another cheat or I get is recommending that we test if it's even defined that makes sense expect index to be defined wonderful so here's how we can do multiple tests on index we can also we can check other stuff with it but I think we're we're gonna be okay further right now all right so I want to see if this will work this guy feverish actually no I don't think that'll be it I think it would be up here describe index it should to render the new back to her I want to go back to the snapshot I want to see how this looks in the snapshot I know we had a bunch of info but there's got to be somewhere where actually we can see it maybe okay Nikki's looking the up the thing that that removes a bunch of the JSON that's cool so this is pulling in a lot of other stuff where's my actual Oh how about what about this Nikki does this look familiar okay all right cool let's see I don't even know if I have this package no this is gonna work I'm not sure what was actually all right cool yay we finally got a broken thing cool alright let's just get it then let me know what you all think about streams like this where I don't really know what I'm doing either and we work through it together I I mean I kind of think there's some value in showing the process of me like as a developer working through something new but if you think this is just kind of more of a waste of your time because we're I don't I mean we're just kind of working through it then you know let me know I'll try to only stream about things that I'm more comfortable doing and have more experience with or if you think there's some value in this you know I'll try to do this you know occasionally as well all right so let's see if this works whoa still not not working yeah so you had a bunch of stuff this gigantic file in here oh that's why it's all this stuff from the theme provider Halla John says what you gonna tab up with 5% battery left well just preemptively since your tablet's gonna die see you thanks for what alright let's what did it say interesting okay cool so let's see what we get now after we did that yarn unit you to update our stuff alright we're still getting a ton of stuff because that's coming in with a theme provider component and then at the bottom we have losses with styles index page okay alright then all right I am at the end of my Pomodoro session so let's go five minutes I'm going to come back to the chat and answer as many questions as I can well how there's a lot in the chat already a boy says I'm excited about this awesome oh well so so far I don't know how how good I've been doing but hopefully you're still excited I'm just scrolling through trying to find things I haven't already answered Oh world says testing always look like a waste of time for me I don't know I mean honestly it it seems like it would just take a lot longer I'm trying to trust and believe everything that I've read and heard about testing that in the long run it saves you time because there'll be less to fix so that's that's what I'm going with one day of s if I use Pomodoro on a daily basis I do I use Pomodoro whenever I'm coding and just to break things up and to help me estimate how long things will take like I keep track of how many Pomodoro sessions certain activities take and then I can go back and look through that and get a better estimate of how long the future projects will take excuse me sorry for the on ice to drink more coffee Kampai asks what's your vs code / linting setup like Aniki says es linen and prettier yeah yeah I mean that's that's pretty much it I I have a lot of other stuff with BS code I should do a video on that because I do get that question occasionally Nilesh says what does enzyme to json actually do okay and that nikki says check out the snapshot after you run the test to see the difference so it might have been hard to catch with all that extra stuff in there but hopefully you could see at the bottom at least that now we have like it looks like JSX right before we had I don't know what did it was it objects or I mean we had some JavaScript stuff going on in there before but it definitely wasn't JSX this is a lot easier to read I mean unfortunately we still have all this stuff but now we can hopefully on some other components we won't have all that stuff and it'll be way more obvious what what we see in the test Carlos says I love it actually it's better cuz we learn as you learn we see even your train of thought on the process okay cool so that was in response to my question about like do you all like whenever I come into a stream not really knowing what's what's going on and we learn as we go brian says I like it because it makes me feel better about myself when I struggle I never get to see someone actually figuring something out it's always smooth sailing in videos all right cool yeah I mean that was one of the things when I originally started streaming that I thought too is like hey there are a lot of other people doing really good videos and it is smooth sailing all the time like why don't I do videos where I do make mistakes and I do try to learn it would be cool for people to see that Raul says can I become a like you someday trying to convince my parents but all they need is to get me a although ones get you a degree Raoh I would say the best thing you can do right now to try to convince your parents is just get as good as you can at being a developer and if you could take on projects I don't know how old you are but if you can or what what the laws are like where you're from but you know in the United States you know you just start taking on side projects and working you know as a teenager so that might be one way to prove that this is realistic you know careerwise but if your parents want you to get a degree and you can get a scholarship or your parents will pay for it I definitely think you should still try for the degree like keep working keep working and getting better with coding but you really can't pass up the opportunity for a free or really discounted degree now if you're looking at having to pay for the whole degree yourself then it's not such a good deal then I mean it kind of depends on you know your country in the situation you're in but if I had to choose all over again and I had to pay for the school myself I was lucky in at scholarships I might just choose to become a developer and work fulltime as a developer without the degree I couldn't have got this job but I certainly still could have got all my freelance clients that I had before I got this job so anyway but that does is general advice so I don't know all your particular circumstances so you know you have to take that into into account all right so my timer went off but I only have a few more things in the chat so let me just get these last few things before we start up again let's see Aniki says for that plugin to work you need add a Jess config JSON file okay cool good to know Patrick hey that's my uncle hey uncle Pat how's it going I'm glad that you could watch Patrick says in the comments and the chat are great awesome Nikki says all hearts should probably set up the chest config inside your package JSON yes I do believe okay so role is saying I'm from India and let me know if I'm pronouncing your name correctly as well I don't have any resources but very interested in coding all right well I don't know exactly how it is in India but in the United States University costs a lot of money for for most schools some schools are more affordable but it does cost a lot of money so it's it's it's almost at the point right now for universities that if you can't get some type of financial help it's gonna take you a really really long time to pay back the loans that you have to take out so if you want to go into a tech related field where you don't really need a degree to get a job it doesn't make sense to spend all that money some so if that's really true really want to do I would say again try to get as good as you can and get actual paying jobs to prove to your parents that you can really make money doing this that might be the best way best way to go about it my wife's calling me let me tell her I'm doing a live stream hello hey I'm doing a live stream you're on YouTube is it is an emergency okay you want me a call you want to know with the stream all right hi okay cool oh my Uncle Pat's at the Denver Airport watching that's cool that the WiFi at the airport is good enough to to watch all right so I'm getting a lot more questions now so I'm going to hold hold off on these questions until after this next Pomodoro cycle so let's get started again I am gonna check quickly because Nikki's putting some some stuff in the chat about how to set this up all right we need to also add a polyfill to the setup files okay well let's let's go to our package.json where's it that I thought we opened it up and now it's not here we mean I I need to close some of this out it's way too much wow I didn't realize I had so much open oh and there it is there's my package Jason I thought I had it open okay so let's see yeah so here's our just sort of shims arches okay we do have that polyfill already there so yes I guess Harshit must have already set all that up even has the adapter for reacts 16 which is awesome okay cool so maybe were we're all good to go then all right so let's um let's see I want to try I got I really want to try to make do a component that does something more than the index should we do the hero or sex section let's just do this tech section because we don't we don't have anything for that yet so this will be like fresh test and we'll try it out so let me just import now I want to use what we what we just did index test so let me copy and paste this into a new file and what we're naming these so this will be text okay yeah so it's not pages index this is going to be components slash text text section okay so in these ones we can at least have section alright whoops I forgot this part okay so so far we haven't done anything different we're just bringing in what we already had and we just changed it to be tech section instead of index but now we can test well let's let's save it and just verify that we haven't mess anything up so far and then we can start to test things like it does it if we pass it this prop does it actually display that right or you know any of these props so we can go through each prop give it some data some test data and then make sure that it actually does what we want it to do with that test data does that make sense so I just got distracted by a long email chain that my boss is CC'ing me on okay I'll just let them know I'll make the update okay so there's an update on a site that didn't get made that's kind of important that evidently someone else was supposed to make so I'm just going to do it before I leave because honestly it doesn't really matter whose was supposed to do it it needs to be done and I can probably do it faster than anybody else at this point that's not bragging it's just like I built the site so I can update it faster okay so did I run this test I didn't that was what I was gonna do let's run the test cool all right so you can see now we should have the text section let's see what we get all right so here's what it rendered out so text section and let's see object here was exception unit continues exercise very button interesting actually you know what we probably should check the component as well that would be useful so let's open up that text section component text section there we are okay so we can see here's what it what it has all right so interesting I had assumed that these were some of the things that were rendered like some of the components inside child components but the tax section section one interesting okay I'm not exactly sure what all this is maybe when we start adding some more tests and changing things we will find out I'll double check to see if any of you let me know what okay all right so let's write another test within that within that file so let's just take so we have it it should render I don't wanna this one doesn't have any events so we're not gonna test events for this one we may not get two events today we might have to do we might do another stream about testing that'll be a little bit more informative because well more practice with it but we should I'm trying to find the trying to find an example of how to add crops oh okay I remember now all right let's let's go alright so it should render check render text and let's say so we're gonna do the text section and let's say we're our props just go back to index so I can see the props so let's say text equals and then we could just give it some text right maybe why am I getting this once all multiple spaces okay let's see I'm not sure if this is all I need but let's see yeah let's see what happens so save it and then let's run some tests now we'll probably get that warning that something changed did we know we didn't ok cool maybe because it didn't change maybe just cuz we added things there we are did it test section in class should render text no actually that's not what we wanted I wanted it to actually render that okay yeah I wanted it I wanted it to show here like actual text inside of this component I guess I'm doing it wrong mmhmm you know let me go I'm looking up all these tutorials but I should just look up the documentation so if you want to follow along I'm I'm going to the official enzyme repository on github so if you just type in enzyme github it should be the first thing that comes up in a Google search so I am going to click on there there's a bunch of options and one of them is using enzyme la just I'm gonna open that in a new tab for now and because the first thing in the docs is basic you should usage shallow rendering so I'm gonna look at what what's going on there just to make sure my my I guess syntax is correct so surrender texts so I notice that this is the style they're using when should render text wind past end which actually is correct because it shouldn't render and obviously it shouldn't render text if no text is passed okay looks like wrapper is just the default name that's used throughout so that that makes sense I was kind of wondering about that and let's see let's see so you wanted to say okay tech section text if we do have text it's not gonna render right in the middle right it's gonna render inside of a div class of section test she texts okay so what will happen is it'll render typography so all right let me see not sure if this is the right way to do it but let's try it out text section here but then within this we're gonna write typography I don't know I don't have a good feeling about this one pinkeye messing it up mm yeah let me check this yeah there's no way that's right let's see alright let's let me take this out for now and start again okay specs okay I may have to go to the full documentation okay yeah Brian I think that's a good idea I was just looking at that part of the documentation let's try that out I'm yeah let's just let's try it out and see what happens I'm a little bit worried about it because the text is gonna it's gonna be within the typography component so I'm not yeah I'm not exactly sure how this will render but I think that's it's worth a try to see you know what's gonna happen you know what shoot we we wanted to match the snapshot we don't want it to contain unique right that's that's what we want maybe I ought to go to the one that's specific for using jest with ensign yeah that'll be more helpful nice example tests all right so I'm going to show I'm gonna copy this into the live chat because it'll be easier to just go right there instead of me trying to describe how I got there but this is the example test with you if you're using jest with enzyme so let's see see what they're saying here hmm okay so we we can do different this is good to know so we can do different things within the same one so we don't just have to do shallow or just just render amount so that's good to know okay and I'm also going to check out the shallow rendering API all right I just realized the example I was looking at before when I was trying to put a lot of stuff in here was not it wasn't an example for passing props it was for passing children so it made sense for that but not not exactly for props hmm all right I am NOT I'm not finding the answers that I want for this all right so there we go so I tried I'm just gonna say this out loud somewhat for myself but also for you uhhuh just to know what's going on my head so I the goal is to make sure that if we pass in a prop it actually gets rendered properly and so we tried to just put in text section and pass in a prop like we normally would expecting that it would do something here but what we found is that we just get back text section and then down here it just has the prop we don't actually see it rendered anywhere this is kind of odd I guess some of the things are odd to me we don't get anything rendering inside here whereas I expected that we would get the child components you know not fully rendered but that the child components would be at least at least they would show up so that's where I'm at you know basically is what why is it not showing up and what do I need to do to have that show up and and test that so let me show you alright so obviously this is what we have right exports in the text section right but here's what I'm looking at as to you know maybe what it should be so you can see here they have exports so they have the component as link but then under exports it has an actual a tag with the href that they passed in and the title here so you could see like you know right here they passed in title as a prop they passed in monkey URL as a prop and we basically have the same we have all this is the same stuff right just not sure so I mean maybe maybe I should compare maybe I don't have all the same syntax here and the same stuff maybe that's the problem so maybe I shouldn't what if we don't it looks like this is different so describe text section okay let's try that out now that I think is the only difference that I noticed so let's run this again let's see okay so let's run that ad like we needed to before there we are okay now let's check what we have next section same same thing right it's still the same actually did we get no we didn't get anything right so we have now you know the first one we're not actually doing anything with a snapshot so this one and this one are giving us snapshots and let's I just want to be just double check that we are getting one hmm and this is what we're passing in correct text yeah interesting okay all right so my timer went off again so that was our second Pomodoro session I yeah I think I want to end now I mean partly because I've already put in over over time today so I don't really need to be here anymore but also I mean at this point I think the best thing for me to do would be to do some more research maybe a tutorial because I'm I'm one number one a little afraid that I'm mixing some little techniques and some new techniques because the tutorials that I have the documentation I have right now some glitch old and then yeah I kind of feel like I've gotten to a place where I don't have many more ideas left so I need to get back to the research so that'll be what I do between now and the next time you come back to this which will probably be after Easter so I I said I'm probably gonna do a stream from home tomorrow working with that brain computer interface so it'll be unrelated to this and then I'm off on Monday and then so next Tuesday will probably be the next time I stream so it should be a while it'll give me a lot of time to research I guess I mean technically I'm off tomorrow too so I don't really have three six so maybe I'll research on Tuesday morning before I stream okay so what I'd like to do now is go back through the rest of the comments and answer any questions that you have you read out some relevant comments okay Nicki says do a push yeah thank you for reminding me yeah so if any of you want to check out what was done test things out you know mess around feel free I'm about to push this to the github repo the links in the description everything in the repo is completely you know open for you all to use for whatever you want I mean excluding obviously like the Franciscan logo and stuff like that can't use that all right I'm just doublechecking to make sure that the things that changed or actually what we expect to change and I will do a git add to add everything and we're gonna do yarn CM and that's a little tool we have running on top of the normal get thing just to help us make a nice commit message otherwise you just want to type in git commit and add the M flag and then put your message so we're gonna add we're gonna make this a test so this is gonna say update and it should say add tests for index dot J's and text section J s okay no breaking changes I don't think we have any issues for that so it's going to run through hopefully it can pass the test yep so passes the test the cool thing about unit testing too is it's very fast compared to endtoend testing because endtoend testing actually opens up ahead at least the way we're doing it opens up a headless browser and it has to wait for the Dom to load the dawn in comparison to just plain JavaScript is very slow so we should probably write way more unit tests than we do endtoend tests if for no other reason other reasons but one of the reasons would be if we wrote a ton of endtoend test testing would take forever but if we do unit tests you can see look all four of our tests pass in just over two seconds not really you know not really that long to wait all right so now I'm going to do a git push and all of this code is now available on github let me scroll up a bit try to find where I left off and answer questions if you have any questions please put them in the live chat and I just now realized that I have no music playing in my headphones this entire time I've been wearing them and nothing's been in them and I feel silly I guess I should turn music on that all right now there's music all right Brian says I'm looking into a startup that will teach the computer science stuff that actually matters plus coding it would be about nine months to a year kind of like College meets boot camp interesting I've actually I had an idea for something kind of like that here at the university that I work for basically you do it you wouldn't get a degree for it but that would be good because we could speed up the process of getting it here and not have to worry about accreditation and all the red tape that comes with adding new programs but it would basically just give you know a certificate so it'd be somewhat like a boot camp but we would have different tracks so if you wanted to know an about like web development you could do that if you know we could offer some of the newer exciting things so if you want to about learn about machine learning you could do that VRA are you could do that and it would be something that the computer science students could do like let's say in the summertime to get better skills it would be projectbased so they could put on their resume or other people who aren't interested in a degree could still come I'm kind of thinking it would be online though so they wouldn't necessarily have to come here because then we have to figure out all about like housing and stuff like that so just to try to keep it like as barebones as possible when it's easy to start it would be online to start but anyway I I've only talked to a few people about it so far the people that I have talked to hear about it I've said it was a good idea I just need to get it I need to be able to talk to people high enough up that it can actually happen but anyway so Brian I really like your idea I I think that's a cool idea because I have so people who do the boot camps sometimes lack some knowledge that a computer science students would have gotten but it's it's not really it doesn't really make financial sense for boot camp people who have come out and you know potentially have gotten jobs already to go back and get a computer science degree but if they could get some of that in a boot camp format that wouldn't that would make a lot more sense I like that idea Carlos says I honestly have no idea what we are doing with these tests but I think it's great to be doing testing I used to do it with rails but you definitely didn't get that much info on the test whoo well hopefully Carlos I don't know what I'm doing with these tests either so we're in the same boat just trying to learn learn as we go along all right so here's some more advice so Raul was talking about you know advice I'm sorry not Raul this is a different question Kemah asked do you have any advice for novice freelancers so Pat says there are a lot of free courses and training sessions on web build as many webpage as possible that training is valuable yeah definitely that's how I am doing what I'm doing I would say at least 90% of what I did training wise was all free resources yaqoob says how to pass variable from routes to handlebars anyone I need to display a number of documents in my new MongoDB I haven't used handlebars in I don't know like two years at least so I I don't remember offhand I'm sorry if anybody else is familiar with handle using handlebars with MongoDB please you know add add a comment in to help out Jakub sorry I just I never use handlebars that much and it been a long time Rollo says currently after my high school I'm taking a preparation for entrance as last time I was unable to qualify but this time I hope for everything everything's go in a good way yeah well good luck with that I hope it goes well for you too Bryan says does anyone think the complete react guide on udemy is any good or any books in particular I haven't done the complete react guide on udemy so I can't really actually I've heard it pronounced you to me have I been pronouncing it wrong the whole time is it you to me or that makes I guess that sounds better you tell me you do me I don't know let me know how you all pronounce it udemy or you to me it doesn't really matter you all know what I'm talking about either way I guess yeah so I don't I don't know because I don't have any experience with that I do know that the reacts nanodegree program with Udacity was good I did go through that it was good if you're already experienced though with react and redux and maybe have some experience with react native it you might not learn as much from it but if you don't have that much experience with Redux and react native then you could definitely learn a lot from the course oh okay so Carlos says that that's a good one doing that one too okay cool brian says I've read the road to learn react Carlos says he explains everything it's easy for him to understand okay so I guess the the complete react guide is is a good resource then rule says in India every parent with their child to get one of the government college and do just a job and they don't understand the in the internet at all this is as you replied in my comments I'm very happy well I'm glad you're happy about that hopefully my advice is is good for you like I said with me not understanding the culture and you know the economics and educational system in India I I feel like I can't give you really good advice really specific advice just kind of general stuff from from my perspective so just take that into consideration when when you're thinking about you know the advice that I gave you Carlos says I had the idea maybe it's incorrect but I thought that IT or anything computer was taught in a lot of Indian schools I says I've seen very good programmers from India Pat says there is a lot of good programming going on in Bangalore cool yeah actually I just kind of as a side note anecdotal most of most of my viewers are from the United States but in a close second I get a lot of viewers from India as well so definitely a lot of programmers or a lot of people interested in programming watching from India that Glen says hello from Spain hey how's it going thanks for watching hey Jones back get a power cord okay aditya says am I the only new beer no no way I'm a noob too so don't worry about it and feel free to ask as many questions as you want Aditya says anyway what is he doing now we're truck we were trying to figure out how to do unit testing with some tools called enzyme and jest so we we had we made some progress and then kind of got caught up when we were trying to test out passing props in so if we do another stream about this which we probably will that's where we'll pick off or pick up and then the next step would be testing actions so like simulating user actions and testing what happens so you know what happens when you click on a button and things like that let's see and brian says dude I'm a noob too so don't feel like you're the only new we are learning here yeah for sure we're all Laurie everybody that's that's Cody no matter how many years they've been at it we're everybody still needs to learn things are always changing there's always more to learn Pat says once you have a basic understanding of objectoriented coding the rest is just practical experience languages change fast and new ones come out every year yeah for sure that that's it I mean you get the fundamentals down and the basics then you can move from from different languages and especially I know like in react land you know we do more of like functional programming but realistically objectoriented is important to know I've been doing some work with solidity which is a language to build block chain contracts on the etherion blockchain and it's all object oriented the syntax is very similar to JavaScript but I was using a strongly typed version of solidity called solidity X so it's it's definitely like imagine like objectoriented JavaScript like strongly typed so that's kind of what it's like but I started learning JavaScript before like the whole functional programming thing was really you know coming up so when I started learning it was like learn objectoriented you know stuff with JavaScript style I know Java scripts not really an objectoriented language but people were kind of using it like it was so that experience helped me to be able to pick up and learner solidity really quickly and know what was going on so anyway so I think there's still value in learning objectoriented stuff it'll help you and a lot of other things even though you wouldn't necessarily need it for react it still could help so it may not be like I have to learn it right away you could probably learn it on the side but it's still still good Carlos says new here also actually I'm a clinical psychologist go figure so I guess it's newer than a Newton cool that's cool your clinical psychologist I have my motherinlaw and my brotherinlaw are both in the field and I have an uncle that's also in that that field I guess yeah we're the counselors yes oh and I think I have a cousin as well I have a lot of people that I know and then that field so very important field let's see Patrick says do you ever write performance test I haven't yet but now that you say that that sounds like a really good idea maybe I'll have to I'll have to look that up and see how you know how to do that with what I'm working with now krishna says may i know the university name sure it's Franciscan University of Steubenville so I mean that's if you go to the github repo for this project its links link below you'll see the name of the University it's used throughout you know some of the places in the site so you can get more info if you want it's a small university in in Ohio in the United States also says hey Jessie how's it going not too bad kind of struggled through this stream but we got some stuff done learned a lot okay so I've gotten to the end of the live chat and I think I'm gonna finish things up here and I'll probably see you tomorrow hopefully things will work out enough that we can get a decent stream with with this braincomputer interface stuff I'm very very new to it Alex Castillo is going to be helping out with that and he's much more experienced he's a developer for Netflix but in his spare time he works on brain computer interfaces especially using JavaScript with them so hopefully that'll go well tomorrow and then we'll come back to this project after the the Easter break if I don't see you and you're celebrating Easter this weekend have a happy Easter and O'Brien says don't forget to call your wife thank you cuz I did forget thank you so much you just saved me a lot of trouble thank you thank you okay all right cool so all on all CEO maybe tomorrow maybe next week until then have a have a great day or a great weekend a great holiday
