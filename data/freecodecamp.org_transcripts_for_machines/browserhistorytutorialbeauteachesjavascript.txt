the history object contains the URLs visited by the user within a browser window the history object is part of the window object and is accessed through the window. history property if you see here we have an alert with history. length the window is just implied this could easily be window. history. length so if I run that and it's going to say three that means there's three items in my history if I just put back here here we can see there's two here plus the current one that I'm on and we can also um do history. back and this is just a method it's just like clicking the back key on your browser okay I'm going to save this and then I'm going to run that it's going to show me the number of pages and then it goes back to the previous page now this can be tricky here so I can hit forward here to go back to the previous page but since I'm on code pin it automatically runs this again so I can't really change this and when I hit okay it's going to go back again so now we're kind of in in an infinite loop we're stuck so we can't actually get back to that page to load it because it's automatically running this history. back well there is kind of a work around here so after this question mark I can just type in turn off JS equals true now I'm going to copy this whole thing and because when I press enter here it's still going to go back because it was already just about to do that now I'm going to paste in the website with the turnoff JS equals true and now it's not going to run the JavaScript automatically so I can um do a make this into a comment I can save this I can run that and now it's it's not going to oh I have to actually um remove turnoff JS equals true cuz I can't run it while that's on and so I'm going to go to this press enter to go to the website again and now it's going to show four but it's not going to go back because I have that commented out so another thing you instead of having back here you could put forward and another thing you can do is this history. go and if I put a number in here like three any any number here you it will go back that many times into the history so now it's going to go back three pages into the history or if you have it a positive number it's going to go forward pages into the history or if you have a zero it's just going to refresh the current page but I'm not going to demonstrate that because then we'll have the same problem with the JavaScript automatically running but another thing I want to show you is replace state okay replace State takes three parameters first I'll talk about the last one the last parameter is going to change the actual domain name up here so it's going to instead of saying l y JLG D it's going to say unicycle HTML the second parameter is not actually used by the browser it's for possibly in the future maybe JavaScript will use this but it just um sets a name to the the page and then this is a state object that you can pass in that you can then access this state later this can be any Json object basically I'm just using a string but it can be a Json object and this is going to basically replace this entry in the history so right now in the history it's going to have this website up here in the address bar replace state is going to replace this history entry with with this new history entry so the previous history entry won't even be there it won't even show this website it's going to show this website in in the history now there's a weird thing with code pen where it this doesn't actually work correctly but if I'm going to if I copy this I'm going to open up the JavaScript developer console by doing um option command J it's different on Windows and then I'm just going to run this command here and if I press enter you'll see right up here it changed it it's now unicycle HTML and if I run this you can see it's four which it was at four before so we haven't changed the number of pages in the history and now if we do console.log history. state and I'm going to run that it's going to pop up four and the console says bow is great that comes from this state here so you can access this first parameter that you pass in by just going to history. State now that's just a way to save some information um between pages and when you go to different pages you can access the same information now another thing to point out is that this website up here doesn't actually exist there is no code pin iboon pin unicycle .html so it didn't actually load that page when you call replace state it does not actually load the page it just changes it in your address bar up here you can put a full URL here as long as it it's has the same root URL that you were already on I'm just going to copy this and bring it into my console and we have an error so let's see what happened oh I should not have had the s for some reason I'm not on the secure version of code pin so it has to be the exact same uh beginning of the URL to work so let's try that again so now you can look up here codep pin. IBO is awesome so we can replace everything after the main domain name but if you put something wrong in the main domain name you get this error that we had up here and if I run this again you will see it's still going to have the number four here and when we ran that it's going to give me an error here because of a weird thing with code pin but I want to show you another one more thing history. push State now the first two parameters are optional push State and replace they are almost exactly the same so the first parameter is the state the second parameter is the name that's not used and the third parameter is what the domain name is going to be so we'll put this into free code Camp so I'm going to copy this and I'm going to bring over to the JavaScript console that's just of code pin here and if I run that now you'll see it's Cod pin. freecode camp and if I run this it says five up here remember before it kept saying four now it's saying five in replace date we replace the current history entry with a new history entry push date just adds a history entry so it's still going to have the page you were on in the history and now it's going to have a new page in the history so if I press the back button you'll see there's just an extra item here before we just had this first code pin history now we have the second code pin history right there well that's the history object thanks for watching my name is Bo KS don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
