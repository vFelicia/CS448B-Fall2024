this week is a struggle my problem right now is simply the order i'm not sure what should be done after what thing and when i have a list that i prepared what i need to do that still needs to be implemented um still i'm not sure what should be done after which thing and this makes things problematic because sometimes i start implementing a thing that without other thing wouldn't work and so that's why i get stuck um and even if i find the solution or if i know from react recommendation how to implement a given thing how to connect the components how to make it display despite all these things i find the moments when i get stuck because the order was wrong just because something else should have been implemented fast in order to make this new thing that i'm implementing working so this top level logic on the level of pages and connecting everything with storage turns out to be the hardest point in this project it is a process and you know the more i code the better you will be added i hope when i get stuck and i don't know what to do next with the code which option to implement what to do and why i get a bug like that i reach to these steps i write down the plan on paper and i try to write it down with the smallest steps so what i should do next what generally should be done what's the order of these things at least what i think that the order should be i talk with other programmers i consult the things on various forums i look for tutorials that have similar projects i look for tutorials that solve similar problems i assertions like overflow or i post on twitter or try to look for the solution on forums and sometimes i simply take a break from a given project from a given problem i try to go to the next issue that can be dealt with or i go for a walk and you what do you do when you have the problems with focus and what to do next in your project please share your solutions in the comments below i want to make each image that is loaded to the recipe the same size and to be displayed as cover so this is another step that i have to take right now velocity is not a function what what does it even mean and how to solve it please the top of the ground yes to go for a walk or to continue coding that is a question especially if you are struggling with some problem for the last few hours this is my answer of the ground so this project is the example how the decisions previously made influence the time needed for the final implementation why to give you some examples if i hadn't decided to implement images i would save tons of time you have to resize and crop the images in order to allow the users to add more recipes because local storage has their limits if not a user will be able to upload just only a few recipes because of the huge photo but because i believe that images are crucial when it comes to recipes and you eat it with your eyes i think that this is another thing that i will resign from another example of how previous decisions influence the way influence the time you have to devote to implement a project is using materialize in this project i used materialize in order to save time but right now i'm not sure if i wouldn't have to deal with velocity is not a function ever that's hard to debug because it is connected with materialize and with the ui components that i use from there i want to finish this project as soon as possible and make it decent um that's why i wanna resign from those things that i decided that at this stage they are too overwhelming for me because they adapt to the overall complexity of the project and they are not in the project's requirements this way i'm resigning from search why for example from search well i wrote down the plan how to implement it what would be needed in order to do it and there are many steps that will take a lot of time right now to finish that extra functionality that can be added later in some iterations each step from clicking the search icon to displaying the result and going to give the result and later coming back to home page or to the result list everything that should be referred and designed and implemented not just only in logic but also in the ui that would be user friendly it's possible but it takes time that i don't want to devote right now maybe it's because i'm a bit fed up with this project and when i really finished it because it was quite hard but for the time being search is not needed sometimes you have to give up in order to have the power to come back to the project especially if it's not for the client because if you decided that it should be designed this way you can also resign from a given point at a given iteration it's sunday in the evening this is how it looks now i can add a recipe add a photo add the ingredients some instructions and save the recipe automatically it is added to the list and the list is created alphabetically so if it was fries it's after b and before and when i come into this recipe i can edit it or delete it if i edit it i can resign from tags add some tags still i need to fight with this overlap this will be the next step i can change the photo and save the recipe if a user wants to delete a recipe they click delete and when they reassure this recipe is no longer in the storage in the local storage and this fries recipe is no longer here looking at the user stories um from number one um i can create recipes that have the names and ingredients yes i can i can see the index view where the names of all recipes are visible yes i can it's the home page i can click into any of those recipes to view it yes i can and then i go to the detailed view i can edit the recipes yes i can this is what we did and i can delete the recipes yes we could delete the recipes all the recipes i add are saved in my browser's local storage if i refresh the page these recipes will still be there yes it's done if i refresh there's a disaster here so looking at these user stories while they are implemented but still the app needs a lot of work i mean it could be better it shows that fulfilling user stories doesn't mean that the project is done next week i'm going to test this project once again and to go to smaller js apps and reestablishing my js phenology knowledge learning to code has to do a lot with selfawareness i think that is also a courage to experiment and to choose to try to take the knowledge from different sources having a major plan of course in it like having the main path that you want to follow so i want to go straight away to the next react free code cam project because i want to work more with js and stop for a moment on some smaller project or some smaller projects with javascript to make me stronger in javascript and to make me think clearer in javascript this is what i feel that i need right now let's check that we will see if it was the right move keep on doing remember that learning to code is not a race you get your own path your own journey and take the decisions that you feel that are good for you at this moment see you next week you
