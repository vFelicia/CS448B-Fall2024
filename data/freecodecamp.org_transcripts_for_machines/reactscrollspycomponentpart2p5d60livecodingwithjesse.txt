hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to finish the component that we started yesterday i i made a lot of changes so first thing i'm going to do is cover those changes before we get started with the coding this is my first time using the new webcam with my my home office set up so let me know if anything is weird hopefully the picture quality is a little bit better it should be but um i um i'm getting like from from my point of view the audio is way off from the video uh as i see it in obs i'm hoping it's not like that for you all please let me know uh what what it's like for you and my computer is really sluggish while i'm running this okay so the audio and video seem to be out of sync i was afraid that all right let's let me see what i could do i tried to look into how to fix that yesterday but uh i couldn't find i couldn't really find anything that seemed to apply with what was going on yesterday with the stream so while i'm explaining this i'm just gonna check over on my other screen some some options all right it looks like there's there's quite a few um options here to choose from on a google search uh john said time for a new machine yeah i that would be really nice i i do have one other thing that i can try it was just gonna be a lot of extra setup but i can i i can run obs on a different machine and then that would let my computer um my that i'm actually coding on uh it wouldn't have to handle all the load of running obs so uh maybe that'll be my my next step uh it looks like i can set an audio delay yeah maybe i'll um let me add in audio delay let me go to the settings real quick and add that in if this doesn't work um i guess i'll just go to the code let's see all right audio stream or output audio is probably where i need to go sync asset all right let me see if i can add this delay all right is this is this better at all you know what actually let me try can you hear me all right that seems to be so the um the webcam itself has a microphone so i wonder if i switch to that if it'll give it'll be better synced it looks like it's still off from my point of view but i'm not sure alright so i think i so i switched mics to a different mic and i think that i just set a delay of um 300 milliseconds but i'm not exactly sure alright so let me at least show you and explain what what's going on here and maybe i can try to adjust the settings a bit based on on your feedback let me go i'm gonna adjust the settings like drastically all right so in the spot where i think i can add a delay i just added an audio delay of 10 seconds all right so it looks say the the volume is dropped okay i am a little bit farther away from the webcam mic let me see if i can adjust the volume all right is the volume any better now all right just keep keep letting me know whether it's getting better or worse and i'll go back to it but for now i i do want to show you what i've done so i'm sure most of you uh remember harshit he's been not in the stream quite as much since i've been streaming later on and it's it's really hard to watch because of the time zone uh difference but heart [ __ ] gave me some good advice to use what's it called react scroll i think that's what it's called yeah react scroll to help with handling the scrolling instead of trying to do it ourselves and you know i really wanted to use what we'd already used in the previous project because i thought that would save us a lot of time but as we saw yesterday it ended up being pretty difficult there were just so many pieces in different places that i i didn't even realize they were there because number one it's been a while since i worked on a project but also most of that work was from a pull request and i didn't do it myself so having seen the code and not actually written it myself it just was a lot harder to try to adapt it so i think this is probably going to be a better way to do it so far it's it's working well so i want to give you just a very brief overview of what we've done in terms of the code and let me make this code a lot bigger that's pretty small wow this is quite slow i see what i'm gonna do actually let me i'm gonna change my display let's see there we go let's change this display let's get rid of this and let's see that looks like it's in sync it's it's much better does that look better to you all so i might just go with this one then and maybe oh um if i just just go with this for now and then try to work out the difference i'm gonna switch back to the normal uh microphone that i usually use and so the audio will be you know back to normal okay that'll be something i just need to work on uh maybe after i stream today if i have time i'll work on getting the the other computer set up to run obs all right so for now let me make some space get rid of this sidebar i don't need that okay john says the video is fine but the sound is out works fine enough sound is now in sync okay awesome all right that's cool i think uh probably my this this laptop is just not powerful enough to handle that and so my audio's just gonna be out of sync so i don't think i'm gonna make it work with um with this computer and that camera so i need to figure some other solution out with another computer all right and now let's get to this i do want to show you all maybe on one of the breaks so remind me if you're interested but i'd like to show you all one of the side projects that uh harshit and nikki have been working really hard on and give you an update on that because we haven't we haven't looked at it in the stream in quite a while okay so here's what we have so far we've brought in well if i can click the right the right component i'll show you what we had so far okay so we imported let me see we actually imported a lot so we imported all of this stuff from react scroll okay so link events animate scroll as scroll and then scroll spy and scroller just as an aside here we are using a component called link on other pages uh and we're getting that from from next if we were to use that component on this page we could import link as something else and that would reduce the confusion so we probably will do that and i forgot to set my timer oh because this area alright so we've added basically everything everything where you see these these blue lines in the green line here this is all added so on component did mount basically um just setting event handlers right in this case the the scroll and then we have some functions that we're not using right now so we'll probably take out but i copied and pasted heavily from the example um if you want to check out react scroll uh let me let me throw a link in here for you i thought i had it here i guess i don't let me grab the link for react scrolls um so that you all can can check out this package there we go so the link's in there now if you click it and it doesn't work please try copying and pasting it okay so we'll probably get rid of scroll to top i don't really see the need for a scroll to top function on this particular page but it's good to know it's there because we should probably use that on the search page and we're definitely using the scroll to function so you could you know scroll to a certain element and you can see you can set different things like duration uh delay uh you can even set like the type of animation so really nice i'm not probably not going to mess too much with the type of animation because that's kind of thing that could get me off track for a while just testing things out and then like the grand scheme of things it's just not that important for this one particular part of the site um let's see let's continue yeah so some of these will have to work out and see like do we really need we're only using one type of scroll so we may not need some of these and then of course when the component unmounts wait we remove our event listeners now in terms of markup we've added this i've added this div i put in some inline styles in the div but they're not working for me right now so that's the number the first thing we're going to work on are these styles to get it in the right location but we just have an unordered list and then within each list item we have that link component not to be confused with the one we've used elsewhere from next this is the link component we're getting from react scroll and we've just set our class is active so when we're scrolled in that particular spot so when we're inside that component that element on the page that has an idea of spring then this link is going to have the class of active and we can attach and i have attached uh css classes to that right now i just have spring and summer oh sorry uh but we'll end up with you know all the seasons so we'll have four four links and the only other change that i needed to make was in our container so it's the second content container we changed why i changed this id i should say i added the id of spring and then i added in another container below that and gave it the id of summer just so that we had two to work with to test all right so all in all once we get rid of everything we don't need i think this will end up being less code um and it'll be more centralized in one place i mean yes we're bringing in a whole another npm package but in terms of like cluttering our components way less clutter all right now let me show you what it looks like so let me go to missionary outreach okay so right now i can't even see it so something i did with the styles are really messing things up so i'm gonna inspect here because i know in the markup it's it's right below this so even though we can't see it on the page it's it's obviously still going to be in the same place in the markup so that's where we're going to search for it we'll mess with the styles a bit right here in devtools and see if we can figure out you know what to do i think i pulled over the styles from our other project that resource center project it's uh it's rc.franciscan.university if anybody wants to check that out and uh i believe it's the planning guide page would be slash planning hyphen guide and i think we had that menu positioned uh yeah let me make this bigger we had that menu positioned like in our in our dom tree we had it like up at one of the higher levels so i think that made a difference so i'm just gonna get rid of a lot of these styles right now just to see does that make any difference at all and we could see it does not so the one thing that i think is messing this up is this position fixed but if we wanted to behave in in the appropriate way we need that sorry for the yawning i've um i've been having like uh i've been so drowsy tired all day i uh i thought i was gonna fall asleep uh so let me just click it just to show you right so when you click it it does take you to the right section so that works i did have to use an offset of negative 50 pixels so we could still see this because the id is actually on this container and not on on the title because we want the scrolls by to detect that it's inside of this container the whole way down when we're scrolling otherwise it would just very briefly have the class of active and then once this was off the screen it would go away that would be no good all right you know what and nikki says give it a ridiculous z index just to be sure all right let's let's try that let's put put all these back on and then give it a z index uh big z index actually you can see where is it it it looks like it's putting it way down in the bottom uh let's see if we go see if it puts it ah yes okay all right so it it needed at least we can see it on the screen so uh right here in the corner let me make this bigger so it'll be easier so here in the corner we have this spring and summer but really what we need this is kind of odd i don't know if you can see this but the background color is is off here it's white here and then it's at off white i don't know what's going on with that you know what i think uh the student that's working on this page brought over a bunch of styles from the html css version of the page that he did first and i think some of them are conflicting so uh there's there's a few areas where the styles are a little off it's not really a big deal we'll get that sorted out okay i guess what i'm thinking is we may have talked about this yesterday is that this menu won't this menu will stay here on the page so it you won't see it it won't go up here as you scroll so here's how i think we can make that happen you all please let me know if you have a better idea i'm definitely open to suggestions so by default this will be positioned here on the page uh so i think we can how can we accomplish that we'll get into the css of that in just a second but then since we already have the scroll spy set up we'll just check out there's got to be a way to make something happen um like fire off a function that we create when we get to a certain place or change something we got to be able to change something when we get to that certain spot and at that point the styles will change so that this goes to something very similar to what it is right now so let's let's go back to the code so i think we can do this all right if we have oh nikki saying use position sticky yeah is that what's the support for position sticky let's check that out hmm all right well i mean obviously internet explorer 11 is not supporting it i'm not really that worried about internet explorer 11. i've told you all how i feel about it if anybody once really wants to know ask me and i'll answer it at the end of the stream um yeah so i'm not going to worry about internet explorer 11 for right now let's try position sticky and i don't know that i've ever used this before i remember someone bringing it up on the stream before and we checked it out but i don't know if i ever used it if i did i forgot um so let's play around with it i don't know where it went let's just look up um what yeah i'm pretty sure i'll get a link right to mdn from here there we go oh polyfills maybe we can't make this work all right here's our sticky position if you haven't used mdn before i highly recommend it so it's the mozilla developer network anytime you search for anything in html css javascript and who knows what else the mdn uh article on that will probably probably be one of the top search results uh so it's it's very thorough if you're a beginner it could be a little intimidating because there's so much information for beginners i recommend if if you're confused by all this scroll down to the examples and check out the examples first for me starting out and even now the examples sometimes make it clear to me immediately whether or not this is going to work and then if i think it'll work and i'm interested i'll go back and read and learn what i what i need to about it but otherwise it can take some time to get through everything and try to figure it all out um so let me just uh go through this quickly i'm not gonna read it out i'm just gonna glance at it all right let's go down to the sticky area all right this sounds perfect for us a stickly positioned element is treated as relatively positioned until across crosses specified threshold at which point is treated as fixed it's exactly what we were going to try to implement ourselves with javascript okay which one one is all right so which one has the id of one i don't see it in there all right let's see oh okay i like that that's nice okay i just see that uh frankie just joined us welcome thanks for joining us don't worry about being late all right so let's try it out uh it seems like all i really need is this position sticky and then like a value from the top so let's go back here and let me get rid of that was weird that max with is messing things up oh can you believe it it works just like that that's amazing check that out wow that's cool all right a few things that don't want to try here okay so uh when it really is position fixed it's nice that it doesn't take up this space here so i want to do something about that um i definitely don't want it taking up so much space i don't know if you all can hear that but my phone just keeps going off constantly um okay i do have some work messages let me just check and make sure it's not emergency okay there is a change i need to make to the bulletin website but i don't think it needs to be made until the end of the week all right so no no emergencies okay thanks for being patient check that out all right so let's see interesting um all right so this position right it's not working let's see if we can do there we go nice all right so i know floats are old school but in this case a float does exactly what we wanted to so we're gonna go with the float and then we're gonna put a margin right margin if i can't get this right here we go right of 16 pixels okay i always like to have at least 16 pixels here because you can see we have this scroll bar that shows up and on browsers where this happens uh we definitely want enough space so you can still read and click on these i believe internet explorer scroll bar is like always there and it's big so i know we're not really trying to support it but something small like that i think is it's definitely worth doing because you never know how browsers look to on different um operating systems so i think this scroll bar is like the slimmest one and on windows i believe they're a little bit thicker all right wow that was that was super easy uh i guess what's going on here this is it's not exactly working something happened and it's not working so that active class is not working right uh but let me check the time all right only about two minutes uh let's let's get these styles over into a css file quickly so i'm just going to copy these and we'll do the position sticky so this will be i'm just using this missions.css that we already had and let's start um actually i had that on the div and that div doesn't have a class right now we need to give that dave a class let's get rid of these styles and give it a class name of um scroll spy container position sticky and then we'll paste this in i don't have auto formatting set up for my css unfortunately i have to manually do that there we go um all right cool let's i don't think we changed anything else let's give it a refresh just to be sure uh the styles don't auto refresh so when i change the uh like the css files it's taking quite a while why is that happening uh i think i messed something up here all right no none of those errors would be able to explain it okay let me take a five minute break i'm gonna go to the live chat and answer some questions and when we come back we're gonna troubleshoot the stuff that i've apparently broken okay i didn't notice right off at the very beginning of the stream tova says hello first time here um if you're still here jova welcome to the stream thank you so much for uh for joining us today sorry about all the technical difficulties at the beginning oh phoenix said earlier there's a weird noise let me know if there still is a weird noise i mean there shouldn't i don't hear anything now nobody is home at my house so if you hear something weird let me know again yeah i can't hear anything uh james ross asked if there's any update uh with uh my kids brain project um so the last thing that happened with that project was i i had a video call with alex castillo and he works with brain computer computer interfaces and javascript and he does presentations on it at different conferences he used to work at netflix and he has his own company now that are is focusing on the brain computer interfaces so he he was working on making the link so we did some testing to try to get the brain computer interface connected via bluetooth directly to a website right through the through the browser uh and we were successful at getting that to work um i did send him some some test data so he's going to try to work with that to get a link so that the data can be readable so i've no idea how long that's going to take in the meantime i can probably start working on like the front end of it and just basically like mocking data um so i'm hoping to get started on that soon it's i mean it's it's there's just always things going on you know there's always things to do so hopefully i'll get to that it is kind of high on my list so oh i will update you all as as we go on uh john soto says um question uh why not use scroll into view um we could use that since we are already using this package to um to track the the scroll i'm just using the tools that are available uh there uh to move the to do the scrolling so i think this is the case where there's a lot of different ways to do this and i don't know if this weighs the best way uh but so far it is it seems to be working uh john soto if there's any particular reason why you think strolling into view would actually be the better way to go please let me know because i'm i'm definitely interested in doing this you know the best way i can uh john hanson says bringing over a premade react package can be great though i find that you have to put trust in the dev of that package yeah for sure for sure i think that's i mean that's an issue i think everybody deals with now there are very few like largescale projects where everything's built from scratch i mean like anybody using react for a project is trusting the devs behind react it's just um i don't know that's just the way web development is now uh for better or for worse we're all able to build really cool things and and build on you know what everyone else is working on it's really awesome it's great collaboration but at the same time yeah it does require that trust so i guess um it is a good idea to at least look at the package a bit look at the github repo uh see some of the issues what have people said about it how many people are actually using it um you know see basically if there's anything that just looks weird in terms of you know does nobody use this maybe there's a reason why nobody uses it um are there a ton of issues that that never get closed that's probably a warning sign too so at the end of the day though you're right you just you have to trust that the people that made the package uh did a good job and uh you know definitely make sure to test things out on your own um and not just trust that it's it's always gonna work uh okay let me let me start this and let's go oh okay i broke everything so let's check that out first and see why why it's broken now probably because i've messed up the width um shoot this just seems all right let me i think that maybe the float right is what's doing it see while i'm waiting for that to reload i'm just gonna go through okay all right that did work now um some of the functionality we needed i think because i think we have all the functionality now it it scrolls with a page but only when we want it to you click a link and it goes to the right section oh we're still missing that change in when we have that active class so that was something that was working before i started the stream so something that i've done since then has has changed it um so that plus this positioning is what we need to uh we need to fix all right let me i'm gonna save this i'm gonna try one more time just to see like what what's going on is this this is it always gonna happen and it looks like it is okay oh nice all right cool it um it worked this time all right excellent um at some point we may not get to it on this stream but we'll definitely want to make sure that that side navigation goes away we don't really have room for it on a smaller screen all right all right cool all right so now that's that's sorted and we need i need to figure out why the active class is not being applied here so let me inspect this so we can see if it's being applied let's see so it should be on i think it'll be applied here on the a tag okay yeah so it is being applied it's just the css that needs to change okay and that makes sense because the styles are actually on the li right now okay oops all right let's check it out it'd be nice if i could get the class to apply here but i don't think it's going to work like that nikki just said it looks like masonry is just being a bit slow on this machine yeah i think you're right um it's just this this machine just can't handle streaming very well hmm john said looks like this coding session has been conquered almost we're close we're really close okay so if i all right let me ask this is there a way in css to where i could change the style of a parent if the child has a certain class added i don't i don't know if that's even possible let's let's go to google i know you can do it on uh what is it like hover and stuff like that so hmm all right john's saying that styled components would work really well here because we could just switch the attribute name with javascript hmm uh actually let me let me uh to look at this from a different uh perspective here so i want to try two things one is nikki's idea and it's uh what if we move the link component outside the allies we'll try that first that seems to be the most straightforward thing if it works then great we're done if that doesn't work then what i want to do is let's move the styles onto the a tags and see if we can get a similar effect by putting the styles on the a tag whoa nikki there's a parent selector no way how did i not know about that oh wait a second is there really a parent selector or is that just a suggestion from css tricks all right i'm looking it up right now on can i use on the other screen all right i don't think that's it i think uh i found the um johnny says yes there's a parent selector all right let's try it then seems like it's not but a lot of people want it yeah i want it all right let's let's try moving this around this is gonna be really weird i don't think i don't know if this will work i'm just gonna try with one just to save time did it refresh it i don't think it did let me refresh okay john says the parent selector will be out in css4 all right so i guess i can't use it yet hmm oh you know what i didn't the css is still not not right so it it did work and you know that we now have an li inside of this a tag which actually that that's weird but it works um so we need to have li senior dev a active l i there we go okay that looks like it will work so really wish i didn't have to reload this again but i do it's just so slow i'll check my time while we're waiting all right about 10 minutes i think 10 minutes is more than enough to fix this problem hopefully all right i'm checking out the live chat while i'm waiting for that to load nikki says disclaimer i've never actually used position sticky uh just a possible answer for the problem you should do what you want good to know thanks for that because also the css tricks article on something uh is also a great resource i go to that when mdn starts to confuse me which is often okay that's that is good css tricks is um is pretty good all right cool check that out so we have when we're not on that area we don't have that little border and now when we scroll to it hey there's that little border perfect perfect all right nice really cool all right i like that um i'm thinking maybe the colors could be different uh we're not really using that yellow color in this site so we may want to change that um you may may or may not want to use the gold color for this you know maybe we'll go with you might want to go with uh regular color text with gold on the side um green text with gold on the side i mean there's a lot of combinations so i'm probably not going to get into that for this stream i mean it's pretty basic just changing hex colors on on text here um yeah all right very cool so what i do need to do though is to go back in and make sure i change the markup for that second link as well so that was i believe nikki's idea to put the li inside of the link tag and that was a great idea honestly i thought it would not work but it was such a straightforward change that it was definitely worth the try and it turned out that it did work for some reason my auto formatting is not correcting this mess that i just made um probably when i go to commit it'll get corrected so i'm not going to worry about it but i do want to wait for the refresh just to make sure it's working and i don't think it'll work to go down here because the page isn't long enough i can't actually scroll into the section so i won't be able to test that out but we see if we can see yeah it it won't work right now so if i add some like demo content to this section we can see if it'll work but i'm i'm pretty confident that it will i tested it out earlier with some different stuff and i was getting a change in the uh in the classes for each section and we can see like the the allies here so these look the same now all right let's save that and let's do a git status what why is my chrome bouncing what does it want to tell me i don't know um let's do uh commit now yeah this looks good okay cool um i think there's some low dash stuff we can get rid of like the four each i believe in the map values you know i want to i we can for sure get rid of the four each but i do want to double check about map values so maybe i'll um maybe i'll wait and double check that uh later on before i just get rid of it uh but for now we can do a git add and and we'll run through our yarn so we're going to add a feature and this we add um completed all right i added the word completed in there because i think i may have made a commit already that said we added this um when we had just added some of it and it didn't work yet so while that goes through all the tests and everything i'm going to go over to the live chat and start answering some questions so let me scroll up to where i left off uh devin says you should listen to everything everything spring summer winter dread while you work on this oh i have to all right i'll have to look that up i don't think i've heard that nikki said is it bigger than 16 pixels on windows i think that's let's talk about the scroll bar um devin says i.e scroll bar i thought we were dropping support yeah windows ie for sure has a big scroll bar but i think on windows in general every browser has a big scroll bar it's been a while since i've used windows so i'm i'm not 100 sure but i think the last time i tested on windows which is probably the last time we launched something new uh i i think there were large scroll bars even on on chrome devin says will this even be usable on ie can you just target ie and show a sub nav for spring summer at the top yeah we'll see i'm i'm not even going to try to make it 100 usable and ie uh i mean like think about this is like one page on an entire site that's gonna have thousands of pages most likely um i'm okay if one menu looks a little bit weird i'd actually it would be cool to see what it falls back to i mean i am interested in trying it on internet explorer just to see what happens there's got to be some like fallback position does it fall back to fixed in that case it'll still work it'll just look weird um when it's uh you know in the hero section devin says mixing top and margin right seems weird to me yeah it it definitely is weird uh it there's some weirdness going on with the styles and markup for this component so i think had i made it from scratch instead of importing a little bit from previous projects i maybe wouldn't have done it like that but um this works so i'm definitely i say i'm i'm pretty sure that there's probably a better way to do it um it probably wouldn't look different to the user and it probably wouldn't result i guess i tried to save that webpage all right that's why chrome was bouncing yeah so i i don't know that it would be worthwhile for me to really worry about about that at this point so i mean just to be clear i think writing good code and writing the best solutions is important but you don't always have time for that like i don't think i could make sure all this code is as close to perfect as possible and still get it launched on time uh so what we have to settle for then is does it work and is the code at least reasonable um you know and i that's that's my experience you know with actually working on projects with deadlines and things is that you just you just have to do it sometimes so but anyway i i entirely agree that setting the marge works but the reason we had to do that obviously was because of the float right so um we need that offset for the scroll spy uh so you can see that come into play like so we need that top value uh for the i'm sorry for the sticky so you can see that come into play of this 50 pixels down but then we also need the margin since we decided to use the float which is pretty weird to use with top as well that's why we needed that margin so definitely weird but it gets the job done and i think yeah it went through everything so i also fixed the test i remember yesterday i was saying that the tests were like taking forever so um i believe it was nikki that found the commit where i broke everything and so i was able to go back and um and change everything at some point i made a commit that reverted to an older version of the package json file i'm not exactly sure how that happened but it was about five days ago and so all this week this past week the tests have been acting weird that was why so now it's all worked out we have our test back and they run quickly so i'm going to run a get push to make sure that is on github so you all can check that out if you'd like a link to the github repo is in the description uh frankie s if i'm feeling better today oh thanks for asking frankie this morning i felt good but then after a couple hours my energy was just gone and um actually i was actually felt so good this morning i was thinking about working out i ended up not and just started work like right away uh i did have to take the kids to school so i got the kids ready and i took them to school and um i don't know i still might work out i'm thinking about it i just don't want to go i i don't feel 100 but i don't want to go too long without a workout because i know like with my depression if i go too long without working out i'll get depressed so even though my legs are still sore from my last workout that was two days ago it would be better for my mental health i think if i just do it so hopefully i'll do it and uh but i think this uh this antibiotic that i'm on is is starting to help the congestion is almost completely gone uh so i'm glad it i'm glad it seems like it's it's working because i honestly i've had this on and off i don't know what it is some type of virus or something i don't know on and off for it seems like months uh who knows how long it really was but it just seems like it's been so long um but hey i appreciate you asking thank you oh john says try out right 18 pixels all right i'll try that i'm not going to try it right now i want to test first i think it looks okay with 16 but i'm not opposed to bumping out a bit more if we need to especially for people using windows uh nikki says i also thought it wouldn't work so flipping the lis and the link tags um so that the allies inside the link so you're saying thought that wouldn't work what are the implications of not having the uli structure but a ul a structure a city truth i don't know but we may want to think about that i think visually there's not going to be any implications but for screen readers there might be i maybe i'll have to look at that i'm wondering yeah i mean based on the position and the markup that's actually a really good position i think for screen readers because it's like a sub menu that comes comes in there we'll have to see i mean maybe i might just have to try out just the basic screen reader that comes like on a mac and see what it says when it gets to that point i mean they'll still show up as link tags so user would know that it's it's a link i wonder how misleading anchor tags are for screen readers right because if they show up as a link would a screen reader just describe it as a link like to another page when it's really not it's just the link to a different spot in the same page like what happens when that jump happens does the screen reader also jump down i'm getting kind of off topic here but that's that's really interesting i just don't know you know what is doing that is jumping to a different section in the same page even a good idea for accessibility i don't know i need to learn more about that there's like a whole world of you know making your website more accessible that you know i just don't know enough about um john's pretty sure that li is not needed on uo uh also says chrome used to have an experimental flag to make a skinny scroll bar that shows wider when hovered not smart to develop with that flag on yeah why i mean i could see it would be easier to actually click a wider scroll bar to scroll up and down but i don't know i think that would be annoying for trying to develop stuff with that you're basically changing the width the window with on hover that's not i mean it's only a couple pixels that depending on where your break points are that could totally like make your whole layout reflow just on hover oh okay nikki said i i do have something in my package.json so i have a jest key that i need to remove but also says it's not a huge deal since it's not used now okay so i'll it's not hurting anything then to be there so i'll remove it at some point i guess uh yeah thanks for letting me know about that though that saved me so much time um you know earlier when you when you showed the commit where all that changed uh arthur says hey jesse i'm learning frontend development my problem is that i switch between html css and javascript as priorities i try to create a small javascript project but stop at designing but again uh i get sleepy while learning html css all that best practices and cool stuff um yeah i guess in terms of priorities it's i mean you you need to know you need to know all of it i mean i focus i depending on what you want to do i mean i would focus more on javascript you will pick up your html and css more along the way uh those to me seem to be more simple especially html there's some tricky things to css if you really want to get into it there are some people doing really complex things with css and really cool things but for most of us you know we don't need to be at that level uh for for a lot of the sites that we make so you're probably better off focusing on your javascript and then instead of getting like bogged down in the styles just use a framework like like bootstrap or materialize or if you're doing react you know you could use material ui or you know whatever other framework that way uh you won't get as distracted by the styles in the ui because so much of it is done for you and then maybe have you could maybe possibly set a rule for yourself that you get the site build all the functionality done first before you style um and then that way you know maybe you won't get you know stuck in in that section so i'm not i'm not 100 sure that that's your issue but uh sometimes that that helps me just not get too caught up in designing first because you could end up designing for elements and features that don't even make it into your site and then it ends up being you know a waste of time i mean you always learn from it but you know it did would take up a lot of your time that could otherwise be used to you know add more functionality to your um to your project or you know do more testing and things so um hopefully that that helps all right that's that's it for the um for the live chat and uh we basically accomplished what we set out to which is awesome so uh i i was a little bit bold and i wrote in the description to the video it was either in the description of the video or in my tweet about it i wrote that i will be completing uh this uh scroll spy nav today so when i wrote it i thought like uh what if i don't complete it i'm gonna i'm gonna feel silly but we did we completed it so that's pretty cool um okay arthur has some followup here uh i read a lot of articles watch courses and sometimes don't create a single project yeah i like design and want my projects to look good i struggle mostly with layouts and responses yeah yeah arthur definitely check out some of the frameworks that i mentioned because it'll take care a lot of the respon of the responsiveness i mean it's good to know how that works and writing media queries and things but it's a type of thing that you really only only want to do from scratch once and then either copy what you did for other projects or use a framework because it can be tedious and i think unnecessarily tedious i don't think there's a lot of value in recreating a whole layout system every single time unless you're doing something really experimental um then it's better off just to use something premade in in that case uh something thoroughly tested you know um yeah and make sure really try to do projects i mean it i get into the same thing sometimes where i read a lot of stuff i watch courses and things like that but um uh try to make sure that you're also working on projects maybe split up your time to say like okay i'm gonna spend this much time each day working on a project even if it don't get anywhere like i'm i'm gonna give it a good try and then you can go to your your other resources because it's important to actually be the building as well all right arthur says thanks for answering you're welcome arthas i have that bad feeling do it from zero yeah don't worry nobody does it from zero don't worry about that i used to feel the same way um especially when i was learning like i gotta do it all from scratch but nobody does it from scratch like we were talking about earlier in the stream like if you're building a react project how much work has already been done by the react team at facebook like so much work there's no such thing as from scratch for a react developer um you know there's so in so many things it's not just react if you're using angular if you're using vue uh if you're using any type of testing you know framework uh you know whatever even if you're just using um some boilerplate html code like unless you wrote it yourself and are copying it from a former project like still so i mean we all we all build on uh what others have done and that's i think a good thing uh so so don't worry too much about that as long as you can produce good work um you know i i'd say it's totally fine to rely on you rely uh you know somewhat on the work of others and um frankie says thanks sensei you're welcome i think it's so fun that you uh do you call me sensei um all right okay so i'm gonna end the stream now i've definitely put in um more than my normal amount of time working today and my kids are home from school um so i'm gonna see them and hopefully get a workout in i should be back tomorrow i will be in the office tomorrow we we have like some sort of drill for um in case there's some emergency on campus and it's in the afternoon so i'm going to try not to stream during the time when we're supposed to have the drill because i don't i don't want to have to leave my office in the middle of a stream so i'm thinking maybe in a stream early in the day so early in the day eastern time so just as a heads up to you all um yeah so anyway thanks all thanks everyone especially thanks for all your help uh definitely went faster you know because of all that help and i appreciate all the all the positivity uh that you all have not just today but all the time and until tomorrow have a wonderful day
