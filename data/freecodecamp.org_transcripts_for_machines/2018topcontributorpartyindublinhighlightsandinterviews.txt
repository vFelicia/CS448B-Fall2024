hey everybody welcome to the free code camp 2018 top contributors party in dublin yeah here before we get started i have some very quick announcements uh things that are coming up very soon that i think everybody who's interested in free code camp should know first of all just like last year when free co camp participated in hacktoberfest and hacktoberfest is the month of october it's a big push to get people to contribute to open source last year free code camps guide was the number one most contributed to open source repo as part of hacktoberfest we're taking a lot of the existing repositories we've got learn we've got curriculum we've got the free codecamp slash recording at the main repository uh and then we've got the guide we're working to unify these repos into a single repository that will make it easier for everybody to get the local free code camp running a couple other announcements since you are watching this on the youtube channel according to like the youtube analytics we looked at free code camp is now the fastest growing programming youtube channel uh yeah and we are getting about 50 000 new subscribers a month if you create compelling videos about programming and you're interested we would love to help more people see your instagram content your videos so just reach out to us and we can make that happen but for us we want to put as many amazing videos on youtube as we can we're here in dublin we're at i've got a cool sign for it the huckle tree which is a really cool hipster name i'm gonna try to talk to as many of you all as possible and just interview you and learn more about you so hey i'm here with brianna swift you have been involved with freco camp since basically the beginning maybe you can just give us a high level overview of your involvement with free code camp and and your transition into being a developer yeah so i found free code camp uh while i was an elementary school music teacher i was trying to learn how to code i love kids i love teaching music but i knew it wasn't a career that i wanted to do forever so i was like what can i learn how to do without having to quit my job and go back to school because i couldn't afford to do that and i thought the people that make the internet are probably the first ones to put all of that information for free on the internet um so i did code academy mostly javascript type stuff and found my way onto free code camp i was really involved on twitter that was my only community because i was really kind of alone while i was learning and went through the free code camp challenges and as soon as i started doing that i started to get involved more in the chat room which there was no forum at that point and started doing some pair programming and streaming that so free code camp really not only taught me the fundamentals that i needed for you know for development and for software but also gave me a community and a place to you know commiserate almost with how hard it is to learn how to code and based on your videos on youtube and the skills that you were able to build up just learning the code on your own and through different communities you were able to eventually get a job can you talk a little bit about your job and how you got it yeah yes i work at github which is not where i thought i would be working when i started learning to code i'm a trainer so most of the time i'm talking to developers about how to use git and github so regardless of what language they're programming in regardless of what type of projects how big their team is everybody should probably be using version control and git is not the simplest thing to wrap your head around so it's a similar challenge to these computer science concepts like how can we make this simple and approachable um this you know that transition was weird because going from elementary school music teacher to working at github is kind of a jump but but i think working with those videos specifically and saying how can we take these difficult concepts and make them approachable to anybody is something that really primed me for working at github so i think even if somebody's going through free code camp and if you're going through free code camp and you're like i don't know if i necessarily see myself as a fulltime developer that's okay like there are so many places for you that are perfect for you that you might just not know exist like i didn't know that this job existed but i love it awesome thanks again thank you quincy why don't you just tell us a little about yourself pete sure so my name is pete and i'm a data scientist based in london and i uh write for and help edit the medium publication i've been doing that since about october uh last year so almost a year now and it's it's really fun it's really interesting to see what articles we receive and and you know sort of curating them and helping them to you know the high standards we like to put up what is your editorial workflow like about how frequently will you check in and find articles that you're interested in editing and publishing i see so we do receive a lot of articles there's always something to work on um i i try and check in daily uh i actually take uh my lunch breaks at work uh as an opportunity to you know see what there is and review some of the articles and if i see one i think i can i can help you know edit them get to you know the standard we want then i'll you know i'll claim that article and in that evening i'll work on it and send it to abby for you know final review and publishing so that's thank you thanks peter have a seat richie just give us an overview of some of the things you do yeah so i mean we met a couple of years back you know free call cam was still in its early days and stuff so um so what i do currently is basically run meetups um i'm a core admin um for free call cam johannesburg uh there's a couple of other guys that some came and went and some are still there but some are dormant some are active we needed when needs be um but i'm generally like you know organize stuff and host the meetups themselves we're building uh we're building an events platform that'll make it easier for people in johannesburg when they're just using freecoatcamp to it'll remind them hey there's an event in uh you know at the nearby office uh where you're having your next event so i i'm optimistic that that will help even more people who are already in johannesburg who uh don't realize that you're having all these inperson events that will help get them involved as well absolutely um yeah i mean so like so another aspect of it i mean it's um we were talking about how else uh myself in the evidence we were talking about how else we can contribute like is is this all we can do you know is is that like how do we take it to the next level and i was like my response to that was like that's a very good question brother what do you think and um he's over there so he gave me his peace of mind but like for me i think for now is like we need to continue doing what we've been doing because personally i mean for me the the reason why i believe in this and why i'm still doing what i what i'm doing now is that i see value in this you know i truly believe like this is um one way that we can and i know it sounds very like up in the sky but like i really believe like this is one way of actually tackling poverty um and i see people that are frustrated in their jobs people that they just you know they just go to work just for the heck of it but they don't enjoy it you know and for me i strongly believe in that like you have to really enjoy what you do and i absolutely love what i'm doing right now and thanks to free code camp and i think the way just back to my original point was that um how to take it forward is first of all we need to keep doing what we're doing you know don't drop the standard and obviously think of other ways um of how we can improve it um whether it's um i don't know like just maybe writing articles if you would say you were doing like youtube stuff or you hosting meetups um maybe just you know think of other ways of contributing more or at least getting other people to feel the same passion that you have so that they can also continue and and contribute to the platform in in different ways richie it's been such a pleasure man thank you so much for flying out here well david you are a prolific uh writer among other things and i think you have a very interesting background can you tell the audience a little bit about yourself and how you got into coding and writing about code okay first of all quincy i'm really grateful to you that you created free code cam because i think it was really the major helper for me to switch my careers because as you mentioned i was working as a lawyer i have a law degree and then i was working as a lawyer for two years but then i got eventually a little bit frustrated and i was wondering what to do next so i was checking online courses and stuff and if i think first i checked some harvard course about cooking about molecular gastronomy and i spent like three months doing that but i said to me okay i cannot be cooked because i'm sweating and in the kitchen there's a lot of hot in here so i couldn't cook so i tried to watching for something else and then i find first some course on udemy about uh programming css html and javascript and i tried that but then it was just a tutorial you know building things that other people built so it was kind of it was great i got motivated but it was just the first level and then i discovered free code camp and those algorithms and it was basically a different dimension for me because before i was just creating stuff according to tutorials but with the with the algorithms i need to really understand and at first i got really frustrated because i think oh my god it's so difficult i cannot be developer but then it really just was better and better and finally i got really confident and really i started learning to code during the weekends and on the evenings and it eventually took me seven months to switch from a lawyer to developer just coding into on the weekends and the night so i'm really grateful for free coach ken because it really motivated me to see all the people doing the same thing is although so why i decide for contributing for free code cam by writing articles because you know a free code cam community helped me to become developer and i also wanted to contribute to it by by showing people concepts that were difficult for me so i try to like describe them in a way that are more understandable for me and in a way that i want them to be to see them when i learn them because there were no resources before yeah and that's i think the part of my story and maybe just the the main thing what i decided to change switch the careers was that as a lawyer i didn't see the results of my work and as a as a programmer i mean you write console.log and you see the result is it's so motivating you just write code and you see the result i love this and this is why i love programming cheers so tell us a little bit about uh about what you're working on out in portugal uh eduardo and you're leading the study group there well uh i i first knew free code camp in the beginning of 2017 and i was a civil engineering and i was not happy with my career i wanted to reboot into into programming and when i'm at free code camp i'm at the right path uh to start learning how to program i've tried a lot of boot camps without effort but with free code camp it was very very easy to to follow follow up and and at the same time that i was studying uh i started to motivate people to study with me i started at the same time as jerome enrique and together we started the study group in our city uh and we impersonated also the starting of the study group in lisbon the capital of portugal and we are doing that effort every week even after we get got our jobs yeah i've rebooted my career in five months studying more or less 10 hours per day but it was uh nats it was five months and i got from civil engineering to a frontend developer how many people within your study group have gotten developer jobs do you think yeah first quincy let me tell you that we are in the south of portugal so it's a small town like 50 000 inhabitants and in the last year we got five five developers ready to start working and they started working so i think it's a nice percentage so basically one out of 10 000 people in your town has gotten a developer job thanks largely to your efforts and your community outreach you're great yeah it was nice to meet you robert have a seat man thank you thank you you lead the free cocaine vienna group along with daniel deutsch who who couldn't make it uh he's a student uh tell us a little bit about the origins of free code camp vienna which i think you said is about three years old now yeah it is it is um yeah it's like there's so much to say but um it basically started i i now have a developer job and i mainly attribute that to free code camp which is awesome and when i started as a student shortly after there's this there was i think it still is that this is getting started guide and you're getting courage to check up your local group there was no local group but there was a nice guide saying if there is no local group start a facebook group this is how you do it so i did uh and then no one came so i asked my wife to join i invited her we were two then like this is probably just in the span of a couple of days there were still no more people joining so i got impatient so i think i texted you on gitzer or something i was like i don't know if quincy larson will reply to me but he replied and it was awesome and i was asking can i start a meetup.com group because i knew meetups from my city there's a quite a bit of them thinking that that's the way i could get more people involved because i wanted to meet other students right um and then i did that and you replied like yeah of course sure just keep in mind it cost money and stuff and i was like that's fine so that's basically how it started in the format that we have now we've been going almost three years like this i think november or december take care all right thank you well elephant thank you so much for flying in from greece you are a very prominent person in the freco camp community especially recently you've been live streaming a whole lot of videos you've been creating videos on things like angular it's it's incredibly helpful tell us a little about how you got into tech and how you started deciding to record all this and share all this knowledge okay uh well i wanted to learn and firstly i wanted to learn for me and for myself but i knew that eventually i wanted to find a job and i wanted to be sure that everything i know i can also uh like go to another person and maybe teach them so i said okay how can i do that so let's start coding in my computer as always and then i'm going to record these videos and if they're very good then i'm going to upload them so basically that's how i started i wanted to pass this knowledge to other people and make sure that i also know these things thank you very much ben is a prolific contributor to free code camp i think i've spent more time pairing with him than pretty much anybody in the free code camp community uh gosh let me let me let me just let me just recount some of the things you worked on so you were you were very heavily involved in the javascript curriculum which pretty much everybody who's watching this has probably tried at some point um you created the challengeomatic which was the tool to make it easier to contribute challenges well tell us a little about yourself you're here in dublin right yeah yeah so i am based here i am currently kind of a college student uh detergent my degree is all work placement so i'm currently a working man for a year in kernel development actually which is a complete pivot from javascript but yeah well what are some things that uh aside from kernel development and hopefully getting back into free co camp contribution what are some areas of technology since you're somebody who is you know at many different places in the stack and has a pretty good bird's eye view on on how things are moving what are some things that really excite you about tech information technology and the way things are going in terms of new things um i guess there's a lot of scope for i guess like this is trying to unlock but the tight integration of technology and people i feel like there's a lot of issues that are are not serious enough that they needed a solution in the past but it becomes so easy to solve that they will be um a great example is the the whole health technology kind of revolution the way everyone's getting their heart rate constantly about and all that kind of stuff and there's been many cases of people fighting that they have asip or atrial fibrillation if you want the full global thing uh because of their smart watch i think there's an article really really about an apple watch that alerted a person to it um and it's stuff like that that can you know makes huge differences to lives because they're you know if you find that you've atrial fibrillation you need to get it sorted and it's fine if you sort it and if you don't you get yourself a lot of trouble so there's all kinds of applications of health technology in particular that are not only really exciting because they're cool but they're also really exciting because they're good they're doing a good thing in the world quincy it's great to talk to you live yeah matt uh tell us a little bit about uh your background and what you're doing so i'm i'm originally a music teacher i studied music at university um taught guitar on piano for several years um and then which i still do actually just a little bit um in the evenings and weekends um but i realized um it wasn't the career for me i wanted something which had a bit more direction had more of a challenge um and i met a friend who i'd not seen in a long time and uh he studied music with me and he was like oh i'm a developer now like how did how did that happen and uh i knew that well i found a lot of courses online and sort of taught myself and then a couple of years later and developed first it's incredible and uh so i started just looking around different resources um and this was so this was uh like three and a half years ago four years ago um so i was started with a lot of courses on coursera edx and those kind of things which were really good because they had these kind of deadlines so you had to get the project in by a certain time and then people peerreviewed them um and then listened to a lot of podcasts and i think i feel it was probably javascript java you were on and you were talking about free codecamp or maybe it was code newbie maybe both and um and i heard about free code camp and started trying that out and and realized actually this is this incredible free platform um and yeah just got really into it and got quite disciplined about doing it every day and then uh and then i heard about these meetups that were going on and um which at first i was i'm not good enough to go along to these i bet everyone's amazing and you know very uh i was quite intimidated but i forced myself to go and then met people who were very similar to me you know some people who were above me some people who weren't quite where i was and um and found that really and suddenly it was oh you know maybe i can do this and yeah it's gone from there really that's awesome so describe the transition uh you're a musician and just looking at the different steps you would need to take and planning out your progression as it became clear and clear to you what you needed to do yeah i think yeah to begin with it's it's fine just to accept you're not going to learn everything in one go i think some people think they maybe do it for a week and think i feel like i don't know too much yeah i'm never gonna be able to do this it's so this just it can be overwhelming um it's good just to yeah just do it initially which i think i did just to try a few things out and just just enjoy it really not necessarily i mean think i need to do this and become a developer as soon as possible i think it's good to take your time just to yeah try try some things out and but then as you enjoy it more hopefully and get a sense that it is what you want to do trying to um find ways to keep yourself motivated in my case it was initially doing these courses which had deadlines at the end of the week and then in the meetups thinking okay there's another meetup in two weeks i'd like to be able to show something to someone by then you know sometimes you feel like if you go along and you've not done anything since last time it's like oh you know i should have done it it's a nice kind of motivator having some peers around you i think it's very easy to sort of stay by yourself and get a bit isolated but you know what we try and encourage with the meetups is to get people to come along and just you know talk to people um see where everyone else is don't feel shy about it everyone's there to help each other we're not about you know criticizing i mean it might be constructive criticism but um yeah thanks again matt knows timo is a prolific contributor i think i was talking about you earlier when we were going around in the circle but you've contributed an incredible amount and if you look on the github repo and look rank everything by commits you're way up there what are some of the ways that you've contributed to the free cooking community over the past year and a half or so so when it started out it was almost exactly two years ago now um i started with making small changes mostly to the curriculum uh small fixes to the test mostly so it was a test that was missing correct uh solutions or it was allowing solutions that shouldn't be allowed i try to fix those and that's mostly what i started out doing and then i found out about the freak out game guide being developed and actually you had quite a bit of time at the time that it uh was the next development and uh i got involved and i spent a lot of time on uh contributing to the freak out combined to the platform not the articles the content but to the platform the site around it yeah well thanks for all your articles so far sam they've been they've been great and very well received by the community yeah thank you virtually like the first article i wrote i was i wrote it just because i was in china and i hated the great the great firewall of china and i sent it to you and said can you have a look and you said you loved it and actually made me an author on the uh on the free code camp media mask on the medium publication and that just gave me the boost i needed every other article before that i got like 5 10 maybe 15 viewers getting on the free code camp thing boosted me and gave me the confidence to write more and that was really big for me what would be your advice to those people who already have kind of a traditional engineering training but are interested in pivoting into software development if you're interested in pivoting into software at all give it a try stuff like free code camp and there's hundreds of other free resources out there they're all absolutely brilliant i learn most of the stuff i know now through free code camp it's free it has stepbystep tutorials that give you really good feedback as you're progressing through and the worst that happens is you try it out you do two or three months and you find that you don't enjoy it that much thanks again for coming out man it's great great to finally meet you richard i'm so thrilled we've talked so many times we've been in touch richard is in charge of preco camp leads precode cam oslo and the free cocaine instagram which has i don't know 10 000 ish like 13 and a half or something now somebody dropping 13s i think yeah yeah and it's it's great photos of freco camp events and just beautiful workstations and code setups and things like that yeah all that stuff all the good stuff yeah what are your goals so you really took charge on the instagram and i mean you owned it for you were already very prolific on instagram you had a lot of your own photos you had a ton of followers yourself and you really took the free cocaine instagram which was largely just chilling there because i think i was the only person who had access to it at the time and and and now it's it's quite vibrant and there's a lot of beautiful photos on there can you describe that process of thinking like hey maybe i could help out with this and and how you went about it yes so i think um people took it from about three thousand at the time uh are you saying it was like underutilized i think the thing i think you were very um very very good on twitter and things like that that stuff was doing it um and what i was doing on my own instagram uh was just pictures of my code stuff i'm working on um and things like that so we had the conversation about doing some stuff for the free code campaign to it have a lot more of the community stuff in there as well trying to reupload other people's pictures um regram them or whatever they call that um so that's kind of what we tried to do get the community thing more in there and just try and try and build that up and have a bit more of a community a bit more so other people could um you know get involved in that as well so that was the plan yeah yeah and uh early on you you made it a clear point that people could basically add mention free code camper hashtag freako camp on instagram and we could basically signal boost their photos and and of course credit them and everything uh are people still doing that pretty regularly we need them to do it more do it more especially to do with if there's meetups going on that stuff's great so if we've got a meet up and you've got a picture of all the groups and stuff like that we love that stuff so like send those stuff but um yeah i'm constantly going in there checking the hashtags or if you've been tagging us in them directly as well trying to find the good stuff out there and posting it on there so um if if people send me the good stuff then it means i don't have to do anything so that's kind of what we want to do for sure for everything you're doing richard andera has contributed extensively to free code camp uh through the free co camp guide and also publishing articles on medium tell us a little bit about yourself and how you discovered free code camp and decided to contribute to it okay um at the moment i'm a student actually just started like last week university um the my journey with frequent camp started when i um moved from like g sharp to javascript because i needed to learn node.js for like a server application and uh i basically discovered frequent camp to learn javascript then i started like reading the articles on the medium publication and when i decided that i wanted to also write articles it just felt natural to go to publish the articles on the media publication and then from there like the involvement with the community just like grew uh gradually yeah how old are you 18. oh wow you're getting really into uh really deep into technology pretty young and that's that's excellent yeah i actually like started my first experiences with coding like at 12. um the story goes basically oh i like games why not make one and then like i just started with the software that lets you just create the game with drag and drop stuff and then you say oh i want to add this like cool feature i will learn some scripting and then oh program is super cool i will learn this all right cheers all right i'll just grab the camera um so matt's over here we're gonna take a big group photo and then we're gonna gracefully leave thank you so much for tuning in for the stream we got to talk to a lot of exciting people doing exciting work both within the free cocaine community and just working as developers so i hope you all have a beautiful evening
