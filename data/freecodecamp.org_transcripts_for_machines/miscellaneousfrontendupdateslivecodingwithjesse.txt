hey everybody it's Jesse and uh if you saw the description for this video it's very vague because today as you can see I have my todo list up and I just need to get through some of this stuff normally I try to pick out something that I haven't done before or that I think might be interesting and I I do that during my streaming time but there's really not much left on the todo list that I think is really that interesting the link to this Trello board is in the description you can check it out if you see something in one of these three columns that hasn't been done yet that sounds really interesting let me know in the live chat or even in the comments to the video if I if you comment if you're watching the recording and you comment before I'm done with this site then maybe I could do it but for now I've just been working on some of these didn't get to do as much as I had hoped today because I had some meetings this morning and can't I I always don't like when I have a lot of meetings because it just feels like I don't get anything done uh I'm sure the important stuff does get done in meetings but you just can't see it I'm going to check the live chat here before we get into any code hey everybody a lot of people saying hi in the live chat all right Peter says you he usually joins in about an hour after the stream starts but this time he is early so awesome okay uh okay Jaden asks what are you doing now all right so I'll show you what I was just working on um right before this stream started uh so basically I was working on this add adding images to the resource section so we uh I think I streamed some of this before um I mean we've definitely streamed a lot from that section that Resource page we're doing a lot on there so let me show you what I've done and uh I'm on if you're following the the GitHub repo I'm on the branch for uh called resource images uh so so the stuff isn't in the master Branch yet it's not live yet but basically I I just pulled in these images and everything's working like I wanted it to I'll show you how I did this in a second but what I was doing was I was checking the width of the image and if the image width was less than 600 pixels then I not displaying it because at at some point I think when you get down to like here then this image is almost 600 pixels there so I need it to look good um at some point it would be nice to optimize it even further maybe and use some responsive images but that's not really necessary at this point uh at least you know it's more important just to get the images up at this point than to really be nitpicky about the speed um but here's the problem when I scroll down here these images are I mean these don't look like they're 600 pixel images they look all stretched out uh so and especially you know if you zoom in like you can really tell so somebody's looking at this on the small screen like this let me scroll down to here I mean look that's just not that doesn't look good now this is what I was trying to avoid by setting that that limit uh or that minimum width so I'm waiting on some information back from the person who uploads the images so what I'm thinking I'm basically when I go to look at the uh at the data I'm getting from WordPress which I'll show you here what I'm getting um if there is an image it shows up like this so a better featured image and it has it gives me the width of the original image so all of these images are showing that the original image has this a width of at least 600 pixels and then when I go to let me show you the one that that I just showed you that's not really great quality so this link should this will take me to the image the full image that's supposed to be 666 pixels wide okay look that's definitely you know a wide image but that's not quality so what what I think happened maybe is that when I I had sent an email saying you know if you're going to upload pictures make sure they're 600 pixels wide at least or they're not going to show up so what I think happened is um they resized the images so they took the small images and just resized them to 600 pixels and then uploaded them which of course is not it it's going to look like this so I'm waiting for confirmation um back that that is in fact what happened and if that's the case I'll just have to provide clear instructions that we don't want the images resized as soon as I hear back from that one way or the other then I can merge this with uh the master branch and I can make it live I'm not like thrilled how this looks so I don't know maybe I'll take I won't include these images unless I have them all for all of these these I don't know what do you think to me like this this just looks really weird that you know this is very small and these are now huge also I'm not sure about when I go down you know to like this size so this would be more like somebody on their phone I don't even know if I want to have images on this side this is ends up being a really long scroll I mean there's only a few images but if you can imagine like what if most of these had images you'd be scrolling forever I'm thinking of maybe just not doing any images for small screens load times will be much better which is great because if you're on your mobile and you're on your data plan you don't want to load a bunch of images anyway so let me know what you think about that I'm I'm still undecided as of yet so uh your your input would be very much appreciated all right so I'm just going to switch to another branch and work on something else uh until I I hear back so I don't even know if I'll hear back today uh or if it'll be until next week so I would I kind of hoped that I could get this going and get this live today but uh we'll see I definitely don't want it to be live with those images looking uh like that so trying to find my console here so I'm thinking about just switching back I moved this into like the testing area just so that I know it's basically done I'm just waiting on on some info here I was thinking about going back to that search bar uh so we got this working and uh remember there are just a few optimizations that I wanted to make and I didn't do any styling on the search bar at all so it definitely it doesn't look like I want it to look so I was thinking about switching back to this branch and just doing that so if there's any objections to going back and finishing up with this uh search page let me know I know we did spend a while on that before so uh if you're tired of that tell me maybe I can find something else to do I just looks like I got a bunch of stuff in the live stream so I'm going to check the live stream now really quickly just to see if you uh have some feedback for me before we start okay so uh Asar says is Fabian here today to save Jesse and uh yeah in case you haven't seen the past few streams uh Fabian uh and I'm not even sure if I'm pronouncing your name right Fabian so if you hear this uh let me know cuz he's from Paris so maybe it's more like Fabian or something like that I don't really know um he did save me he submitted a pool request and it was just awesome and um his way to deal with the problem I was dealing with was way better than my way and it worked and um and then he actually joined in the next day in the Stream and and basically step byep that like coached me through how to get the search function to work so super helpful uh but I don't know if he's here today he hasn't said anything in the live chat so we'll see hopefully he is here and uh a lot of the stuff I'm going to be doing today isn't like super difficult stuff so I don't think I'll get stuck to the point where I'm just I'm totally lost um uh mamadu says hello what is it about this live I'm not sure I'm not sure what you're asking so um if you can clarify that for me that would be great and I'll I'll try to answer okay Rohan says uh you put images on the left or right side just color the card the color of the image uh Philly says why not make the images only appear when you hover the mouse okay that's possible you should add hyperlinks for the images David says you should hyper links um Rohan thinks it would be too abrupt to add the hover oh vet said made a few fixes for f marcom okay so we got another Pool request I will check that out um I'll check that out after the stream uh let me know what what parts of the site are they fixes for because uh if you could just quickly let me know in the live stream that way I won't try to mess with them right now and uh you know do the work that you've just done but I really appreciate that and I will check that out as soon as I'm done oh John says use flex justify to stretch uh justify content stretch to fill the heights um and then change with media queries I I have I actually was doing something like that before I wasn't using Flex because the the way that I have the cards now in the columns it um it didn't work right basically like I well I should say it it was easier I don't I'm not it's hard for me to describe how I did it but basically I did something very similar to that uh John's suggestion was to you know like fill the Heights and make them the the same height so uh I might go back to that if I I'll see I'll play with some stuff uh like I said but I'm not going to mess with it anymore until I um until I hear back about what's going on with those images all right thanks V yeah I figured you added a description in the pool request V says he had a description I just wanted like just like a very quick what are they about cuz um I I didn't want to like go over the uh the request um during the live stream wow okay awesome v um it seems like he did a lot of stuff I'm definitely going to check that out uh please says uh W wahaj says Please add some black UI where you want to add the black UI Andre asks about the Trello power power up oh yeah the Trello power up is I added it so long ago I don't even remember what it was let's see what I have activated um it's not even why is it not showing up you know what maybe it's not a PowerUp maybe it's um this might be a browser plugin let see B all right it's called burndown for Trello and I think it's actually a browser plugin and not a not a power up in Trello so I'm using the free version it works for me uh full version lets you do cool stuff with charts like burn down charts and things all right so let me get to work uh I'm going to do this there were no objections uh that I saw to working on the search so I'm going to go to that that's probably is the most like technically challenging thing on the list right now uh so maybe that would be more appealing uh to everyone especially uh for those of you who are a little bit more advanced uh it it would be more appealing some of this other stuff is just really basic uh so let me switch to that Branch there we go live search okay so switch to the live search branch and I always get weird I said not always I often get an error when I switch try to switch branches there we go and I just need to manually refresh uh it's something with a hot module reloading uh messes up when I switch so so we got the resources page here's our search bar in case you didn't see when we made this search bar uh basically as soon as we search for anything uh we have um like a live search let me search for something that's legit okay so we have uh you know this actually has I've typed in the first part of this name so it actually shows up there uh and then not only that if I clicked on these it would keep whatever I searched for and then I could sort by these same categories so it keeps all the Sorting I thought I added a in height maybe I just talked about adding a in height and didn't do it I think I did add it to Trello though so um actually that's a good one to start with I can at least get something checked off the list let me see let me see if I added this I guess I didn't I didn't even add it to Trello so I probably just forgot about it completely maybe that was one of the days where I had to leave like immediately or go to a meeting immediately after the stream there was one stream where I really pushed it and I ended the stream at like 259 and I had a meeting at 3 and I had to just run over uh all right so basically I want to add here's what I want to do and this is easy I don't like that when I type something in and there's nothing it just totally shrinks up like this so I'm going to add a Min height I did have I remember some other suggestions about animating this transitions but um for now I'm just going to add a Min height uh because as I mentioned before in an earlier project uh it's getting to the point where I just like I need to be done I think uh people you know higher up than me my bosses and their bosses are thinking like you know why is this project dragging on they haven't said it like that but that's the feeling that I'm getting so uh I need to just finish it up and I don't want to spend like 13 hours a day like I was doing trying to get this finished so I got to just be I got to just use some judgment on what's what's really necessary and what's just kind of more nitpicky uh to do so let me go to the code here where I'm at resources and I am using next also I'm not I'm not watching the live chat like really diligently right now so I'm going to be going back and forth but I'd like to maybe uh complete a task and then go back to the chat and uh just go back and forth like that uh for maybe like an hour or 45 minutes and then I'll I'll go back to the chat and I'll answer questions um let's see actually yeah today uh as I'm looking for this I I'm going to fill you in on some of the um some of the stuff that's been happening here uh since this this show is about just the daytoday job that I'm doing as a frontend developer uh so I like to fill you in on some of the other stuff that happens when I'm not live streaming just to give you a better picture of what my job is like I don't really know if this is my job is a good example what frontend developers jobs are normally like or not I work at a university so um I imagine a lot of universities do need Developers for their sites so in that sense it's maybe like that but probably not like a tech company would have uh I think this is the column the row that we need actually need more than the row I like the section to have a so if you haven't worked with react before this is going to freak you out to put the CSS right here um but I'm going to do it here I could also put it here okay so I have been using this you know style J X tag and I can write the CSS just like regular CSS in here um but if I'm going to do something to just one element I usually just put it in line I there's there's no point in me just doing it down here if it's only applying to one element at least that's that's the way I feel it's easier for me to see immediately what's happening because it's right here I don't have to like look at the class and then go down here and figure fig it out so I'm sure there are other opinions and pros and cons to doing it a different way but that's how I'm going to do it so um I can just type in style and I'm explaining this in case you know there might be some people watching that aren't familiar at all with with react or anything so I'm kind of explaining some things that I know I've explained before might be some basic to some some of you who are more Advan so just kind of bear with me all right so we're going to go style and uh we're going to start with our brackets here here and these curly brackets mean in a react component this means that we're we're going to write some JavaScript we're telling react like hey expect JavaScript now and then inside of that I have more curly brackets so since we're in JavaScript land inside of here this simply means hey this is an object right that's normal you know you put the curly brackets just an object so when you want to write CSS in your component you do it at least in in next you do it like this I'm not sure if it's like this by default for reacts or this is a next thing let me know uh because I haven't done a lot with react when I'm not using next with it as well I've tried some stuff but uh weback just crushed me the first time I tried it so um I didn't really get very far uh so I want to go Min height oops and when you're doing it in here uh you can camel casee it so pretty much all pretty much every C I haven't run into any CSS uh attributes that I couldn't camel case and make it work just in case you don't want a camel case you don't like that I could put this in quotes and just use it like normally but uh I think the camel case is fine uh once you get used to it it's it's all right but I can understand if you're going back and forth between regular CSS and this it could be confusing so you might want to just stick to it now the second property you usually want to put quotes around it uh I'm not sure you may be able to get away with putting the number like just a straight number value uh without quotes but I just always use the quotes no matter what even if I don't have to uh I'm going to give this maybe 500 pixels and just see I kind of feel like we already played with this a little bit and then I just forgot the value that we settled on um but we'll try 500 pixels at first and this will just be in nice um demonstration see so uh not nearly the same type of jarring transition could probably get away with doing a little bit higher but I'm all right with that oh you know what we need to make one more change uh and we made this last time and uh see this is a good example of uh when you make a change like in Dev tools and then you put it off off actually coding it um then you have to do it all over again that's exactly what happened here on a maybe a few days ago we did a video and I made all these changes but I only did them in Dev tools and then I didn't code them so um at least it's I I remember what I had to do uh but this could have been a lot of wasted effort if I didn't go back to this for a couple of weeks and just totally forgot so basically I'm vertically aligning uh whatever is in this container and I'm using my the framework that I'm using for the UI is uh materialized the material design framework and it has this nice class here well these two classes V the V align wrapper and then Vine and then anything in this container is vertically aligned so that's really nice that's cool because it it's based on uh Flex so browsers don't support F Flex it won't work with so um like if you view the site right now in Internet Explorer 11 none of the vertical line Works everything just goes right to the top uh but I'm not super worried about supporting Internet Explorer 11 right now based on the analytics uh that we have for a lot of our other sites we have very few visits from people using Internet Explorer 11 so it's not really worth it's not a good use of my time to optimize anything for Internet Explorer at this point uh so that should fix it so if we go back yep now everything's at the top it'll stay at the top we don't get there we go very nice uh and at least much nicer than before uh I think it was I think Rohan gave the suggestion to animate this and um I I I mentioned before but I think that's an awesome suggestion but like I said I'm I'm that's kind of nitpicky I'm not sure how many people will even you know be UPS about that that transition so uh if I do get time I will definitely put it in uh if not it won't make it although Rohan if you really want to you can submit a pool request uh to to do that um I don't I don't expect you know anybody to take their time to to work on this for me but if you want to then I really appreciate it so the next thing we need to do is figure out how we want this to look right now I have it taking up half but I wanted to my idea was I was going to have a drop down as well so there would be a search and then there'd be a drop down and the drop down would have like basically the equivalent of what tags would be normally like in a blog like in in a WordPress blog you have categories and tags since we have these already and these basically act as like broad categories that's okay I mean that works but I I the people that I'm making the site for had in mind kind of a drop down with some more some categories that were focused on the content so these are the type of content but something that was focused more on the uh the content itself like you know what what the topic is so I don't know that I'm going to add that in right now uh number one reason basically being we have not decided on what the topic should be so I'm not putting in a drop down if there's nothing to go in the drop down and uh I don't really want to go through right now and try to pick out topics that's I don't I don't think that's really it's not really what I should be doing I think someone else more familiar with all of this content could do a better job than I can so I'm going to wait on that I I'll probably let I'll let somebody else know about it and at that point maybe I can add this uh I kind of want to see what this would look like if it was all the way across I think it might look weird on a wider screen I don't know what do you think would it be better to put it all the way across that that'll look fine on a smaller screen maybe uh all right here's my idea right now let let me know what you think on a large screen it's just going to go halfway like this on a small screen it's going to be all the way across also uh is this is this clear enough that you can search here or do you think this needs do I need an icon should I throw in a little search icon in here or are the word search uh plain enough here also I definitely need to change this color this was the default color that I've added uh I have like kind of a little starter theme uh just for styles that I use for all my projects and the this is one of the University's official colors uh but this site doesn't use University colors because it's a like a separate it's part of the University but it's kind of a separate undertaking in some ways so they get to use a different color palette all right I'm going to check the live chat really quick to see what you all think about this before I make any changes okay uh so uh mom mama mama do it's m m a d oou I'm not sure how to pronounce that please let me know how to pronounce that so I can do it right I don't I don't want to keep mispronouncing it uh if if I am uh clarified the earlier question he says I mean what is he coding for so uh I'm coding for um I work at a university so I'm coding a website for one of the Endeavors of the University it's kind of like a new um Department uh thing that they've started they've they're they have this other company that's creating a learning management system from scratch based on Drupal uh for people to be able to get like certification so they're not going to get a full degree but they can get a certification through this online learning management system that they're building the website that I'm coding is kind of like the marketing informational site that people can go to before they're directed to the actual learning management system and at that point they can sign up for an account and pay for it and do courses and stuff so that's that's what I'm coding right now um Sr says I think you should now start coding you're getting late I age thanks thanks for the reminder if you've watched any of my shows you know I I can talk a little bit uh and not code wahaj says change your Navar on top uh it look it looks really old um you mean like this Navar like this sticky nav that's kind of floating here is that or like the whole one the whole thing here I'm I'm not going to disagree uh with you about certain Design Elements uh this site is a mix of design elements that were in a site that was built previous to this or at least partially built and some design elements that I added so I will say um not all the design decisions on this site were from me I did have to compromise on a lot of things um so but if you have suggestions and I can change them I will change them but I I am not I don't have the freedom to change the design to whatever I want at least not without having more meetings and discussion so but I'm definitely interested in and like uh wah and and maybe you explaining more what you mean and how I could change it um rested ask which framework are you using using for that uh it's materialize is the the uh like CSS JS framework and then I'm using react uh but particular nextjs to like scaffold the react app oh Patrick says isn't there supposed to be a visual representation of what page you're on in the Navar it doesn't seem like it is working um actually no I didn't build that in uh the visual representation it is on my list though or at least I I remember it being maybe right now it's not like that I could make it like that and maybe I should maybe I should put that on the list that would be helpful um so maybe that'll go on the list I don't know if that'll be uh my boss is kind of reviewing my list right now to see like what things actually need to get done and what can kind of just be left left off so I don't know if if that'll make it onto what needs to be done but uh that's probably a good idea uh in regard to the case for the CSS like that I was talking about here when I was putting it in line in react Patrick says uh the react way to do it is camel case Okay um all right Rohan says he he'll do the pool request so awesome thank you and don't don't feel like you have to do it tomorrow if you if you don't get to it that's fine I mean you're you don't have to do it at all if you don't want to uh bill says um I think a search icon would be a good idea oh awesome Bill uh Bill actually sent me a link to the site he's doing with next as well and uh it's awesome I was really impressed with the code um bill I like how you were um like you were making API calls in your server.js file like where I was doing it in the in the component like in the page in the get initial props you're doing it on the server I was really kind of checking that out I'd like to know you don't have to answer me now you could like message me on Twitter but I'd like to know your reasoning behind that um what's the benefit of doing it like that and also how does that work um like let's say if you were going to do a live search thing like this where all these calls to the API are being made like within the component like on the client side how how would that work would would I have is there any way um to do this differently I don't know I just kind of want your thoughts on that cuz I'm I'm really intrigued by it and I like the idea of using the uh the URL to the WordPress back end uh making that environment variable and kind of like hiding it uh I don't really need to hide it for most of my sites but if I ever did I'm going to keep that in mind uh go everybody's saying seems like everybody's saying go for the icon so let's go with the uh icon uh John saying also maybe a box Shadow uh underneath the line okay Rowan's saying sticky nav could be a bit bigger it looks kind of weird okay and let's see Ro robot Villa says the ux guideline text text plus icon enhances usability all right thanks for that you're you're right you are right about that I will add that John says 75% length might would look better all right so let me let me just Su of the suggestions here and let's do it so for sure we we need to add a search icon okay everybody's is on board with that um we've had a suggestion to make this 75% instead of half and then also slightly unrelated suggestion was make the text in the white background section to be aligned Center all right actually I will say this there there was quite a controversy over how to align these sections so I'm not going to mess with the alignment of this right now just because there there was finally consensus among all the people involved in the project of and and the conclusion ends up being the homepage the first section on the homepage will be Center aligned and on every other page it will be left align and everything will be left align so that's one of those decisions that I'm I'm not going to revisit uh I'm just going to leave it as it is at this point because there is there are so many opinions about it um but I I appreciate the uh saying that all right so let me throw in an icon here I'm I am I'm loading I think I'm loading the material icons but um I I'd rather use an inline SVG icon I like using those better and then that way I can just not load the rest of the material design icons and use just the ones I want so I'm going to do it like that and I think I use this in a project recently trying to remember what project it is so I can just grab the code it'll probably be faster for me to just get it so uh let's go to material Z icons uh what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to grab the the code from the SVG so like the SVG tag and I'm going to stick it right in there if anybody knows of a reason why that's not a good idea let me know I've been doing it on a lot of sites lately I haven't had any issues with um like browsers not being able to display that uh but if there is some issue that I just haven't figured out yet and you know about it please let me know uh the alternative would be loading like font a font icon set and uh just load using the font icon uh so usually I just go here to material icons I select SVG and it downloads it looks like I've already downloaded this but I'll do it again because it's just going to be faster and then I open it I would rather it not open in the browser because then I don't have to view the source but this gives me a nice SVG I know that's super small it'll get bigger when I I paste it in uh so that gives me a nice SVG tag and I can put it in here so I can put it directly in here in the label and we'll see it in a second it'll need some extra styling but um at least you see actually it's probably not is it going to work I I may have to change some of the um fill height vbx with maybe not I'll have to see sometimes you have to change the uh the attributes because they don't work in react uh like as you would normally use them so we'll see if it all right it worked I'm not getting uh I would have gotten like the pink screen with an air if it didn't work so I just could not remember hm obviously I'm going to change the color of this it's going to be more gray but what do you think about the entire search icon going up like that I don't know that I like that I don't even know that I like it right here would it be better on the end I mean this obviously is the easiest way to do it let me know I'm going to um change the length of this while I give you all a chance to weigh in on where you you think this should go in materialized they have this this column classes similar to bootstrap or other Frameworks uh so I'm just going to give this a column class of let's see nine and that'll give me that 75% but I also want to I want to do that on medium screens and on a small screen I want to do 12 so you can see it's pretty easy to handle columns it's just small screen it's a 12 column layout so 12 means full width um and then obviously for 12 columns uh 34s of 12 column 75% is n so we should see there we go okay so now we have that 75% length here let me know what you all think about that uh if that's okay and when we get to it should be 600 pixels or less yep then we get it all the way across so not bad actually you know what I want to test and I totally forgot about this right now we're searching on key up but we will that work on mobile let me know if you've dealt with this before uh do key up events even fire on mobile like on that virtual keyboard or not I mean I'll I'll be able to test it and find out so it's it's not a a big deal if uh if you don't know you know uh but if you happen to be on your phone or have your phone on you and and would like to test actually you can't because this isn't live yet so I'm I'll have to wait and test it uh or at least just look it up all right so the uh the delay on the video is probably it's it's probably been enough time that you've heard my question about this so I'm going to check the live chat okay so uh Rohan um says the font icon is usually too big and not worth it for just one icon yeah I agree the why load all those icons if you just need a few of them that's why I'm using these svgs I've also had issues with certain browsers not displaying my font icons especially when I I've used font awesome for icons I don't know if any of you have had the issue the same issue but occasionally I actually had somebody look at one of my sites and uh lift some really nasty messages on the University's Facebook um uh page there was a post that that was linking to the uh particular site I did and was like super uh upset that the font icons wouldn't work and claiming that we didn't know what we were doing um which I don't know maybe I didn't know what I was doing but it had worked on all the other browsers I tested so anyway I've decided to kind of get away from using full font icon sets and just using svgs because I've had more luck with svgs working uh John recommends uh making sure the SVG code is simpli ified and clean um yeah definitely I don't need all that stuff in the SVG so that might be worthwhile to just do on the live stream in case somebody hasn't worked with svgs so um let me see which ones I don't think I need this I'm just going to pull stuff out and see if it breaks uh because that's that makes for uh good education experience right um yep see okay that works so we don't need that this SVG is already actually really small so you know it's not like I'm saving that much but there are some svgs that are huge and have all kind of extra stuff that aren't needed so it's definitely worthwhile to shrink them down so do I need Phil I don't think I need this either let's take that out and see see what happens oops I keep that oh I guess I do need that so all right I'm not sure if I can take like I could take some of these out and just use CSS to put them in but I mean that's I'm I'm using inline CSS anyway so I don't really see the point in taking this out and then just writing style and putting it back in in style so I will change this to be the same color as the text so I might as well do that right now let's see what color I'm using for this text uh the inspect thing just opened on my my other screen so if you're wondering where that's at but all I'm doing really is just grabbing the color actually I don't I don't like how that color is done let me show you what's going on um the color here is uh like a hex value for gray I don't like that I in if you look at the material design documentation they recommend never using just gray for text they recommend using black but um having it be uh slightly transparent uh so I'll show you so instead of that gray like let's just do black right so we've done black and then we'll go in and let's let's set it to actually this will this should do it all right so we'll set it to like I think 57 is one of the values that they recommend so I'm just going to set it to 57 right so now the text is like this the reason that they recommend doing that is that it becomes much more readable so I wish I had a side by side of like both texts I I I don't but um you have to take my word for it right now or at least take Google's word for it right now it it actually is true your text becomes much more readable uh if you use black or or this also on the flip side could work um I guess it just works with black and gray I was trying to think of other colors where this might also be the case but I think it's just black and gray um that the TR black with some transparency is better than just using the hex color for gray so I'm actually going to switch that I thought I had switched that already in uh like my main CSS file and I edited the um the materialized file but I guess I didn't maybe I did it on a different project and just didn't carry it over so let me fix that now I'll show you let me this is within materialize and input field label let's change this I kind of don't want to I kind of don't want to edit the materialized file directly uh because then if I update the version uh it's going to override all my changes so I'm going to add this to uh my own like CSS file and actually let me just let me copy all of this because that'll be easier and I can just take out the stuff that I don't need uh and then just kind of override what's happening here I'm sure there's other places where where this is happening as well so they're also doing it here uh so let me change that right now and my CSS is a bit of a mess right now I've been kind of slowly working to move a lot of it into the components but as you can see I still have a lot here I could probably get rid of some of it because I've already moved it over um but for now I don't know I'm just going to put this at the bottom because I don't want to take a lot of time to think about my structure uh right in the middle of the live stream so I'm just going to copy that or paste it and all we really need is that first part and also if you saw in the uh in Dev tools it was like this for all the labels so I'm going to go ahead and just put use this as well so we may not even use this for anything else on the site but in case we do that works works now so the uh hot module reloading doesn't work with like a separate CSS file so those changes require a manual refresh at least for the way I have everything set up I'm sure you could probably use something like um live reload or something like that I know you you there's a way you can use um like you can use gulp with webpack and have it all work but for this site I did not set it up let me restart my my Dev server so normally in case you you haven't seen this happen to me before it happens frequently normally you shouldn't have to restart your server and I've never had this happen on another site where I've been building with uh react and next for some reason I don't know what I did but uh I've messed something up and it requires me to frequently uh restart so I'm not blaming next for this I'm sure it was something that I did but just so you know that's not normally uh supposed to happen all right I'm going to go back and check the live chat cuz I never did get around to figuring out where we should put this thing also we can't forget to change this color all right so down downloaded uh said the search icon should not move it Rohan says it should be fixed also it' be nice if you moved it to the right put it on the right uh keep search fire text but it should be persistent all right so it looks like it is unanimous it is unanimous that the search icon should be over here and it should not move actually I like that idea and I think if it turns out that the keyup event doesn't register for the virtual keyboard on a mobile device then I'm going to make it so that when you click on this icon it runs a search as well and then that way we'll we'll cover that uh so I think there's there's definitely value in having this at the end that's actually what I've done when I've put in search bars in other sites that I've done I I usually do put it over here so um yeah who's else cronis says looks bad honestly I appreciate your honesty and I agree um TK TR says I think M M6 look better so 50% look better okay thanks for that what I don't know what do you think do you think 50% look better obviously if I do add in the drop down at some point it's going to look better uh to have it you know half and half I'm sure okay robot Villa icon should be a bit bigger and gray yeah okay bigger as well I was definitely going to do the gray um I would make it bigger as well bill says oh I'll follow up in Twitter chat in more detail but my main issue had been when get initial props fires from client side I was getting mixed content errors uh no SSO on WordPress site oh okay all right so bill was responding to my earlier question thanks for responding and uh thanks for following up with that uh so yeah I was super interested in that so I I'll talk talk to you more about that on Twitter um wahaj agrees with uh robot Villa oh okay bill says he uh he left the uh like the API logic out of the actual like components and it kept to keep the front end cleaner and more reusable I actually I like that idea okay Patrick has linked something on stack over overflow about the input so let's check that out really quickly I'm assuming this is about the um like the mobile uh the key up thing so let's check this out because if if we can get an answer for this right now then uh then we can actually fix it make sure it works on mobile the way we need it to so I've searched it on my on my other screen you all I'm sure know how stack Overflow works so I don't think I need to to show it um nice okay so basically the answer is now that I'm looking at this I'm pretty sure this is the same stack Overflow article I looked up the last time I built a site like this and I just had totally forgotten so I am going to bring this over just to show you all um we basically we have this uh key up and input okay so the um the key thing is the input um input works both on uh desktop and mobile um also this is another answer it didn't get I'm not sure why this didn't get selected either jQuery method this is actually this is for jQuery but I'm assuming there's probably a react equivalent to this um so we'll have to uh we'll test that out although I wish I had um maybe I can do it uh I'll I'll do like a um a simulator for an iPhone and test it uh usually when I when I'm not building in react and I'm building like a static site I use um I have everything set up with Gulp and it's like is it live reload or browser watch or something and um it actually gives you an IP that you can look at on your phone while you're developing which is really cool but I don't that's not how webpack is set up it probably can do it I just don't know how Okay uh Julio says sorry for the question but I'm interested to know if Jesse is a designer with uh programmation skill or is a programmer with design skills good question I would consider myself to be a programmer with some design skills so if you've watched my videos and disagree feel free to to say something but um I do have a lot of opinions about how designs should look and I'm very concerned about how things should look but I don't in consider myself a designer at all but I will say I where I work there are no web designers that work with me so so I do have to do that job as well my title is frontend developer um but I imagine I probably do a lot more design than a front end developer would would normally have to do uh if they're working you know kind of with a proper team uh where they had a you know somebody doing backends somebody doing design and all that so all right let's get back to this let's let's move this over here and make it the same color uh as our text here so we'll do the color first because that's the easiest thing uh we could just grab this color and let's put it oh yeah resources I wonder if the f I don't know I'm just going to try this but I don't know if it'll work I don't know if you can pass a color in like this into this fill or not but it's worth a shot all right awesome that works good to know and now we're going to move this over so B we're going to have to move the code around uh because everything in inside uh this label is going to move so the easiest way to make that stop moving is just to move it outside of the label uh and now we need to oh I didn't get it all uh where we going to put this so we want it still in the input but outside of the label let's put it here and see how it goes oops I can't normally when I work I have things in like different views I've just done it like this um so it's easier to actually let me let me do this since I keep doing this anyway on accident H shoot I put it down actually that might work yeah that'll probably work right there I'll just have to do some positioning so I haven't done any uh real like CSS work in a while so this will be nice um let me shoot as soon as I made this full screen now I have a reason to uh make it half screen again so let's make it half screen and bring this in because I want you all to be able to see what I'm doing in Dev tools I'll have to make Dev tools a bit bigger so you can see uh so we'll keep this screen pretty small and then so we have a little bit more space here all right so here's our SVG we want to position this here so let's see oops position absolute so I'm going to go position absolute and let's go left uh 8 pixels no I mean sorry right eight pixels 16 let's see how 16 looks and then we need it to come down from the top so let's guess um 10 pixels NOP I needed some more down more I also want to make this bigger as well so I should probably uh change the size before I uh settle on this so let's just see what what will happen if um let's go with with oops um I'm just going to do 48 Auto okay so check that out in case you're not really used to doing CSS stuff notice when I put the width nothing happen happened until I set height to Auto um let's see I think that that looks all right there I want it to be I I don't want it to be too small because it needs um I guess I don't know I I still don't know whether I'm going to make it uh like taable for a search so um but in case I do I want it to be big enough so it's reasonable to tap it um but if it's too huge like it's just not going to fit you know we don't really have large font going on right now so need it to fit let me know if you think that's too big and now if you see we do this and it stays still all right so now I'm just going to move this to my other screen so I could see it when I uh put this over on my SVG um I could probably get rid of these so since I've already set uh the width and height with the style okay and I think I'm already at 300 so um I don't want to go uh we talked yesterday saying it' be better to keep the the streams to like an hour or less so uh this will probably be the um the last thing I do before I go back to the questions so seems like I didn't get a whole lot done but I did find some things that I I didn't even expect to be doing and changed it so got some some things done but just things I didn't think I would even have to do so I kind of don't want to put this right here so because this is so I said before that I I usually like to put it in line if it's not really a lot but if it's a lot of um attributes that I have to add or uh you know a lot of CSS I don't like to add it in here because it just gets huge so I'm going to go down here I only have input so we should be able to get this if I just go to input field SVG that should be good that's should cover Us in case we put another SVG on the page somewhere and let's go to looks like I never close that out so let's close that out right yeah yeah I never closed that up okay and now I'm going to add input field SVG and let's copy all our Styles over the other good thing about this is uh I can just copy them over exactly as they were because I can write it just plain CSS inside of this uh in case you're not sure what's going on here like let's just take a look we have a style tag we've added this jsx which tells it like hey some this is not a normal style tag something's going to happen in here um and now we have our curly brackets so if you remember from earlier in react you see these curly brackets that means okay we're going to do JavaScript now now it might get confusing for you if you're not familiar with template literals uh because this all doesn't look like JavaScript right it's CSS so what we've done in here is we used a template literal when you see one of these in JavaScript this is a newer type of thing it's es6 or ES 2015 um everything within this template literal basically is considered a string there and there's really easy ways to put Javascript in so if I went like this you can see like hey it's JavaScript so um just to show you like I'm getting a different syntax highlighting um when I do stuff like this so anyway um that would be JavaScript in there and I could put it right in here right in the string I don't have to uh put plus signs or anything so that's what's going on here so it it looks crazy at first but if you think about it it makes sense like we're dropping into JavaScript and we're putting everything basically as a string but since we're using the template literal string we can put you know Spa all the spaces have it on multiple lines and it all just works and then because we have this jsx in the style tag uh behind the scenes uh this is all getting added in uh to these elements so when it actually comes out on the other end I'll save this and and we'll see we'll see what's going on here um let me bring in let me bring in Dev tools right so now this is that same SVG but beforehand let me get rid of this stuff because this is what we typed in Dev tools so we don't you know we're getting rid of all that um and we can see like now we have this data djsx and we just have this this long number okay so it's giving this uh its own unique unique number and then on this side here we can see we have input field and then this data jsx number right for our input field which is here and then it's saying you know any svgs within the that input field that have this number get all this so you can see it's very specific when it does that it's definitely not going to mix it up and put something else in there I mean look how many digits are in this number like that's going to cover all your elements for sure um and uh that's how it works so pretty uh I don't know I think that's pretty cool that you know it kind of automatically does all that for you and as we can see just just so that you know it's working all right see we have all the styles that we want and uh you already saw that I I took these Styles off so the ones we did in Dev tools so this is working just like we wanted it to work um the only other thing that we wanted to change was the color and so let me let me hover this I no it's not that the input needs to be hovered right or Focus that's what it needs to be Focus okay so focus our Focus color here we need to change these and we need to change we need to change the uh label color as well so I guess I'll just copy this there's there's actually a place if I was using the SAS version of materialize you can download SAS uh materialized as with the SAS version of the files all split out or the CSS version uh since I don't have like a SAS compiler running right now I just went with a straight CSS version but in the SAS version there's actually a variable that can set this color this is the secondary color variable um and then I would only have to change it once and it would work but that's not unfortunately that's not how I had it set up so I will have to change this in a few places and let me do that in my I'm going to actually do this in the CSS because where it's at I thought I had my CSS running I must have closed oh yeah I did there we go uh I'm going to do it in here and let well I guess I got to decide on a color huh let's decide on a color um do we want red I really don't want red that usually signifies like you know hey there's an error what other color we using how about this how about I use the same color I'm using for this uh this icon we'll see how it looks I don't really have the main colors on the site are really just red black and white um and this is the only alternate color that I think I'm using on on the whole site this is this is actually in the University's official color palettes this is the only color the only time we're using University colors on this whole site is for this color uh okay so let's throw this in and sorry I haven't been paying attention to live chat just because I know we're running out of time and I really wanted to at least have a finished task uh for this video um oops oh I I gotta um got to refresh it okay so you can see here's the color I didn't change it for that yet um we can do that now oops where am I at I have my Dev tools open here so I'm trying to get to this section input field focus and uh label Focus there we go all right so I'm going to copy this and all I was doing on the other screen was basically the exact same thing I just did with this I just found this code in Dev tools and copied and pasted it so if we refresh that should be working as well yep and that works so I don't know that I love that color but I'm not sure if I have another color that I'm using now on the page which would be appropriate other than black I don't really want to go with black so there we go I think basically accomplished everything that we wanted to the only thing I might do is is I don't know we had some some mixed opinions about the length of this line so maybe I'll move it back I'll I'll see what I think um yeah but that's it I mean style wise that's that's good to go uh performance wise there were some oops there's some optimis ations that I um that I wanted to make but um they're not like critical I don't I don't absolutely have to do them before this goes live all right let me check the uh live chat now sorry I've been neglecting it for so long but um let me try to figure out where I left off at I'm sure there's a lot of good suggestions that I was missing along the way oh okay so uh we had a suggestion uh down downloader said you could try to leave the current size of search input so 75% but then centor it I'll think about that oh okay uh Julio asked uh your title is uh didn't hear that sorry I didn't see that um that remark so if you're still watching because that was a little while ago that you said that my title is front end developer so that's officially I'm a frontend developer for University so that's what it says on the plaque outside my door um Rohan says if you're connected to the same network and don't have devices isolated you can just connect to your P local your PC's local IP and the port to view it on mobile oh okay I'll have to try that good to know uh Deon I'm not sure how to pronounce that so sorry if I did it wrong uh it's do d o n y it says Hey Jesse my company uh I'm interning for just put me on to free code k after completing code academy uh and I love programming keep up the good work oh awesome uh thank you for um for the positive feedback there I really appreciate that and um you know uh good luck with with all your uh your endeavors on code academy uh or and and free code Camp so looks like you say you completed code academy so awesome keep up the good work um okay downloaded has offered some uh advice to vertically centering um the the icon I actually I kind of think um I think it looks okay like that I I don't think I'm going to need to vertically Center it after we made it that comment might have came like before I got it all positioned so um I I'm okay with it just being kind of statically just centered here so thank you for the uh for the suggestion though um Rohan suggests 24 pixels I'm assuming that means this icon 24 pixels maybe I'll play with that a little bit later on I'm not going to go back to it now I'm just going to do handle uh these questions but um I I will I I'm like I'm kind of thinking this is just like slightly too big um yeah I don't know I get the feeling like like I said I'm I'm not really a designer so I couldn't explain to you like reasoning behind this but to me like just my my gut says it's just a little too big um Francesca says uh looks good I love that name Franchesca I got a cousin named Franchesca so awesome name um John says does pug work in react I love pug okay yeah I I like pug too I well I worked with pug sometimes back when it used to be called Jade and then they got like threatened to be sued by some other company that evidently has a copyright for the word jade which is crazy because like come on Jade is like should not be a copyrightable word it's it's a legit you know it's like a very common word you know anyway um so they had to change the name to pug uh I don't really know if pug uh Works in react so sorry if anybody else knows uh you know please uh please let John know know um if if pug Works uh with react um bill says uh in in regard to um being able to check out uh Dev site on your mobile phone uh check out enro that's NG K uh to be able to forward your Local Host beyond your network oh you know what I'm like I feel like a really big idiot right now because on a previous live stream I actually demonstrated how to view your Dev site on your phone and I just totally forgot about it so if you can connect like I have um I have the uh um Google like pixel phone so it takes a USBC a chord but I think pretty much any phone now you could get a chord that can connect it to your computer right so you connect it to your computer and you open up Dev tools and let me just bring this over uh just just to show you like um if we go to remote devices I don't have it connected right now cuz the spot where my cord reaches is right where my mic is and I'll have a lot of static like I had a few uh live streams ago uh because of my phone uh so BAS basically if you would plug this in um you would see your device right here and you could do some like debugging right here uh on your device but also you can port forward so I could forward I actually already doing it I already added the port forwarding so uh I plug this in I say Local Host 3000 is now going to be Local Host 880 on my phone I type in Local Host 8080 on my phone while it's plugged in and I can see it so my brain just was like totally not working at that point but thanks for all the other suggestions uh for everybody that suggested in case for some reason this is not going to work for you um or maybe like you have other people that aren't able to actually plug in to your computer but on your network then you know you might want to set it up in some other way um Rohan says a tad smaller and a bit more to the left so it could go a bit more to yeah you're right a bit more to the left yeah you know what I'm actually going to do too is uh I know that I think on some of Google sites they have a similar setup with the search icon here um I'm going to check it out since I am going by material design guidelines uh sometimes I do like to look like okay well how did Google implement this and so I'll check out one of their sites just to give me some visual reference uh for how they interpreted the material design guidelines in their own sites uh so um that's if you like material design you want to use it uh I recommend doing that like check check out Google sites that use material design uh and just just get ideas because the documentation doesn't cover every use case possible sometimes it's it's nice to see how it's been adapted uh John says and SAS 2 uh in the JavaScript St strings and react as far as I know you can't use SX SAS in the JavaScript style string so let me go back to this just to give some reference to what we're talking about um so this in jsx uh you can check out there there's actually this is on GitHub um trying to think where the repo is uh I can't remember what the repo is called but basically um on my other screen I'm just going to look it up real quick uh at this time I don't think there's support for sassin here but I have seen I maybe it was in in a GitHub issue or something I've seen a discussion about enabling something like that inside of here but I don't think it's enabled right now not to say it's not possible but um I just haven't seen it done and here's the GitHub repo for that it's styled jsx so uh it's the same people that do next so zeit is the the company that does next so style look up styled jsx and this will let you know basically what it can and can't do and um like I think maybe there's one of the issues for this did bring up that aspect so um I I would really actually like to use SAS as well um or at least some of the Fe even if they couldn't Implement all of SAS some of the features would be nice Francesca says the search icon is a functional icon element so visibility is key we want to help our users at all times in a way they don't have to think about what they have to do uh don't make me think principal all right good uh good advice uh bill says uh John it's a part of nextjs I believe style jsx is what they talk about in the docs all right so Bill Bill answered it uh before I even did so um John says so so SAS is possible cool thing I don't I don't really know so once again I I don't really know for sure if sass is possible I think it is it's just not been implemented so I'm sure they might be open you know to a pool request to try to implement it all right getting towards the end of the uh of the live chat comments uh so just in case you're still sticking around and you're not really worried about the live chat I'm not going to do any more coding so if you want to take off now um you know feel free thanks for watching um otherwise uh if you have any more questions I'm getting towards the end so get your questions in now um before I I wrap things up and uh or you could direct message me on Twitter or you could put it in the comments to this video if you're watching the recording uh put it in the comments or message me on Twitter or whatever other social media you prefer I've actually had people email me things too so I'm I'm not opposed to that if you find my phone number and call me though I probably won't answer but if you leave a message I'll listen to it uh oh Sebastian's here okay so Sebastian is a regular uh viewer here and also has given me some great uh tips on like sending me error screenshots of Errors he's gotten on my site which has been super helpful um so Sebastian basically you just miss me working on this this search input just styling it so I mean that's all at the beginning I talked a little bit about um adding images into these cards and I I've done that on another Branch but that's pretty much it um probably doing too much talking and not enough coding to be honest with you but uh colonel colonel Zoom or I guess but that's with an X and not a z says I'm having trouble understanding the grid layout and how to place things uh like a line of text uh next to images or uh or other text um if you are using materialize with the columns and rows let me check out the repo okay so you'll be able to see in obviously the materialized documentation might have some explanation but if you want like real world examples check out my repo the link is in the description or pretty much all of all of my projects for the last I don't know year or so been using materialized so they all have examples but just to show you quickly um how this works uh let me show you a section that does put images next to text uh just to give you an idea um courses all right so in courses I do so subsection down to the ball I know have some down the bottom this this is a mess I can't wait to move this all this junk out into WordPress and just pull that in um so here I have basically I have a section all right which you don't really need the section and I have a container and this is the container is basically just for adding like padding on the sides and I've modified this a bit because I didn't I didn't like the normal container padding like how wide it was so I added this class wide container that it makes it a little bit wider um so that's that's my class this is comes with materialize uh and now what we have in here is a row so this is how you you get the columns and everything to work so basically you have a row you usually don't have a row on its own it's usually wrapped in a container or at least a section but uh so you have your row and then within your row you have columns okay so the First Column I have is on small screens it takes up the whole space and on mediumsized screens which is anything over 600 pixels you have it takes up half the space because half of there's only 12 columns half of 12 is six right so um this this is something I added that's uh that's custom it basically just changes the order of the image and the text on a mobile so that I always have the image on the top and the text below um and then on a big screen they're they're stagger so one section has image and text um like text vers image second the other section has image vers text second so you won't have this by default but if you see it and look at my code that that's what it's doing so this is the first section and then this is the second section and if your screen is larger than 600 pixels they will show up one right after the other so the text will show up on the right hand side and on the leftand side will be the image and they'll both take up half the screen uh but then if you have a small screen the text well normally what would happen is whatever you put first would be on top and what you put second would be on the bottom both taking up the full width in this case I have changed the order be like I I just explained because I I wanted consistency when people are scrolling on mobile um that's how the basic work uh in materialize if you wanted to have like this be 75% width and this be 25% I could change this M6 to M9 and change this M6 to M3 and that would give me that and and you know as long as what you have here between these two add up to 12 no more than 12 then you're good um and and they'll be side by side so hopefully that answered your question let me know if it didn't um or you know send me a direct message or something and I could explain it in more depth uh maybe I'll do a video on stuff like this uh since I I use materialize frequently maybe I could do a a little video just on materialize um okay Sebastian says Center it it looks kind of weird like that all right so let me bring this back up since we're talking about this um okay so this sech thing he saying Center it it looks weird like that okay so I'm definitely going to do something with this because have a lot of people saying basically do something with it either Center it or take it back to half or do so something is going to happen with that um Franchesca said thank you I like your name also Jesse thanks um James says uh as a software tester I have to agree the search is a bit large okay awesome yeah I so that will definitely shrink up I'm not going to shrink it up too much but maybe like four pixels somewhere around there um I'll see how how it looks uh Thor hey Thor's here uh Thor says hey hey Thor um actually now that Thor's here uh this reminds me um I have a question for you all so um I have a major project that's coming up so I did mention I had meetings this morning so basically like my work life for the next year is all booked up as far as at Franc at at Franciscan University where I work is concerned so um uh I guess that's good because I'll know what's coming um but I do have a huge project that's on the horizon and uh maybe even not this year that might be next year but what I need to happen at least what I would hope was happen I have a database that is um feeding data to a site that's running a Content management system called ectron okay not my choice to use ectron that's I inherited it when I started working here I want to move the content over to Wordpress since we're already using Wordpress for a lot of our content it would be easy to be able to teach like our student workers to use WordPress and then they could know how to update all the content so the idea is is it possible is there some way and how hard would it be to move the data out of that Actron database and then move it into another database that WordPress is going to use but move it in such a way that it will be in the it will be structured in the normal WordPress way so WordPress will understand it I don't know very much at all about databases so I don't know if what I'm describing even makes sense to do if you have some experience and you're watching this either live right now or later on in recording please let me know uh direct message me or put in the comments or something uh because I've been it will save a lot of time and money if we can do that and uh to be honest with you like I I think I could probably talk the you know my bosses into you know paying someone to do it so if you know how to do that and you're interested you know let me know um also actually I just remembered this from my meeting I had a meeting yesterday morning as well and uh I was given an award for this website that I'm working on right now it's it's a spirit award so uh it's not like a really big deal thing but uh it's cool you get like a $50 award and a piece of paper describing what a good job you did so that was cool it's nice to be recognized uh for doing a good job um was actually my boss nominated me for it so that was pretty cool uh all right back to the uh to the live chat questions I want to get through these yeah oh man man I've already gone an hour and a half I really need to I need to like set alarms and timers to work on getting my live stream times down to something more manageable that's not as intimidating to watch the recordings so uh hopefully uh I don't forget over the weekend and I I remember to really set some set some timers and uh quit you know really force myself to stop at some point uh Rohan says yeah I usually use Chrome console using USB um uh to my expir also USBC type cable Google has some space between end of Icon and end of line oh okay so those are two different different thoughts I ran them together so um he said Google has some space between of Icon and end of line okay that's why what I thought that's why I did it like that uh if you know like there's a little bit of space uh because like I said it's been somewhat recently at least recent enough for me to remember that I did a very similar input to this on a site and I remember looking it up and that Google had some space so that's why I added the space uh so I I'll double check though and maybe get try to make it as close as possible um since I I'd like to stick to material design as much as I can for consistency sake across all of my sites and for the users so that uh you know a lot of people are exposed to material design so if I use those same uh you know design patterns I think there's an increased chance of a user Auto automatically knowing what to do because they're familiar with it uh I I like that idea I think yeah it's cool sometimes to experiment and make an amazing looking site but sometimes when you do that users have no idea like uh if you look at like the top design sites that win the awards they look amazing and they do cool things but a lot of time at least me when I go to them I have no idea how to use them at first uh so that's not what I want for this site you know maybe U just messing around on the side I could do crazy things but that's one of the reasons why I just stick with material design uh and don't really Branch off and I just I modify it when I have to uh you know when there's not some explicit Direction I'm doing some type of component that's not mentioned in the docs but um anyway I don't I don't even know I think I feel like I went off on a tangent there so I'm going to get back to the live chat um Patrick said by the way what I said about sassin next is wrong it looks like they are supporting script jsx type equals text SL SAS but I'm not sure how far the support is come yet all right awesome Patrick good to know uh so a question earlier I think I think John had the question earlier I don't know if he's still in the live chat uh but um yeah it looks like he's still in there uh so it looks like maybe SAS support is on the way or maybe like somewhat supported so uh that's really good to know I might check that out and try to use it because I uh I like to use SAS when I can on on projects um okay someone mentioned the uh the IRC channel in case you you haven't heard uh there's an IRC Channel now like to continue this discussion on live chat later on it's uh like # FCC Jesse and that's running at uh what is it fre so I don't really know very much at all about IRC so I can't really help you get things set up uh I'm just learning with the help of some people like Rohan and Thor here that are in the live chat and uh so um I try to log in as much as I can I keep getting logged out all the time though and not seeing things so I just need to do a little bit more research and figure out how to best use IRC but uh but if I'm in there and you have questions I'll do my best to answer them as well or the other people in there are actually really knowledgeable more iable than me and they can help you as well um John says thanks for the info on SAS Jesse and Patrick you are you're welcome Patrick really did the work and found the right answer so I I appreciate that Patrick Andrew asks uh not is the only way to do server side rendering uh what do you do when having another language on the the back end uh Rohan answered you could do service side rendering in any language uh yeah that's my understanding too is that you you can do I mean if you think about it like a a regular like WordPress site uses PHP and it renders using PHP on the server side right so um the same way with like uh if you're using like NET Framework stuff you know everything it gets rendered there on a server side so that's actually like the traditional way of doing websites the benefit to using node and act uh at least the way I am is uh that I render the first load is rendered server side so it's a nice fast first load it's just like a static HTML page gets sent and search engines can see that so that's the main reason but then after that first load all the additional um routes so when I click on a internal link that is actually uh all done client side so so um you have the best of both word worlds so you have the routing without a page refresh that's super fast on the client side but then you also get the SEO benefits and the quick loading benefits of that so that's why I do it it's I don't maybe it could be done to where you don't have to use node and you could I don't know can you run react with other stuff on the back end um and do it kind of like this I I don't know enough about it to know like if I could run react and render react with PHP I don't really know uh but you can definitely do it with other languages and that seems to be we had some other people uh give the same answer there in the uh in the live chat uh uh Colonel says and I do this within the same row yes you do so he's responding to when I was demonstrating the um uh the column sorry I'm late with that there's there's a delay on the video so it's it's not exactly real time when I can respond to you like what you're seeing uh also I you know I was answering some other questions too so um so if if you're um whatever you are seeing is actually like what I just said like a minute ago so uh that's why I'm it might be a little off as to when I'm explaining things or answering questions uh inside the Matrix says I like that name um says sorry I'm new is WordPress C or org um so word if if you're not familiar with WordPress there's wordpress.com and wordpress.org um one is like you can go there and just get a site up and running and like it's WordPress takes care of all the hosting and everything like that and you just do your blogging and it has limited functionality in terms of what plugins and customizations you can do the other one is um you can download the entire CMS onto your server for free and set it up and run it however you want and customize it however you want I can't remember what it I think the uh selfhosted version is.org and the doc is the version that they host so correct me if I'm wrong with that but that's the and I'm not even sure if that answers your question right way uh inside the Matrix but uh hopefully it does Rowan says I don't know about how both CMS handle databases but it can be done oh okay so this is in response to my question about databases uh and and Thor also had a response earlier and it I I just now realized it was in response to that says if both systems have an API it would probably work okay uh I'll have to have to look into that so let's say one system doesn't have an A like so the WordPress API I already know how to input data with the WordPress API so I didn't even think about that but that's that's doable I don't know if the other database has an API um I was reading the documentation and it said there was some sort of API but after look like comparing the documentation of how it's supposed to be implemented and how this CMS was actually implemented I'm referring to the Extron CMS that I was talking about earlier it seems like there were some things that were recommended in the documentation that weren't implemented and uh I I don't know for sure cuz this was done before I was here a lot of the work was done by an outside con outside company uh and some of the work was done by an employee who's no longer here so I'm really like having to figure things out on my own and just like go through the code and just try to figure out what happened so um would it be possible then and I'm sure it probably is like to build my own API that pulls from that database if if there's not one already maybe that's maybe that is is the the real answer to that all right Thor says um Sebastian says you could get the data from the database and post it WP Thor thinks that's probably not a good idea um Rohan says database level is easy but not a great idea all right thanks for that because I was thinking originally just on the database level but uh I hadn't even considered the API that seems more doable for me because I am familiar with working with apis uh a lot more so than I'm familiar with working straight with the database so this is like really really helpful for me um okay so Thor has clarified uh theom is the hosted instances and the .org is um when you uh host it yourself so I think I had it backwards honestly if you just type in one or the other you'll find out really quickly which one is which um oh okay Rohan said congratulations that's amazing and I'm like wait what's amazing what did I miss and that that must have been when I was talking about getting the uh award it's it's called a spirit award so yeah I mean it's not like this spir it's a pretty common thing a lot of employees uh do get it uh but like I've been here for almost 2 years and I've only gotten it once before so um yeah so I mean I was happy I mean any little thing showing appreciation is you know that's awesome when that happens and uh not that my boss didn't already let me know that he appreciated it uh but yeah the the award was nice and the extra 50 bucks is nice I mean it considering all the extra work I put in that uh it's not much compared to that but it's still cool you know it lets me know that you know my bosses care um let's see uh Francesca says CMS to cms.com can migrate Extron to Wordpress wait are you serious Francesca you might be my favorite person of the day uh if that if that can work because I never heard that so I I am definitely going to check that out if there's like a system that already does this then like H you have no idea like literally the main thing stopping me from completely redoing our main University site so it's it's franciscan.edu um right now the site runs on like Actron which is super old and it's really hard to for people to update the content and and um it loads all this stuff all the time and I've been trying to go through it and just like manually edit templates and things to make it faster but it's just like it takes a long time to accomplish like little things so I want to totally redo it and do it like I did this CI site kakal Institute site with react and the back endb WordPress and make it just really fast so the one thing stopping me from doing that was the idea of who is going to move all this content there are well over 3,000 pages to this site there's a ton of content so we were thinking like we're going to have to hire like some student workers and pay them you know you know have them work a ton of hours to do this and I'm not thrilled about the idea of people copying copying and pasting content so uh anyway so thank you very much Franchesca I just went to this site um so here's the site um so this actually looks really cool I'm definitely going to check out this site and uh this is not an official endorsement of the site I haven't even looked at their page yet so just so you know uh I always feel like I need to give a disclaimer when I talk about some paid service like like I'm not making money off of this and I'm not officially endorsing it uh and that's it I I actually don't make money off of anything if anybody ever wants to use an affiliate link from me because like you appreciate what I'm doing and want to help me out then that's cool let me know but otherwise I'm not going to push uh that kind of thing um let's see does someone use typo3 typo3 I don't I don't use it I've actually never heard of it so Andrew asked that um John says he he does or John says he's here all right cool because I asked John if he was still here so uh I was I just wanted you to hear um some of the the answers to the stuff you had asked uh Rohan says try IRC Cloud for Android awesome I will do that um I'll uh I'll try to download that app um Rohan says I had a complicated setup previously but now I just moved to using ioc Cloud on Android sweet that would actually be good and then I could get the messages anywhere and I don't have to be at a computer I tried to use um some like command line client and uh I wasn't exactly sure I must not have set it up right because it wasn't working correctly for me uh I didn't really have time to read the documentation thoroughly so um Thor also says uh for Android Atomic is awesome for IR IRC um oh Sebastian says what app do you use for the IRC for Windows Thor says hex chat is good once again I'm not like I I haven't used any of these things so I don't know I'm just reading out the live chat for those of you who are going to be watching this later on so that you can um you can get the benefit of the live chat without actually being here because correct me if I'm wrong but you can't see the live chat on the recorded videos right if I'm wrong about that then I may be wasting my time by reading all these out but uh I'm pretty sure you can't um all right almost to the end here here so probably wrap this up in maybe like Le 5 minutes or less um IR SSI is mentioned here Rohan mentions that uh and that one's for Linux okay inside the Matrix said yes that answered my question awesome I'm glad glad I could uh could help out there um brohan says it's free for with donation so irssi for Linux free with donation and he says it's also available for Mac too he thinks uh Thor says for Linux uh he prefers WeChat that's actually I think WeChat might be the one that I tried to uh download and use I got it all loaded and I started up and everything and then I I kind of hit a wall and and couldn't get it to work um any further than that uh says not they're not available for Windows though four says I guess CMS to CMS is just people doing it but not sure like the people are doing it for you uh James says you are correct okay so that's actually somebody doing it um I'm actually I'm cool with that like I said I I'm it's definitely worthwhile to pay for this to be done because uh otherwise it's going to cost a a lot of money either way I think uh unless unless I level up my skills and figure out how to how to migrate it in a way that's really easy which I'm not opposed to I like learning new things I just am not confident that I can do it uh in in a way that it would be uh efficient and and really work correctly uh I I'd much rather have somebody who has a lot of experience uh do that uh because if something would have happened that content it would be it would be disastrous it's quite a bit of content yeah Sebastian says I don't think it's copy and paste by humans so oh okay Sebastian said it says 15 minute migration on average we're talking about the site CMS to cms.com that Franchesca had recommended uh for migrating um databases from one CMS to the other uh it says 15minute migration on average full scale CMS in a matter of 15 minutes yeah actually that makes me think it um there must there's got to be some automated stuff going on somewhere along the way um right I mean I'm sure there are people that are uh it's not like you click a button and entered info and it automatically happens but um anyway I'll have to check that out a little bit more so like I said that's not a project that's actually not one of the projects that I that we had talked about in our meeting earlier today uh um for the upcoming year but it is a project that I think is like within the next two years it it should H I think it should happen um in my opinion the most important project is the main sight project because that gets like by far the most traffic but that's not the opinion of people higher up so not going to probably not going to be able to work on that uh right now um Umberto says I make buttons that you click once in a day's worth of work is done that that is awesome that that is a good uh a good skill all right that's the end of the uh live chat so I'm going to wrap this up because this ended up being nearly a 2hour video despite my intentions um so today's Friday right so yeah today is Friday so uh I will be back on Monday and uh Monday will be the last week before I'm on vacation so the week after I'll be on vacation and uh I don't know if I'll be able to stream or not depends on the internet and on like what's going on um I should probably spend take a little break on vacation uh but we'll see I mean maybe it'll be like really rainy I'm going to the beach so maybe it'll be rainy and I'll be inside and maybe I'll I'll do a stream or something so um all right yeah hey have have a great weekend um everybody's saying bye in the live stream so I really appreciate everyone watching and all the great um questions and the great advice and um uh yeah so I think um we're starting to develop like a nice little Community that's helping each other here and I think that's really awesome um so a lot of a lot of very knowledgeable people are contributing um to make this stream so much better than it could be if it was just me uh and I really appreciate that um hey you're welcome thanks for watching so uh I'm going to um I'm going to wrap this up and I'm going to try to write down all the stuff suggestions that you guys gave so I don't forget it over the weekend and uh yeah so thanks and uh I'll see you on Monday
