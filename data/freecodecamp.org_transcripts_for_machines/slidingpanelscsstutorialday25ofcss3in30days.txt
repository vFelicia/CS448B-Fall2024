good day everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today's day number 25 and we're going to be coding up some sliding css3 panels let me show you what that looks like here we go down in our final result i basically just have an image and when you hover over that image bam an element slides in to frame with some text so this one's sliding from the top when you slide when you hover back out it slides back out of the frame sliding from the right sliding from the bottom and sliding from the left so maybe already you have some ideas of how you might want to use this the fact is in css3 it's incredibly easy to code this up typically you'd use a plugin or you'd write some javascript or jquery to achieve this effect but in css3 like i said it's incredibly easy it's slim and lightweight and i want to show you how to do that right now so up here in the sandbox you'll see what we're going to be working with is an image with some text above that and we're going to hide that text into an element we're going to slide that in from the top bottom left and right over here in our code editor go ahead and download 25 sliding panels and get it queued up in your favorite code editor and here in our index.html let me just show you the markup so you're familiar here in the sandbox we have a section with a level four heading that says slide from top that doesn't really matter that's just telling you what each section will include it's this element that matters to you right here the div with the class of slide and then slide top right bottom and left respectively within that div we have a div with the class of slide content and some text and then an image with the source of a placeholder image that i pulled from place img.com and that's a free placeholder website you can use that for your own placeholders i'm using that in this project and again you can put any image you want in there it doesn't really matter it doesn't have to be an image it can be content so let's get started over here in our sandbox let's start right from the top we're going to say class of slide we're going to go position relative display inline block and overflow hidden that's because we want that element on the inside of slide to be out of view when it's not within that frame and now we're going to say slide and then image we're going to say display inline block this one's going to be vertical align middle and that's going to align that image within the middle of the element if you're uncertain about how a style works whether in this video or any of the videos or just in your projects take it out reverse engineer the the work that you create so if you don't know what this specific property does then remove it and see how it affects the output and then add it back in modify the values and see and experiment that's how i learned as a web developer as i started building more and more projects so and that's how i encourage you to also learn how to understand css properties and values okay vertical line middle now we're going to jump in and maybe let's just see what that looks like if it does anything so over here in our final result in the sandbox rather you're going to see that it doesn't actually do anything so far because we're not telling it to do anything specific we're not actually modifying it too much so let's move on to the class of slide dash content and we're going to say position absolute because we're going to move that content the content is that pink box that's going to slide in and out we're going to say top 0 left 0 right 0 and bottom zero so it's stress so they're all anchored so each side is anchored to every respective side if that makes sense width 100 height 100 we just want to make this expand to the full size of its parent element slide and now what we want to do is give it a z index of one so it's just in front of everything we're going to use flexbox here display flex align items this is a flexbox property flexbox based properties we're going to align the items center justify the content center and then text align center just covering our basis here let's see this looks like so far look at this so this is what it's starting to look like it's dead center if i were to remove the last few properties here maybe even if i took out display flex as well so let me take all of this out so there we go you can't really see any change when i take out flex but watch if i took flex out and tried align item center it's not going to do that it's not going to vertically align that but if i go display flex those that align items is now going to work nice i like it typically in the past you'd have to make it display table and then have another element within there that says display table cell and then vertical align middle but this is way more lean using flexbox and it's better it's better to use flexbox rather than trying to go back to old school css table technology all right especially because tables are used for data whereas flexbox is specifically for visual modification all right now let's keep going and i'm going to say padding i want uh whoops i want to stay in slide content i want to give it a background color actually i want to see i want to see that uh background pink color so 225 comma 35 69 and 0.9 a little bit seethrough and then we're going to give it a padding of 20 pixels so that it doesn't over so it doesn't go out into the edge of the parent the text color to be white and i want to give it a box size box sizing of border box because that padding i don't want to have it be 100 wide plus 20 pixels i just want it to be 100 and the padding within it i write transition transform s seconds and then ease so that's going to transition the transform property that we that we did we add transform property yet no but we will upon hover so save that let's check it out so now we've got that style it looks good but now what i want to do is hide it and then have it slide in when i hover so let's make that happen so now i'm going to say slide hover and then i want to say slide dash content so now what i'm going to do is say transform translate and the translate value allows us to position where we want to see this animation so zero and zero now what that means is upon hover i want it to go to zero and zero that's x and y but here let's say directions now what i want to do is say slide dash top and then slide dash content so i'm specifically styling the slide top element here and i'm going to say transform translate so this is by default this is not on hover i'm specifically targeting each uh each element now i want to say translate 0 and negative 100 percent save that that's going to move it up 100 of its size its height so now there we go slide from top you don't see the element you just see the image of the cat hover slides down just like that why do we use translate because the animation is much more smooth it goes by points of pixels rather like fractions of pixels rather than one pixel 2 pixel 3 pixel and it's a lot smoother of an animation especially when you have like a retina screen and you have really high a really nice video card and all that sort of stuff using translate is better for animations versus using position for animation so maybe we can have a look at that let me make this animation go really really slow 10 seconds let's see what that does so very very smooth i don't even see any clunks at all now if i were to use let's say instead of transforms let's hide this and let's just use something like top negative 100 and then if i go top actually this would be negative 100 and this one will be zero and take transition let's go all so i can already see chunks you might not see it in the recording i've got a retina screen um and it's a really large monitor so i can actually see i can see the the clunkiness if you made this go slower like really really slow something like 100 seconds we're not going to wait that long and then checked it out you're literally going to see it go down and you can actually see that see how it's going down it's just that's what the animation is actually doing if you're using uh top or the position that position property so we're actually going to change this to let's go back to translate and see if that actually makes a difference and i'm going to uncomment these remove this oh this is actually transform okay now let's check it out amazing difference proof is in the pudding right here so you can now see how that is literally sliding down like liquid even if it's if it's a slow animation maybe you're animating a scene of elements like a background scene of clouds and a mountain and mario running across the screen or something you would use transform and translate because that's going to slowly smooth it's going to be a smooth animation whereas when you use the top or bottom or left or right and use pixel values or percentage value values that's going to be a clunky animation this is just sliding down just super smooth so that is proof right there why you'd want to use transform translate for or any other proper translate 3d translate y and all these sorts of things these values for animations because it's very clear the difference in the animation so let's put that back to 0.3 seconds save that bam it's just nice really liking this okay so now all we got to do is just going to copy this paste it a few more times change the value from slide top to slide right and then slide bottom and then slide left and then you guessed it all we're doing is changing these values so slide top is fine we want to change slide right to x value negative 100 and the y value would be zero and then if you wanted slide bottom we're gonna do um and let's see here we're gonna go zero and one hundred percent and i was wrong here so side right is actually 100 that way to the right and then bottom is 100 down slide left will be uh negative let me see negative 100 on the x and then zero on the y save that let's see if all of these work now we got slide from right beautiful slide from bottom perfect slide from left awesome now what if you wanted to slide from the top left top right bottom left or the bottom right you'd simply let's just use one of these for example um we're going to use just this one i'm going to say 100 and negative 100 let's see what that does that's the slide left see how it's coming from the top left that's what is happening there you just have to change these translate values the x and y i'm just going to switch that back and there we go slide left bottom right and top there we go there are sliding content panels with css3 these are incredibly useful you can use them for displaying your services portfolio pieces let's say you're showing a picture of your portfolio and when you hover over it content panel slides in uh displays the title and a button to click here maybe you're just playing a product and you're selling something the price comes in with the call to action to purchase whatever it is that you want to do using these sliding content panels they're incredibly versatile i highly recommend you use these in your own projects and as you can see the css is way way way easy you don't need any plugins or any javascript or jquery plain vanilla straight up css3 so thanks for joining me today in day number 25. see you tomorrow we're closing in on the home stretch here day 26 coming up see you there bye now
