hey everyone and welcome back to css3 in 30 days or code 30 things in 30 days with css3 whatever you want to call it uh today we're going to be playing with the css clip path property which allows us to make custom shapes uh from an image so we'll put an html image in our markup and then you can clip a path around a shape to create circles polygons triangles custom shapes it's pretty cool and plus i'm going to show you a neat online free tool that lets you kind of draw your own shape and then copy the css i mean that's cool so head over here into my screen and this is what we're going to be doing here so day three as clipping images the course files as usual in every module there's going to be a dedicated lesson there that's going to allow you to download the course files for each day so today is three clipping images you're gonna get index final and sandbox.css of course the sandbox is where we're going to add our css and final is where you can reference the final css for your own reference and for help and the index is just a markup that's already precoded you're always welcome to play around with it and do whatever you want with it but here's what we're gonna do so over here in my browser day three clipping images with shapes we're gonna use css3 to clip the following images with different shapes so i just have different images stock images that i pulled from unsplash that are just four random images at 300 by 300 pixels now here is the final result the first one is a circle second one is a cool chat bubble the third one is an x and number four is a right pointing arrow and the cool thing here is these are actual images that they're kind of masked now they're not necessarily masked because that's a separate thing but clipped images is the property that we're going to be using and so if i just drag on this image it's actually the original square image but it's clipped with this this circle and this one is the chap the chat bubble and this is the x right facing arrow so it's using exclusively css to get this effect we don't have to use photoshop so this is pretty cool and it's actually quite easy to to do and understand so let's head over into our code editor and into sandbox.css now the first thing we want to do is we want to select this first image example number one so that image the class is we have it set up here it's simply clip image one clip image one and all we need to do is use a simple property called clip dash path and then we're going to add the values but i also want to be just a little bit more safe here and do the prefix for webkit so let's start with webkit clip path and then we'll work our way down so we're going to start with just a circle so here's the value that you add circle and then parentheses and in there it's going to accept some values so for a circle this is what we write and then let's play around with it so you can see how it works so fifty percent at fifty percent fifty percent save that now if i go over here to the browser you can see it made the circle where we did it now what happens when we change those values what do these mean so if i were to go like over here in the code editor ten percent at fifty percent fifty percent that image that clip is much smaller so technically the smaller that first value the smaller the size of the clip for the circle what if i were to do 100 in the code editor here let's see what happens nothing so perhaps that size is just too large and 50 is the maximum so if i were to do like 60 perhaps you wouldn't even see it so that 60 is still being grabbed around the corner so you can you know kind of create this weird effect but 50 effectively is going to make it all the way around within the constraints of the square image now you can play around with that to see what different effects you can get now at 50 and 50 let's see what happens when i change this first value to 10 and 50. head back to the browser here you can see this is the offset kind of the the offset of where the circle clip is going to be positioned so 10 it looks like it's about 10 to the left so maybe what if i were to do zero let's just see what that does it goes straight down the center of the circle now if i were to do zero percent on the other value it pushes that up so it's going to the center so this is coming from the center is what i'm gathering from experimenting with this so 0 and 0 is the center axis of the circle and it's positioned at the top left so it's taking the circle here's the circle here we go and it's going from the center and if i were to go zero zero it's going up into the top left for you maybe it's up here of that square so the zero and zero axes of the square is going it's going up here so we're only seeing a quadrant of the circle now if you play around with that some more you can see the different results that you get you can position that circle but 50 and 50 is what gets you that circle clipped perfectly over that image so that is the first one right there now i'm going to add clip path as well to be browser compliant circle fifty percent at fifty percent fifty percent save that now let me show you a cool trick if you head to your browser and go to bennett feely dot com slash clippy he has this really awesome css clip path maker that lets you create clip paths and there's demos and there's examples and you just copy the css down here what's cool about this is one if you just wanted to quickly create a shape without trying to figure it out yourself you could do it here by using the presets like triangles parallelograms rhombus and so on or you can custom polygon and create your own so let me just let's just play around with a couple here and and do that so i'm going to show you up here in our final example number two is this chat message box so let's go down to clip path maker and find that message box because i got it from here so down here message if i click on this it gives me the clip path down here that i could just copy paste onto the next clip path uh image that we have in our in our css and then we'd be done with it but let's just see how it's how it is uh made so you can see here it has all these corners and this is how it's creating the shape of the of the actual message box maybe let's choose a more simple one just so you can get the idea here triangle there's only three values and we can see it down here fifty percent and zero what happens if i drag this first value over to the far left top left zero and zero what's the value it's zero and zero even if i just moved it a little bit one percent and zero so clearly this top one this top value is the x axis so i'm 31 over 63 over 100 over so that's how you position that first item that first point on the clip and then if i were to go down you can see the yaxis changes so that's how that first point works and you can see here point number two was this one if i drag it anywhere you could see zero and zero is top left 150 and 0 is top right oh sorry 100 and 0. i looked at that wrong and anywhere else in the container you can see the values change so the triangle we're going down to the bottom left at 100 so zero on the x axis one hundred percent on the y axis and then over here we have one hundred and one hundred because we're at the far bottom right which is one hundred percent down in the uh over in the xaxis one hundred percent down on the yaxis so you get a triangle and so now if i go back to the message i get a number of different values and you can just easily see where they're positioned and how that works so that's pretty cool so let's copy that and see what happens i'm going to copy that css go back to our sandbox and i'm going to select clip dash path dash 2 and just paste those values now save it and let's see what happens oh sorry clip clip image clip image two there we go now go to your browser there we go now you can see here in our first example we use circle and in our second example we used polygon circle has a different set of values so as we played around with just a couple minutes ago and polygon goes based on however many numeric values you have you have x and y separated by comma and the more separated by comma values you have the more points in your your polygon you have and you can create totally custom shapes so let's call that clip image number two and we copied and pasted it there let's go around and play with this next one example number three so this is an x so let's go to clip image don't make that mistake again three and let's start out with our clip path clip dash path and it's a polygon so we're gonna do polygon and this is how i like to do it uh to write them up it's just a little bit easier to read so polygon in the parentheses semicolon and then write your first value i'm going to hit a return and then tab myself in a little bit here just easier to read this so i'm going to start with 20 percent over and 0 on the y axis so a little bit over not down comma return let's go 0 percent and the next value will be 20 now if i were to stop there let's see what happens let's see what that looks like it might be kind of weird or you might not even see anything so you don't see anything yet so let's add a little bit more and see what we can come up with the next one is thirty percent and fifty percent now i'm not just pulling these numbers out of my butt here that this was uh practiced and played around with before using the clip path maker and everything like that so so to create something from scratch you'd have to kind of map it out or use the clip path maker but i want to show you how it works in practice so let's add another couple values here and see what we create next we're going to go 0 on the x and 80 on the y now let's stop there and let's see if anything's been created yet so nothing yet uh it's possible that maybe i'm typing something incorrectly okay so the issue here why i don't see it is because uh the clip path property isn't rendering properly in my browser my atom builtin browser so that's why we must be using the webkit clip path prefix at least for me i need to use that so i'm going to be using that to start with so webkit clip path with our values let's see what we've got so far there we go so you can see it's creating value one two three four there we go so cool let's keep going so now the next one's gonna be 20 and 100 percent the next one will be 50 on the x 70 on the y 80 on the x as the next set of values and 100 on the y save that let's see what we're coming up with see it's taking shape you can see that it's actually starting to take shape so here in the values we've got 20 and 0 0 and 20 30 and 50 0 and 80. 20 and 100 50 and 70 80 and 100 so we just have a few more to create the rest of this shape so let's go back to our code editor uh we got 100 and then 80. and then we got 70 and 50 100 and 20 save it check it out again i just like seeing this progress so you got you can see we just have a little bit more to do we just have to a few more points back to our code editor we got 80 and 20 and then we have 50 and 30 so you can see these kind of start to mirror mirror things a little bit so 20 and 100 we have 120 0 and 80 80 oh a little bit different so some of these values are inversed some of them aren't so save that it should be our x let's go back over to example number three no not quite so i did mess something up here so go back to the code editor uh yes right here so it's 80 and zero percent and then 50 and 30. go back over here there we go so i was right initially in my code editor so it's you can see how these are actually mirrored so 50 30 80 00 120 we've got zero let me see so 30 50 0 80 28 100 so these are kind of mirrored opposites so that is the webkit clip path copy that paste it below and change the property simply to clip path as the fallback that'll do the trick save that and there's your click path image three now finally the last one we have is the right facing arrow now feel free to try creating it yourself or you can go to the clip path maker and draw your own version or you know if you really wanted to you could just click the right arrow it'll give you the values like this and you can copy and paste it or you can play around with this drag it around you know create a custom shape like so you know i just created this like funky looking arrow something like that something a little bit funky copy that head back over to your sandbox and i'm going to say clip image 4 paste that in there save check it out in the final result and we got my cool custom weird looking arrow there now what you can also do is head over to the clip clip path maker and click on custom polygon and then just click to add some points you know i'm just going to go like this and then you can click on the in the check box in the top left here on your first point and drag them around to create a totally custom polygon shape that you can use in your there we go i kind of have like this hourglass sideways stanley cup you know and then there's your values and then feel free to just try coding them out yourself so those are the four examples we got our circle then different sets of polygons heavily using the bennett feely clippy path maker which is really cool thanks benefili check it check his site out follow him on twitter do all the things um because he's made a really great tool that makes our lives easier as web designers and web developers and those are your examples feel free to play around with them make custom shapes and use them in your own projects thanks for watching day three clipping images with shapes in css3 in 30 days cheers
