in this video we're going to talk about regular Expressions also known as regex regex has a really different format than everything else in JavaScript so it has kind of a steep learning curve and can be a little bit intimidating personally I'm very intimidated by regx though I know it can be a very useful tool and I've used it a lot successfully what you can do with regx is match replace search and split strings which can be one of the most difficult forms of data to manipulate in JavaScript the times this be useful if you have a website and you want users to create a password and you want their password to have at least one number and at least one capital letter you can use regex to make sure that their entry matches those qualifications for it to be valid there's like I said a lot of ways to use regex but the most common is when you're validating user inputed information I want you to remember this because when you get to the regx challenges don't worry it's going to be okay I know it looks really different and also if you're ever trying to do something like validate user information on your website or your web page or your bonfire whatever think about rigex because it might be a really efficient way to do what you're trying to do
