hey what's up welcome back to css3 in 30 days this is day number six called print specific styles jump over here in my browser print specific styles what we're going to be doing is creating a print specific style sheet using media queries in css so that when you hit print in your browser when you print a web page you know you can do that you can actually style the print style sheet so that when you are printing out like a graphic heavy or a colorful you know web page like this one for example you don't get all of the colors and all the backgrounds and the borders and all of the web specific styles you don't want to see that on a piece of paper because it doesn't it won't show up or you'll waste a ton of ink so you can style that that print specific style sheet so that it looks great so let me show you the example so here is print specific styles if i go ahead and hit command p to print this you can see the preview look at how nice that looks it's all black and uh black and white there's no backgrounds there's no colors or images we got a little bit of color here in the links but check this out as well so all the things like you know the the graphics and the 3d you know text and all that stuff that's gone and it's replaced with something very minimal and readable and things like the rotations on the heading that's fixed that's all straightened out and check this out right after a link it actually shows the url because in the on the web you can say click this link and have it be linked up in html and you don't have to see the url you just click it because it's interactive but on a piece of paper it's not interactive you can't click it you need to know what the url is so you can actually display that and i'll show you how to do that in a moment so very very simple it's just a single page and you can print that out and it would actually look quite nice so why don't we jump in and do that head over here to your code editor i'm using adam and i opened up my number six print styles it has the index sandbox and final css for your reference and enjoyment go ahead and download those print styles the course files for today that is in this module you can go ahead click that uh module lesson you just get the idea by now you should know how to do that so number six print styles we're going to jump straight into the sandbox and start coding it up this is going to be a pretty straightforward lesson so let's go ahead and do that so first thing you need to do is you need to do a media query and you know when you're doing uh you know media queries you can do things like screen and you know um max width you know 900 pixels that's going to style screens like your iphone or your computer at a max of 900 pixels so this is how you do like a media query for responsive styles but we're not doing responsive styles we're actually doing media print so you can do a print style sheet so we're going to style everything within these parentheses here so let's go ahead and first things first let's hide some on unwanted elements and i'm just going to bang through them here so we're going to hide course files is the is the button that says download course files the big blue button we're going to hide that i'm going to go comma what else am i going to hide we're going to hide the logo which is in the footer we're going to hide the sandbox before so now you know i'll show you what i'm doing here if i go to the index file i'm hiding the course files because i don't want to see that this you're not going to need to click that on a piece of paper uh the things like the oh let me find it here sandbox uh actually the sandbox isn't even in this specific lesson we're just using final so final dash result before so if i go to my index here the final result we're actually styling something in the theme styles called before so if i go over here to my browser and show you you know how we did this 3d sort of effect here if i inspect this and show you basically this is what that looks like here we've got final result before so we styled that to have that you know sort of um 3d element we don't want to see that in a print style sheet so i'm hiding that so go back to css so final result before we're also going to copy that another comma and info before because we did the same effect there and final result after we also have that same style going on there the after pseudo element and info after what else do we have here i believe we're going to hide the images i don't want to see any images and i'm just going to say display none all gone just like that now basically maybe let's go check it out print all right so okay so everything is showing up for me because what's happening is we're hooking in the final css but we're trying to sell the sandbox so here go back to our code editor here in your index if you want to hide the final result all you're going to have to do here is final project css use for reference just comment that out if you want to hide the print styles so let me even just put a comment here so yeah comment this out if you want to hide the final styles so now let's go back to our browser if i hit refresh and then print command p i will see there we go so it's everything's still kind of styled uh in a in a basic way there some browsers will automatically remove things like backgrounds if i go to more settings i can like you know i can adjust the margins i can leave the headers and the backgrounds and the graphics so if i left that in basically it's just styling the web page as you can see that so let's go back here to our code editor in sandbox let's continue and now let's do the i'm going to call this the global typography reset and comment that make a comment there okay and now in the global typography reset what we're going to do is we're just going to select body and we're going to say font family i want to make it georgia georgia is a nice georgia and serif is uh people like reading serif typically on paper you read serif typefaces like in books whereas on the web sans serif is a pretty good um font i mean obviously you can there's no hard and fast rules but serif fonts are nice to read on paper so georgia is a good one font size we're going to say 16 point which is kind of more of a print based measurement instead of pixels because we're not really using pixels on paper there's no pixels on paper so we're going to use points line height we're going to say 24 points background no backgrounds and then the color straight up flat black i'm going to say that let's keep going before we view it let's do a layout reset and i'm going to say final result info these are all classes by the way class info and then section html5 element and footer we're going to say width 100 because they have specific widths currently border no borders padding 0 margin 0 and color triple 0 as well because some of those elements have different colors so save that now let's view it and see what it looks like refresh command p to view all right so you can see that we're getting there it's pretty messy i mean if i use the default settings here and i just turned off background graphics then you can kind of see that it's already looking okay but let's leave that on so that we have to override it all right let's keep going let's go down to the uh keep going in the section uh the layout reset here we're gonna say section first child before uh that is the top border uh on the instructor that the in the section that says instructions i want to hide that i'm gonna say border none save that and now let me save that and check it out in the browser let me see what we have so far see if we were missing any sort of global styling okay so i don't want any backgrounds you know this stuff is hard to see i don't want to see that big logo up at the top i don't want any of these backgrounds so let's go back to the code editor and remove the backgrounds in these sections and remove this background logo so i want to hide this uh i believe it's in body and before so body before we want to remove that element altogether and what do we have the backgrounds and final result yeah backgrounds and sandbox final result info so go back here uh in layout reset i want to add background none and in fact background none is in there as well great so now body right after the global typography reset i'm actually just going to change this to say global reset and then body pseudo element before display none and let's actually move body before up to the to the hide unwanted elements so we don't even let's just do it right at the very top body before comma save that now let's see hit print all right we're getting there we're getting there what else do i want to hide i want to hide these tabs i don't want these tabs here so what are those those are final result i believe those are um h2s so we got body final result h2 yes i don't actually want to see those let's hide that as well so let's go final result h2 and info h2 save that that should solve the problem let's uh let's have a look there we go those are gone so we're getting there you start you start to see that this is looking a little bit more like it needs to uh not perfect but let's keep going okay down to the bottom oh we've already done that now let's do some specifics so i'm going to say specifics and we're going to say h1 2 3 4 5 and 6 and we're going to straight up say color triple zero to override any styles there font size 24 points line height give it some line height of 30 points and margin no margins and now let's do even more specific we're going to say h1 we're going to style that one to the font size 50 points margin 0 0 20 points text align center width 100 transform oops transform rotate zero because it's currently going to rotate and we don't want to see that and then let's style the small h1 uh h1 small tag within there we're going to say font size 24 points we're going to say color triple 8 a little bit lighter than black margin 0 0 10 points okay and let's uh save that and check it out one more time over here refresh hit print what do we got looking better already day6 print specific styles the small is right there this is large they got margins at center beauty beauty beauty all right now what do we got so let's go back here to this to the style sheet sandbox right after h1 small let's go ahead and select the a link we want these links to be to have no margins and let's do a after pseudo element this is where we're going to add the text of the url so this is how we do that we say content and then we open uh some strings here and in that first string set of strings a space and then a square open square bracket outside of the string attribute we're going to select the href and then a space after that open and close another set of strings and then close the square bracket and then close to the semicolon and then let's just do one last thing here we're going to say footer a link and footer a visited we're gonna go color triple zero and then background none save that let's go over here refresh hit print see what we've got this is looking pretty good uh i see that there's some weird padding around this link and i know that we had padding because we had those little popup boxes in the footer and this text is too gray i want it to not be gray i want it to be black so let's go here we're going to say padding zero in fact in all the links we're just gonna say padding zero maybe that will solve the problem then i want the text within all of these sections color zero i'm just gonna say important on that to override any styles let's see what we've got refresh print okay so the the padding on the links didn't change and that didn't change all right let's find out why so i'm gonna select this inspect it and i'm going to what do we got footer a link padding so i'm gonna have to over be more specific there yep and this text why is it not overriding info p okay go back over here i'm gonna actually change this remove that and i'm gonna say down here under h1 small i'm gonna say info p and i'm gonna say color triple zero and this should this should be padding zero and a link doesn't need padding that should do it save head over to the browser do a refresh and a print and we should have our final print specific style so now if i change here in the settings and do backgrounds and graphics it should really just all it's modifying is the day number six it wants to be darker which is fair in fact why don't we just change that right now let's go h1 small let's just change this to triple zero and that should do it back to the browser refresh print and there we go we've got our print specific style sheet if i change these settings now it really shouldn't do anything at all beautiful those are the print specific styles great work now what you can do is you can take these styles add them to your own websites your own blogs applications client sites whatever it is and just go to any random page and hit command p and go to print it out and see what the preview looks like and you can see if they have a style sheet for print or not and on your own websites you can go ahead and add some print style sheets so that if for some crazy reason your grandfather wants to print out your website he'll be able to read it properly on his good oldfashioned piece of paper
