hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to work on some more html and css we're just going to continue on with what we were doing yesterday did make a few adjustments yesterday mainly in the javascript so i'll briefly go over uh what we've done harshit helped out a lot with that and then we'll get right into it uh probably gonna be about an hour and a half for this stream uh we'll see i actually haven't been feeling that well so my stomach hurts really bad i have no idea why so if it gets like worse then maybe i'll end the stream but for now i think i'm okay to stream um let me see we may have i keep trying to get one of my coworkers to come in on the stream she's just starting out with coding and i thought it would be cool since we're doing beginner stuff if she would come in and ask questions too but she said she's too tired so we'll see we'll see if she comes um also my camera keeps stopping um so i don't know i can get it turned back on uh i'm just gonna have to keep an eye on it and make sure that it's it's still going so just to just heads up if my screen just freezes like it did just now then i need to restart it yeah so all of a sudden my fan will start going really fast and my camera shuts off i don't know why that's happening all right so let's switch over to the code and see what's going on here let me check the live chat quickly just to say hello uh looks like oh harshit wrote a blog today uh about graphql so it's really cool uh harshit's blog is hp techblogs.com so check that out if you want to read some of his blogs hey everybody um all right oh cool um ethan said great holiday sweater yeah i actually have two holidays let me show you all this other holiday sweater i got i should have done it when i had the camera on full so here i'll switch it back really quickly so we had a white elephant uh christmas gift exchange so uh at my my office today and i got this women's christmas sweater vest so i was wearing it around earlier i have a picture of me with it on on my instagram now because it actually fits me evidently women's size medium is the perfect size for me so i think i'll probably give it to my wife though let's see also i do want to mention since ethan's here in the live chat so ethan did a um a stream two days ago i think it was two days ago um he went through a bunch of the new es6 challenges for free code camp and um went through them all solved them uh wrote the tests uh so it was really cool i i watched some of the stream live and i watched some of the recording of it as well and you did a great job ethan so uh anyway if you haven't checked that out already i think it's really cool and it's a good overview if you would like to contribute to any of the free code camp challenges then you know check out that video and just to get a perspective of how someone else contributes and then maybe it will give you a good idea if that's something you'd like to do uh andrew says uh is also learning graphql alongside gatsby intimidating at first but it seems really powerful uh yeah definitely though that was what i thought about it at first uh if you're not using graphql already check it out we've done some streams about it you can go back and watch those uh we'll be doing more streams with graphql later on but now that i've used it i don't ever want to use anything else so if you're using maybe rest apis right now check out graphql it's it's worth learning all right um ethan said thank you so much you're welcome no problem all right um hey vernice here i do okay so uh vernique says hey jesse hope you remember me from nashville in november i was the one you're helping with the bookstore project i'm still learning yeah for sure i remember i was just wondering recently how you were doing with the project um so i don't know what yeah i don't remember just like out of nowhere i was thinking hey did she ever finish that project but anyway thanks so much uh for uh for coming on and checking out the stream all right let's yeah let me get started okay you're still working on it vernee cool you'll have to um if you can i'd love to check out the project once it's finished so i know there was some of the api you're trying to hit was uh you could only access it from a certain place so i don't know if you if i could see a working version of it but if it's possible that would be kind of cool if you're up for it okay so let me get started and let me start my pomodoro cycle if you haven't watched before i kind of break the stream up into several pomodoro sessions so we do 25 minutes of code we take a five minute break and i answer some of your questions in the live chat and we do another 25 minute session and then after that the whole second half of the stream is all just answering questions in the live chat so be patient if you ask a question and i will get to it at some point during the stream all right so let me switch back so you all can see the code so very quickly let me show you what i've done and what hardship has done in terms of correcting the problem we were having yesterday so if you remember yesterday we had um the deed let me bring let it bring over the website so you all can see it it's on my other screen now i have too many screens open sorry still trying to find it there we go okay so yesterday we were having problems where these were all um like drop downs right they were hidden by default you had to click on details to get them to show so obviously we solved that problem right it you can see everything by default so here's how we did that so harshit submitted a pull request yesterday and uh went through let me make this a bit bigger i'm gonna hide this on the side make it bigger and we don't need this right now so i'm going to shrink it and let me know if that's not big enough for the font size i can make it even bigger uh let me get okay let's um someone asked about ngrok so let me give give you that link i think i still have the server on from yesterday i never yeah i do so i never turned it off so here's the link so you can check out the site live as we're working on it and um if you want let me give you the the ending so this is where we're at so if you want to paste that onto the end of the link that's what page we're on the program i'm using as my editor is visual studio code it's for microsoft and it is free uh let's see oh harshit says that i can remove this globalx content that was for testing all right cool thanks yeah i wasn't sure why that was in there uh but it worked with it in there and um i've been harsh it's been working with me on these projects for long enough that i i trust that that was okay to have in there so anyway i left it in we'll take it out now so basically it's just using a regular expression here um and then it's replacing it with in this case a div that's class of details and then a closing div so i had to change a little bit so the problem i was having originally was that there were some other tags that had the word details in the tag and it was catching those tags as well and it was changing it so it has some really weird things happening with the html so what i did was included the entire tag so in the opening and closing brackets and then here i included the slash as well so i have you see i have a two two different slashes here the first one tells the first one basically means whatever i type next uh you know treat it as part of what i'm looking for you know because normally the slash would have a special meaning in a regular expression but in this case i i actually want to search for a tag that has that slash in there okay so um the g means global so we're gonna try to find every instance of that uh so anyway that's that's really the only changes i made uh from what uh what horseshit had done and that that works also in our css which we'll be working mainly in our css now i added this right column blogs and the br tag to our list of things not to display because there were some really weird positioning things going on because of these two this was an element that had a lot of stuff in it but it was all empty but those things are still taking up a lot of space and then there's for some reason wordpress is inserting a ton of breaks so until i figure out how to fix that on the wordpress side of things i just decided to display none for for the you know br tags all right so that's where we are now once once i did that with the br tags though some things got out of place so these were all stacked on top of each other uh now you can see they're side by side they're definitely better stacked on top of each other but instead of adding the the breaks we'll just add some some css to get them positioned properly all right so let's go let's go to our dev tools so i'm going to inspect this and let's move this over to the side and uh the first thing we're going to try to do because i think it'll look um pretty simple uh and clean is we're just going to try to get this all to display properly right in a row and this will be the way we want it to look on a small screen so let's say like on a on a phone screen right so the way we'll probably do this is we'll start with a small screen view get it looking good and then expand and then see what adjustments we should make for a larger screen i guess you could call this like mobile first um so that's the way we're going to do it so today i'd like to you know get these all stacked properly and then get the formatting on this list we need to fix it a bit that's font's too small i don't want it to be bolded so if we can accomplish that today i'll be happy so first things first let's get these stacked i want the title at the top above the image and then i want these items phone number email this link to a cv all stacked so first let's check out this title and probably the easiest way to make them stack will be to do a display block all right so if we do a display block it's stacked right there so what i'm going to do then is just take all of these elements and add display block to them so i'm going to move this off to the side now so i can see it and i'm gonna go back in here and let's add add a few things in so this is all just plain css we're going to add the name name tag there's a lot of custom html tags which is it's valid to do this but it may look a little strange and we also need the phone and email email and let's go cv link now there's another tag here that we're not using right now but some faculty member profiles might have it so i'm going to add it in here and that's a video embed alright so just in case we run into that later on it should be covered by these rules and the last thing we have is center column details and that would be that um this education right here that's the center column details so we'll add that as well all right so now we're going gonna do a display oops display block and let's save that and we'll give it a refresh all right cool so uh now we have this all stacked up hmm well that's interesting i i now remember that we did not do anything uh to make this responsive at the top so we make sure we won't forget that uh so that that's gonna mess with our responsiveness a bit here or being able to test it out properly so i'm gonna just open this a little bit so we can see what's going on here and try to get that fixed probably the next thing i do will be fixing that alright so that's not bad let's look at our spacing we're going to need to add a little bit more spacing here um above education i think we should add some spacing between the image and that phone number maybe a little bit see on this image it doesn't look bad because there's so much white at the top but i think on a different image where there's not so much white this is going to look cramped so let's add maybe you know eight pixels of space here we'll try maybe 16 and that should be okay for this i do want to check the font size on this it looks a little small for me a little smaller than i like let's bring this back over so we can check the font size i guess we have no font size set so is it automatically setting that's odd i guess it's just going to whatever the default is so what i'd like to have let's just see what's uh 16 pixels all right so we were at 16. i thought it was 16 16 is not bad but i'd like to go closer to 18. we'll try 18 on everything um if it looks we'll see how it looks i like to go with a larger font uh you know for readability uh let's see all right so let's go ahead and put in here for for the p tags we want font size to be 18 pixels and that's not going to cover everything uh because we have some things in in other tags but we'll add those as we as we find them uh now let's let's try to add here under our title uh let's let's do it in dev tools so that you know we can see the result so let's go with the margin bottom of let's try eight pixels first and see how that looks actually that's not bad it's hard to see right because of you know the color of that image but i think eight eight works you know what i think is i'd also maybe like to change the the font size i don't know where i here we go so i already had name here before font size 24. let's try 26 for that font size and then we'll go margin bottom eight pixels so we do uh try to follow material design and usually in material design things go in in like eight so you see eight pixels a lot 16 pixels uh as kind of the spacing between things so that that's what i usually start out with 8 16 um 24. i use those values a lot all right so that's fine for that one let's try to do a similar spacing here and this is under a phone uh so let's do whoops accidentally put that on the tag with with all this in here uh which it might not be bad to add some spacing in but i don't think that much spacing is yeah i don't know that i would want that much spacing uh so here on this tag let's go with margin top of yeah let's go eight that's not bad i thought it would be too small but let's just stick with eight for now and yeah we'll stick with eight for now i do want to make sure we have a proper line height for everything too so we'll take care of that in a second so here let's just take this and i'm going to get rid of this font size and i'm going to change this to phone all right you can see right now i have very little organization to the css we may end up converting this and using it like in the component at some point uh or if we do leave it as css you know we'll kind of try to organize it better but for right now it's we don't have a lot so i'm not super worried about organization that may not be the best way to do it but i usually i don't worry about that when i only have a few lines all right so let's do this center column details and we're going to add margin top uh i'm going to try 16 pixels yeah 16 is better okay because we really want to separate that out you know from from this so 16 looks good uh and that heading could maybe be a bit bigger as well so let's try to do the heading um let me add a class for heading let's try to make all those those headings there uh 20 let's let's try 22 pixels all right i'm gonna see this in comparison to the title here um actually i want the title to be larger i'm not sure though that what we've done to the title has actually taken effect yet so uh because we did change that and make it a bit bigger okay but i like that so let's let's check with that this is center column details the center column details is going to get a margin top of 16 pixels and then the header heading yeah it's called a heading right heading is going to get a font size of 22 pixels let's double check to make sure we increased our font size for name and we did all right so i'm going to save that and i'm going to refresh it now so we can see all of our changes okay uh yeah this is still it's still not looking as big as i would like it to be even though we made the font size 26 so let's go let's go with 30 and let me make sure okay i'm not zoomed in all right i'm going to go with 30 for this one because i want it to be obviously you know bigger than these subheadings and i think at 30 you you can get that immediately anything lower than that and it's not uh you have to kind of look at it more closely to tell so let's go with 30. and again if you're just joining me and you haven't watched the streams before please be patient if you've written a question in the live chat i will get to the questions in the live chat uh in just a few minutes i split things up and i do some coding and then i go back to the live chat so i'm in the coding session right now uh and then we'll do some question and answer stuff here in just a little bit all right so let's do that i did notice something with the phone number where i put the wrong thing so i it should have been margin top and i just copied from name and so i got the wrong wrong thing it there we go okay much better let's see i want to make sure our font size change took effect yes font size 18 but it seems like on this we're we're not at font size 18. so let's add in to our font size 18. let's just add in ul's as well and see if that'll cover uh what we want and actually yeah let's let's try to do it here so it looked like there wasn't a font size set at all so we may be able to just cover everything if we put this on main here and then the ones that we specified here should override that let's see if it works that way okay all right not bad now this looks right i'm going to double check though okay it's inherited that yeah let's see if let's see if i took that off okay so that one main didn't really do much okay so i may as well take that off of main since it didn't do anything anyway and it's working on almost everything we just have these so let's see what kind of tag that is oh h6 that's odd okay so uh we're gonna have to override the default size for an h6 so i usually i i don't like to override the h tags as much if i don't have to but in this case obviously we can't have it that small so let's override those h tags and we can try to be specific and say h tags that are just within an li it it probably doesn't matter i'm thinking the only place where we're going to see h6s on the faculty pages are in here um but i i honestly think it'll help me reading this later on to know why exactly i made that change the 86 if i specify here that it was in an li h6 and let's do font size let's make them this should be the same as the headings no we need them to be smaller than the headings let's make these let's let's try 20. okay 20 pixels looks pretty big you know what i don't mind 20 pixels there so i don't really even mind 18 but i do want to take off the the bold so let's you know let's play with the font weight a bit so uh font weight is kind of like the boldness right of the um uh of the font so we're gonna take it through some here 400 is the baseline of what we have everywhere right now all right we could go five did we have five or six let's try five right now and let me take this off yeah it looks like it's six so i don't want six hundred five looks much better and we still have a little distinction there um let's let's check this out i want to see let's see what what it'll look like if we change all these font weights to 300. hmm i actually really like the look of a thinner font i'm going to stake i'm going to keep that thinner font now but definitely want to test this it may not be as readable on on certain screens so i'm gonna kind of tentatively uh keep the font uh font weight at 300. all right so let's add this here as font weight 300 and then our eight sixes as font size would we have that at 20 and then font weight at what was we said 400 yeah okay all right so i'm going to save that give it a refresh to see if anything looks really weird no that looks fine at least on my monitor that font still seems really small i mean is that really 18 it just seems it is really 18. wow there we go all right so line height 1.5 at least for me on my screen makes it seem a lot more readable so let's add that in as well i usually use a line height of 1.5 so that's not bad we'll stick with that actually yeah we'll keep it line height 1.5 okay now my pomodoro timer did go off a minute or two ago so i'm gonna go short five minute break i'm gonna go back to the live chat right now and um i will answer as many questions as i can also just notice that my camera shut off so i'm gonna get that camera started again there we go i guess it doesn't really matter if you all can see me so not a big deal i'm going to leave it on this screen so i can see my timer and i'm going to scroll up see what questions i missed nino says do you think php is a good language because there's a big gap in that field and a big opportunity to make something um it my feeling on uh programming languages is you can build good things and terrible things with any programming language so i personally don't have as much fun building things in php i enjoy javascript more so there are certain languages that i personally like more than others just because of my experience with it how good i am with those languages you know the amount of syntax that it takes right like python just seems more fun to me than php uh just because of the syntax right but it does depend on your exposure so i would say if you enjoy using php and you can get a job with it then use php i don't really know any of the statistics as to whether or not jobs and php are growing or shrinking or anything like that but you might want to look into that as well uh if you're trying to plan out you know what you want to do for your career another good thing to keep in mind is it's not that hard to switch from one program programming language to another so even if you decide to specialize in one now you could always change it up later on you know if you know if things shift you know you gotta you know you have to learn what you need you know for your job be able to support yourself and your family pay the bills oh okay harsha's irish it says uh and this was a little while ago it said it's it's 1 30 pm there so he's really sleepy yeah uh i'm sorry am i am um yeah harshit if um if you if you need to go to sleep by all means go to sleep i only i just had to start later today because uh we had a christmas party here at the office so i'll i'll try to make sure i don't stream this late usually let's see uh harshit recommends moving the css to a style jsx tag so that it may be scoped and nonrender blocking and splitted it will also give live reloading or should i think i will move it into a tag like that for these videos since i i wanted to take this opportunity to do some videos that would be as easy as possible for beginners to understand i decided to use the css file but you're you're completely right we will get some benefits from moving it into our component with the style.jsx tag so if if you don't know much about react and you didn't understand what we i was just talking about don't worry about it it's it's just a certain way you could do something when working with react so you don't need to worry about it unless you really want to learn react uh let's see sergio says hello i'm new here is he doing some kind of free code camp challenges i'm not doing the challenges right now in this stream i actually work on the projects that i need to for my job as a frontend developer i work for a small university and so we're redoing the main website for our university and so that's what i'm working on right now i'm working on a template that's going to display all the faculty members here at the university uh moises asks what are those colors on the number column um i'm not sure i'm not exactly sure what you're asking like what number column you're asking about so if you can if you're still watching uh could you give me some hints as to what number column you're talking about i'm sure if i would have saw your comment while i was doing it it would have been obvious but now after the fact i can't remember what i was doing that would have a number column uh so anyway i'd love to answer your question just need a little bit more info if possible please uh okay so i'm going to go back to the coding for a bit and then i'll come back in the live chat so if i didn't get to your question yet stick around for a little while if you can and i will get to your question if for some reason you can't stick around i'll still answer your question later on and you can always watch the recording of this video uh and uh hear the answer to your question uh you know whatever time you feel like watching the recording okay so let's start this up uh we'll do one more pomodoro session let's see okay i think we're good i do need to make sure that i'm home in time uh to watch the baby so my wife is and most of my kids are gonna go christmas caroling at a nursing home but uh my youngest cordelia who's one and a half almost um she was sick last night so obviously we don't want her going to nursing home she might get you know the people that are sick so i'm gonna stay home with her but that means i have to make sure i'm home from work and enough time for for them to get over to the nursing home all right so let's see what we want to do now all right so we have everything in a column the spacing is not bad it's not perfect let's see what we can do about it all right it looks like we need less spacing between education and this first bullet point we need to make education as a header and these we need to make them the same it looks like something's off in here so maybe it's i think it's the weight uh so we'll have to match the font weight so i think this is 400 and this looks like 300. so let's match those font weights and then let's change the yeah it's it's going to be slight but i definitely think there's less spacing here so we're going to change that up a bit and then we'll move on and we'll work on the spacing down here okay so first things first let's see what tag this is so this is a heading heading tag and i think if we put font weight 400 yep that should do it for the font weight and then let's do a margin bottom uh let's let's see where we're at let's do a zero first all right so we don't really have yeah we have nothing there right now what's giving us that space there we go it's it's inside of a paragraph tag that's our problem let's see what we can do where is this paragraph tag you know what we probably don't even originally have a paragraph tag it's just wordpress is adding this in here for us all right we can we can select just this paragraph tag and let's do that here just to test it out and let's go with the margin oops bottom of zero that didn't even move it up did it now it's making no difference interesting that's really odd okay well i guess we won't worry about that let's take this off there now and well in this case i think we're just gonna have to do a negative margin if we can here uh so let's find where are we at so we gotta go inside this p tag again and let's find this let's go with the center column details and let's add our margin onto this so let's go margin oops margin bottom of let's go with a negative eight pixels and now i'm gonna have to i'm gonna eyeball this a bit for now if we can get it close i'll be all right with that that looks pretty close i'm gonna leave it at that for now because that's yeah that's really really close okay so we're going to add a margin bottom of 8 to our center column details and then we're also going to add that uh where is it at heading we're going to add that font size or i'm sorry font weight 400 all right wonderful all right now let's go down hey did that not work let's inspect it all right it's being overridden which is okay so let's go in here and just make it a bit more specific um so i'm just gonna put this inside of the p for now i know that will work it should have worked oops i added pixels on the end all right so i may not even need this now uh it's supposed to just be 400 not 400 pixels that's my problem all right great that works okay let's check out the spacing here i'm most worried about the space between these uh this should be a lot closer since this description goes with this of heading here so let's find our h6 and we're going to want to remove most of that bottom margin so we can see we have a 46.6 uh down here so it's the margin is probably a em yeah so we have an em value uh let's try to make it let's just go right here with our six let's go margin bottom let's give it eight pixels oh i like that yeah i like that a lot okay and actually let's go with the margin top of 16 pixels yeah much better much better hmm you know what i may even wanna let's increase this to 24 and let's bump this down all right so something else is messing it up it's it should be all right let's figure out what else is messing this up okay so on these p tags uh we also have a margin at the top here which in this case i think a negative margin is going to be the easiest way for us to go instead of trying to select these p tags and not affect some of the other ones so let's go back on that h6 and let's go with that margin bottom and let's take it negative and 12 looks not bad yeah 12 is not bad on these headings i'd like to have a little bit more space though uh above each one all right so let's first put this in see uh see you can see the value now uh especially if you're just starting out the value of using devtools of being able to immediately just kind of adjust your changes and then you can just copy and paste them right over into here you know just quickly hit save and then a refresh on your browser just to double check that everything worked and there you know just kind of line by line you can test your uh your styles and you know we've kind of made quick work of of this page and cleaned it up quite a bit and we have like a really nice tight feedback loop you know like immediately we can see the changes so it can at least for me it you know really helps save a lot of time you know being able to you know do things like this okay i want to now add a margin on the top of these headings sorry for the yawn okay margin top 16 no it's not working why is it not working all right so let's let's go up a bit here to these right column details and let's add it on right column details margin top 16 pixels um that's not working either all right let's add it to the bottom then see if we can make it work on the bottom all right this is odd i'm not able to change the margins and padding here why can i not do that all right i know i've run into things like this before and i can't really remember oops you know what maybe um ah that's why i chose the wrong wrong thing okay let's try this again we want center column details uh so let's go with center column details margin bottom let's go 16 pixels there we go that's what we want uh let's try 24 24 pixels okay much better i just wanted to make it more apparent that these headings go with the what's below it all right and not with you know what's above so we have it has messed up this spacing why would i mess up that spacing hmm all right well i like i like this look i'm going to keep this look all right so this does look oh that's why so this was in the center column details as well hmm oh so we already we already had the center column details that we were using and we just overrode that okay all right all right let's take this out let's change this 24. let's see what this looks like okay not bad could use a bit more here uh you know why because this is actually this is right column details okay all right this is what we're running into before where we just had some weird things going on here all right let's see if we can do there we go all right so we had set everything else to display block but not right column details so let's add that to our display block so that's what we needed to be able to make this this margin work so we're going to do that and then we're going to add under right column details this margin top of 24. save that and refresh great all right everything looks uh how we wanted it to look not bad yeah not bad a lot better than what we started with let me check my time here about seven minutes um okay so let's well my camera went off again so let me set reset my camera okay cameras reset and let's think about this let's do um i'm going to try something with the positioning of this this container so this test id content should be the container for all of our content in here uh so i'd like to make a max of 90 percent it's just going to work there we go all right so that'll bring this in a bit and let's try to do a percentage so we want this hmm let's go with let's do some media queries here all right so with this the default is going to be max with and we're going to say 90 percent and then we're going to give it a margin of zero auto which you can use to center uh something that is not everything will center like this but for sure if it's set to display block uh you can center it like this it also has to have a width all right so we're going to do that but then let's add this media query so let's go um media screen and uh let's go um with i'm gonna have to look at the syntax for this i haven't written a media query by hand in a long time media queries there we go okay it is a hyphen uh min width and we're gonna say let's just do 600 pixels for now as i'm in with and then now we're going to say we want the max width to be oh let's say 70 oops forgot to put in the uh yeah let's just copy this so i'm there we go a bit spoiled by sass not having you write as much uh what did i say i wanted that to be 70 yeah let's try 70 for that so i'm going to save that and refresh okay great so it should be 70 percent of the screen width in this case which so you can see it's only taking up 70 percent but as we get down to lower than 600 pixels it changes and now it's taking up 90 of the screen width right because on a smaller device you know we want to be able to show everything we're not as worried about you know screen uh real estate there so that's that's what i wanted i mean there's definitely room for uh adjusting that but that just roughly gives it you know kind of a better look um you know more of a look that we were used to and so let me explain that media query so if you are i i've advertised this stream as being a very good stream for beginners so let me change or let me go through what's what's happened here because this um is if you're just starting out a media query is kind of a somewhat tricky thing to deal with so here's what i've done i've made the default so this simply selects a div that has the attribute the data test id attribute of content okay because we happen to have a div like that so we've selected that div and this would be you know very similar to selecting a div that has a class of content right we've just kind of made up our own attribute there so by default the max width is 90 okay and as i said the zero margin zero auto centers it so the default size is actually the mobile size right once we get the screen bigger once it gets to 600 pixels right so if so basically this is saying the minimum width of the screen that anything within this query uh will work on is 600 pixels so anything below 600 pixels this will be ignored if you're above 600 pixels this will be run it's below this so it will use the cascading nature of cascading stylesheet css and it will go with whatever value this has overriding this value so that's why we didn't have to add margin 0 auto again all right that's not overwritten here just this one so once the screen gets 600 pixels it switches over all right or 600 pixels or more it switches over to max width 70 percent and we could put anything we wanted in here we could make the text size go to 300 if we wanted to on a big screen we could make the background color go green if we wanted to really anything you can reposition elements you know anything that you can do with css you can put inside a media query if you wanted to go the other way around and have this be the base value for a large screen and have whatever's inside the media query only apply on a small screen you just switch it and do max with instead of min with and then with max with what would happen is anything that's above 600 pixels won't have any of this stuff applied to it but if it's below 600 pixels then anything in here will be applied right so these i know were really tricky for me starting out with html and css it took me a long time to get comfortable enough to kind of write my own at first i always just copy and pasted ones that i know worked from other projects and would just kind of adapt those ones you know even now i had to look up the syntax so i got to about here and had to double check and make sure i was doing it right so i've been doing this for years and i still have to look up the syntax so don't feel bad about that but it can be tricky trying to figure out well should i put min or should i put max so it usually takes a lot of practice before you can just remember it and i get confused about it still but anyway that's basically how media queries work they don't have to be with you could set a height sometimes that type of thing helps if you're trying to target like a landscape view on a phone or you know something like that you can set um a width or a height right because some big phones have much larger dimensions than you would normally think so it's it's helpful uh you can target um a lot of other things right so you can actually target orientation so landscape or portrait uh for a phone you can target aspect ratio um i don't really know all the things that you can you can target uh you can make a media query just for print so it'll only work when the user goes to hit print and then you can have print only styles be applied so anyway a lot of cool stuff you can do with that but the most common use i've ever seen for these are for width for responsive layouts so when you hear people talk about responsive uh websites most of the responsiveness comes from these media queries okay there are some things you can do with javascript uh that can also help and some things you can do with setting like percentage widths on items that's very important but you know the magic happens in the media queries okay i went over my time for coding and kind of talked a little bit but i know that was really tricky for me so i wanted to make sure i got a good explanation of that and for all of you hopefully that made sense all right so now we've gone through two pomodoro cycles we've accomplished everything that we wanted to and a little bit more which is great uh i don't think i messed up anything today which is a very rare occurrence so i'm happy and my stomach quit hurting and i feel fine now so all in all this was a really amazing stream today so i'm going to scroll back up to where i left off in the live chat and i'm going to answer all your questions so if you have a question you haven't put it in the chat yet please do so now uh you can also ask me questions on twitter if you like my the link to my twitter account is in the description below this video you can ask questions in the comments to the video uh i'm on all the different social media things so get in touch with me whatever way is most comfortable with you i'd be happy to answer your questions look at some code for you i can't guarantee that i can answer right away but i'll try to get to it as soon as i can all right one benefit of asking the question in the live chat is you not only get my answer which may or may not even be a good answer but you also get the expertise of all the other very talented knowledgeable people that are in the live chat right now so i do recommend that as the number one way uh to ask a question all right 329. okay so i did leave off with uh a question about what are the colors on the number column i'm still not sure what that was referring to so hopefully uh moises i'm hopefully i'm pronouncing that right hopefully moises has clarified later on uh down in the live chat and we'll see that in a minute uh some move on here uh john hanson as a comment says jesse you stated about trusting pixel size and it is absolute though it's a good idea to let others know that rem and em is often a better choice when it comes to responsive design okay yeah that's a really good point um yeah let's let me foreign i'm just double checking it to make sure i'm getting everything in the conversation here about rem and ems um okay so let me address that i do see a lot of people use rem or em the reason i don't use rem or em is because i just don't know enough about them to use them comfortably so i i really uh i have nothing against using them but i know what i do with pixels will work because i've used it before i'm open to learning more about using em instead of pixels as a unit and uh if that is generally the better way to do things then you know i'll i'll try to learn it and i'll try to use that from now on uh but at least for this stream i was definitely not comfortable using that so i guess that's but that's a good disclaimer on this so if you're watching and you're used to using rem or em don't switch up the pixels just because you saw me do it uh i this may not be the best way to do it it is a way to do it and it works but there may be a better way uh so and i think that can go for everything that we do on this stream as well uh i'm definitely just showing one way to do things and that's the way i know how to do it and i'm always trying to learn better ways to do it so if if you think you know a better way to do something please let me know i can't guarantee that i'll start doing it right away because i'll have to learn how to do it first but i'll definitely take it into consideration and try to use it and if you ever want to submit a pull request to one of the projects and use a technique that you think is better feel free don't feel like you have to match what i'm doing all the time i'll review the pull request i'll check it out i might ask you some questions so that i can understand it better and i may end up using your technique in in all my future projects so that certainly happened before uh with people contributing uh pull requests and it just blows my mind and i change the way i do things so anyway uh john hanson thank you for bringing that up and um yeah i wish i could say more about the difference but i i said i'm just not knowledgeable i know uh you john and a few others have brought that up in past streams and uh so i think maybe it's time that i better uh do a little bit of research on that uh no beer says uh jesse i think justifying your paragraph would also be better let's check that out yeah maybe we can yeah maybe we can try that out i'm not going to try it right now on the stream but maybe we have to try that out we'll try later on or maybe on another stream let's see also uh i want you all that are watching let me know what you think about these streams that kind of go over more basics uh because a lot of the streams lately have been going over more advanced things which is fun and challenging but i've noticed that i'm getting a lot of response and a lot of different people watching when i do these beginner type streams so if if you all think that this is beneficial let me know i'll try to work in some beginner stuff you know maybe at least like once a week if i can uh i may not always be able to do it depending on what i'm working on but uh i you know i'd love to be able to you know have these streams be accessible to to a wider uh audience so let me know what you all think about it okay john hanson says rem is a relative base that can be set even with media with at different sizes em is set as em is set uh we'll then change the pixel sizes with the width changes okay that's interesting so basically we could get like a responsive font size with em let me know if that's what you're saying john if i have that right uh i think that's what you're saying and that actually seems really cool so the idea then would be the font size would actually get bigger or smaller depending on our our screen size uh which i really like that um i i love that idea so yeah let me know if i if i'm understanding that correctly please uh yusuf says hey i'm a newbie here and uh newbie decoding so do you think vue is a good option to start uh learning a framework for js um i haven't used vue myself but i've heard a lot of good things about it there's uh people that you know that work as developers that i i respect their work and they use view so i'd say it's probably fine to start out with but i would i would caution um try to learn some of the basics of javascript before you go right into the framework now i'm gonna put a big disclaimer on that right if you need to do projects and get work done so that you can support your family and pay the bills use whatever you can use right uh i totally understand that so if you know you can get a job or clients right now and you need to use vue do it but just while you're doing it remember to keep up you know your studies on normal javascript because that's going to set you up to succeed later on when let's say nobody uses vue anymore you know years down the road well if all you knew was view and you never took the time to learn basic vanilla javascript then it might be a lot harder for you to switch to whatever the new framework is that people are using so if you have time and you're learning try out some regular javascript first before you go into a framework whatever that framework is which view is a good one but if you got to jump into stuff and use vue there's nothing wrong with that just be aware um that that you take a little bit of time to learn you know some of the basics so um i'm open to other opinions on that as well i know i i've heard people have strong opinions before about making sure you learn vanilla javascript and i said assuming you have all the time in the world to just study yeah that's probably a good way to do things but realistically most people don't have that luxury so i'm i'm not gonna you know uh say hey you got to do it like this and make everyone feel bad for not being able to do that so i say try to do it the best way you possibly can within reason you know taking into account your situation let's see oh goodness no beer said it was it was 2 40 a.m uh where he's at and that was that was a while ago so it's probably after 3 a.m now thanks for staying up so late no beer please feel free to go to sleep if you're still awake yeah you can always just catch the end of the stream uh on the you know the recording john hanson has a quick react question which is better axios or fetch for in a simple post to a php mailer i have very limited experience with axios i've seen it in use i can't remember if i've ever actually used it myself but i am a big proponent of using fetch because it's well depending on the browser it's supported it's built in it's going to be more lightweight for you axios is another library you know that you have to learn uh more things you have to bring in i don't know how heavy axios is really so it could be super lightweight it's not an issue but uh i've always gone with fetch so but like i said i don't know enough about axios to really get into pros and cons other than i figure it's it's always better to just use you know whatever the base thing is you know for the browser which in this case is fetch not for every version of every browser but going forward that's i think that's going to be what's what's used so we may as well just use it now unless there's some feature in axios that that you really really need or like uh let's see rhaegal says in all honesty i like php and ruby and whatnot over javascript javascript just seems to do some really silly stuff by comparison and you have to secondguess it a lot in my opinion hey that's totally valid um let me see regal are you the one that asked earlier maybe not uh somebody had asked earlier about whether to learn php or something like that and i think i had mentioned you know it really kind of depends on what you like using so the bottom line is their jobs out there for php developers i mean think of all those wordpress sites out there right as long as wordpress is out there there's always going to be jobs for php developers um and then like ruby there's a lot of ruby sites out there there there's work for people in almost every language uh so find what you really love to to do and do it if you don't really have a preference then maybe you want to look more into well what what companies do i like to work for what do they use uh things like that um but i mean that's just the way it's gonna be yeah some people like chocolate ice cream some people like vanilla some people like strawberry it you know it's it's only natural that the same thing is going to happen with programming languages you know i like javascript i don't really care that much for php but i use it when i have to i don't hate it i just like javascript better um i don't think there's any programming language that i hate you know they just i like javascript better because i've had the most experience with javascript it makes sense to me right so you know when uh regular saying here it javascript seems to do some really silly stuff by comparison it doesn't seem silly to me because i'm used to it right uh so it just all kind of depends on what you're used to doing so there's nothing wrong with you know coding in whatever language you wanted like he said as long as as long as you're cool with it and you can do good things with that then you know go for it a good girl sammy says can you learn coding at 21 years old um yeah you can for sure uh i don't know if if you're asking if 21 is too old or too young to learn to code but i would say 21 is a finance to learn how to code i didn't really start getting into coding you know seriously full time until i was 20 in my late 20s i can't remember how it was exactly so i was in my late 20s um so and i'm an okay coder now uh you all can judge for yourself because i've done enough live streams that i'm not even going to attempt to rank myself as a coder uh it's it's there for everybody to see um but yeah so um if you want to learn coding and you're 21 go for it uh sergio said no you're too old most people start coding at 10. i'm assuming that that's a joke it's being sarcastic from sergio um horizon said but i like axios api more yeah in that case if you really like axios use axios right if axios works you know stick with it let's see uh rook says i'm 26 started less than a year ago um jordan asked if i was doing this in wordpress uh the data is coming from wordpress so i'm running uh what's called a headless uh installation of wordpress so i'm not using any of like the the themes right or the templates for things i'm just using it to be an admin interface for people to store data in a mysql database and then i'm using uh the wp graphql plugin to be able to use graphql to pull the data out and into our react project so what we were just working in is actually react but we were just pulling in a bunch of html and so we were doing it we were using just basic css and not really a more react style of doing css just because of the unique situation that we're in uh with this data so at some point we'd like to convert it all over so we can do it you know a little bit more properly according to the you know best practices with react uh but right now you know we need we just need to make sure that we get it looking good for launch day and uh so that's first priority um you know the other stuff will get pushed back and get can get taken care of after launch let's see uh good girl sammy is i'm just gonna follow this conversation a bit because i think it'll be helpful to uh newer people so good girl sammy says uh rook how long did it take you to learn it uh less than a year um because rickon said uh so rook started last year um let's see harder should ask if uh good girl sammy was starting from scratch um let's see uh john hanson says i just started html css a long time i started just html and css a long time ago but jquery php javascript react at the age of 60. never too old i like that thanks for sharing that john i see a hard caught that i was trying to use pixels on font wait thank you harshit i didn't see it in the live chat but i appreciate you putting it in there okay so good girl sammy is starting from scratch um but has a lot of ideas i just got to learn to code leonardo uh leonardo says what's up how are you doing how you all doing today uh i'm doing pretty pretty well uh now um so how's how you doing thanks for watching all right so poison said i'm glad other people have problems with styling i always thought i was the exception well i don't know about everybody else but i definitely have problems with styling sometimes i actually really love css i know i've heard some developers that are specialized in javascript say they don't like css but um i i still like it i i really like it it's just so easy to make things happen on the screen you know very quickly but it is tricky it's very tricky sometimes stephen says jesse going old school with straight css today yeah definitely uh good girl sammy says i got a question for you if if you got a nice idea for a project should you go to a company or should you try to build it yourself um my my answer to that would just be it depends on if you think you have the skills to be able to build it yourself so if um if you can then why not build it yourself it might be fun you might learn a lot in the process if it's a big idea where you think you know you're definitely going to need help with it or you know maybe a lot of funding then you might want to go to a company but don't really take my word for it i don't have a lot of experience at doing things like that you know sometimes i have ideas and i use them i figure out a way to use them in my my daytoday work so i can work on it i don't really have experience with going to a company and proposing my ideas let's see uh john hanson asks when the production build is deployed to the server why is it that so many things keep the site alive in in cache especially when updating the files is there an easier way around this um john are you asking in general or in particular to the sites that we've been doing on the stream uh in general i know there's there can sometimes be a caching problem uh for instance like a css file might be cached in a user's browser and you can't do anything about it unless you change the name of the css file so there are some things you can get that can automatically change the name every time you update your css file and then you push it changes the references some of my projects the earlier projects were set up with gulp and uh we had it set up to automatically change the references to the files in the production build and change the name of the css so that's one way to get rid of it but otherwise you know all your caching options can definitely be changed if you have caching going on in a server um you know you can you can set all that yourself even if you're using a content delivery network like cloudflare or something you can still go in and you know manually flush the cache so i guess depending on how you set things up you know it can make it harder or easier to get rid of the cash if you make updates but there's always a way to to make that happen uh rook says that shares a lot of fighting the markup you have to do there jesse how excited are you about everything eventually being in the right spot in the database i'm really excited i'm trying not to think about it too much because i know that day is is months away um so i'm i resign myself to the fact that i'm gonna have to fight with the markup for a little while uh but i'm i'm convinced that that is going to be the easier the faster route and we need speed for this project right now so the cool thing is going to be too that when the site comes out it's definitely going to be an obvious improvement over what the current site is so people are going to like it it's going to load a lot faster it's going to be more clean people are going to like it but then a month or two after once we get the data all sorted out we can actually make you know what we have going on now even better um so it's almost i think going to be a good thing because users are going to see this big change and it's going to be so much better and then not that long after that they're going to see these tiny little changes in the different parts of the site as we get the data you know sorted properly and when we do that we pull it in to our react components we're going to style it a bit differently we're going to do it exactly as we would have done it if we had the freedom right now to do it that way all the freedom of the markup so i think it'll be cool for people to see how actively you know we're keeping up with the site not everybody's gonna notice that but some people will and i think they'll appreciate that we might never know about it or hear any compliments about that but um i i think it'll be it'll be fun let's see okay harshit is responding to john hanson's question about uh caching uh and it's talking about um there's a way with webpack to automatic automatically change file names uh so yes that's pretty much what i was doing before with gulp but you can also do it with webpack hey quincy's here so quincy larson uh was in the the chat not sure if he's still here but he was here at one point uh if you don't know who quincy is um he is the the founder and head of free code camp so without quincy none of this would would be going on uh it's always a pleasure when quincy gets to check out some of the uh the live stream so i remember when free code camp first started up uh just thinking like what an awesome guy quincy was for starting this so uh i'm still a little bit starstruck whenever quincy's in the in the live chat uh rhaego says you fixed the bugs in your stomach yeah for sure honestly you know what i think it was i most of you probably don't care about my health problems but i didn't drink any water today i had in a double espresso and then i had at the christmas party some old wine and a root beer and i ate a bunch of food and cookies and i think that was just what killed my stomach so before the stream i drank some water and once that got through my system i think that's what would help maybe i was a bit dehydrated and had too much sugar so i feel like my kids when i tell them like you know don't have too much sugar you'll get a bellyache well that's actually true it happened to me today all right let's see poisoned asked how often are these live streams i i do try to do them every day monday through friday sometime around 2 p.m eastern time give or take an hour or two i don't always do them 5 days a week though frequently i end up having meetings or i might take a day off and i can't really stream from my house because the the internet connection is not fast enough there so anyway ideally my goal is five days a week so that's what i try for but usually it's less than that uh samson says i have missed a lot in the past few days but luckily i am back i'll be following the streams awesome glad to have you back samson all right quincy says great practical advice thanks quincy i really appreciate that all right um very sorry if i mispronounced this name i'm going to try my best let me know how it's supposed to be pronounced if i mess it up so it looks like it it just john all right so it looks like it's i l y o s j o n i'm not sure how to pronounce that so apologies for that please let me know how it's supposed to be pronounced anyway um they say hey there jesse you have uh given the best advice right now thanks i really appreciate that uh thanks i try my best i don't think i'm always right i might not be right even most of the time but uh i i try to do the best i can oh okay so so john hanson's saying you set rem on a div sorry we're we skip back to the conversation about pixels versus rem versus em uh so so like on a container div like the html or the body you set the rem then uh using media queries you set um you you set with with em and then they'll change relative to the width of the screen and he says it works great okay like i said i'm gonna have to do like test that out a bit and maybe i'll go through a tutorial or something and maybe we can try it out when we do uh we're gonna have to do a lot of different templates for different types of of pages so maybe on the next template we do hopefully i can learn enough about it that we can use it then that might be fun to try to do and then compare and then you all can see what it's like to do one or the other and how hard it was to implement one or the other and then what the results look like okay so ar asks why is synchronous functions bad practice um or in industry practice all right let's i'm gonna see if someone else answered that first so i don't say the same thing okay so ar i'm gonna do my best to answer this question i'm going to say right now i i don't know if i'll do a good job here um as i'm somewhat confused about the question uh because of that that second comment um so what i'm thinking is the question is really why are synchronous functions industry practice um well in regard to javascript at least um let me think i'm gonna mess this i'm gonna mess this up um at this point i'm wondering if i should just say i don't know enough or i should try to give this question a shot um how about this if you're still watching could you clarify your question just a bit uh because i'm not sure if you're asking why is synchronous functions an industry practice or why are synchronous functions a bad practice so let me know that and then maybe i'll try to answer that uh rhaego says for the record i'm 28 and i've been knowing web dev stuff since i was 16. that's awesome yeah you've had a nice run of it so far uh i'm going to try to say this name lei tala frey say i'm not sure it's not laitalafraise uh if you let me know what the best way to pronounce that is i'll be sure to pronounce it correctly from now on um anyway they say yes please do more beginner streams awesome i'll keep that in mind so once again please let me know in the chat or in some other way whether or not you like these type of beginner style streams if you'd like to see more of them uh or just you know general kind of advice on on that kind of thing particularly about what what i can do to help out beginners reiko says css is love css is life i remember when i was first learning html i'd style my pages using tables oh yeah i i remember that i remember when i first learned html i actually i learned html in css long before i actually started doing real web dev stuff uh so back in i don't know like the early 2000s tables were kind of what i learned with i'm glad we moved on from there i still occasionally have to work on some old site that uses tables and uh ever they're always like well can you make this responsive as soon as i see its tables i'm like oh it's always kind of a pain uh veronique says he has too much sugar jesse now you have my stomach hurting that was i feel so silly that it was like i ate too much sugar and i didn't drink any water like i'm a grown person like i should know better than that oh harshit has some answers about those uh synchronous functions so uh harsh it says synchronous functions actually block the code execution which slows down the application in an async function everything is fired simultaneously so execution is faster so that's kind of a good breakdown between the two i'm still kind of looking for a little bit more explanation in the the first question that ar asked but uh even if we don't get that horizon thank you for um for clarifying that um harshit says jesse i have a question uh how easy is it for me to get a job considering my current skill set honestly harshit um i think you have great skills you've been such a help in all of these projects that we've been working on um if i could hire you to do backend stuff here at the university i'd hire you right now um so i think you've got a great shot at getting a job you have a good portfolio you have a lot of pull requests that have been accepted for these projects so you have a lot to show that you know what you're doing um so i mean i know you're young you're only 16. so that's probably going to be an issue depending on what country you're trying to get a job in but that's really the only issue that i could see you know that i'm not sure about is is just simply the age thing um i mean i know like in the united states you can definitely work at 16 it's fine but would a company be comfortable hiring someone who's 16 for like a fulltime job probably not at least not here in the united states so but i i think potentially freelance might be a better route for you to go or eat better yet because because of your okay i should say i'm not getting a job now i'm at school okay so assuming that you're out of school later on you're older i don't think with your current skill set and assuming that you're going to improve your skills as well which i'm sure you will i think that you'll have a great time getting a job you'll have an easy time finding a job uh so i think the key thing will be just making sure that you get your work out there to companies to see because if they can see it i think they'll be impressed i'm always impressed with the work that you do so yeah when you get out of school make sure you let me know and if there's any way that i can hire you for something i probably will uh i don't know if i'll be in a position to do that but if i'm in a position to give you a recommendation or something i'd definitely do it so anyway um just keep adding on to your portfolio you know keep doing what you're doing with contributing to open source projects you know it seems like you're already doing all the things that people say will help you get a job uh so i would say just keep on with what you're doing and um like i said i think it won't be that hard and when it comes time for looking for a job um let me know i'd be happy to help you out you know check out your resume and stuff and give you some advice i've been on both sides of things i've been the person getting interviewed and i've been the person doing interviews for developer jobs so that's not a bad perspective to have you know being on both sides of that uh so you know i'd be happy to give you insight into that when the time comes uh let's see the hopeless brit says our website design teacher made us use frames slash iframes or something along those lines to lay out our sites this is back in 2015 oh wow um i was with you until you said 2015 so i remember learning frames also in the early 2000s with tables 2015 i will say this normally like web design courses at the high school and college level are usually behind the times when it comes to the latest stuff so um yeah so if i were doing a site now i would definitely not use frames i would not use iframes for the layout but it was done like that at one point all right so alberto has some more info about this synchronous uh asynchronous function thing so uh umberto says each type has their own uses it depends on whether the function calls are dependent on each other uh in some if not most cases you do not need calls to be fully executed before the rest of the code runs so you would want async calls uh for all of them to run at the same time you would want to use synchronous calls though to make sure that one function runs completely before the next okay that makes sense um umberto says i presume async would be industry standard because most function calls can be run simultaneously all right that's that's a great answer it's very informative thanks humberto uh christian says hello i've been following your live stream since august and i'm learning a lot specifically on react js your videos are some of my goto resources awesome thank you so much for saying that christian uh i i'm gonna tell you i got a comment uh a really positive comment on twitter earlier and i always get positive comments in the live chat i just wanna say i really really appreciate it when you all have comments like that i certainly don't mind criticism too uh you know i i always i'm trying to get better so criticism is fine but really positive comments like that help me to keep going you know they when i see stuff like that it's like i think you know what you you are really helping people you got to keep going this stream and it keeps me going i really appreciate it so um so thank you christian and thank you everyone who's given uh me a lot of positive encouragement i really really appreciate it let's see all right so that uh french sounding name that i couldn't pronounce actually means strawberry milk in french so i guess let me know how to pronounce that in french otherwise is it cool if i just call you strawberry milk because that's easier for me to say but i'd be happy to pronounce it properly if i can figure it out carlos says i moved away for a few years from web development i'd like to know how to upgrade myself and learn the current tools um carlos i just say check out it depends on how you like to learn if you're if you like videos there's a ton of stuff on youtube just make sure with videos you're watching are fairly new um check out some stuff on what's called es6 or es 2015 for some of the latest javascript stuff you can go beyond it and even check out es7 eight you know all that stuff but at least ex es6 for some of the newer things that are happening in javascript if you want to check out some of the newer frameworks you know check out react check out vue um this that would be my advice now i'm not exactly sure where you moved away and what you're working on in terms of web development um so i guess that would kind of depend on that but uh i guess it shouldn't be too hard to get back in like i said depending on what you were doing before um i personally kind of think that videos might be the best way to go uh with that just to kind of see what other people are doing uh but there's certainly a ton of blog posts out there that can help you out as well let's see the hopeless spirit says yeah it was a shame at the time none of us knew any better about frames and iframes looking back i shouldn't have just trusted our teachers and gone along with it yeah that's a really tough thing you know like you want to trust your teachers know what they're doing but there's really not a whole lot of incentive especially at the university level for professors to keep up to date right if a professor has tenure you know they really can't get fired unless they do something crazy so you know they have to keep up with all the meetings and paperwork and grading um where's the incentive for them to really stay up to date because you can only really stay up to date on things if you're actually working on projects you know they don't have time to do that so it's it's much easier for them to keep doing what they've been doing right they don't want to have to redo all their lesson plans and stuff every single semester to stay up to date right or even like what's the current best practice at the beginning of a semester might change by the end of the semester you know this field changes way too fast for the current you know way that colleges are set up to keep up so here at this university at franciscan university i'm trying to work with the computer science department to find a solution to that so i have done a guest lecture and we i'm hopefully going to maybe team teach a course so that the computer science professor can handle a lot of the basic the testing grading paperwork and a lot of the basics that don't change of web development and then i can come in and my part will be to get the students up to date on stuff i'm working on and what the latest is in the industry i think something like that where you have a collaboration with someone that's actually in the industry working would be the ideal situation for computer science students at the university level so anyway um i totally understand where you're coming from i actually dropped my web development course in college because of that very issue um i'm gonna have to wrap things up soon my wife's texting me asking me where i am i'm gonna need to go home soon uh so anyway that's kind of a tough thing you learn a lot of good things in a computer science program but you often don't learn a lot of new cutting edge things all right harshit says jesse what happened uh to the electron project you didn't even create the repo i thought i did create the repo where'd it go let's check it out github hmm did i never push that to github let's check out if you have more calm oh i'm sorry you know what i i'm not gonna be able to do it today because i gotta leave uh and go watch the baby but tomorrow i'm gonna do my best to remember to go back in i had thought that i had pushed that repo uh to get him evidently i didn't so um i will definitely do that uh at this week some point thank you for bringing that up harsha really really sorry about that um i just totally thought that i had done it already um let's see um at it says i stopped coding on free code cam months back because of my exams now i don't know where to start from i was a challenge 258 and now i've forgotten half the things uh added i the new curriculum is going to come out soon i think sometime this month so maybe if you want to just wait till that comes out and then start from the beginning again there might be a lot of new stuff uh that's what i would do if i was thinking about starting right now i would wait a week or two to see if the new curriculum was going to come out and then maybe try from there and if you really want to do some things now you know you can go back through and do some of the other problems if you want just to you know stay up on things but that new curriculum should be coming out really soon harsh it says it's 3 30 a.m now i have to sleep immediately otherwise mom will scold me hard waking that late if she's awake harshit yeah for sure go to sleep i do not want you to get in trouble uh with your mom i'll do my best to keep my streams earlier in the day for you all right so i really have to go now or my wife is going to be upset with me so thank you so much everyone this was a great stream really great discussion and questions uh i'm i'm gonna try to do another stream tomorrow a little earlier in the day uh for all of you over uh in in india i know it was really late for you watching i know we have quite a few people from india that watch uh and from that time zone so it'll be earlier tomorrow but until then have a great day
