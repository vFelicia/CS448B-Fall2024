okay so welcome everyone the quantum computers are coming my name is aleister collinson i'm a senior software developer for xenocode technology and blah blah blah you don't really care about any of that do you there's one thing really that you have to know about me i'm a nerd i'm a huge nerd in fact i'm so much of a nerd that my colleagues call me a nerd and they are you know other computer scientists and mathematicians and physicists now personally i'm not a physicist not at all last time i had any formal education in physics is ages ago but i'm here nevertheless to speak about quantum computers and the good news is you don't have to be a physicist anymore to get into quantum computing it's the time now where being a nerd is sufficient and that's really good news because in looking at you here you're probably not going to need quantum computers for your job yet you're sitting here watching a talk on quantum computers chances are you two are nerds okay so what is a quantum computer let's get started with the the basic term and the easier part of that is what is a computer well this is a computer rather older than what you probably use i hope this one could argue is the first computer ever at least the first uh electronic digital programmable computer the twoso z3 and digital or binary is a big point there when we think of binary we normally think of zeros and ones but that's not really true is it we don't have zeros and ones in our computers we have two distinct states and for what we care about it could be a green circle and a red triangle as long as they are distinct that's fine now computers nowadays work with transistors well smaller than those more like this here built into small chips and the way that transistors work is basically that depending on their input they either let a current go through or they don't two distinct states wonderful and this is great for loads and loads of problems i mean the fact that we are where we are with computing technology nowadays is due to the fact that this is such a versatile um a versatile tool but it's not great for everything and i'm going to show an example of something it's not great at as nerds you may be not that familiar with this but nature okay so nature is not binary let's have a look at a close part of that and try to try to determine where we have forest so this part that's clearly forest this part clearly isn't forest but what about that part i mean you clearly have some trees there right but most of it is grass so where do we draw the line when do we call it a forest and that question where do we draw the line we have to draw an arbitrary line we have to decide how much say trees per square kilometer or whatever counts as a forest and when we have to draw such a line when we have to make a decision we are artificially making our world binary binary problems are great for computers nonbinary problems not so much okay so that's the computer part i think we're all up to speed now the quantum part so quantum as you may have guessed is based on quantum mechanics quantum mechanics was first introduced by niels bohr and carl ivana karl heisenberg they worked together in the 1920s came up with quantum mechanics and what they called the the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics named after the city where they worked together now i'm not going to explain all of quantum mechanics partly because as i said i'm not a physicist and partly because even if i were we would need more than the time we have available so i'll give you an example and the example is imagine we have an atom in fact we don't care about the whole atom all we care about is the nucleus here and let's say that our atom is radioactive what does radioactivity mean it means basically that at some point it will decay which means that part of it will radiate away this radioactive particle and alpha particle in this case will leave the nucleus and what remains will be some other element so assuming we have our particle our atom and we wait for a certain time if we look at that particle there are two states we could imagine it being in either it hasn't changed at all or it has decayed right according to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics it can be both at the same time that is it can be both at the same time until we actually measure it now don't be you know confused by those eyes i'm not stating that there's any connection between consciousness and physics looking is one way of measuring it but anything that relies on its being in one state or the other counts so nevertheless this is a really really weird thing to imagine how can something be in two states at the same time and so schrodinger here in 1935 he thought there was this was pretty weird so he came up with a thought experiment showing how absolutely weird the um the interpretation was that heisenberg and boar had come up with in this experiment which you may have heard of he has a cat and this cat is totally fine it's healthy it's not likely to die within the next hour or so of natural causes and he puts this cat into a box the cat however is not the only thing in the box what else do we have well we have a radioactive source of some kind this is very similar to the radioactive atom we had previously there's just more of them and this source has been chosen in a particular way so that if one hour passes the chance that any of it has decayed is 50 50. okay what else do we have well there's also a flask filled with cyanide gas in there cyanide gas of course highly poisonous it's better if the gas stays in that flask but he added a fourth thing he added a construction which consists of a geiger counter that if it measures any radioactivity we'll use that hammer and what will happen there well dead cat so if we again imagine an hour passes what are the states that we could have well i thought the radioactive isotope has not done anything it's not decayed in any way and the case is fine or well the cat's dead two possible states and according to the copenhagen interpretation we could have both of them together we could have them at the same time i mean how can a cat be dead and alive at the same time right schrodinger wasn't thinking of zombie cats as far as i can tell but it's definitely a weird concept and so he came up with an alternative interpretation because he did believe that the maths behind quantum mechanics was correct he just thought that the copenhagen interpretation was nonsense and the interpretation he came up with is called the many worlds interpretation now before i get into what the mini world interpretation means i have a small disclaimer for us for our purposes the many world interpretation is a model it helps us understand certain aspects of the topic it's really good at that if it's chosen well but models have something else often models are wrong in many ways and that's fine as long as they're wrong in ways that we don't care about and the many world's interpretation for our purposes is right in where it counts it may or may not be correct in all of all i don't know i'm not a physicist and i think even physicists are unsure about this it's certainly right in the ways we care about okay with that disclaimer out of the way what does the mini world's interpretation say well it says first of all take everything there is the world the galaxy the universe i couldn't find a picture of the universe but the galaxy here will work and in this universe among other things you have your cat now when this radioactive event happens this quantum event so to speak you don't get your zombie cat situation rather what happens is that you get two universes and basically that carbon copies of each other with one exception and that exception is the result of your quantum event and everything that followed from that so in one universe you have a live cat in one universe you have a dead cat and of course this can happen again if you have another radioactive event quantum event giving you four universes and again giving you eight universes you get the picture now one thing you may notice on this slide is we have rather many dead cats and uh well that's not that pleasant thing is we have this situation because of biology in our universe at least and probably in all other relevant universes if you have a dead cat and add more cyanide you don't get a live cat that's not how biology works or chemistry or anything luckily for us cats and quantum computers are different in that aspect so now we're getting to the actual meat of the matter what we see here is called a blossom and it's a represent a representation of a qubit a quantum bit that's the equivalent of your zeros and ones your bits or your there is a current and there's no current your green circle and your red triangle this is the equivalent in the quantum computing world so what states can we have in there well first of all you can have a zero state which is represented by your vector pointing to the top there you can have a one state which is represented by pointing to the bottom so that's simple enough but you can also have something that looks like this now this isn't zero and it isn't one it's not really between the two either at least not in this visualization it's somewhere on the sphere and mathematically speaking this is actually a combination of the two base values we're using now if that math confuses you because i mean zero's at the bottom at the top one's at the bottom how can some of that be somewhere else ignore the math we don't need it for the rest of the talk it is a combination it makes sense in the mathematical model the blossphere is a threedimensional representation of fourdimensional space it gets mathematical um we don't have to care about it what we have to care about is okay assuming we have this qubit what can we do with it and uh if you want to do something with a qubit you need a quantum gate so let's go through a few quantum gates first one i want to show you is the socalled hadamard gate so the hadamard gate operates on a single qubit and basically it imagines that there's a further axis between the x and the z axis and it then spins our vector around that axis now if you are measuring a qubit if it's at the zero position it will give you zero all of the time binary value if it's a one it will give you one all of the time if it's somewhere in between it will give you zero and one with certain probabilities so if we were to measure measure it's at this point in an ideal quantum computer at least you would get zero and one each with fifty percent uh probability this state where you can have zero or one as a readout is called quantum superposition and we'll need that very soon another gate i'll gonna i'm gonna show you is called the pauli xgate now the xgate is much much simpler to understand than the uh the hadamard gate because basically if you have it at 0 and apply an xgate it just takes the xaxis and spins it around there by 180 degrees giving you the opposite value so this is basically just a not around the xaxis not as easy enough to understand right but it gets more complicated if you go to another gate which incorporates part of what you know from the xgate now so the conditional not or c naught gate is where things get really exciting and basically this operates on two qubits we have the the control qubit at zero here and we have the target qubit and if we apply a c naught with the control qubit at zero well nothing happens everything stays the same if we have a one on the control qubit and apply the c naught it will flip so basically this is the behavior we know from the x gate but what happens if our control q gate is in superposition if it could be measured as 0 or 1 we get something like this so we now have two arrows in that second qubit basically it's a bit like this because if you were to measure either of the gates you would get the value of both gates they are combined they are locked together if you have zero in the first one you'll get zero in the second one because nothing happens if you get one in the first one you'll get one in the second one because everything happened this is the situation we had with our radioactive isotope and our cat earlier this is quantum entanglement and quantum entanglement combined with quantum superposition is what makes quantum computers and quantum mechanics in general tick now we don't actually have this until we measure before we measure we basically just have both in superposition and as long as they're in superposition we can do some really funky stuff with these qubits now i've shown you a few quantum gates namely the hadamard and the c naught gate i've shown you one of the three pauli gates there are y and z power gates as well they just spin around their axes by 180 degrees those axis just being y or zed there's also stuff like the identity gate which is the most boring gate ever because it just does nothing um there are phase gates which are pretty exciting you can do some uh pretty neat stuff with those i'm not going to get into the phase gates today but you can read up on them if you like i'll have some material and some links for you later and there are many many other types of gates you can imagine so okay we now know roughly how it works but why do we need this what are the use cases and there are quite a few use cases actually um for example the big one that if you've heard anything about quantum computing you've heard about this it can break encryption and it can break encryption because at least in theory it can break it because it's really good at prime factorization quantum computers can factorize numbers much more efficiently in theory at least than your regular binary computers can do it if you want to know more about that check out shaw's algorithm something you may not have heard of various companies including google and volkswagen are using quantum computers now to assist them in engineering tasks you could simulate molecules and atoms on quantum computers you actually have a quantum state there so you can easily work with quantum properties and this can be really useful in research in physics and chemistry and medicine of course so this could be really really exciting um other than that how about ai or machine learning there are quite a few attempts to use quantum computers in those areas and i think it's pretty safe to say that those will be some of the first fields that will we as developers will really meet quantum computers at least in the wild then you can use it for weather prediction you can use quantum computers for pretty much any field that is nowadays added by heuristics because heuristics are just a shortcut because you are unable to calculate everything but quantum computers will allow you to calculate well not everything but much much more than you can nowadays financial fraud is another use case that some people are looking into again a field where heuristics is large nasa is using quantum computers early quantum computers admittedly in their engineering tasks so that's similar to the volkswagen case and just to jump on the bandwagon quantum computers could break bitcoin so if you have bitcoins you'll probably save for a couple of years until we have quantum computers that are powerful enough but don't wait too long to sell them okay so these are interesting use cases i guess but there's much more that could be done now most people who nowadays are into quantum computers are scientists physicists as i said engineers etc and they come up with solutions to the problems they know we are the ones who will have to program them eventually so we need people who are in the programming field who are in the software development field to have a look at quantum computers try them out work with them see what they can do we will come up with other use cases use cases that so far nobody has thought of and this is basically why i'm doing this talk today because we have to get into quantum computing and we can so um that's why we as a community should get into it why should you personally get into it well there's this wonderful quote from venkat basically if you want to learn something new learn something that's totally different from anything you know because it will help you think differently it's a wonderful quote and believe me quantum computer programming is different from what you know so i'm going to show you two examples today of how you can actually today start programming for quantum computers the first one i'm going to show you is the ibm quantum experience so ibm has built real quantum computers early prototypes but they are real nevertheless and they're basically offering them as a kind of quantum computer in the cloud service how does that work well first of all the computers they built look something like this and for the moments yes i hope they'll shrink considerably um actually this part here most of that is a freezer well a cryostat but basically a huge freezer the chip itself looks something like this this is a seven qubit chip those are the qubits here and it has to be cooled down to well basically as cold as it can get because they are based on superconductivity and superconductivity well it works best if you have really really cold states now you can use this quantum computer well not that specific one but uh ones that they're providing via their website this is uh the entry sites to the quantum experience they have great learning materials there by the way so um if you're interested in this later you can check it out it's great once you log in the place you'll spend most of your time probably is this this is called the quantum composer and up here we have information about the quantum computers that you can use they currently offer for free by the way two different five qubit computers that anyone can use they also have in their quantum experience in theory a 20 qubit quantum computer that's only open to their partners and it gives you some information about those computers now i think it's difficult to read but uh the top um quantum computer it's cool down to 0.012 kelvins that's colder than in out of space that's why they have this huge cryostat that huge freezer and as you'll see very soon that's still not really enough so the main parts however is this part the composer interface and it's named so because it looks like you know a musical score and you do call the programs often quantum scores also you have here your q gates now you'll recognize some of them there's the h for hadamard there's the the plus symbol that's the c naught um you see the green x that's the x gate and there are some other ones as well so let's say we want to implement an algorithm in this and we'll go with something we already know schrodinger's cat very simple algorithm to implement not much log logic in it but it's a start so what do we need apart from the cat well we need our radioactive matter we need our modified geiger counter we need our cyanide and all of those have to be linked in some way they have to be entangled and if we lay that out in our quantum uh composer it will look something like this so the radioactive meta we already learned that is in quantum superposition so we can achieve that through the hadamard gate we then link all of the other items so the uh the geiger counter and the cyanide and the cat through cnot gates because basically if um if the hadamard reads out as one that means that the radioactive matter has decayed and in that case all the other qubits should also flip they all start out as zero and if the first one flips everything should turn to one and looking into the box is basically this pink symbol here the measurement gate in fact let's measure all of the gates we're modifying here and see what we get now you can run this as i said on a real quantum computer it's sent to their quantum computer there's a scheduling system etc and after a while you get back your result and your results well part of the result will look like this so what does this mean um at the bottom we have the various measurement values ignore the first value because that's the qubit we didn't measure and what we see is here this is the case where everything's zero nothing happened so that's a big peak back here we have the case where everything happened everything's a one cat's dead and each of those two results come to about 30 i think i've ran this test a thousand times and you get 30 each which leaves 40 percent of these results so what are those well those are measurement errors see this is still an early prototype and it makes mistakes and quantum error correction is actually a huge research field right now things are getting better but you do have to keep in mind that you can't believe all of the results at the moment that you're getting there is some randomness in there basically due to the fact among other things at least that it's not at absolute zero it is those you know 21 milli kelvins above zero which isn't much but it's still a bit too warm so that's the quantum experience the other tool i would like to show you today is the microsoft quantum development kit now this the the ibm quantum experience is basically a drag and drop editor you can write regular code as well they have a programming language and it translates back and forth between the graphical interface and that language in most cases at least for learning purposes you will probably use the graphical interface the quantum development kit by microsoft comes with a language called q sharp this looks much more like the code we're used to and as i said it's from microsoft so initially it was only available for windows and i thought during the preparations for this presentation i'd have to tell you well if you have anything but windows tough luck but about a month ago they said hey it's now available for linux and mac os as well so everyone can download it everyone can start playing around with it yes okay so you can do it let's have a look at what it looks like if you actually do do it so the language q sharp is heavily inspired by other.net languages as you would assume and it does actually run inside a.net environment here we have a very simple program most of it's blurred out at the moment it's not something about your eyes it really should look like that and we'll go through the program step by step so what do we have first of all here we're applying a hadamard gate to our isotope h isotope and then we apply the c naught to the isotope and the geiger counter and another c naught to the geiger counter and the cyanide another c naught to the cyanide and the cat you know this and it's just written down as code it's the same algorithm as we did before what else do we have because there's obviously more code well first of all we define a mutable value what we would call a variable in most languages most things in q sharp are immutable by default we want this to be mutable and this variable is supposed to represent the state of the cat is it alive or is it dead this is a simple one it's not a qubit value this is a binary value here we check in the box whether the cat is alive or dead m is the measurement value this is the pink thing you saw in the quantum experience same concept and then at the end we return you know is the cat alive or is it dead okay simple enough what else do we have we have boilerplate basically so here we say this algorithm needs four qubits we have to state explicitly how many we need they will be provided by the language then we give them proper names normally you have an array of qubits and that's fine initially but you can't throw best practices out of the window just because we have a new languages language here we do have to give the the qubits names so we can understand what we're doing then we initialize them all to zero the quantum experience did this for us everything was initially set to zero q sharp does not do this fast we have to do it manually and at the end we're setting them back to zero now the reason we have to set them to zero initially and at the end is basically decay quantum decay means that a qubit will always strive to some kind of equilibrium state we want to make sure it's not in equilibrium but rather it's in a defined states that we can work with and you could leave out language wise the initializing to zero then would you would just get random results q sharp forces you actually to set them back to zero when you're finished and that's basically all of the q sharp code now this runs in the net environment which means we can access it from other.net languages and so here we have a few lines of c sharp code which basically say well here create a quantum simulator to run my algorithm in run the algorithm in that quantum simulator and then tell me what the result is and you can run this code on your computer it runs it just this once in this case and it'll either tell you the cat's alive or the cat is dead and that's it this will run on your computer so we have a quantum simulator here and that may beg the question then why don't we just simulate it why do we need a real quantum computer it obviously works so why don't we just simulate everything and don't have those measurement errors you don't have the hassle it's a huge financial investment that companies like ibm for example and many universities are taking on why do they care and i'd like to go back to a previous slide to answer that question remember this slide now in theory the slide is designed in such a way that when i press my button here it will have a smooth transition from the dead cats to gravestones i clicked yeah that wasn't smooth my computer is having difficulties with powerpoint and what stress would a quantum computer put on a binary computer well ibm actually looked into this issue and they published a paper last year they had two quantum computers that they simulated one of them was a 49 cubit computer and they needed four and a half terabytes of ram one of them was a 56 cubic computer and that needed three terabytes of ram note that this wasn't the same algorithm and maybe the algorithm they used for the latter was more optimized it's still much more than we have on our development machines there are computers with that kind of memory available of course but you don't have them sitting at home i would assume if you do let me know i might come by um so this was a huge success and you'll see why it was a huge success with this line here previously those kind of simulations would have needed eight petabytes of ram for the 49 qubits machine and an extra byte of ram for the 56 qubit machine let me repeat that one exabytes of ram can you imagine how much an extra byte is probably not so let me break this down for you one exabyte is a thousand petabytes which is a million gigabytes a terabyte sorry which depending on whether you speak british or american english is a milliard or a billion gigabytes that's 10 to the 18 bytes of ram so intensity 18 bytes that's hard to imagine our universe according to current estimates is 13.7 times 10 to the nine years old that translates to 4.32 times 10 to the 17 seconds that's less than half the amount of bytes we have in an exabyte so the improvement that ibm made there by getting it down to the terabyte range is astonishing but as the number of qubits grows that you have to emulate or simulate and as the algorithms grow that you want to simulate on those simulations of quantum computers things will get well even more unrealistic than they are right now so at least for the time being we are stuck with actual physical quantum computers now this here is a 50 qubit quantum computer that's ibm built and until recently i thought this would be the largest machine i'd be able to show you about two weeks ago google came along and said hey we have this thing here we call it bristlecone and it has 72 qubits and apparently very low error rates now when they announced it the testing wasn't fully completed so we can't be absolutely sure what the error rates look like but it's promising note the uh the 50 qubit machine i showed you i think that was from earlier this year this is from two weeks ago things are moving really rapidly um and ibm and google aren't the only companies in the game here for example intel is also working on quantum computers um at the beginning of the the year they introduced a 49 cubits quantum computer after some previous iterations the largest one in the picture is the 49 qubit one and um alibaba the chinese internet giant announced in early march that they were offering a quantum computer in the cloud similar to what ibm is offering now as i said earlier ibm to certain partners offers a 20 qubit computer this here offered by alibaba is an 11 qubit computer which is the second largest one available at least it's available to some people i registered with alibaba looked for anything and i could only find this announcement so apparently it is available in theory but only two well probably members of the university with which they are doing this or the research institution i should say um but things are gonna happen quantum computers will become more and more available in the next months and especially years and so this is uh the breaking point this is the point where people like us have to get started and can get started with quantum computing so if you want to get started what can you do well as i said earlier there's the quantum experience you can register there it's all free um and they have great learning material here's the url i will make the slides available online so you don't have to remember that qrl right now great uh great tool for learning there is as i said the ib the microsoft quantum development kit available for yeah sure sure um i'll still speak about the next slide there's the microsoft quantum development kit available for windows mac and linux this also is absolutely free of charge and available under this url if you want to take pictures now would be the time and also about one and a half weeks ago stack exchange who run this tiny site called stack overflow you may heard of um they opened a private beta for a quantum computing site now it's a private beta so you can only join by invitation if you want to join let me know i can i can get an invitation to you and that's uh well the site is at this address of course my invitations aren't um but just let me know and well apart from that i would say it's time to explore try these tools play around with them read the tutorials there's much much more than i got to cover today in the information material provided by for example ibm and microsoft and of course other sources um play around with it and hopefully we'll get some really cool results and now ask your questions that adds two numbers that's a good question um if you want to add two numbers well in theory a very simple adder would be just a c naught if you have zero and zero you get zero if you have zero and one you have one if you have one and zero you have one if you have one and one you get zero because of overflow um but you always have the problem of measurement error here you probably don't want to build something like an adder in a quantum computer um the profile of quantum computing applications for one as i said earlier is anything that's nowadays or many things at least that nowadays you would improve with heuristics um so you'll probably be able to improve those with quantum computers um among these things are well uh prime factor prime factoring of course you can you can do that nowadays you would basically have to try all possible combinations and you can improve that with heuristics but it's it's difficult another issue that can be solved with quantum computers is unstructured search there's an algorithm called grover's algorithm where basically if you have a data set and you know nothing about how it may or may not be sorted with any regular binary computer would you would have to look at each separate entry and check is that the one i'm looking for is that the one i'm looking for is that the one i'm looking for if you have n entries you'd need potentially n tries it's certainly an o of n grover's algorithm can do it in o of square root of n basically by using this uh this state of superposition and looking at several values at the same time so anything that goes into the area of breadth search is a potential candidate as well and there are probably many many other problems you can look at that so simply nobody has really looked into yet i'm pretty convinced that it's possible to write a proper sorting algorithm with a quantum computer i haven't seen anyone do it yet and i haven't been able to come up with one myself but i do think it's possible we just have to find the proper algorithm okay will not be represented okay so basically the question is can quantum computers help with floating points uh decimal representation infinite floating points the answer is i don't know um maybe there's a way i haven't seen anything about that so far in theory i would say it is possible because you could choose some kind of representation within the block sphere um where each points on the sphere is a possible value and that in theory at least would be infinitely many values measuring those is a bit more difficult because you get either zero or one so i can't think of a way to represent uh infinitely long binary number uh floating point numbers off the top of my head but that doesn't mean that there isn't a way to do it okay so basically how do you represent numbers at all in a quantum computer um basically the same way at least you can do it the same way you do with a binary computer because um when you measure your values they will be zero or one you don't get a value on the sphere um you get zero or ones with certain probabilities there may be better ways of representing numbers in quantum computers again i don't know um it's something you can certainly look into there probably is a better way to do it but we're in the early stages where that kind of question is still something that as far as i'm aware hasn't been fully answered so you can go with a basic representation where zeros and ones uh give you your results just like with a binary representation on a binary computer and anything from there onwards is up to research yeah okay so how do cubits work on a technical level um i'm no expert in this field basically i can tell you that there are at least i don't know four or five different ways in which people have started building qubits the super conductor method that is used by ibm and google and quite a few other hardware manufacturers is currently the most successful method how exactly that works i'd have to check myself there are some other ways that don't necessarily require super cooling and those could be very promising in the long run because basically if you want to have a quantum computer with you if you want to have it in your laptop in your car in your phone you don't want to have you know a huge cryostat that you have to carry with you you don't want to have to call it to as close to absolute zero as you can get um currently to my understanding at least those technologies aren't as uh as advanced as the superconducting methods and so we'll have to see where those go does that answer your question great any other questions yeah sure sure with microsoft yes with ibm you can run it on a simulator um basically you have two options when you have your code in the quantum experience you can choose the simulate button and then it will run automatic uh not automatically it will run immediately on a simulator and you'll get back your result in no time you can say run it on the real quantum computer and they have a scheduling system um i'm not going to get into it it's easily explained and then they do send your code to the actual quantum computer they have in their facilities will run your code there and after a while you get back your result and this is actual quantum quantum computing happening that's what we saw when i showed you the results where we had all those errors if you run it on the simulator you get much nicer results which is great for testing but of course if you want a realistic image you should run it on the real device okay anyone else yeah can a quantum computer generate truly random numbers my guess is yes it can i'm no expert in randomness i must admit so you would have to ask someone who's more familiar with what constitutes two randomness but to my understanding yes it can okay anything else that case thank you for listening and no cats were harmed in the making of this presentation
