hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse and we have so much changed since the last stream and sorry I had to cancel at the last minute on Friday stream because well basically I had a couple things come up all at once about a half hour before I was supposed to start streaming at work so yeah so I decided to get it done and up staying late on Friday trying to get things done so anyway so that doesn't happen often that may be the first time I actually had to cancel a stream because something came up with with work so anyway it probably won't happen again anytime soon but again sorry for that but the first thing we're going to do is just try to go as quickly as we can go over all the changes and maybe try to explain a little bit about why if you check out some of the issues on the github repo which the link to the repo is now in the description for this video so you can check that out there's some discussion about why we're doing what we're doing now and but we'll talk about that a bit before we start coding as well and also I'm not sure if Brian Sizemore is watching right now but he is my coworker that's in the next office write down for me and I just want to congratulate him on becoming a fullstack developer which is awesome so he's actually been doing a lot of frontend and backend work mostly PHP on the backend he's been doing it for quite some time but his title did not reflect that his title you never know he was a web developer at all from his title so now he finally got that change to really reflect all the work he's been doing so I'm really happy for him and it's also cool I can't wait til the next time I have to do something on the back end and I could just say all Brian could you do this I'm the frontend guy right and pass it off to him but anyway he's a super nice guy he does drop in occasionally on the live chat and yeah it's just super super happy for him and I just got a message from my wife sorry about that I normally don't even check my phone during the stream but it just caught my eye all right all right cool cool let me check the the check just quickly to say hello to everybody everybody oh cool harsh it says November for teeth in India is Children's Day so actually it's probably the 14th are ready in India what time is it if it's not already the 14th it's pretty close because the time difference so anyway a happy children today I'm not really familiar with children today but so I'm not sure if happy Children's Day is the correct salutation on this day but anyway I guess have a good time doing whatever whatever this you do on Children's Day and cool Bogdan says hi Jesse watch your streams from the Ukraine and learn English and web at the same time thank you for great experience that's awesome that's really cool that's great yeah and if you're ever watching you don't understand some phrase or something that I'm using just ask me in the live set I'd be happy to explain it occasion I might use some type of like slang term that may or may not be understandable even maybe to English speakers outside the United States so I really try not to do that but in case I do please let me know because I I want you all going to understand what what I'm talking about see okay so it's 12 12 a.m. in India so it is in fact November 14th which for me is tomorrow it's still the 13th here okay awesome all right let's go last thing a hardship mentioned in a live chat that I get help right from the creators so Kyle yeah so Kyle who has created Gatsby which we had had worked with in the last stream actually did comment on some of the things some of the issues in github which is really awesome it's really cool when the creators you know notice things and it really has nothing to do with me it's just that you know Quincy let me do this on free code camps channel and I think free code camp is wellknown and so I benefit from that and occasionally someone who's a creator of something we're using we'll get in touch with me so the creator of the end Rock which we're going to use today got in touch with me before and really awesomely decided to let us use end rock for free and have as many connections as we need for the stream and creator of WP graph QL and then now the creative gatsby so anyway anyway it's really cool I probably would have never gotten to talk to any of these people if it wasn't for this so anyway it's cool there are some benefits I guess to to live streaming all the time okay all right well let's get started on explanation I do I won't be able to go too long that's why I did the stream a bit early today because I do have my normal Monday 300 o'clock meeting so let's see so probably in about an hour we're gonna end the stream all right so let me I'm gonna remember to switch my screen now so I know last time I forgot so now now you all can see what I'm saying so the first thing I want to do is paste in the end rock link so you all can check this out at the same time and so you'll be able to see this site in your browser with this link you can inspect it with dev tools and it's going to be a lot nicer experience so I can see you got a bunch of connections open so awesome okay so here's what's happened so far as you can see visually we got a lot done and really I did very very little basically just merging things is all I did I maybe really just minor things Harshit did most of the work over so basically since Thursday stream until now Harshit did a ton of stuff and we also had a bunch of discussions so somebody Christian was involved in a discussion and Kyle from Gatsby was involved so we had a lot of people involved in the discussion and it was really really awesome but here's the decision that we've come to at least for now okay so I think we're gonna go with next Jas I'm gonna keep a branch open for Gatsby that's gonna have our original set up with Gatsby and potentially we can go back to it but here's here's what happened so Christian had brought up and thankfully he was persistent in bringing this up that there may be an issue when we have content changing from our content management system which may end up being wordpress or potentially something else but regardless of what it is content is going to change and with gatsby his concern was we'd have to rebuild we have to rebuild our site actually would be sites because we're running mold we're going to be running multiple instances of our site so his thought was do we really want to rebuild every time and I that's understandable right it's going to be pretty big there's gonna be thousands of pages do we want to rebuild all that so we're gonna try next because it's gonna operate a little differently okay so Gatsby is a static site generator so everything gets built and then put on the server well not even a server you know you you don't even have to use a traditional server if you're just serving the static site but anyway I think next is next is going to be the better fit for us at least from from the discussion that we had and we've used next before if you go back to project one which was the catechetical Institute website we've used next there with the WordPress content management system using the WordPress API and it works it's very fast it we get serverside rendering it's great for search engine optimization it really works we were able to set up things like live search you know pretty much on our own without having to use any you know thirdparty you know outside search providers so I think we're gonna go with that and you know if it comes down to we need to switch later on that's that's fine which is still really early on in the project this is only the third stream so I know we've already kind of switched or are kind of free I don't know if you've got a frameworks or anything but anyway that's what's happened and if you want to know more about that you can of course check out all the pull requests all the commits and all the discussion about that on the github repository the link is in the description and let me show you the site now and then we started coding so here's what we have we got our sidebar right we have our app bar at the top I'm sorry our drawer we're calling this our drawer that's what it says in material UI ok we got this big hero section with the image this isn't the image we ultimately go with this is just a stock image we have our main call to action here and then just some cards just it's kind of a demo right what's gonna happen is we're not gonna have this login button we're gonna have some links at the top we're gonna have our social media icons and we'll have a search icon here we'll have a spare check on here with a search field and then we'll have all our menu items here probably there'll be expandable menu items so we'll just have the menu headers and they can expand out so if you if you remember our design we were gonna just redesign the main website but use the same content management system and we had started that process before if you remember we are editing those csharp you know templates we're gonna use that same design and bring it over and that's really gonna help it's gonna save us time on the design my boss already really liked the designs so I think that's it's gonna look nice so today what we're gonna do is we're gonna try to make this app bar look just like we have in our other designs so let me bring that up so we can compare so you can check this out as well Franciscan dot edu slash home test all one word home test so if you'd like to check this out and inspect it you can see this is what it's going to look like I'll zoom in a bit for you all so we have a donate button here all of these social media icons which these are all inline SVG's right now this doesn't work on home tests but what's going to happen is when you click this it's going to expand just like we have done for the for the bulletin that we're working on which is project four so we're going to be able to reuse that code from project four which is awesome and these links if you see what happens when I click one oops let's refresh it see if I can get it to work no I don't know what broke on this but basically what happens when you click this is that this sidebar sidebar is not working either hmm oh well I must have broken something on there inadvertently then but in any case what will happen when we click on this the drawer will open and then that section will expand to show all the sub links so will will be able to keep our interface very clean right off the bat and then kind of hide away of all the links that we'll need in the drawer right now the main website as it currently is is very busy there's a lot of links there's a dropdown on hover with even more links it's so there's a lot going on so we definitely like to simplify that significantly so we're gonna make better use of white space so if you see you know right here with you know I'm not 100% sure about this layout these are just kind of examples we're just messing around with things this footer is actually going to be pretty close to what we'll go with as well so we can use this as a as an example okay all right so I'm gonna take this and maybe move it down here so I can have that visual what its gonna look like we'll move this up into this corner and let's get started I'm gonna start our Pomodoro timer and this was built by Harshit who's in the live chat now so if you are in need of a Pomodoro timer check this out pom pom da da SH such P om p om dot now dot Sh really cool and everything's available on github as well if you want to check out how he did that all right so let's start it up 25 minutes of code take a fiveminute break I'll go to the live chat I'll answer questions and then we'll try to get another 25 minutes of code in it's going to be tight today since I have that meeting coming up soon but I really will try to get all the questions answered in the live chat if at all possible all right so the first thing we need to do is we can basically convert this login button to our donate button change the Styles a bit and then we need to be able to put you know two rows in here so we will need to make this a bit taller because I think we'll need a bit more space and then we need to put these in so the first thing that I'd like to do is go to the material UI documentation look at the app bar and see if they have anything builtin that comes close to any of this if they do we'll try to use that if not we'll just do our own modifications so we are using material UI and we're using the the beta version and let's check out our components at bar okay so if you're not familiar with material you I it is a react component library that is based on Google's material design standards so we use material design here at the University is part of our official web styles so this helps us to save lots of time by building things you know with this premade these premade components and it looks like I'm not seeing anything that that looks like what we need so we're gonna have to do a lot of a lot of custom work which is fine yep then I'm not really seeing anything okay that's fine with me I really don't mind I don't mind change modifying things I think it's kind of fun okay so let's go in here and find our app bar component and we'll just check out the code see what's going on and then test a few things out I'll just check the live chat Harshit says we might want to use the grid there that's a good idea so we have our app bar here and I'll make this a bit bigger it's gonna make sure everybody can see and okay so all right here's our login button so I guess right off the bat let's make this donate and let's check our button styles I shouldn't have closed material UI so just leave it open all the time let's check out our button styles and see if we have we already have a style that will work button Syrio so let's try a primary button let's see button raise primary okay let's try this colors honey we need to import primary no okay yep that works all right let's see what happened all right great wonderful that was those uh that may have worked out better than anything else I've ever done on a live stream awesome okay such a subtle effect now you can see that that shadow is just so subtle which is fine you have the color change anyway and I just wonder I'll have to doublecheck the material design documentation because I'm pretty sure materialized CSS which is another material design framework has a more of a change in the shadow on hover I won't worry about that detail right now but this is just something for me to think about okay great so we have our button here and let's check out just try to add in some other things here and just see where they see where they go just kind of naturally let's see how they line up here perhaps we could have some of them line up in the right spot maybe not those worth the try all right so let's go with before I worry about anything else let's just put something in here so let's do let's do a div and inside the div I'm gonna use a span and let's just put tests and I'm gonna put a few more just to see where they may end up hmm nowhere maybe the there we go I was gonna say they're probably whites font okay well good thing is they're lining up to the right side which is where we need them actually that that's not bad on that line there that's a good spot for our social media icons so maybe let's add those in yeah let's add our icons in and then we'll worry about putting our menu items below that but since since this is already kind of lining up in the place we want it we'll only need to make a few adjustments to get that in the right spot so what I'd like to do then is just grab the code for all of this and paste that in so let me find that I believe I have that on github so let me check see Frances at the u.s. homepage so if you want to check this out some of this code out from the design this is not react this is going to be just plain JavaScript but it's fus homepage so it's in that same github organization FUS Markham and this is fus homepage and if we go into app we should be able to see this in index dot HTML and here we go here's our our social icons I'm just gonna copy this whole thing just copy that paste it in there probably gonna be really big and what do we need to do let's change these classes to class name whoops now I know there's going to be it's just added a ton of markup into our components so there are going to be better ways to do this we can always refactor later but for now we just kind of need to prove we can get this to work there we go last name and let me make sure I grab also this and we'll need to put we need to make sure that this is and this we need to do this right is that how we do that I can't remember how we do how we do comments and reacts right we can't just do that we need let me do it like this don't Lee whoops there we go okay so if you've never done a comment in react within your your render so so our return for our our render function you can't just do normal HTML comment tags right because remember this isn't really HTML right this is JSX this is all JavaScript it just kind of looks like HTML so what we need to do is do our curly brackets here which lets us write JavaScript inside of here and then we use our JavaScript multiline comment tags see and now all this is commented out as far as I know that's the only way to do comments like this in react so I do want to add this in I did not create these SVG's andreas Larsen dead you can check him out on code pen really useful you can see all these SVG's are just super short saves us from having unnecessary Network requests put them right in line they load extremely fast really cool we can change the color the size on them since they're vector graphics we can scale them up as large as we want they'll never be pixelated so really really like using these so let's check them out I probably they're all white so let's change that now let's see I think we can add some styles in here hmm want to do this and I will would actually rather use regular CSS but I don't know if you have a file setup no we don't do it okay I'll do it like this how about this since we're just trying to see them let's get our dev tools open let me pull this over here and make it a lot bigger okay it's probably still not gonna be quite as big as we need it for you all to see but all right here's our button so we should have there we go should have these here and are we getting we're not really getting much of anything in here oh okay they're all going down interesting alright let's see what the problem is actually you know it would be a great idea when we put that why don't we see what styles we used on here that would that would be the smart thing to do let's check out our Styles here all right so we're looking for social and check our file SAS file okay so let's just grab this for now and see okay so we were giving them absolute positioning which actually could work okay all right so for now let's just give our SVG's a width and a color and see if we can see them on the page this was our CG greats all right I think we have 30 pixels as our with great and they're black right now so let's give them a color so that's our green color let's see if that works no they're still black so I'm just gonna put a an important in here right now just so we could see what the green would be like whoa still nothing we'll probably need to do is have that apply to the path then did we have that oh you're right you know what it's Phil green not color that was my fault so with the SVG it needs to be fill there we go awesome alright so we have all our icons wonderful let's see how this works okay so our hmm our actual links are a little bit off so we'll have to work on that but for now that looks pretty good not bad alright so let's do this then hmm I don't think we really need these class names because I'm not doing anything special with these icons right now the only reason I could think that we would want individual names like this at any time would be you know potentially for some tracking but I don't have anything planned right now so what we'll probably want to do then and I don't know if we'll do this now or not depends on how much time we have so I'd like to get the other links in the header what we'll do is just iterate through an object that has these SVG's yeah I'd rather not have all this in the component so we need to have yeah we need to have some way to change this potentially we could just take these and make it another component our social icons component and then at least that would get rid of this at that point I honestly wouldn't even care if we just left it as is it wouldn't be the cleanest looking thing but if this was all there was in that component I'd be ok with that so for now I'm just gonna leave it like this we can move on and get the layout looking how we want all right and let's see for now let's just do let's do our class name as social and then we will yeah we really don't have a CSS file huh hmm okay let's make sure we have our SVG's yeah okay let's add it in here ICG stuff with 30 pixels fill whoops I was supposed to be a comma Phil besides two one four one two a whoops which I probably could have brought yeah I could have brought this color in like this let's do that that's the better way to do it okay all right so let's do that and then let's take all of our instances of SVG and then let's add oops how are we adding this that wasn't close was it yeah it is okay class name classes dot let me just call this SVG style okay I'm gonna save that see if it works just make sure okay great that works wonderful I mean shake my timer okay but just under four minutes and then I'll go to the Live Chat check everything out answer some questions okay see what we need now all right so let's throw in some of these links and then afterwards we'll try to put this in this is also an SVG so let's just grab what we have again from from this demo we'll grab the code and you know at some point these aren't going to be hardcoded in and we're also going to have URLs for all of these which are all not going to be hardcoded in either we'll want these to be changeable and actually I'm not sure about that the odds of the URLs for our social media changing and really small so maybe it's not worth it but these links you know potentially we will want to change these at some point all right so let's get let's go back to our index.html and we'll scroll down so here's all of our icons will go below that and here's our lengths okay so it's just an unordered list but when here we go we have our search input included in there so I think this will show up we may have to put some Styles in here as well but we may end up with white font color at first so probably won't see it but once we change the font color it should be alright so let's put let's put this after our button yeah let me see where this toolbar component goes from okay yeah we'll put it right after the button whoa something's not right Oh what's going on so we have something not closed ICG div there we go inputs not close so remember when you're working with react everything has to be closed so even a thing like an input where if you're doing normal HTML you don't have to include this slash to close it you you do have to include it in react thankfully you know we have our syntax highlighting and it was immediately apparent what we needed so it saved some time and we're gonna have to change all these classes to class name so you said it I think it is class name and if we have let's check our inputs ID class name time all right okay I think we're good wonderful all right so I'm gonna save that the timer just went up style okay it looks like we have some inline Styles wool on our next Pomodoro session we'll address that but for now we'll do a fiveminute break let me scroll all the way up to the top of the live chat so I don't miss questions got to keep an eye on the time so I don't miss my meeting and I'm gonna take a drink I'm back on the the the G fuel so it's like an energy drink I haven't had G fuel for like a month I've been doing like espresso and coffee but this has a lot of vitamins in it so I figure it's probably healthier for me so anyway not than any of you really cared what I was drinking I'm sure just says thanks I'm from Mexico awesome thanks for watching I've actually I've never been to Mexico so I'm from the United States and I'd like to go down there I had somebody who who I know know some people who are gonna open up like a tech school somewhere in Mexico and he was going to try to talk to him and see if they'd be interested in me coming down and giving a talk to some of the students which i think would be really cool so I don't know what's going on with that I haven't heard anything about it for a while but that would be it would be cool I'd like to go paul says hi Jessi your stream with Gatsby Jess let me down the rabbit hole and caused me to rewrite my entire application nice we're just going to say thanks you're welcome I'm glad you're thanking me for for having you write my entire application you could have been annoyed with me I guess so that's cool if you're still watching and if it's possible I'd love to see what you're doing so if it's on github please share share that link with me you don't have to do it in a live chat if you don't want to you can DM me on Twitter but it'd be really cool to to check out what you're doing and if you need any help open an issue and maybe if I have some time I can submit a pull request for you kiss your it as says can someone say what is going on I'm new to Jesse's videos looks like got some answers to that yeah creating erect harsh and says creating a react next J s site for the university yeah that's that's basically the answer if you want to know more about it check out the first video in this series so it'll be project 5 day 1 of the video title is I think planning a react project so check that out and I go through a much longer explanation of what's going on Oh Harshit says next four is faster now much faster since next to which is what we use in the catechetical Institute site awesome I'm really excited to see it yeah I mean I I figured that next that had updated a lot because I know from the first time I use next when it was pretty young until that catechetical Institute site a lot had changed so I figured that it had changed even more I'm really impressed with how quickly next updates and adds new features so we got a lot of people working on that staying on top of things see all right Gino says Ola Ola Gina I my Spanish is not that great she let's see I think my time is up just her to go off and see all right Gina says kaykay framework s its react and we use next js2 kind of scaffold it out so those kids alright Gina says alright Sugino speaking in Spanish so if anybody knows Spanish and can help letting me know which you know saying I'd appreciate it so far I can pretty much understand me saying but I haven't really worked for Spanish that much since I was in college so it looks like Gina wants to learn JavaScript great let's see we are definitely using javascript also says Java web development mobile development totally cool yet we we're definitely doing JavaScript no job Java but we are going to do some maybe some react native which is mobile development gino also wants to learn how to program and Gina hopefully you you're understanding what I'm saying in English I went so Gina wants to make a Facebook trying to make a Facebook clone is pretty challenging but you know stick with it no doubt you'll be able to do it it looks like hushhush it's as speaking with Gino in Spanish in the live chat so that's great so anyway yeah let me know do you know if if you can understand what I'm saying enough I assume you can my Spanish is is not good enough for me to actually teach in Spanish unfortunately okay let's get back to this and check the time a little okay I'm gonna try to another Pomodoro session but I went a little bit long on that last break so we'll see if I can get it in or not I do need to do some prep work before my meeting so let's just see if we can get a little bit more done and then we'll go to the questions sorry I clicked away from my my dashboard for the livestream and now I'm trying to find it okay I got it back okay okay so we had problems with our Styles all right so let's check this out so we just copied in everything in this ul it looks like we have some inline Styles that aren't working because inline Styles don't work like they do in plain HTML when you're doing things with reacts so let's find it UO closed then style whoa we just had an empty style tag that's weird all right let's see if that was it whoa okay cool that was definitely it but we've got ha ha we've got a bit of a mess going on here right we didn't bring over any of our Styles for this so let's see let's go back to our CSS see what we have going on or I'm sorry our sass we have a class name search icon okay let's try to find search icon there we go okay so we're floating this left SVG pointer all right let's bring over you know what I'm gonna move this over to my other screen quickly so I can copy this over faster so we need on let's see we have another SVG as well right we do but it looks like we have some inline stuff going on that should be fine for now okay so on this SVG let's take this class name out this is a different one huh I think this would be all right okay so let's take this class thing out let's add classes and this will be search SVG yeah that works and now let's put this in up here SVG and we need to add in cursorpointer whoops this needs to be a string great and we're gonna give it a width of 27 pixels and fill so with an SVG weak we use fill for our color and we're gonna give it the same color that we had here and notice that I'm not writing regular CSS Co this is actually a JavaScript object so a little bit different but you can see the the property you know this kind of operates this operates just like a class name would alright and these are the properties and the values so the only difference with the properties where we use camel case and let's just put in padding let's see I don't want to mess with the padding yet because we may have some differences so I'm just gonna leave it as is for now and see what it looks like all right so let's check that out first okay great so that's a more reasonable size and color awesome actually we may want to yeah we were gonna pull some code for this input right I've forgotten about that so I'm not going to do anything else with this input or the search or anything because we're gonna replace that with a code that we used on our last project but I do want to change this a bit so let's figure out where we're getting this this list from hmm let me just search what I meant where we're getting the styles for this list from so I okay so what are we calling this it's hoping to have links okay let's check out my other screen I'm gonna check out the styles for top and I have links whoa I'm not finding any styles huh so we did have we had that on there from this class what else do we have see what he said eyes display this an interesting Oh looking at the wrong one here here we go alright let's put some of these on here didn't really make it better there you go floatleft this style type known oops I put it on the wrong thing I'm sure you all notice that oh sorry about that that explains why it's not really working okay oh goodness you all can't see that it's behind the screen I'm very sorry about that okay anyway yeah so you can see we do have let's take see where we have a so sure let's let's play around a little bit in dev tools and see what we can do position let's try fixed and let's go top eight pixels and left and a right 16 pixels great except we want more than that right because we need to fit that donate button in there so let's just try 50 then a hundred try hundred pixels first okay and then let's do the same with the donate button so we're gonna do a position position fixed and we're gonna go again with top zero oops top eight pixels and then left this time we're gonna go 16 pixels Oh what do we end up interesting let's get rid of that for a second oops I did just did the wrong one here I said left didn't I oh yeah here's a button I meant to say rights 16 great all right now 16 pixels from the rights is a good space so let me try to zoom in and show you it's hard to see but basically you can see that scroll bar goes right in here if you go less than 16 your scroll bar will start to overlap whatever you have there and this is is on you know on iOS you have a thin scroll bar on Windows the scroll bars tend to be even thicker so minimum I go from the side is 16 pixels so you know keep that in mind and I usually do the same on this side at least 16 pixels just to keep things the same but you can certainly go more than that but if you want to give yourself you know as much space as you can up here you know 16 I'd say is the minimum amount or I'm sorry the yeah that's an the minimum amount okay great so we need to move these over a bit now obviously this is not good spacing let's go back up to our social social div and that's not bad spacing now let's try 116 great okay I like that spacing I like it the only thing I don't like is right now it I would like it if all of this you know kind of the same so we may want to make the donate button a little bit thinner or you know maybe push these down just a bit I'm not worried about it right now at some point we might want to do you know one or the other a combination of the two you know to make it so that you know these are kind of middle you know a line Pro you know potentially align right with this text but for now that's not bad that's working out all right so before we accidentally refresh this and lose what we've done let's take these and transfer them over to our react component so I'm going to move this to the side here so I can keep it on the screen while we edit this so we have above our SVG style I'm gonna put our social I'm gonna call this social and that's going to be of course our our div that holds all our social icons and we're gonna do positionfixed and top it's gonna be eight pixels right we'll be do we do one hundred and sixteen pixels all right awesome we're also going to do just few G let's do our button so let's call I don't want to just call a button because we have a lot of buttons secondary CTA this is our secondary call to action I say that because our primary call to action is going to be this button this is our secondary one so we actually do need to play around with these sizes because I would want this to be larger and this to be a bit smaller right this is primarily what we would like users to do which it doesn't say it right now but this will prompt potential students to fill out an application and then secondarily for people who aren't students we would like them to consider donating so we want those you know definitely visible and easy to click right off the bat okay great so let's put our social and our secondary CTA classes down here was a social class name so we already have social here which is great let's just gonna wrap this here and classes dot social and then let's go down to our button and let's give it classes the secondary CTA let's check out what we do as you saw oh I forgot the comma I frequently forget commas in arrays I'm sorry objects this is not an array it's an object I great that I get all the commas I did it okay oops and I missed well I missed what did I do and what time wow what did I mess up all right let's check this out and I do down here mmm alright let's restart the server usually when things go weird it's always worth it shot to restart the server this was happening me earlier occasionally all the Styles would just go away and the only way to fix it was to restart the server all right awesome so that's working again now yeah and I forgot to add the styles here for this list so I'm gonna have to redo that whoa and you know what I messed up the positioning for that button so what we wanted was 16 pixels not 1/16 so that should fix that and now let me let me grab those the styles for the list don't we had before that was that I get those I'm gonna pull it over to this screen and there we go all right so let's make our bar links I'm gonna leave these in here now but these are gonna be replaced but for now it'll keep that search icon small enough so it doesn't look crazy and we're gonna do we're gonna call these links at bar app bar links and we're going to say I'll see we'll do a couple things let's go lineheight and we do 48 pixels this would be the last thing we do because I'll never get through the questions if I don't stop right now Heights actually alright yeah I have to stop now so let's let me put this comment so don't get an error and how about I stop this now and I'm gonna go ahead and commit this as is and then that way if anybody wants to check out what was done you can otherwise that won't be able to commit it till after my meeting so let's get status check out great so we've only modify the one component which is what we anticipated and let's go get at git commit a.m. and let's say add social icons that's good enough great git push origin wonderful ok now that's on github now you don't need that anymore now let me go to the live chat I'm gonna try to get through as much as I can I can only do about 10 more minutes that I have to go to the meeting if I really have to I could pry bring my laptop to the meeting and I get the data I need while somebody else is talking so but I'd rather not have to do that in case I get asked for my data first okay oh great I see Graham and Harshit both let me know in the live chat how to do the comment in react so thank you for that sorry I didn't look over at the live chat I really should have ended up figuring out anyway but but still I appreciate it that's seed Tim asks where do most technical discussions take place for this project github Gator slack wondering what is the best way to stay up to date or find out if there is something I might help with I would say probably get hub and actually I would prefer this so all the technical discussions should take place on github preferably in issues or if a pull request has already been submitted for something within that pool request that way it's available to everybody we don't have to worry about somebody you know getting you know sign up for Gator or getting into the slack Channel I think that's the most public place and then it keeps it all central so even you know let's say two years from now somebody happens to find this repository our slack Channel and our Gator it might not even be active anymore but they can still see the logic behind everything you know not that anybody would be interested in this two years now but you never know so yeah so check out the github repo and usually all the discussion happens Scott has yawning all the discussion happens within the issues there that's a really good question let's see cool rook says the SVG's looks nice he says SVG's are cool but complicated yeah they are I really like these SVG's because they're so simple you know the the actual you know SVG code is just very simple for those a lot of them can get huge like this is an SVG this icon and it's really just huge write the codes huge is it's hard to figure out what's going on but something like this you at least have a shot at being able to like look at the code and figure it out not me I'm not really that knowledgeable about the code but somebody who is into SVG's could probably figure this out since it's so small but you can do a ton of really cool stuff with SVG's there's somebody on Twitter Sara Dresden Sara her I I follow her on Twitter and she's always doing really cool stuff with SVG's and I've seen her videos come up on YouTube before as well so if anybody is really interested in SVG's and the stuff you can do with them check check that I'll check her their Twitter account out and maybe try to find her stuff on youtube but I'm always impressed with what she's able to do with with SVG's music says putting classes to the class name happens to me all the time and react yet it happens and actually for one project we had it set up I forget who set it up but somebody set it up so that you could actually use class and you didn't have to use class name and then I got spoiled with that and so for the next project I kept messing it up again let's see bill all says what do you guys think about CSS grids versus flexbox would it be a waste of my time to try to learn both I guess it depends if you're into CSS and you want to learn more about it then go ahead and learn both if you're more like of a backend person at all mess with CSS that much but wouldn't worry about it quite as much but if you usually use let's say a framework where it's kind of an abstraction of class names you don't have to deal with it directly then you might not want to but if you're really interested in how it works then the reason why you couldn't check both out it's not super complex I think the hardest part is just trying to remember what the the property names are and the values that you can give them Oh heart should actually paste it in the name of the the plugin where you can use class instead of class name so thanks for that yet it's it's um babble plugin react HTML attributes but it's attrs so check that out if you want to I can see it coming in handy if you had to paste a lot of regular HTML into react I don't know how much of that we'll be doing you know aside from what we just did here I think that's about as much as we're gonna need to paste in so we should be good but it would be useful if you did have to paste a lot God soul says what University the University I work at is called Franciscan University of Steubenville it's a small University in southeastern Ohio in the United States if you're familiar with Pittsburgh it's pretty close to Pittsburgh just just west of Pittsburgh okay let's see Bogdan says I learned flexbox uses some test projects and now started to learn CSS grade Peter says you have to learn flexbox before CSS grades Bogdan says kid because you can use CSS grids with flexbox world's asked what did you study in college business officially I have a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration with a specialization in banking finance and economics it's a lot to fit on on a resume but yeah that's my that's my degree let's see Rick s regarding hang react versus angular what in a nutshell is the biggest difference regarding the learning curve personally I found angular to be more difficult to learn than react but I tried to learn angular back when it was angular 1 and I was a lot less fluent in JavaScript so it's not a fair comparison when I tried to learn react it was a couple years later I knew a lot more so I don't know that I could give kind of a fair answer to that question from my experience all right how about 10s is there anybody who knows there's something on Russian unfortunately I don't really know very much Russian at all but I am good with Google translates you'd like to say something in Russia and I will translate it and it's here hey Anna how's it going thanks for thanks for joining us in the live chat see ha ha brooke says look how crisp this huge icons are it's amazing yeah I mean the icons being that big were definitely is not intended but it was a good example of how crisp the SVG stay yeah I just love it so cool okay Bogdan says are you coding and react yes now as I understood you write some Styles in JavaScript file right what is it can you explain okay man I got into a meeting I'm sorry I won't be able to explain this very well but at least I could show you yeah this is react and this is a JavaScript file and then we're writing the Styles here but we're basically just creating a JavaScript object and then we're applying those Styles down further in what looks like our HTML there's a lot of different ways to do that in react this is not the only way but I don't have time to explain any of the other ways let's see okay all right so unfortunately I really have to go to my meeting now so thank you so much for watching and helping out we got a decent amount done today almost everything I really had planned on getting done and if you have any questions and I didn't get to them feel free to DM me on Twitter or reach out to me on any social media I'm on most of them I should be back tomorrow around the same time 200 p.m. Eastern time until then thanks again and have a great day
