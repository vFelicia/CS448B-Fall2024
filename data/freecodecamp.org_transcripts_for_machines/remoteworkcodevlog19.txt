this week there will be a bit of planning some news and a lot of information about remote wag i'm planning the new year when it comes to code video and my challenges prior planning prevents poor performance it's tuesday and evening the whole day today i devoted to editing the article it will be about the code block the article will be available in free code scam medium publication let's talk about getting everyone's job usually working remotely is working on the project and working on the results matters if you are communicative if you do the work on time and if you really deliver what you promised to deliver mode work is not sitting on the beach and doing nothing there are also team meetings there also scrums and other stuff that you have to be really on time in a given place and connect through the good wifi connection some people say that it's really not for code movies because you cannot learn from developers who are senior developers but it depends really on the team and the relationships working remotely doesn't mean that you have to be like a digital nomad you can do it your way it's the beginning of the year the first week and because i was planning a lot and also summarizing a lot i also was interested what was the top topic that we talked on free code camp and interestingly majority of the top topics are about getting a developer job and some of them are about six stories and others about about some failures while there's also a group of posts about uh remote wack and uh that's why i decided to share some websites where you can find remote work that may be helpful if you are looking for some remote projects the first two portals i'm starting with and these are the portals for the remote web for freelancers but these portals are quite selective so you have to pass a lot of steps in order to to create your profile there these two portals are all toptol.com majority of the other portals you start up your own account the example is up work you start up your own account you fill in your profile you take the tests whichever you want you got the full access to your account to your profile from the beginning and also from the beginning you are able to start applying for the jobs upwork.com is the combination of all desk and elance uh so previously uh there were two separate portals uh right now it's one portal it's upwork.com and that people from all around the world uh when it comes to clients but also when it comes to developers so don't worry about bidding the prices but simply set your price and start applying that different contracts and different clients you can check the clients you can check the contracts what's good about the upwork is that it's really huge this is one of the portals that i really recommend of course there are different opinions about each one i will present but uh this one i know quite well and i know a lot about success stories not just on es for individual and developers but also for the whole software houses the next one is uh jobs dot remote if io you can of course categorize here the kind of work let's go to engineering all of them are remote and clicking into the offer of course you go to its details another we wack remotely wework remotely.com uh it's also a nice list where you can find not just only developers job but also other stuff but simply you can search for the keywords you get updates when they were published of course when you click you see the whole description remote io is the service that's really similar and you can find here um the dev jobs from different languages the next one working nomads dot co slash jobs what's important in all of this kind of portals is to use categories to search wisely faster and to save your time this is the portal called angel.co here you will find a lot of startup jobs another service wfh dot io the next place we are hirable.com and one more freelancer.com very often the same offer appears on different portals uh some of them aggregate then the japanese from other portals but also the clients very often publish the same offer on different uh channels on different services at stack overflow when you look for remote you can find a lot of offers for different languages you can also find them in codepen io slash jobs but here you have to really look for remote here in the description i want to share some lessons i've learned that i think that can be useful for you if you're wondering this year to start the remote work or to take some remote gigs if you really care about getting a new project the best option is to be active and to be reactive to answer whatever your clients write to you respond the same day and if you have to write a lot of extra stuff that in the response or additional questions to the project or some explanation then at least write that you will write back tomorrow at the same time you keep the content alive you can really rise your status among the other candidates by sharing by being the person who is really searchable online i've noticed that providing information that's really um that's really important for the given job is important in the answer in the offer but it's also great if you have a current linkedin account if you have some blog if you write some articles if you share some content if you spread the news about what you know if you help others because this way the person with whom you want to work may simply easily notice you online and simply check whether you are reliable or not in what you are saying in this offer in the journey of these portals you can also create your accounts your profiles and add your portfolio items or additional links and version additional resources about you don't omit it whether the tests you can also take the test some of them like um on artwork in them in my opinion they are very very theoretical one but at the same time that some people there are some clients that look at your profile at your um at your profile at these portals really from the top to the bottom so if you have an empty account if you don't have any references if you don't have any portfolio items if you don't have any information about you about uh what you did so far why you that the other person is the best person for the project they simply may go to the next candidate yes it's a kind of work it takes time to prepare it but later you can use the same content on the other portals because usually um their questions repeat we're preparing your profile you can do a lot of copy and paste from linkedin from other portals that you are already in it's not the same when applying to the offers treat clients individually don't resign from a given portal just only because somebody somebody from your friends didn't have luck there because maybe they had a different account maybe they have different skills maybe they didn't look a lot maybe they did a poor job you should try something on your own i got one big news for you i started um uploading my content uploading my vlogs uh to free codescamp youtube channel and you can find me under the playlist the dual blog i can reach more people and help more people and share with more people and joining the core team of free code camp is a really a prize for me thank you next week i'll come back to react functionality in the recipe box app keep on doing stay motivated and develop each day and see you next week you
