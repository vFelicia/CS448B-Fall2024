hey guys i'm reggie one of the cofounders of pennybox i look after products so everything from ui ux engineering code reviews managing the engineers uh feature sets testing i look after all that so today i'm going to give you a little insight into what i do day in day out so join me i'm working out of the common room in the apartment building i'm staying at here in san francisco i am going to be sitting here probably for the next couple of hours it's a really cool place there's a really cool uh common table here where you see a lot of startup people unfortunately today there's really no one around there is a camera crew here that's actually recording something for some reason or other but it's a nice facility you've got kitchen and there's a gym actually just over there if you can see it um going there at lunch times and workouts to clear my mind occasionally as a bit of an insight into some of the tools that we use here at pennybox in the product development process um so tools like sketch pivotal tracker slack for communications i'm sure a lot of startups use similar ones but these are the ones that we use it works really well for us and i'm going to run you through a couple now up here today very simple just got my mac out and obviously the most important thing coffee i want to show you first of sketch we sketch for all of our design ui ux purposes um what i'm going to be doing today is i'm going to be changing this screen for the next version of the app so right now the profile screen for the child it shows their parents and doesn't really show much else so this is going into a version one beta release for the next version what we want to actually show is a transaction history of what the kid has actually earned the money for and what the tasks were so i'm going to go ahead and change the screen and i'll show you the final output so what i've done here now is i've taken a copy of this artboard which is the no activity version one and i've replicated over here so i keep most of the elements the same next thing i've done is added all of these elements so this basically has a scrolling history of all the tasks and activities the child has done and this will do for our purposes and this now goes to the engineer and they'll be able to code some of these elements in so we're going to have to create some backend api calls to be able to handle this sort of information from our database so that's what we've done in sketch today very handy tool that we use which is in vision i think many of you would have come across or heard of envision at least envision is used for prototyping so click through screens that allows you to basically test with your users how responsive these screens are or how well the users are responding to it um it's a very handy tool and we actually use it in collaboration with sketch with a handy plugin that envision provides called craft so i'll show you in a second how this works and how easy it is to upload basically your designs into envision and start prototyping on your vision this is envision as you can see we've got the screen that we're working on in sketch this is the original one that we had for the beta what i'm going to do is now go into sketch and over here on the right we've got a plugin it's a plugin called craft and it's extremely handy if you're trying to sync your uh your artboards from sketch over to envision it's very seamless integration allows you to basically push all of these um as as image files as pngs into envision otherwise you'd have to extract each one of these manually and upload it to envision which can take a lot of time so this is very handy i'm going to go ahead and upload this new screen that we've done into envision i'm going to show you how it looks on the envision site so this is the craft plugin that we've just opened up i've selected the artboard i don't want to sync all of the artboards to envision right now so i've just selected the artboard that we want to sync we've logged into envision already it's actually very easy to integrate we've logged into envision i'm going to pick penny box beta which is the um the prototype that we're uploading into only selected artboards and sync to envision we're back here now on vision and as you can see um this upload has been successful and it's come through into envision so i'm going to click through into it and it'll load and now i can go through and create my workflows here which will allow me to effectively link this up with the existing prototype and as you click through it you'll be able to see the new new mockup of the screen that we've done in sketch so i just want to show you guys um our task management tool we use a tool called pivotal tracker it's very similar to jira in that it allows you basically to create tickets and track tasks um we like it a little bit better than jira with interiors a little bit too over complex for what we want to achieve and how we want to achieve it so we actually use people to be able to do this so just to explain some of the screens here so these are basically all the tasks that have been done to date um this is our current iteration and backlog so these are the tasks that are currently being done right now and this is the icebox the icebox is basically tasks that we've identified that need to be done and we've categorized them based on priority so once the stuff out of the backlog is done we'll pull these tasks into the backlog and we'll continue so right now you can see some accept and rejects here this is for media engineers um just recently committed a chunk of code and what i'm going to do now is pull up f code i'm going to pull the code out of bitbucket we use bitbucket for our code repository and i'm going to go through and do a quick code review pull it onto my iphone test device and i'm going to be able to test some of these um these engineering tasks that have been completed and then i can either accept them or reject them if they've been done according to the criteria that we've set some code reviewing of some of the commits that came through overnight um what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you our bitbucket repository this is where we store all of our code for the pennybox ios app um and from there i'm going to pull it out into xcode and load it onto my phone onto a test device so i'll show you that now so this is our bitbucket account um this is where we basically sync all of our code too so we've got three repositories here um once for our core api so this is all of our backend stuff this is for the frontend development and this is our gamification platform that we're developing alongside so i'm going to go into the front end um and you'll see that uh there isn't too much on this screen but we'll go to commits and this is where basically all the commits have come through um this is an engineer that's making commits um so what i'm going to do now is basically have a look at when the last commit was done was yesterday so we're going to go into xcode and basically pull this out so we're going to check out this code and we're going to pull it out of the back end implementation branch so we've got separate branches for different um levels of work that we're doing the different types of code changes that we're making or additions we're going to pull it back an implementation i know that's the one that we need i'm going to save it in annotated with today's date and we're going to download it okay so that's done and this is basically our code so you're getting a real preview into how we do all of our developments so this is basically all of our modules um what i'm going to do is basically run this in a release version and i'm going to connect my um my phone to it really soon but let's just uh for demonstrations sake run this on a iphone 6 and this should pop up a simulator so this is going to be on screen it's not going to have some of the features that we'd like to test for example being able to use the hardware on a device that's why it's really important that we also test alongside the simulator with the real devices so we can see exactly how it looks how it how it behaves and how performs and when you do run it on devices you tend to also catch some logic bugs or issues that you wouldn't otherwise see in a simulator so we we always run a simulated version but alongside that we also run a real physical device version as well so the build is succeeded there and very shortly the simulator will pop up all right so paint boxes loaded and we come to long screen so let's just play around with this child anyway so i'm going to go through and test a number of engineering changes that have happened um i won't run you through uh all of our code base um but this is basically where all of it sits we've got different pods um different view controllers for different screens um it's all architected within xcode connecting off my iphone uh with um with my mac and what i'm going to do now is basically create a build um of this current version into the iphone and also onto the ipad so i can test on these devices i'm going to do that on xcode and push it through as a build so this actually circumvents um the need for test flight if you can navigate your way through xcode it's actually really handy because you can run built on devices um especially with your development team it's actually really easy to be able to do those on a frequent basis rather than having to upload to test flight we do use test flight we use it for um for internal and external testing with our users and families but as we're doing development and and to be able to track through the cycle um and as commits are done um so we can tick off on pivotal when tasks and tickets are completed um we just build it directly onto the iphone using xcode a very quick code review of the changes that were made bitbucket actually has an extremely handy section that allows you to look at the commits and what's been done this helps me to identify where the code changes have occurred so you can actually see a side sidebyside difference um to see where changes have been made so this is actually really handy and looking at this i know exactly which file to go into in xcode and where i'm actually reviewing the changes that have been made so this is a review that i've just completed i'm just about to upload it onto um uploaded build onto my iphone which is connected so this is a real device so it's not a simulator and i'm going to go ahead and create the built all right so xcode is telling me that it's about to run it on pinning on on the iphone and here it is so penny box now loaded so now i can go ahead and do um and complete my testing which i'm going to go through on both the iphone here and also the ipad in a very short period of time a break and heading off for lunch i'm in the mission bay area here in san francisco it's a beautiful day today now if you can see the sky it's a beautiful sunny day today going through a bit of a heatwave which is really nice so i'm gonna walk over now to a cafe near me and have a bit of a bite to eat and get back to it got back from lunch and we've got two ladies here from so bakeable.com doing some work here today what are you guys cooking up we're going to make beautiful rose champagne cupcakes ooh yum and i get to taste them afterwards right you do it's the end of the day i'm working away and i get nice little sweet surprises here so jocelyn what's what you've got a dark chocolate cookie that has a melty caramel center with flaky salt on top and then those are our chocolate whoopee chocolate whoopieesque raspberry chocolate surprises um not bad at all it's got a chewy caramel center yum
