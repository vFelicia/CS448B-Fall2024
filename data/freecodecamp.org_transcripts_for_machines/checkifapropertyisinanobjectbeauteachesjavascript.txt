how to check if a property isn't an object here we have an object just my object name js nuggets that's the property and a lot of people to check if property is an object do this so you can say it's going to say it is in here but there are actually two native ways for checking if an object is in a property that sometimes are better than just saying if object got my name there so let me show you those there's the in operator and there's the has own property function so here's an example of those and if we run both these we can see true and true my object that has on property names going to be true and name in my object so those are the two ways has on property and in however there's something to to keep in mind with these has own property will only return true if the key is available on that object directly however in will show true whether it's created directly on the object or if the property is inherited from the prototype chain let me show you an example of that i'm just going to paste these but i'm gonna put in a different property here so value of is a property on all objects however it's not one that we specifically created on this object value of is just part of the prototype of an object so let's run that and see what happens so you'll see at the end false true so has own property value of is showing false the value of in my object is showing true so those are just a few ways to check if a property's in an object thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
