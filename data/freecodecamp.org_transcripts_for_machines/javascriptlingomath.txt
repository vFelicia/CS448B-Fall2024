since we're talking about manipulating data let's talk a little bit about the built in object called math math this is an example math background has a lot of builtin properties and methods that are going to help you manipulate any numerical data that you're working with just like with the other methods you don't have to memorize them all but you should really look at the Mozilla developer Network page to see what math has to offer a good example that I like to use with math is math dot random which I used in my zip line for the quote generator there's something else that you should know about working with numbers that doesn't have to do with math there's something called floatingpoint format that JavaScript uses what I'm telling you this is later when you're doing a lot of calculations depending on the calculations how large the numbers are how many calculations you're doing there might be a little bit of an accuracy like four or five decimal points down the line there are ways to get around this and it's not that big of a deal but I'm telling you this so if you're ever getting an error or there's some number it just isn't adding up right it's not your fault that's built into the language and there are plenty of ways around it
