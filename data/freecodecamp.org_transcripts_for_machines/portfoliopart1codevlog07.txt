Hi guys! Welcome to a new day! It’s Thursday. We are in Málaga. Today we’re going to talk in Spanish because today I start my new Spanish course. To understand all the people who live here you need to speak Spanish. If you don’t do it, it isn’t easy to live here. When I’m talking with people from Madrid I understand majority from what they are saying. They finish all the words and it’s easier. But here (in Málaga) in Andalú (accent)... it’s a bit more difficult because it’s a different accent.
