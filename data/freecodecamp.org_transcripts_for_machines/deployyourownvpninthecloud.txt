thank you everyone for coming my name is robert axelsson besides from organizing this meetup i'm also going to give a talk uh to you today on the topic on the topic of deploying a vpn a vpn is a virtual private network that enables it for you to connect to that server or that network from your connection when you are connected to the internet and it gives room for you to encrypt your data and also to bypass as a proxy if your server vpn network is in the us it will appear most probably for the person that you are accessing the website at for example cnn.com or whatever that you are coming from the u.s and not from austria but let's get into the details and why i'm mentioning this today uh what i'm going to cover in specifics is outline which is a tool that enables you to set up your own virtual private network we'll get to the specifics soon my name is robert axelson as i mentioned you can find me uh at rob axelson on most of the things i didn't realize i put this in here but i am actually on all the things at on all the things as well i haven't started using it actively but i have it everywhere and it's an elias for now i might do something fun with it but it was just available i'm at i'm i'm on all the things at on all the things i'm a software developer a meetup organizer and a community enthusiast i like creating and starting and organizing meetups i now run three monthly meetups as you know as i mentioned before yeah if you want to learn more about mine and also coorganizers danielle deutsch's journey from learning to program to code to getting our first developer job which we did recently over the last couple couple of years both me and him you can look online at my website you'll find links to recordings of that talk we did okay enough about me um slides for this talk are already available online in our repo so have a look there also for the ones looking at the recordings just head on over there and you can look at the slides together no need to take notes what inspired this talk for me was recently i think within the last week there was a episode at youtube at hack5 which by the way is a great youtube channel a big shout out to them if you're interested in security or penetration testing or hacking be it white hat gray hat or black hat have a look at that channel they've been around forever and there's some really great stuff there down to beginner intros on what to do in the command line to using kali linux and all kinds of stuff so i really really really recommend to have a look if you have any interest in that topic okay so before we get into the tool that we're going to use let's get a little bit of a little bit serious and let's talk about a guy named john so john a 27 year old journalist ever since he was a young teen he learned about the widespread corruption in this country after experiencing it firsthand himself he has been driven to stop it john from an early age again he volunteered to help with the school paper and he learned that he had a talent for writing it was only natural to him that he applied to study journalism in the capital in the university in the capital of his country and he was ecstatic when he got accepted like this is awesome so john again after having studied for a couple of years he graduated with flying colors he easily got a job at the top newspaper in his country and john he was on a path he was really destined to be to get a great career career but he wanted something more he's this is there should have been a dash here because it looks like he has a disease so sorry for that but his this is with a dash regarding corruption has never really faded since his teens but his country had only a resemblance of a free press and writing about corruption was at best frowned upon still he felt repelled to speak up then out of the blues john was suddenly contacted by an anonymous source that had him introduced to john via common friend and led to believe that he could help disclose a scandal that involved highly powerful men and their corruption in their country so john agreed to meet a secret location was agreed upon and they met and john was both shocked and repulsed by the scandal his source revealed but he knew he get had to get a story publish the end shortly after the meeting john mysteriously went missing and john's story was never published even though this is a fictional story clearly written by me today mixing past and present tense and not a work of great uh oh we'll get to that afterwards not a work of great um writing talent it tells the story that i think the people behind italian wants to tell and help mitigate to confuse you i'll jump back in my slides because i think i'm missing oh there it is awesome so outline was released now in march of this year by jigsaw which is alphabet's cyber security division supposedly by techcrunch stating it's their cybersecurity division looked a little bit into it it looks more like they're an incubator under alphabet alphabet owns google if you didn't know so this is googlebacked um that has to do with geopolitical issues and how to help the world or people better protect in those spaces so not strictly cyber security but it definitely definitely falls under that domain yes that's jigsaw i wanted this talk to be a bit um again back to the title uh deploy to be a bit interactive i want to state this because i'll get back to it later this talk is this uh youtube video um is 17 17 minutes long and we'll cover some stuff that i won't cover today what we'll cover now together is uh going to the website downloading the tool and then um installing it and setting up our own vpn and hopefully the demo guards are with us and the internet is stable and we'll see if we can get this done so let's do this are two links we need there one is the website to download it the other one is my referral link to the place we can use as for hosting a vps for hosting this keep in mind if you use this link you will get ten dollars credit i will get some credit on my part if you prefer not to do it it'll be apparent later on in the talk where you can go to do it without involving me i want that to be perfectly clear because i'm not doing this yeah for those reasons and just a super quick shout out we my company are looking for both frontend and backend developers if you are interested here are the details contact me email or check on the website yeah i'm a frontend developer in my team we use vue.js javascript mainly have a look if you're interested cool so let's do this it's as simple as using the link goingtogetoutline.org they are framing this for journalists but keep in mind you could use this yourself you would have to pay for the hosting we'll get into that as a monthly cost but when you have set it up you can by click of a few buttons send a link to your friend or contact wherever you want to connect with via a vpn encrypted securely and privately as you can get there's always potential loopholes and with humans involved and attack vectors like i want i cannot stand on stage and say you will be hundred percent secure uh but as secure as we can get in this day and age and then you can invite them and they'll be connected via your vpn and you can safely communicate with them one thing to add about um what we're going to do or no the the reason for for using such a tool is not just for journalists if you are connected let's say in starbucks which is notoriously one of the examples for you shouldn't check your online banking if you're at starbucks or any open wifi network because anyone that just puts up a computer and knows something they can sniff the data and they'll figure all this stuff out this is as safe as you can get by still being connected in the public open wifi first before you share anything private or sensitive you connect via the vpn and then you proceed to communicate what you want it to be hidden or you log into your online bank or you log into facebook or whatever you don't want anyone else to possibly be able to snoop right so that's also a use case besides the journalism stuff so we just scroll down and we go to get outline managers there's by the way also um mobile clients um hack five mentioned that it's not covered on all the devices for me it seems like so but there might be some some caveats there but for our demonstration now we'll just go and get for linux you can also download so you can initially set this up via wizard on windows or mac os and we'll see why that is the case it's downloading down here now and over half of the way true so we'll just wait for that in the meantime i'll get up a terminal and we'll soon get going so for those of you who aren't so tactical or you don't even have to be technical to not understand what's going on right now but i'm on linux and what i do now might seem esoteric the only thing i'm doing is opening the file so at windows you would just double click the exe file and it would would happen by itself a little bit more complicated here but it's just a couple of lines of code or command line commands so i just have to give it i won't go into details the one that knows what this is knows it so now i'll just execute it apparently not okay uhhuh what plus x thank you shout out to however spotted the error we got it now there we go so here we go let's see uh maybe i'll break it now yeah we cannot maximize it so it's is the biggest we get i'll go a step back because i see it knows i already started this earlier today so i'll sign out this is what it would look like for you when you just open this up the first time it does expect you to have an account that digital ocean digitalocean is a vps a virtual private server provider they compete in the space against amazon and google cloud and so on they more are in the business of giving you a dedicated virtual server at them with a certain amount of power and then you pay per month and you do whatever you want with them with it you can start as low as five dollars a month and that's what this is based on so you have to pay five dollars to try this out first you do create an account you can do that via here or you can use the link i mentioned robert e go.do and you get 10 credit to start this out right now i just have to sign in awesome i don't think you have to agree to any gdpr compliance and sign on the papers to see my email but um since we had a talk before let me just get my mobile ready so i can do the second two factor authentication here and i have to change the password this this doesn't work but we should be covered so you see you see my second email awesome maybe you can hear from the way i'm typing what my password is awesome awesome so i just gonna get my one of my account passwords awesome so so you create your account and you just sign in now it might prompt me for something awesome so give me one second okay so here's the magic and this is where i found this really great for um our meetup today um that with digitalocean you can choose a country that the server is in that's also on topic today you can choose it to be in the eu for example and also we're very close to frankfort so that's awesome then i'm pressing the button and i'm telling it to set it up for me it is doing that and this might take two minutes it says while we're doing that um once this is done what we will see will be inside my digitalocean account and then we will see that it actually has created a new server and if you are interested if you do this it's an entry port to be able to log into your own server and get a little bit of feel of what linux is and system administration because it starts with these small experiments it did for me i was like what is this vps can i host besides using hostgator or one and one or one of these hosting providers how much knowledge would it need to do it on my own and before i learned to program the free code camp i took a course at linux academy and learned to host via the lamp stack linux linux apache mysql and php using these kind of tools online and if i didn't want to use the vps anymore after a day i could just destroy it and only pay for that one or two days but it's a great way for learning these kind of things and now we see that there is already so this kept going on in the background i'm just going to refresh for the sake of clarity what this did in the background was that this is my normal server and i'm giving you the ip address this is awesome so i should probably change that ah it's fine it's fine if you know my domain name you can find this ip address publicly available this is the one the server that i created this is its unique ip address so if you try to attack this ip address as a hacker or whatever what you are just directing at is the vpn server that we just set up by clicking a button so it can be done magically easy like this now the thing i won't go into detail upon now is how you would share this because the video that i mentioned earlier that i have a link to goes into better detail of explaining this and for me to demo this on this desktop i would need also to have a shared screen of a phone or another desktop to show the interaction what's going on right so that does that much better we can do that at a key part i'm not connected okay get connected connect this device okay it gives us some stuff to install so i won't do that now with you because that's too um it doesn't give you anything the only thing we see after this is done is that i can click a key to share with someone else but we have done uh the the hard part already believe me so we're almost done we're almost true uh but keep in mind that you can use something like digital lotion to do these kind of things on your own either for a vpn and you can be ready in a second or you can do it for different services if you want to host wordpress on your own if you're interested in trying out linux if you want to do something like you've heard about this ghost alternative to wordpress or you want to set up instead of github you want to set up git lab for yourself or your team if you want to play around with my sequel there's a lot of stuff that are already um there for you with a click of a button mean stack for example is mongodb nginx angular and node.js so on topic for free codecamp it's uh javascript based and if i click here now so i've chosen that one i can say i want the minimum one i want to have it in frankfurt and i want to have ipv6 and i want to add my ssh oh it's a public key it's fine and i can give it a name and create and it goes through the same process again and when i'm done with this i get an ip address i can ssh into it that means that i can connect to it from my laptop and i can be in an environment where i can do stuff from the command line to put stuff on my server to host stuff create an app and already have it available in ip so i don't have to just have localhost on my computer so there's tons of possibilities but that starts by being curious about what virtual private services what linux is and how you can do these things on your own and believe me when i say anyone can learn it i could i got it working and little lotion to top it off also has a great um i can't find a link to it but they have a great article base or they have a lot of how to's on how to do these things step by step really step by step anyone can do this and you can also use these tutorials and i really recommend it even if you are not curious about the digital ocean at all if you're using something else or would you like to use another provider they have a great reputation for having really topnotch articles and i go to them often just if there's something i'm curious about myself and oh how do i do this i often first go to digitalocean so enough about them but i really mean it when i say have a look there if you're curious and to end the talk here are the links not here they are and thank you
