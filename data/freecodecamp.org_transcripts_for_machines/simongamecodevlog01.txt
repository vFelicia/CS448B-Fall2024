hey guys it's monday morning i just came back from running time from ray shower and awesome week this is free code cam project it's called sign on game so it's like the traditional simon game where where you get the pattern of the sounds and you have to repeat them after 20 sounds you introduced correctly of course you win going for a meeting with friends do asking for feedback is always worthy wednesday morning and i've been working on simon game since the beginning of this week this week i did two comments and i started this project at the at the end of the last week introducing the basic ui by the basic ui i mean it's responsive right now however it needs much much more work to be ready to go so far i've implemented the user stories let me show you that i'm presented with random series of button presses this is the random series random ray each time i hit restart there is a new random series each time it starts from step one and if i press the button correctly i have one no sound added to repeat from this array this will continue until 20 steps and after the 20th step the game is over and the user won so the first user story is implemented the next one is each time i input a series um of pattern presses correctly i see the same series of button process with an additional step this is also implemented i hear a sound that corresponds to each button whenever i hit it or the computer hits okay so this user story is also implemented the the sounds are heard if i press the wrong button i'm notified i have done so and the series of patterns is repeated let me make mistake so it's four four one one so i will do two two uh one one so here there was oops listen again and the pattern is repeated so the user store is implemented i can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses is exactly here at the top right now if i want to restart i can hit a button to do so and the game will return to a single step yep it works i can play in a street mode where if i make mistake so then it will be restarted so let me play in strict mode so i have to press 4 because it was first step without any mistake for two four to four and let's make a mistake so four two one and as you see is notification uh that i made a mistake but i come back directly to the first step and i have to start the game from the top and the last user story i can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct i'm notified of my victory then then the game starts over three one one four and the last sound be careful look here what will happen so i'm not notified and the game starts over from the first step so it's implemented to sum up all of the user stories are implemented and there's the basic ui which is also responsive however it doesn't look well yet i just recorded myself for the silent game i'm going to listen to it right now i deployed the project to the server time for biking it's thursday morning and i still haven't done much to improve my design skills it's time for me i've just answered uh code newbies questions on twitter this week if you are learning to code and haven't heard about them it's really great community so you should check them out okay so it works fine but definitely there's a problem sometimes with the sound so i will have to polish it a bit works fine again problem with the sound and overlapping famous internet explorer who works it's thursday evening and i've been fighting with mobile and sounds and animations on mobile for the whole evening that's it for today that's it and i will come back to it tomorrow maybe i will find a solution mobile animations mobile sounds i hate you it's a friday morning and this is my app after the whole week so so the app is working right now so you can play it it's fully responsive the problem that i have right now is looking for some solution for audio because it's not working properly on mobile devices this is the problem that game developers also have as i've noticed so it may be tough but keep your fingers crossed i hope i'll find some solution and solve this problem it's friday evening i finally did it the audio sources change dynamically as a result i can play it on mobile devices which is great because i don't need each time the audio to be triggered by a user because it's still one and the same audio that's it the week is over i introduced all of the user stories from cybergame i tested it and improved its ux and it's live right now the main problem was html5 audio on mobile browsers the plans for the next week i'm going to revise all of my previous projects from freecode.com redesign some of them especially portfolio get to 500 points on brownies in freecodecamp community and play my first frontend certificate it's the end of the first week of vlogging it was really fun and motivating so i will continue doing it it's really great so keep on hacking see you next week
