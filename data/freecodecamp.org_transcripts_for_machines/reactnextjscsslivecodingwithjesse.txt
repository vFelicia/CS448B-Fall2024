hey everybody is Jessie and today I wasn't exactly sure what I'd be doing so that's why that's the title for this one is purposely vague right now I'm working on the the resources page and on the the new user interface for that page and I was actually just adding an atom package to to help with my code formatting so we talked about this yesterday I think Sebastian brought it up and I have it on my laptop but I'm gonna install it now so today it'll just be like maybe just some random things I'm getting to the end of the list here so let me show you so I showed you yesterday how much was left that I needed to get done basically most of it needs to get done be done this week I have maybe a day or two next week I think that I can work on this but it needs to be done but I was able to complete a few of them but then go through this and I moved I moved to bunch them up over here into this category so that if time allows I will do it so we'll see if I can get through this then maybe I'll do some of these but after I read through them again I realized you know some of them weren't they weren't as necessary as I thought they were when I first when I first put them in these rows so for at least for now we're gonna start out working on the UI which is already taking me longer than I thought it would take in particular right now I'm having this this problem so I have this dropdown and this uses a little bit of JavaScript some jQuery from the materialized framework so it needs to be initialized to be able to do this but what's happening is it's getting initialized before the data is populating so I need to figure I need to figure out a way to stop that from happening so I'm double checking right now that I actually have yeah so let me let me pull this over on to my others from my other screen just to show you kind of in the code what's going on make it a bit bigger it's too big okay so you see we have here's our all our data is coming in with our categories for resources so the people in charge of putting in the data which actually I think it's just one person right now is in charge of putting in data in in WordPress have evidently been putting in some categories which is awesome it gives us more data to work with so they're here they're getting put in here but you can see when this gets initialized what the user sees is you know this list but all that's in this list is the first option because that's hardcoded in there so I need to initialize it afterwards so I'm thinking maybe there's some lifecycle method in react that could help out with this so right now I've made a component for this select thing because I'll probably reuse this on other pages probably the blog page possibly the events page so I thought it'd be better just to pull this out into a component so within the component I put in component amount to initialize that select input so I'm thinking maybe I'll have have to find a different life cycle method and if you're not familiar with react that simply means like component did mount is a life cycle method is it's something that happens during a certain part of the life cycle like the life of a component so when a component is going to mount when it actually did mount when it's going to to update so there are a bunch of them until maybe we'll have to go to the react Docs and check out some other ones and try out and see if we can if we can get this working so other than that I had some pull requests so let me show you the new stuff had some good stuff in here let me find it I thought I had it ready but maybe I maybe I didn't yeah I must have navigated away from the page so I'll just bring this over so this will show one of the pull requests that I haven't brought in yet let me go hey everyone okay I just saw on the live staff and they said that he has a pull request so yeah it's it's we're gonna we're gonna check it out right now so this is Vinay's request which is pretty awesome so I have I pulled down the branch to my local machine and tested it out and it's working great I just haven't merged it in yet so basically what would Vinay's done and since since he's in the live chat he could explain it more in the live chat as well and if I mess something up explaining it he can correct me but basically he switched to using preact which is a smaller version of react right so he switched to that and it makes that everything smaller I'll just I'll show you and you can check it out as well this is on the repo but let me let me show you some of the things so you can see the bundle has gone from 271 kilobytes down to 143 so it's pretty a significant drop you know percentagewise and the size so that's really cool also he added this this analyze command here that will basically bring up a page like this and it shows you all the dependencies everything is going on in your build so it's really really cool and I was actually able to see I wonder if you can see it on here I don't know I thought when I ran it anyway there were some things that I'm not using in the newer versions that of the resource page like masonry that were in here that I could see that now will be gone so it's just kind of cool that I get a visual of everything that's going into the project and be able to see the size I was kind of surprised how you know some pages are bigger than others and trying to figure out why so really cool so you can if anybody wants to to check it out and try this or anything the the pool request is is here you know you can pull that down if you want I will be merging this in probably later on either later on today or tomorrow morning I'll be pulling that in I did want to ask this so I've never used pre X so I want to ask if if anybody has used pre X I'd like to know what your thoughts are on it did you have any issues with it so so far our testing it out just locally click like everything works there's no errors or anything happening so then they did a great job but since I've never used it before I just wondered you know should I be looking out for something I read through the docs a bit just to familiarize myself with it a little more but I'm I'd really like to hear your opinion on it you know so anybody that's used it please let me know if there's if there's no objections that I'm definitely gonna you know merge that in and use it so let me show you I had another request to and yesterday I talked about that Andrew had submitted a pull request based on on the search and then he also had some comments on how to make it even better so he actually went I opened up an issue and then he went and made a pull request that that did everything that he had recommended so really awesome so it looks like I mean it seems like he put in some time to this you know based on what always was changed and everything so he pulled in the debounce from lodash and used that so you can check out the code is all on the resources page now so you'll kind of see it as we're going through because we're going to be in the resources page and you can you know might go through it briefly just to see what was done but if you want to check it out in more depth this is actually on it's merged into the master branch now so you can see it in action I haven't pushed anything from master up to the live site yet so you can see it on github but you won't be able to actually use it unless I mean unless you wanted to download the whole repository and run it locally but I will be pushing things up yeah either later today or tomorrow so anyway Andrew thank you so much this was awesome and I really liked reading through the code both from Andrew and Vinay and just learning from what you both did so both of you thank you this was really awesome and I guess I'll show also the contributors page I actually like have this up on the screen just every time I start just so that you know like you're gonna get up there I guess if I started getting a ton of contributors they wouldn't fit on the screen but for now it's nice if I get any more it's gonna be a little tight maybe two more could fit but anyway I just want to make sure that you get the recognition you deserve for helping out so that's why I show this so let's I'm just going to jump right back in where I where I was before I started this dream and just continue on oh I got a few questions let me let me go over a couple of questions first in the live chat I mean it's just maybe two of them so Josh asked how to set up the night theme on github okay so I had a lot of questions about this yesterday so let me show you basically you need two things you need tampermonkey which is a plugin for Chrome so in the in the chrome I don't know if it's called a chrome store or I don't know what they call it but where you normally get chrome plugins from get tampermonkey then once you have tampermonkey you want to get the github dark and i'll copy let's see let me get the URL and I'll just put it in the chat alright it looks like the update URL on the download URL is the same thing so this URL is where you should be able to download this code so you'll want to run this in tampermonkey and then enable it for github which I think it's all setup for I don't think you really have to setup anything else except just put this code into tampermonkey so that's basically it you may have to if you don't know how to use tampermonkey you may have to mess around with it for a bit but it's really not hard I think it's it's pretty straightforward it's basically just a place where you can put JavaScript and have it run when you go to a certain site automatically so you put it in the JavaScript and you say which site to run it on and it runs really straightforward and then once you have it on there you you have this new Settings panel this github dark Settings panel and you could do you could change everything you could customize it you could even go into the code and make your own theme if you wanted to I just use the default theme that came with it I haven't even looked at any of the other themes yet but I guess it would be cool to match match it up to the theme that I use in my code editors so the highlighting would be the same but for now I'm happy with it how it is ok the other question I had was let's see I lost it no okay Adam so Adam asks did you graduate from fus which is Franciscan University of student Moodle so that's that's the university that I work for so no I actually didn't graduate from fus so I went to actually the cheapest college in the state of West Virginia and if you're not familiar with West Virginia it's one of the poorest states in the United States of America so obviously the United States of America in terms of you know average income it's higher than a lot of other places so when I say poorest states it's relative to the United States which basically means to be considered poor in the United States you know by government standards you can still have a house and a car and cable television and Internet and so it's not really like you're you're destitute but basically the school I went to was so cheap I think I only ended up paying like four hundred dollars or something to go there after you took into account like scholarships and I did get student loan money and things but I ended up investing my student loan money since I didn't need to use it I guess I needed to buy books oh I take that I did have to pay for my book so that that cost a little bit more but I ended up making seven hundred dollars off of investing my student loan money and then whenever I was done with school I just paid it back immediately before I had to start paying interest so so everybody is always talking about how much school cost but I think I actually made money off of college so I was I was a business major and I was wanted to be a stockbroker so that was very in line with what I wanted to do but anyway the Franciscan University is quite a bit more expensive than the university I went to which was West Liberty State College it's West Liberty University now they changed the name but when I went there was just State State College but anyway Franciscan University is is not like one of the most expensive colleges out there it's it's pretty affordable for what it is but it is a private a small private college so small private colleges usually are more expensive so anyways sorry for all that none of that really had anything to do with code but and it was a long answer to a simple question but I just always like to tell the story about me making money off of off of college of my college loans back then the interest rates were a lot higher so you could you could make more money off of really safe investments and something like money market funds and stuff at high high interest rates let's seeoh ahead here we go right off the bat we have a question about the text the text out of the code editor so Sebastian says Windows notepad for the win I actually used no pen to start learning how to how to code so that was the first thing I learned out of code on back in I think like 2003 maybe 2002 somewhere around there so something like somewhere around there I think I learned on notepad which was was super fun so it's somewhat sarcastic it was fun to learn how to do it but doing it on notepad was not fun anyway I'll keep it short in terms of talking about the editors and you all can talk about as much as you on the live chat I like Adam because I've been using at them and I have a lot of packages set up and Adam a lot of plugins but I also use Visual Studio code occasionally and I will say it seems faster than Adam so one day maybe I'll switch if I ever take the time to set up you know similar packages in Visual Studio code but those are the only ones I really have very much experience with I did use notepad plus plus when I was developing on a Windows computer before I switch I switched from notepad plus plus to Adam like years ago so no plaid plus plus was okay at the time I wouldn't have said I was a serious developer at that point so it it worked but I thought it would never go back to it okay so let me let me get back and do some coding and then I'll check back in in the in the live chat and so if you've asked a question stick around for a couple minutes and I'll check back in but I'd like to try to do keep a nice balance between coding and and the chat if I can all right so the problem the problem right now is how do we get this to initialize after the data's come in and the potential solution is let's look up life cycle methods for react components I guess I'll go the official Doc's are probably a good place to go so let me make this bigger and I could probably make this a little bit bigger on the screen okay so we're already using component did mount and obviously that's not working for us right now so any lifecycle methods that happen before that are not going to be of any use to us so maybe maybe component did update the other thing is is this says when it's when it's being rerendered it's possible that this will always fire since we're making an API call to get the data for that so that might work it's worth a try so which I component did update and let's check out see what's going on oh hey it worked they're awesome I want to do do two things I want to try a full refresh and then I want to try to you know do click on these links to do that clientside routing and make sure it still works so let's go to events and then we'll come back all right that works awesome so here's a good tip I've had for some reason I've had a few questions about using jQuery with react so I had a discussion on Twitter about it recently and in a live chat I've had some comments about it we did a stream about it before but this is some good advice so if you need a component to have some data that you're waiting on first and then initialize it component did update seems like it's the way to go all right so that's all that and that was a much faster fix I'm so glad that's something that I've fixed more quickly than I thought usually it's the other way I think something's gonna be easy and then end up spending an hour on it but the next thing is I don't really want to keep this with the discolor that's not it's not the color so I got to decide what color I want to make this do I want to keep it white or not and then what color text I know this background is black but I really I don't want to make this black I'm not even sure that I want to keep this black for now anyway but I'm not gonna mess with it right now at the very least I'll change these colors to this red color that we're using for lengths here and I think I'll just leave it at that for now and if I get any ideas on something else I think that should be okay I wonder how many categories they're gonna add in here I was just saying this this may end up becoming quite large which I mean I guess that's if that's what they want to do that's fine might be difficult to scroll through everything at least it's in alphabetical order so that should help get through it so I'm going to grab the the hex color for this and then apply it here I'm gonna check out in dev tools quickly what that color what that color is where I need to put it where is this I think that it's not try this again there we go that's what I wanted okay so here's what we want the span inside the Li so looks like the dropdown content will change the color here so let me just grab this let me see my component yeah I'm gonna I was I'm glad this happened because I I've discovered something else that doesn't work when I'm using jQuery okay so on some of my components you can see that I've used like this CSS you know right here either in a style tag or you know directly in line so when I'm using these things from the materialized framework that use jQuery to manipulate the Dom which really I just don't have time to rewrite them in a better way for react but let me see basically what's gonna happen is I can't put it in line because that I mean you can see here that list all those outlines don't even exist those get added in when it's initialized I can't put it in that style JSX tag because what that ends up doing see if we can find something okay so what ends up happening is like here it's given this data JSX number and that's what's used see if I can find a style for this okay so that's what's used for these Styles so if you could see over here the stuff in the style JSX tag and the component ends up being converted into something like this where it uses these IDs well what'll happen is if your component has features that are going to be dynamically added after the fact then it's not going to get one of these these IDs so whatever in the background does all this is not even going to see those elements so you can't use that so you basically have to go back to plain old style sheets so I was trying my best to get everything I could out of this stylesheet and I found I was I was trying to get take as much as I couldn't put it in the components and it wasn't working and that's how I eventually found out hey it doesn't work if you're adding things dynamically so I'm still gonna have to keep some things in the stylesheet I won't be able to put it all in the style JSX tags so anyway just wanted to fill you all in on that in case you were working with something similar so what I need to do then I think I copied what I had to copy but I need to put it in this style dot CSS and I'm just gonna throw it down the bottom so my CSS file is a mess I was trying to edit things earlier and it's like really I guess I didn't copy what I thought I copied but it's actually getting really hard to edit things because the CSS is just all over the place so I really need to take some time and and work on that if I do get time which I don't know if I'll have time any time soon but that's also if you're if you're kind of just starting out and you want to get a you know you want to build up your github profile that might be something somewhat simple to start out with just to go through and mess around and see how much of the Styles here you could pull out you could either take out completely because I've already duplicated it in the components or pull it out and put it in the components make sure it still works that's just kind of tedious work that's not difficult but it just takes time to do in the tests so I know sometimes it can be hard starting out contributing to projects so it's good if there's some kind of like easier tasks and as always I don't I don't expect anyone to contribute to this this project you know I I'm happy of y'all just watching and everything but if you want to I really do appreciate that let me see I need to grab the color I thought I had it out here somewhere I guess would be done yep I have it done here I will say this if I was really setting this project up in a better way right off the bat I would have like CSS that gets imported and I could probably have I could probably be running SAS have variables for my colors potentially I could even set up like real JavaScript variables since I'm using you know JavaScript within or I'm using CSS within the JavaScript so there's a lot of different ways I could do this that are better if you haven't been watching you know from the beginning this was a conversion from a static site so a lot of this is just left over and in reality some of the things that are still in this CSS file aren't even being used at all because they were even pulled over from a previous site that was entirely different at a different color scheme and but it was a good jump start to this project so there are things that are in here that have never been used on this project that just never got taken out so I'm not saying that's a good way to do things or just explaining this the current state of the project so I need to do a hard refresh because I don't I don't get to refresh when I edit a CSS file the auto refresh okay that looks a lot nicer than the yellow it's definitely easier to read and it fits better with the color scheme alright that works now I actually I don't think I have this working yet yeah it doesn't work so maybe we'll do that so I did get get this working which this wasn't difficult it was just a matter of adapting the code that I think Fabian had done a pull request and I just needed to adapt it so that I wasn't using masonry and I was instead using these I can see this I'm not getting the the border on this top one so I'm not really worried about it now because I think bill who's frequently in Live Chat sent me some code to do a nice effect with a horizontal rule instead of a border so I'll probably replace that anyway so I'm not going to worry about that right now but let me commit this before we go on to the next thing and I'll do it on on this screen so you all can see especially if you're if you're new to get into the command line they'll give you a little bit of extra a little extra info about it I'll explain it as I go along so we're on a separate branch we're not on the master branch we're doing all this new stuff on the new resource UI branch so if you want to follow along in the in the repo on github that's the branch we're on so we're gonna do a get status just to make sure what's change okay occasionally you do a get status and you see something that's changed and you don't know why so I always like to do it unless I'm absolutely sure what's changed and it's only a minor thing I always want to check so resources component has changed the style sheet has changed and then I've added this material select component so that's good there's what that's expected so we can do get add and put a dot to add everything and you can see now everything's ready for me to add a commit message to and then I can take it commit and then if I put the M flag I can put my message right here if I leave out that flag and I just hit Enter when I hit get commit it will pull up whatever your preferred editor is which by default might be Nano but for me I think I set mine to be atom so then you would have to put in your message otherwise like that if you have a really long message that's probably the better way to go but this is faster if you have a short message so in this case mine would be mmm I don't think I've really done anything else that's that pretty much sums up what I've done I think we have an error oops so an it select it's not defined so what I need to do is just put in an exception so that it doesn't throw this error anymore so that's cool I'm glad it through that error because I don't think I ever explained live why I needed to make these exceptions okay so let me show you so up here I've needed to put this in so what I'm using some type of like an it function that I have here in my app is file I've done this it throws an error if I try to use it without putting this and so in it and it select so now we'll ignore the fact that this is not defined so there are better ways to do this as well this was kind of a workaround to get all my jQuery stuff to work now we'll try again it should work this time well that's alright so that works and I'm gonna push that right up to get it up immediately so y'all can see it if you want to and I'm gonna check in the live chat now since there's quite a bit going on in there and I don't want to get too far behind so next step I'm saying this out loud so I don't forget as well next step is going to be actually hooking this up so when he click one of these it actually works and it filters okay so the Nate says check out preact compact which I used it adds react compatibility layer for preact the only issue I face is with react transition group for which we can alias to our C CSS transition group okay so I did read a little bit about the preact contest so I saw that that's what you had had used but in the I guess it was in the package.json file I saw that so that's if you're just joining and you didn't hear at the beginning vinay had submitted a pull request that would shift everything over to preact which is a more lightweight kind of version of react and he's also added something so that it's compatible with what we've already done called pre at compat so vinay saying there's one issue so I'm not exactly sure with the with the issue is I mean Vinay it sounds like you know you have a handle on it just let me know is this an issue that should I wait on pushing this you know out to the live site to production or if should it be okay because I I have no experience at all with pre act so I'm relying relying on you on Vinay and all of you to fill me in on any potential pitfalls okay let's see hey zan is here hey Ben didn't notice I saw it yesterday I was and I saw you'd said goodbye and then I didn't even get to that part so sorry I did say goodbye on the video but I think you'd already gone but so a belated goodbye and hello nah okay all right now I see most of what was in the lab chat was still talking about code editors as usual okay I see now as Anna just said yesterday when I said I was sorry I meant sorry had a rough tough weekend you know what I am when I was driving home from work yesterday I it hit me that that's what you were talking about and I felt like an idiot because I had I just totally forgot sometimes it's it's hard it's hard to keep since I can't keep up with the live chat and code at the same time and I have to take breaks it frequently happens that I forget what I had said you know just a few minutes before and then you you were you all were responding to what I had said but I I just don't I don't get it because I don't remember so I don't really know the way around that because there's there's just usually a lot of activity in the live chat so I really can't I don't think I could do both I couldn't respond to every message as it came in in real time and still code so but I'll do my best to try to remember that but anyway thank you for that Anna I appreciate that I had we had we had a loss in a family over the weekend so yeah I was just pretty down about that and I think I didn't realize it yesterday but this morning I woke up I think I'm starting to get sick like a cold or something my throat's a bit swollen and it hurts so that might have been adding to it but it's just feeling you know a little weird and down like out I don't know if they were happy to you but I was literally like I was sitting here I was working yesterday morning you know writing some code and like I didn't know where it was just like I felt like I was gonna start crying and it just passed over me it was like five seconds and then I was I was okay but I was like man Leawood is going on I think it was just like the emotion of everything that happened like I just was really busy and it hadn't hit me until like that point and then it just all hit me at once and then I was okay but we'll see I'm actually gonna go see I go to a counselor once a month and just for some like minor depression and stuff but I see you later today so in a couple hours so maybe I'll bring it up and make sure I'm not going crazy or anything but anyway enough enough about my mental health sorry for the for the tangent okay we had a question so Viper I behave I'm not sure if or announce that I really sorry I I know I probably messed that up it's vai be hav says unemployed I stay at home all day how can I keep learning to code and build projects how can I be productive I would say if if the trouble is like just staying motivated to be productive try to find projects that you you really care about and then maybe that'll be extra motivation if it's something you can get excited about then I think it'll be a lot easier for you to keep going also this is somewhat I guess unrelated to coding but I found it's helped me out as well if I can get in a little bit of exercise you know every day I find that I just have more energy and motivation I'm much more likely to actually do something and sometimes I'll get a bit of exercise and a solution to some coding problem will come to me while I'm I'm exercising and so I don't I think there's something about the effect of exercise on the brain that helps you work through problems like that so if that's a possibility for you as well that would that could could help but I know it's tough I went through a period of being unemployed and then I've gone through when I was freelancing I've gone through periods of not really having you know clients or not a lot of clients you know and those are tough periods too to try to go through but you try to like set a schedule for yourself and try to be consistent you know that can help to set some goals but hopefully but you know keep keep me informed keep us informed maybe it would be good if you know occasionally if you can join us for the live chat and just let us know what you're working on everything then that might help as well that you know you might get excited about you know filling us in on what you're doing and if I see you if I remember and I see you in a live chat you know it in the future I'll ask you how things are going so you have a unique name I haven't seen anybody else of that name so hopefully I'll remember and I could ask you anyway hopefully that advice helps I'm sure you know people in the live chat have some great advice as well Court Court says in Russia computers have only two gigabytes hard disk that's crazy it's that serious as anybody else from Russia can you verify that because that sounds really really crazy I mean if you were like on a Chromebook in that cloud storage it that would be fine but yeah really crazy Jordan asks what packages do you use I don't know I use I have a lot of different packages so I don't know I can't really go through them now maybe I'll try to make a video on all the packages I'm using I guess I could while I'm going through some of the questions in the live chat I'll put up on the screen the packages I have I need to configure this but I won't do it on on the screen because that'd be kind of boring but if you want the style JSX tag to be highlighted properly there's a little bit of code you have to put in here so I'll need to find out where that code is and copy and paste that I think it's in the documentation for next j/s so if you wanted to use this to get better you know syntax highlighting and things and auto indentation just now you have to put that little bit of code in so let me show you here's here's just some of the packages I have I know this is a little bit small but if I make it bigger you won't be able to see as many so I'll leave this up here for now and I'll scroll down a bit in a few minutes that way you can see what I'm using the court court says no coding I want write code now is they are you meaning that I should quit talking and write code or what or you want to write kiss either way if you want to write code go ahead but I'll get to the code in just another minute there's not a lot left here in the in the live chat okay Sebastian said that yellow is unreadable at least in the stream is Hannah agrees yeah for sure that yellow I've had issues with that I actually found a slightly different shade of that yellow that works a lot better so I've used it in some other sites if you if you like if you convert the color from a hex color into like the H hlsa color or something I might have those in the wrong order the you can darken it right so you can keep basically the same color but darken it a bit and then it makes it much more readable but it doesn't really change the color that much so it appears to be the same color but it's just a lot more readable so I've switched to that color on my newer projects but I think the one that was still there was leftover and kind of like the base theme that I always use for university websites oh as Anna said I hate it when CSS is all over the place yes yes they'd say just it just happened you know at some point you just started getting so much CSS and if you don't like me if I just I didn't I just didn't stay on top of things and then I got out of control so I'll have to keep that in mind the next time I'm doing a project so that I'm more disciplined about my organization right off the bat okay Sebastian says you can import your CSS and the components you can make a CSS file per component so yeah Sebastian that's that's a better way to do it and that's what I'll if I have time I'll probably go that route the reason as I said that it was in one big component or one big file was because that that's how it was in the site that I I came over from so you just never got around to actually splitting it up okay Jeremy like said a couple things and then retracted and said never mind I got it so so glad you got it here on Evo or Ivo Ivo says hey James I've been following the live stream along for a little while and I understood that you have built a reactive website with WordPress as the backend and then Sebastian corrected as Jesse yes it's cool I know what you meant actually when you said that it reminded me of the characters from Pokemon just like the Team Rocket members once named Jesse and other ones James it's like my kids are really into Pokemon right now so that's immediately I thought of that so anyway to continue on Iowa says I'm really curious as to how this worked out for you and what the lessons you learned about this project my previous internship used to Drupal backend and its HTML engine so Zanna did explain he just uses the WordPress API to pull data out from another website that that is true yeah then he thought apologized for I getting the name wrong it don't worry about it it's not a big deal so anyway he said the solution with the Drupal engine usually involve writing custom JavaScript code which always overwrote each other and made a huge mess of the HTML as well as the application state yeah that sounds like a mess yeah so anyway legs Anna said since I'm not it I'm just taking the data that's entered into WordPress and I'm not using their templating system at all so that kind of eliminates a lot of the issues that I would if I was trying to work in to the actual like the templates I'm not sure what the terminology is in Drupal I haven't worked with Drupal that much so I'm like the terminology might be a bit different from Drupal WordPress but you know normally these templates are made in PHP and then they get rendered serverside with PHP and HTML if I was trying to use Java scripts or real react in particular with that I probably would have run into more issues but since I'm doing it this way and I'm basically just dealing with data coming in the form of JSON it makes it a lot easier so I actually am interested though and how you would potentially do the similar thing with Drupal because there are some sites connected with this site that I'm building that are built on Drupal so there's a learning management system that is that this site is going to direct people to and then they'll go and they'll sign up and it's like I think a yearly fee or something and they'll be able to take all these courses that system is built on Drupal and then there's another site that's a magazine that's associated with with this website and that site is built on Drupal as well so potentially if I could expose Drupal data through some sort of API I could pull it into this site as well that would be nice because the people entering in data wouldn't have to duplicate data so I'm interested in in that I don't have direct access to any of those Drupal sites like it to the backend so I couldn't implement anything but there's an outside company that that is building those so potentially you know they would have to set up the API and then I could use it but I assume that Drupal could do something similar to what the WordPress API does it'd be even better if it would use graph QL instead of a regular REST API but that would be ideal if you if you don't haven't heard of graph QL check it out it's GRA pH and then the letter Q and the letter L really really cool what's it's like I I suspect that it's gradually gonna take over a lot of things that use a REST API now we'll switch to graph QL but for right now there wasn't an easy way to do that with WordPress so that's why I just stuck with a normal API oh no Sebastian said apparently what I said about CSS doesn't work on next Jas oh I'll have to keep that in mind so splitting up things into like separate CSS files for components doesn't work so off to check that out more there's got to be some better way to do it also Sebastian mentioned by the way you're missing the border bottom in the first item from the list yeah I did I saw that let me let me switch back to here actually let me let me put up while I'm going through this I'm gonna put up the code all here I had the code on the screen what am I thinking I want to put this up here so you can see some of the stuff that Andrew did to change basically make the the search function a little bit better so it won't make so many API calls it works better with like the mobile virtual keyboard so you just kind of check this out now of course this also on the github page Sebastian says sorry to hear about that yeah I appreciate that thanks for saying as anna says we're humans not robots crying his natural yeah that's true that's sure it was just odd to have it happen like right in the middle of just just working just going more often and nature helps a lot actually that's a good idea I haven't spent that much time outside for a while I did go to the beach a couple weeks ago so I just went some time at the beach but that might not be a bad idea I actually have like my my house has a little over an acre of land around it and part of it is just like yeah it's just a bunch of trees and stuff so but I rarely get out and actually enjoy it I'm always you know coding or something so maybe I ought to just go out and walk around take the kids they'd probably like that okay Zanna had some advice for the vibe have which like I said I'm sure I'm probably mispronouncing your name if you want to try to explain how to pronounce your name I I will definitely try to pronounce it correctly from now on but anyway the advice is write emails for startups out there I'm sure you could find an internship the best way to learn is coding real stuff small tasks so anyway that's that's great advice I wouldn't never even thought about that of just emailing different companies for internships and stuff but that's a really good idea Jeremy says in the same boat but the live chat helps me a I'm really glad that this the live chat is helping helping you all I do I think the latch that is one of the best parts about about this that's why I take so much time to try to read out everything that I can in the live chat for the people who are watching later on because if the if the show was just me talking it wouldn't I mean it would not be nearly as good and helpful for people I think you all make it so much better okay yeah ratha asks can we watch this afterwards and Umberto's says yes the video is posted in about five minutes thanks for answering that I'm just reading it out loud for in case you know anybody else I imagine there might be some people watching this they can't look at the live chat for whatever reason maybe they're they're just listening to it and doing other things so I just wanted to read that out for those people Zanna recommends let's see following sites like remote okay or internships and found a startup cool so Zanna actually was able to find a startup for an internship so that's that's awesome so that's definitely really good advice so if you're in that same position you know just trying to get some experience and you know just doing doing side projects and things you know definitely try to get a hold of companies you like and get an internship I vote says I checked out graph QL before and it's really interesting would recommend it as well you pronounce my name is Eva okay awesome Dutch pronunciation is weird okay cool alright so I'll try to remember that so Evo that's that's actually fine and I used to teach Latin and in Latin in the the there's a couple of different ways you could pronounce Latin but in the pronunciation style that I used in my class you would pronounce an AI is e anyway so so that's not really that weird to me Sebastian says check out Gatsby Jas I've heard about Gatsby I haven't used it yet but it sounds really cool Jordan says there is a drupal plugin for a rest api awesome so that's cool so if I'll have off to remember so it shouldn't be too big of a deal then just to have this company install the plugin and set up a REST API if we need it that's awesome Zanna says I was on fever fiber not showed up for not fi ve or R for a while coded small small things for for peanuts especially CSS GS animations but I also learned a lot from that yeah cool I was on a similar site before too and that's kind of how it goes you don't really make a lot of money off the sites like that but you do get experience so if that's what you need then it's it's definitely I mean it's better than doing nothing right oh if I have says I did pronounce the name correctly so awesome Zanna said gave up on Fiverr because people are mostly asked me to copy things from other sites and didn't like that felt like stealing yeah that kind of stinks I mean I'm I'm all for getting inspiration from other sites but just straight copying I'm I don't I don't like that yeah I mean there's definitely a difference between you know learning from other people but and copying from other people okay Evo said in regard to the to the Drupal plugin the drupal rest api plugin check that out didn't really have that much time to investigate so I mean I'm assuming that it works in a similar manner to the WordPress plugin I mean at least in terms of getting the data you know rest the way data comes out of REST API is somewhat similar you know for most places okay Adam says thanks for taking time to share this appreciated oh I appreciate you saying that Thanks thanks for watching and contributing in the chat as how did you get started collaborating with free code camp I'd love to do some things with them with teaching angular so actually for free code camp stuff ayat I started live streaming on my own YouTube channel and I did a few streams and then Bo from free code camp who does all like the JavaScript tutorial stuff he I guess watch one of my videos so I posted in the free code camp forum and I just I wanted help for people to give me tips on like how to improve my stream so I explained what my idea was for the stream which was just to show people what my normal work day is like and I asked for advice and so I think he saw that that link in the forum watched one of the videos and then he asked me if I'd be interested in in doing some streams on free code camp and so I talked to Bo and I talked to Quincy just through email and I ended up doing some streams and they like the streams and so I I said well you know I'll stream here every day then if that's alright and they said yeah so so I'm streaming and I let them I let him know coincident bowbow that if they ever don't want me to stream any more to please let me know because I want to be helpful to people and if I'm not helpful and I don't want to waste waste of time on the chain but evidently they must be happy with with the streaming I think they are Quincy occasionally will drop into the live chat and he seems to be happy with with what's happening and told some people on Twitter over the weekend that I was doing a good job so so that was that's how it happened for me I kind of really didn't like I didn't imagine that that would happen at all so it was a very very nice surprise and enabled me to basically like instantly have an audience of people you know because freak I think my youtube channel has less than 500 subscribers and free code camps over seven hundred and seventy thousand definitely much better subscriber base here all right so anyway Adam if you want to do things with free code camp then I you know just reach out I would say reach out to Tabo or Quincy or both you reach out on Twitter or in the in the forum probably Twitter would be the most direct way to reach out and if you have any examples of videos or streams that you've done already then that would be cool to just say the get this out I'm interested and just see how it goes from there I can't really help you any more than that because I don't I don't really have any decisionmaking power within free code camp I just you know I I do my my little thing you know and and that's it I think that's kind of how it works everybody that volunteers with free code camp just kind of does their own little thing to help out and you know there are definitely some people with Quincy and everything that have more oversight over things but it's very much like kind of a decentralized thing you know there's a ton of meetups all over the world and things and this was very very decentralized Oh aim high is here hey how's it going so so aim high recently got a job so how's it going so far I am actually I was really excited about that because aim high will come in from time to time into the live chat and and give updates from even like in the the job hunting process and then it through the interviews and everything and then getting a job so I'm really excited excited about it alright so I'm gonna get back to coding because I just spent a really long time in the live chat so I see there's a couple more things that were just posted in the live chat so I'll get back to those in a minute I think this is these packages have been up on the screen long enough so I think I'm probably safe too I guess I'll leave them up for now so I don't forget about configuring this package but for now as I said the next step is going to be making this work so when you click one of these it actually does filter filter this out so let's let's just check out some of the filters that we already have because this is not going to be very different from what we're already doing actually oh did we already set this up yeah we did I can't believe I forgot that yeah I remember this now yeah because someone in the live chat had given some some code for this and I'm sorry I can't remember who it was I'm really sorry about that I really usually and in somewhat decent about remembering who contributed so really sorry I can't remember who contributed this little bit of code it wasn't a pull request it was just you know copy and pasted into the live chat but in any case so we do have some filter by category stuff going on and then we were just changing the state and then that is what we'll filter by so I don't know if we actually put the filter on though hold on a second let me see those resource category okay sorry we actually filtering sure thing here sorry I'm just trying to figure out what we did since I didn't remember that we did it okay alright so this okay alright so this category thing in the state is what actually populates that that select that dropdown this category is what is gonna the filters gonna be based on so this is gonna change so it's going to be not the category name but the category number so zero is gonna give us everything so let me go down and so when we do filter by category if it's zero see we return true for everything otherwise we're gonna return so I think I have some check in here for undefined that our return false otherwise it's actually gonna take the the category and return things with that actual category so so what we need to do now is take that select input and we want to make it so that every time something changes with that input it changes States this is going to be a cool thing to demonstrate right because I don't think we've done this yet at least in the stream so what we're gonna do to this input exists in another component so it's not gonna be as straightforward as it normally is you know we we can't just you know call this function you know right here so what we're gonna need to do is actually we're gonna make a we're gonna make a function that sets the state to whatever the value is of this and that function is going to live here right because this state is needs to be in this component right because this state is gonna change things you know on this page so first things first let's let's make that but then we're going to pass that that function as a prop to here and then we can do our on change to get the value here and on the change what's going to happen is we're going to call that function and we're going to pass in the value into that function and that's going to make it actually run the function here change the state here and resources and then a state change is going to trigger a rerender and then that's gonna be what filters everything hopefully that made sense if it didn't make sense when I explained it it will probably make more sense when I actually do it so first thing we're gonna do let's put this we'll put it by the filter so keep them together a bit let's say set cast category that works alright so I'm gonna be set category and we're gonna pass in category number just can't abbreviate that as cat num and let's basically all we're gonna do then is go this set state and we're gonna take category and we want to set it equal to cat none and that's that's it this is going to be just really simple so now we need to go down to here we have material select so let's go okay so I think that's how we need to do this if this ends up not working I actually just did this on a project I'm doing for the Udacity course that I'm taking so I can double check it on there because I've had to do this a few times for that project but I think that's that should work so now this will get passed as a prop so in here it's gonna select input and actually I gotta remember how to get a value from a select input because I haven't done that in a long time so on my other screen I just looked up how to get the value and the first page I went to it's not great so let's go to stack overflow everybody's giving jQuery answers I don't want jQuery answers actually I kind of wanna see where's my select input okay the values are there it's correct so I want to select something it's that selected all right so just straight up value does not work I guess I will have to look it up I thought I might get lucky and just try it maybe you have to see which one is selected can't believe I'm getting stuck on something so simple I know I've done this before plenty of times maybe stuff okay well in jQuery is dot Val which is not gonna help me that much because I don't want to use jQuery let me try to find it what it is using just JavaScript it looks like it might just be valued hmm let's just try it with value then all right so on the select input we're going to do an on change and we're gonna say on change and let me see actually I really I think I do want to see how I did this on my other project so let me bring it over it's probably worth worth sharing so anyway so this is my no this isn't mine this is Bill's where's mine sorry bill if you didn't want your project on on YouTube I thought I had mine up somewhere all right so this is when and I'm pretty sure I did it with this there we go that's what I was I was looking for this syntax here okay so looking for then I could probably shorten this to E save a bit and I don't need the first part and when I was doing it before that was a stateless functional component so I need to add this props to this one breath work and what did we call it we called it set category all right so this cross target value okay so let's check it out we'll save that and then I'm also gonna add into this function a good old console just to see what we're getting in case it doesn't work we'll see what we're getting right away so let's test it out nothing happened all right let's see maybe I just didn't refresh it's possible with my I guess it's not hmm I'll show one more time okay so that's its not being triggered so our own change event is not triggering anything so we need actually let me look at this project again because I'm pretty sure I have a select drop down in the project so it says here I'm Bo yeah this is a select on change okay I see what's happening all right let's try chimes knocking I'm thinking okay this I added this in for another reason so this is irrelevant for what we're doing now so on change this should work let's check out how I pulled it in though in the main the main component here so I move book there we go so I pulled it in here so it's being pulled in as shelf yeah it looks like it's work it's working in here all right let's check out let's check this out again and see what's going on okay so and maybe it's just something silly like I misspelled something okay so we have set category so on change we're gonna get the value right let's let's just take this out for a second and see if we can get a console out of this nope not getting anything no nothing okay I'm gonna go to the live chat because it's possible that some of you have already figured out what my problem is and I've been foolishly ignoring the left all right so I'm gonna scroll up to about the time when I first started having the problem I see there's some questions in here I will I will come back and get to the questions as soon as we get this working well so I'm just kind of scanning through to see and someone says Jay says there's a grandma in Japan as 86 years old and learned how to develop an app that's awesome as Anna said she lived in Japan for two years that's awesome I would love to live in Japan I'm a big fan of sushi and ramen and it would be amazing to go there because there are so many places to get sushi and ramen where I live you can't buy ramen anywhere like at a restaurant they just don't have it I have to drive into Pittsburgh to find a ramen place and even in Pittsburgh there's there's not many places you can go to get it with sushi there are like two sushi restaurants near where I live but they're not like they're not really good I mean it's okay it doesn't taste bad but it would it would be cool I like the color Japanese culture as well there's a lot of cool things about it okay so it looks like there's a lot of awesome conversation going on the live chat but not exactly related to my problem so let's get back to the research so I'm actually gonna bring over I usually don't do research on this screen but I'm going to now so let's say say I want to think now if I've gotten the value from a select input in one of my previous projects aside from the one I just checked I think I have but let's see if it's all right cool so evidently this is Wow sorry I just saw this on the side here anybody looking for a chub seeing yourself we're developer 130,000 to 150,000 dollars a year and you can work remote that sounds like a great deal ellaby that's like so much more than I make right now I can't even imagine what that would be like okay let's see this said state yeah this is pretty much what we're doing we're getting the target value we have unchanged all right let me check the code again is it seems like we're doing what you know I'm doing pretty much the same thing and another site that I worked on earlier this week and it worked and it's also pretty much the same thing that we just saw in the stack overflow page there so what is the problem oh I want to check one thing where's my so I want to check how I pass this okay is this the problem in yeah I think this is the problem all right so there's definitely a difference in how I pass this in so that's that makes sense this is the only thing I really haven't checked over yet so let's find that material select so so I would I did that kind of fast so I'm not sure if anybody caught it but you'll see it now so basically I was just passing in you know this function like that but that isn't how I did it in my other project that that works so this is what I need to do now is get what I'm what I'm passing here is by a second call whatever I won out what was i calling it and then i call this and set category okay so this this makes more sense as to how it was working I don't know what I was thinking earlier so yeah so this will then and should work maybe I'm still a little worried though that even our console.log didn't work but let's take this out and that set it to what we had it at before and make sure I save it in both places and now let's give it a try okay not working let me check out I want to check out what state is nice and not showing me where status I guess I can check out what the props are at least mmm okay I'm gonna check the live chat again okay it looks like Oliver is put something in here this is the category and all of this process a category you've copied it's from a savings component oh good catch good catch I see let me see is this set category and not this prop set category you've copied from a stateless component ok she's saying this actually this should be right this should be this props category so the other the other component I use was a stateless functional component so it was just this set category but in this case I need to have this props correct so I don't think I read the comment out loud so sorry the the the comment was talking about the difference between using this set category versus this props set category so on my my other example here I used I guess I had clicked every but on my other example I had a stateless functional component so I just had to do props set category right yeah so at this point the only change that I can think of the alien is different that's really different between these are the fact that there's some other stuff going on here it's not just a normal select input so maybe what I need to look up is so maybe hey all right there's a github issue for this okay so someone else using the T realize wants to get the value okay but all these these examples using jQuery I don't want to use jQuery also it's it's a different alright I'll take one more and then we'll try something try a few things yes alright materialized CSS with react Jas let's see what's going on here okay so there was an answer but I'm not sure whether or not it worked it says no votes wasn't selected the this is pretty much the exact situation that we have but this is a little little odd so it's saying to put a wrapper around it all and then track this change event inside component did mount I don't know any any thoughts on this method I'm not really sure that this is really the best way to go I mean if it works it works but it seems to me like there's got to be a more straightforward way of doing it I'm gonna check the live chat again cuz I think I have asked a few questions and then never checked looks like we now have a slack channel that's cool so so if I have created a slack channel its FCC pair programming dot slack calm so that's pretty cool we also have a channel an IRC channel on freenode and it's hashtag FCC Jessie so FCC J esse so we have that actually I haven't logged into the channel for for a little while I have to remember I kind of forgotten to login okay I'm Barry toe said maybe it's time to restart the server so that's actually a good idea it has happened in the past that I couldn't figure out what is going on and then I restart the server and somehow it works this it's worth a shot oh well not working alright now this I'm gonna run through every line and I'm gonna look at every line and just just to say maybe that the weird thing is is I'm not I didn't see any error messages I mean any new error messages but let me read them okay so I usually get a lot having unique key prop okay I probably should give the key prop okay so this is a warning related to the value on the select option so it's possible that that is messing something up these are just related to using localhost out there so let's let me see this resource drive I thought I had added a key but I guess I didn't I guess I'll have to pass in I get it doesn't really matter there's no way that that is messing up what I'm doing now but I wouldn't need to put a key a unique key on there and I'll just use the ID the WordPress ID but for now let's check this out again so let me look the I guess I could test and see if something is messing it up because we're changing it with jQuery so I could stop initializing it and then let's refresh so it's gonna be invisible for now so I'm gonna have to change it manually so this select is gonna set the displaynone so we'll just kind of manually get rid of that we'll check out okay so it's still not happening so it's probably not due to to what's going on since it's still not working the other thing I can check out is the actual data see the key value let me remove this because we were getting in a a warning related to that and we could so let me initialize this again okay so didn't do anything except to change so that choose the categories and displayed right away hmm look at this again yes Wow I'm really surprised I didn't think it was going to be this difficult to just get the value from this let me check out okay so patrick has pasted in a link to a github issue so let's see go check it out I'm I'll bring it over so okay cool so this is the on change event for select is not propagated yeah this actually thanks Patrick this seems like this could be exactly our problem is that nothing's happening for that on change event even when we just wanted a simple console.log we didn't get anything so this is probably what's happening here is the the on change event is not it's not find others it's probably firing but it's just not registering at all alright so I do want to check out I'll change this okay let's go down a bit then to this it's always good when you go through an issue in github whichever one has the most cool emojis is probably the best answer if you only remember one thing from today's stream remember that just look for all the emojis okay well let's try it this is actually somewhat similar to that other stackoverflow thing that I saw it was using component did mount so just gonna scroll through really quick to see if there's something with even more emojis okay the only thing I don't like about this still using jQuery wait a second okay so anyway I read this in which it seems like this is similar to what they're saying is basically like a container around it should work so I guess I guess we could we can at least test it out to see if it would work so the first thing I'm going to test out basically I know the same put it in a component did mount and then binding this but based on the other thing that I read I'm it's possible that if we wrap this in a div that we could get an event to fire based on that that div unless I'm reading this wrong which is possible because at this point it's starting to get a bit frustrating okay yeah that seems like what it's saying so this is just going to be really simple for now just seeing if I can get an event to fire Hey we get to fire once okay so we got one change what we get do we get another one let's see no we just got one but yep one change come on all right so that's not gonna help us okay let me I'm gonna check the lap chat again cuz now I'm starting to see some other things here set the value on the Select element T Anderson's has set the value and see oh yeah Patrick says I can just replace the jQuery with the document get element by ID yeah that's that's true resin wants someone to say hi hi Reza okay and Oliver says try just simply passing the function name this props a category changes yeah actually I kind of want to try this now because I don't think we ever tried it with just the console long and nothing else see if we can get a get a response okay once again we're just getting one shoot looks like we've gotten one too so again too sweet hey Fabien sir how's it goin Fabian all right I will have to see ya whether or not we get it working I'll have to stop with the coding and do some questionandanswer here and maybe I don't like 15 minutes so we'll try and get this working so anyway so let me let me just go back to the the github issue on react and let's just try try some of this stuff okay uh I see that's a good answer just youth use a different thing looks like the link does not work I was just looking I was wondering what because obviously we're not using a function name handle select change okay yeah I'm doing all right baby and I'm just stuck on something that should be easy and in fact something that I have working on another site that I got working just a few days ago and for some reason it's not working here all right so let's yeah let me I want to go back to what we had before I've changed a lot of stuff so I'm gonna start just want to start from the beginning of where we had it oops I don't want to get that far back okay alright so this is what we initially started with okay and see yeah Patrick says men should the the on change didn't even fire at all was just calling it console logon load yeah so that it wasn't really wasn't really helping so it was probably we was probably calling it twice because what's the data came in and everything rearended then it got caught again okay so we're gonna try Patrick's advices let's replace replace the dis props with console.log e and see what's going on okay we'll see I may not since it wasn't even firing I'm not even sure what we're gonna get let me refresh and let's change no not getting anything dang it I accidentally clicked on a link now my my dev server is frozen okay and I actually well I had to remove that earlier than it came back when we went back everything so okay so let's check out its inspect it all right I got it I gotta get go out in the hallway for a second so just give me an update I'm sorry many people yeah there's definitely a chunk of it that I couldn't eat off and everything would still look like it's finished so if I have to write yeah just make sure I want to make sure you are aware of that because the 17th possible starts and I don't know what they're going to be doing there show and tell but I know that they are so whatever you don't then you got two days when you get back to see what you can publish so the main thing is it'll be I have things sorted out so like here it's okay I just want to remind you like I just did the exact same thing a few days ago okay sorry for the interruption there but that was the head of my department so kind of had to take that because that was my my boss's boss's boss so I really couldn't leave her waiting and she was actually asking about the site that I'm working on right now and reminding me that once the 20th comes I am done with his site no matter what so to make sure that whatever state it's in on the 20th is is reasonable and you know it'll look like it's a finished site which I don't think she'd be a problem it looks like it's a finished site right now at least the version that's live so if I have to leave something off I'll probably leave off the the news section that's supposed to function like a blog because right now there's not really a lot of content and so that's probably the section that's the least amount of content so it would I guess be okay if we left it off so anyway I'm gonna check the live chat quickly just to see what I missed for the few minutes that I was gone and okay looks like I didn't really miss there was some conversation but not directly related to our issue tell you what here's what I'm gonna do it occurred to me that this is actually kind of like really weird so our issue was related to this being materialized framework right I mean that's what we were thinking and that's what we're looking at but when I didn't initialize it as a materialized input we still had an issue so if that's the case then maybe the issue is not maybe there's a like two issues potentially maybe there's another issue so I'm gonna try this again let's do this and let me remove this class of input field because it's possible that materialized is picking up on that class our options I think everything else was fine and let's try this out now and see if we get anything the only other thing I could think of is potentially it's a problem that all of these options are being added in after the fact and we could certainly test that out easily by hardcoding some options and seeing if that's if that's the case if it is the case all these options then maybe we have to put something to fix that in component it update but for now let's just try this now it shouldn't have done that it should have there we go actually let me put oops I need to so since materialized by default puts displaynone on select inputs I'm gonna display block and then that way I don't have to keep building that all right so here's display let's change it up and see alright so let me bring this over so we have and I've so much stuff let me do this again so we can just get a more clean looking setup here okay so look we've gotten something right which is better than what we had before if if it comes down to it I'm fine with just doing a bit of styling on this I'm not I'm not tied down to using the materialized input I've actually I've been unable to use the material i style input on a few other projects that I had and I've been able to style it in such a way that it looks decent not quite as polished there's the materialized input so that's that's fine then we can I can definitely change it also I'm wondering if so basically what's happening is on this select input materialised it's just changing what you see into a list right and then making that list behave basically I could drop down potentially if you wanted to keep that same style all we would have to do is instead of having a select input we just made a list and just had click and it looks like you know when you clicked on a certain thing on the list then it it updated I'd rather not have to go through all that but those are two alternatives that I'm thinking of to just completely bypass all of this stuff so at this point I'm I'm convinced now upon seeing that upon saying that this actually is working when I have materialized disabled then it's definitely materialized ok see and then we got a value so we got the value we want so here's what I'm going to do I'm gonna put back in here what we were originally going to have which I guess was let's just go back to get what we had before okay so that's what we have before and then I'm just gonna add this one again I'm gonna take this out and leave that off just for now I'll probably just completely remove everything but when we do this hopefully we'll get we can get the filtering working and check oh what just happened they are reps oops wait a second so I oops left off a bracket there we go okay so let's try it now come on she's too oh yes it's actually not shoot it's stillit's console logging and we got rid of our console log right we still eat that one in here you know what we might not actually be using this filter off the check so this must be the console oh that's actually working resources yeah so it's coming from the resource page so that's the console log it's working it should be setting the state correctly let's go down to where our filters are okay yeah maybe we don't have a filter for that so let's do that I don't want to filter so I'm gonna filter and actually what it sorry I forgot what I called that actually I had the price that where did I put the price filter in sorry gonna figure this out what the heck so my price filter is not working either I had the price filter working before what did I do that's really odd okay filter by category I need to put in I think that's how I do it I had all my my windows hurt out of the order I want them to be in there we go just don't know what I called it I hope bunny did it it needs to be this sorry about that this dots all right it did something not exactly I wanted it something happen oh that not exactly what we wanted but it's better than nothing okay I think I'm just gonna have to stop for now and figure this out tomorrow because I do have an appointment at 500 that I'll have to leave for soon and I want to get to your questions so just to try to wrap up somewhat as much as I can here the plan is basically to not use the material as input and instead just to style the input a bit so that it looks it looks good as good as you can or potentially make some type of custom dropdown thing and then it would it would look similar to this input but would in fact be a list also figure out what's going on with this filtering it's obviously it's doing something but not exactly what we wanted to do so I'll just have to go through and try some things out I'm gonna think what else that's about it I mean probably if I can get that done the search works these work so basically just getting these two done it'll be functional completely functional in terms of what we want it to do could probably use a bit of polishing up the UI but it'll do what we want it to do so this is really close to being functionally ready so I'll need to check I also want to check to make sure that the posts actually are linked up with the categories I expect that they are but I just want to double check it's not that because if it's the case that we have categories but they're not linked to posts then that would explain why we're getting nothing here it wouldn't explain why they're not showing back up when I click all but anyway so that's the plan so I'll fairly work on that tomorrow or maybe tonight I'm kind of thinking I'm gonna have to put in some work on this at night to get it to where it needs to be anyway so let me go back I'm gonna go back to the lodge that I know there's a ton of stuff in here so I'm gonna try to get through as much as I can before I have to leave so if you do have a question you could put it in there now I'll try to get to it if I happen to not get to it you can message me on Twitter the links in the description or you can put it in the comments for this video or you could just wait til tomorrow and ask me then okay I'm scrolling through these I'm going pretty quick so I can get to the question so it's possible I might miss a question so I'm sorry if I miss miss any questions okay suit sumit had a question about a contact list in an app the web app that they're building so I'm not sure it wasn't us assume it if you're still here you're still listening I need a bit more info if you want to send me a link if you have liked your project on github or something then I could check it out but I'm not sure I could give you a good answer you know just from you know the info that that could be put in and the live chat it pretty better if I could see the code so you can message me direct message me on Twitter and I'll get I'll check it out okay cool Gino says I've signed up today I assume sign up for a free code camp and in two hours I finished the HTML and CSS tomorrow bootstrap King that's awesome that's really cool all right so aim high yeah sorry I asked you a question about your job and then I I got sidetracked with with the the coding and so I didn't read your answers I'm sorry about that but here's the answer so aim high got a job recently and we're all really excited so it says first week has been brilliant working on a project with 30 million users every month team of four developers that's awesome that's that's really really cool yeah congratulations on that name House is loving it so really happy for you that sounds great thirty million users a month that's a lot that's that's amazing Janus is FF developer IDI edited on good for coding I'm not I'm not really sure what that is so I'm sorry I'm saying if you're still around you could explain a bit more I'm just not understanding the question do you know ask what do I need to learn to be a frontend web dev if you're already going through the free code camp stuff if you just keep going through the free code camp frontend thing that'll teach you a lot I definitely work on some projects you know as you pick up skills because you'll need you know you'll need to know how to do your own projects and setup things like that so I would for now at least be starting out you know free code camp will be a great start for you and that's aim high gave similar advice also a nice says go on to dribble and try to convert complex designs into code using HTML CSS that's really good advice I like that Oh John John said Google developer tools has a way to see all unused CSS rules in each page makes it quick to find this content cool yeah I actually I used that when it was on Chrome Canary and it was really cool at that point I don't think it was ready but now it's it's in chrome like the the normal version of Chrome so I have to use it haven't used in a while but that's a that's a great idea Eva said just heads up that chrome tool is did cause cause some trouble before searching for it all right so I'm gonna skip I gotta go in just a few minutes so I'm gonna unfortunately I'm gonna have to skip a lot of just like the comments in the live chat but I will be able to hopefully answer any questions okay Sebastian has a question about an app that he's building about updating state so Sebastian if you want to send me a link if you have it on github and can share I'd be happy to check it out Gino asks what types of code I need to learn to be frontend web dev got some answers in live chat which are good but just for everyone else that's watching that maybe you can't see the live chat if you're watching later on HTML CSS JavaScript if you only learn those you can build web apps frontend and backend if you want to branch out and you know what you want the specifically like you could pick up PHP if you know if that's where you want to go into WordPress is built with PHP Drupal Joomla so it kind of depends on where you want to go but if you're not sure what exactly you want to do yet within frontend web development and I should say if you want to just just stick the frontend you really don't need a backend language like PHP but HTML CSS javascript is you you'll be solid if you really focus on that okay we had some discussions about languages and different things to learn Sebastian said he had to go like an hour ago so he didn't hear any of my responses so maybe he'll be able to catch the the recording if I have asked this free code camp have backend dev streams actually right now I think I'm the only live coding stream on free code camp but we might get some some new people we're talking on Twitter so I can set up Twitter with a few other people who are interested and maybe like being on this stream and like adding some commentary and talking and then Quincy joined in and offered to say you know they could they could come on and actually do their own stream if they wanted to so that's possible I don't know nothing's been said officially yet but it's possible that could be coming mrs. hoese Anna's comment sushi is nowhere quite like in Japan yeah that's what I've heard I'd really love like a while back I was talking about sushi so it's in it was in response to that now I really want some sushi you know I'm thinking about it all right almost to the bottom of the live chat it's not not a really a whole lot of questions today a lot of activity in the chat which is awesome oh yes the question says almost everyone can learn frontend development for free what do you think will web developing sphere become overcrowded Zanna says no there'll be more jobs than coders that's yeah there's definitely way more jobs than coders right now and it doesn't look like that's gonna change anytime soon so I wouldn't worry about that because you can learn to code for free but that it doesn't guarantee that there's quality coders you know you know people who are really dedicated and and you know work hard at it will be the good ones and get the jobs and the so I think in terms of to me I think it's more important to think of like people who are quality coders who really can do the jobs not just necessarily people who say hey it's free to learn how to code I can learn be you know because as long as as long as there's a shortage of quality coders who really know what they're doing they'll always be jobs out there because you know just because you can go out for free and learn what to do you won't necessarily get a job unless you actually are decent so in that sense you know I don't think the markets gonna get flooded with with so many coders just because it's free to learn and Jeremy says in LA I mean Los Angeles there's plenty of companies looking for frontend as cool all cool and rejoining hander Oh Andrew be balanced is working great thanks so much I am I talked about it at the beginning of the show like super helpful it was really impressed with that cool Andrew says but too big react Redux courses from udemy for twenty dollars so that's a great day that's cool keep keep us updated on how the courses are and if they're good then you know let us know this might be a good good investment for learning reacts okay cool so I've gotten to the end of the live chat and unfortunately I have to go but I hate to leave this unfinished and I know I did skip over a lot of good conversation in the chat but I'll be back tomorrow and hopefully this problem will be solved by the time I stream tomorrow and I'll I'll let you know how it went and how I ended up solving it and so I guess you have probably same time tomorrow I don't think I have any meetings or anything thanks so much for all your help in the chat today and for for helping so many people who you know came in newer people who had questions they're just so much good advice and I really really appreciate that also thanks for creating the slack Channel so that's cool yeah if somebody yeah off to remember to put a check out the slack Channel and put a link in it's FCC pair programming slack com so if if you're interested check that out but I'm gonna I gotta go now I got a hurry up and go to my appointment and thunderstorm outside so uh I should probably leave a bit early and anyway I'll see everyone tomorrow and have a great day
