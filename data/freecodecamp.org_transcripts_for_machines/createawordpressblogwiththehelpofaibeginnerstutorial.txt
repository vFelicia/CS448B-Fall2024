if you're looking for a guide to making a professional blog website with the help of AI you're in the right place I'm Bo KS with free code camped in this comprehensive course I'll walk you through the steps to create your own WordPress blog even if you're a complete beginner I'll also show you how you can easily use AI to help with things like logo design and writing articles AI can help you create content for your site much quicker WordPress is a free tool you can use to make a wide variety of websites and what you learn in this course will help you even if you don't want to make a Blog there's no coding whatsoever in the course you are going to create everything using a simple graphical interface I'm going to show you how to do the initial setup how to easily customize the site with templates how to create content quickly with AI and all the other things you need to know to use WordPress first I'm going to show you how to get your domain and hosting the primary expense is web hosting but everything else from the domain name to the WordPress platform and website templates is free while you usually have to pay for a domain many providers such as hostinger offer a free domain with certain hosting plans for those new to the blogging World think of the domain name as your website's address similar to youtube.com or freec camp.org web hosting on the other hand is like the land where you build a house it's where your website will live online it's where everything is stored well actually get the domain and hosting at the same place hostinger provided free Campa Grant to make this course possible and we'll use hostinger to get the domain name and hosting we'll be using them to create a managed WordPress website they offer premium features at an affordable price such as 247 customer support a free CDN a malware scanner and more I've actually used them in the past for my personal websites before we got this Grant and they make it super simple to set up a WordPress website but just you know almost everything I teach in this course will work with other hosting providers as well so go to hosting.com use the link in the description to get a better deal than you would normally get so let's see how to create a WordPress website with the help of AI now hostinger has a lot of builtin AI tools that makes things easier you can also use other AI tools such as chat gbt or Dolly but having it all everything included within hosting or just makes things a little simpler so we can see with this there's a few different plans you can choose from I would recommend the business plan because that is the one that's going to give you the WordPress AI tools we're not going to get that with the basic the Premium plan so I'm just going to go through and add this to cart and you can choose your period so the more months you buy at a time the cheaper it's going to be or you can just do a one month period if you just want to try it out I usually recommend doing at least 24 months when I'm going to create my own websites but it's up to you you may just want it for one month just to see how it works so we're just going to either log in or create our account and I've already bought my hosting plan so I'm not going to go through this right now but this is what you would have to do you're going to choose your payment method and then put all that in and then you're just going to do submit secure payment so after you get logged in or possibly during the account creation process you're going to have to claim a domain or get a domain you may already have a domain from another website you can use hostinger whether you purchase your domain name through hostinger or through another domain registr so I'm going to choose my domain now it could take a while to find a domain name that's not already taken but I was already doing some searching on what domain names are available and I'm going to go with python on playbook so hopefully this is still available yep I'm going to claim that domain you're going to have to put in contact information when you create a domain and some hosting providers will automatically hide that information from people that are searching it up some won't in hostinger all domains are going to have free who is privacy protection so that's nice um if you don't have that then all the contact information you put in when you're getting your domain will be available for anybody to see and you're going to get a bunch of calls and emails of people trying to sell you things for your new new domain and you probably don't want that so that's what's pretty cool about hostinger is that you get the free privacy protection so I'm just going to go to finish registration there's different ways to get into the hosting um I'm going to go to um skip because we're going to go back to home and I'm going to set up the business web hosting now depending on how you create your account there could be different ways to get into this setup so I'm going to be creating a Blog that's going to teach quick python tips and different just small nuggets of of knowledge of how to program in Python mainly because I have a lot of knowledge in that area so I might as well share the knowledge with others and I can easily use AI to help me create this content quickly so I'm going going to just go through this I'm going to create a website and here you're going to have to choose if you want to create a website WordPress with AI or the hosting or website builder now the hosting website builder is best for absolute beginners and the WordPress with the AI is still good for beginners but but it's going to be slight it's going to give you slightly more features which means it's going to be slightly more complicated and you're going to have a little more power over your website and it's better for people to have a little a little more knowledge so the hosting website builder uses customizable templates to simplify the website building process and they're all premade website designs that include images layouts and texts and then WordPress is is going to use themes alter the web appearance and the theme is a package of premade templates website elements and customization tools so we want to have a little more control so we're going to do WordPress with AI but if you want it to be even simpler you can click website the hosting or website builder so create with WordPress and then you're going to want to create a password that it's going to this email and password will be used to log into the WordPress account so you have one set of login details for hostinger and another set of login details for the WordPress account and I'm going to choose a Blog now everything I'm talking about in this tutorial will be relevant to creating an online store as well so you can also choose that if you want the online store so now we're choosing between prebuilt templates or standard themes it's pretty selfexplanatory the prebuilt templat is going to have things more already created for you and the standard themes are you're going to have to customize it a little more so if you're really into customizing to standard themes we're going to go with prebuilt templates to simplify the process and get our blog running as quick as possible so I'm going to choose one of these templates now again we can go back to standard themes if we want to have a little more flexibility and we can also preview these like I'm going to preview this one and you can see it's powered by Astro which is a common WordPress theme or template now since I'm making a website about python tips and python tutorials I think it's more similar to this child care blog there's not going to be videos but uh just how a childcare blog would have different lots of different blog posts about raising children this one's going to have a lot of different blog posts teaching how to work with python so I'm going to select this and then I'm just trying to make this as quick and easy as possible so you can either select all the plugins you want manually or use the preselected plugins so I'm just going to use the preselected plugins we can also always change these later if we want and this is where the AI is going to start helping us do you want to generate blog content with AI we just have to enter some information about the website and the description and the AI will start generating original content tailored for us and here's my description welcome to python Playbook your goto spot for diving into the world of Python Programming with a Twist of humor whether you're just starting out or looking to brush up on your skills our blog makes learning python not only easy but entertaining we break down complex Concepts into simple digestible analogies and sprinkle in a healthy dose of laughs to keep things light and fun so I won't keep bring the rest but the more details you add the better and the more the AI will have to work with when creating the content so I'm just going to go with next and then we select the domain name and we can select where we're going to be based out of I think there'll be a lot of people the there's actually more people in the United States on the left side of the United States or the the west side so I'm going to go with Arizona okay after the website's created we'll be put into this dashboard and so so let's just do some basic things first so let's preview the website I'll actually click on this to open up the website in a new tab and you can see it's using the child care theme that we chose now obviously we're going to be going through and updating this in a moment here but if we go to blog you can see that we already have some blog entries now it's going to give us the child care examples and then the python examples now these all look to be about the same these aren't exactly what we want for articles these articles are going to introduce people to the website welcome to python Playbook and then you can see it gives information about what the website's going to be about and later I'll show you how to use AI to create some more blog entries so I'm going to close that for now and before we start customizing the website I'm going to set up the free email after the email is set up we can click manage and then we can choose the email plan I'm just going to go with the free one and then we choose our email address and our password and then create and then we can access the email through the browser or actually apps on our computer the simplest is just using our browser and then I can click webmail and now I can email people through this or I can receive emails right to this email address and there's also a way to set it up to forward to a different account if you don't want to use this web interface and if you want to check all of your emails from the same account but that's beyond the scope of this tutorial so I'm just going to close this because I'm not going to write an email right now and I'll click complete and we also want to make sure the DKI is set up correctly this can it says right here prevent spoofing and fishing and makes emails less likely to be marked as spam so I just go to generate here and then it says to verify the DKI record add this txt record to your DNS Zone it can take up to six hours for the verification to be finished so what I'm going to do I'm going to keep this page open and I'm going to open a new tab with hosting and then manage the hosting and actually I'm supposed to be on domains domains and then manage the domain and then go to DNS name servers and here is where I'm going to add a record so I'm going to go to txt and then for the name that's the host so I'm going to copy that and paste in this name and then for the txt value is going to be this second one and I'll paste that into here and then I'll just push add record okay so we added this record here and I can just go and say I have added the dkim record in my DNS zone now that will just make our emails be less likely to be marked as spam when we send from this email address okay let's go back to our websites and then manage and then we're back to the admin panel here and so we can also make change on some other things like the backups um you can see there's other things we can do on this main page here but we really want to go to the WordPress admin panel that's where we're going to go to make all of our changes now WordPress on hostinger is very similar to Wordpress on a lot of other hosting providers so like I said earlier you can follow along even if you're not using hostinger hostinger just provides some AI tools that are going to make things a little simpler so we're going to start by just going through the steps here we're going to start by creating a logo and hostinger has this really cool AI logo maker to make things even easier so I'm going to go to the AI logo maker and then I'll get logged in and you can see we default with one credit to make a logo but you can also buy more if you want more logos or you can create your logo using a different tool you don't have to use the AI logo maker so I said just logo for blog with quick Python programming tutorials and you can choose the style that you want want I'm going to stay on abstract and see what happens so we can use one of these or just create our own so we also have the ability to edit the logo we can download so I'm going to download this one and the editing that you can do within this program is kind of limited but you can also always just bring in these Graphics into your own image editor if you want to make it more detailed so I can just close this tab and then it's going to show how we can finish uploading our logo okay now we just have to go to the customize page and upload the logo so we'll go to take me there and then we'll go to site identity and then site title and Logo settings and then I'll just select the logo I actually made a different logo and didn't use the AI options we were seeing earlier so I'll just hit select okay so it's like the python logo and it kind of has the Playbook like a a sports Playbook on there so I thought that was kind of cool okay and I also want to use a site icon this is what's going to appear right uh in the right in the browser next at the very top there's always an icon next to the name here so I'm going to select the icon and it says suggested 512 x 512 pixels which is actually what this logo already is 512 x 512 so I'll select that and then now you can see already right in the top here so that's pretty cool and now we're going to go through and just update the design so it fits more with what we want and then I will show you how to use the AI to make more blog entries so first I'm going to go into Global here and we can change all these different settings so I could change the typography I'm going to keep the typography the same but I do want to change the colors so right now we see the this blue blue purple black gray white and you can see everything uses those colors so um this color this wiish is actually here and then we have the colors of the text and if we see these buttons that blue in this buttons when I hover over view all articles is the same blue right here so I'm going to go through and change this to some different colors that align with my brand better so we could go through and select one of these presets here but I'm going to manually change the color here and I want this green that's in the logo I want that to be the accent and the links so I'll just click here and then if I scroll down I can actually enter a hex value right here so I'm going to paste the color hex value I got from my image editing software and then I can change this to be the same one and then I'll also change this color up here so any time I see this blue I'll change that okay now if I scroll down we can see that we're using we're seeing the Green in the different part of the page now I still have to figure out sometimes the color the changing the colors will be in different spots you'll see when I hover over this it becomes blue when I hover over this becomes green I don't want to become blue when I hover over I want to become dark green something you just have to kind of mess around a little bit cuz it's not immediately obvious which color goes to which thing but I see this blue here so I'm going to first put on my hex value and then I'm just going to use this to make it a little darker just like that okay and now when I hover over the button it goes to dark green instead of dark blue great now I'm going to change a few more things I see these a see these lines here um I see it's the same color this so I'm going to change color seven this time I'm just going to change it myself I kind of want it to be um a yellowish color maybe a little lighter than that okay so now we have these lines are yellow so you can just go around and experiment until you change the colors of everything that you want to change and the rest of the colors look good this you can still see the blue right here but that's just an image that we can change so first before I go out of this I want to hit publish and then I can hit X to go out of this screen here and if I refresh we should be able to see the changes so we can see what the page looks like with those changes okay I'm going to go back into customize now and then if we go into the global section we can still change a few more things like if we go into buttons we can change what the buttons looks like you can see it brings in the colors from before that's pretty nice but for the most part I like all the button stuff so you can go through and and change global settings but we're going to come back over here you can go through and change things in any of these categories we're going to go we're going to go into more of those in a little bit but let's see how we can change our main page here so right now we're just customizing the look of things we cannot actually customize the text on here so I'm just going to hit publish to make sure it saves everything I've done I can hit X here and now before we we're on customize but now we're going to go to edit page so you can see it takes us into this other editor here welcome to the block editor and it just talks about how each section is a different block of content and then you can basically edit different blocks however you want and you should look at the Block Library see what you can add okay so what we're going to do is just start making some changes here so instead of Welcome to bua I just can just double click and I could really change anything I could change the font the text size anything like that but I'm just going to change the text to python Playbook since we want the site to have funny entertaining posts we're going to use a slogan python made playful and again if we want to change anything we could like we can make it bold italic we can copy the format and there's all sorts of different ways we can change what the text looks like now for some of the texts on the page we're going to try using the ask AI feature now there's different types of AI that we'll be talking about some of the AI is created right from hostinger this is a different service that you can use but we're just going to get signed up for for this with 1,000 free credits okay I just created an account really quick and I just have to connect it and we can see we have we've used zero of 1,000 usages so let me come back over here let me just refresh to make sure it loads now that we've logged into the other website to save it I'm going to click update and then I'll refresh here okay I'm going to hit ask ask AI here and you can see we also have ask AI down here this is for when you want to ask questions about WordPress or we can click ask AI here if we want to help make text uh fix grammar change tone make larger make shorter write a one sentence description on my blog where post short humorous python tutorials and we can use this or we can just click refresh and we'll try writing it one more time okay I'm just click use this and now it replaces the text with this new text now let's just keep scrolling down and see what else we want to change well are we could actually change put some new logos here of where we've been featured but we haven't been featured anywhere so I'm going to actually take out this whole section so I'm going to click in here and then I'm going going to go to delete so we delete that section going to delete this section and we don't need a contact page right now so I can delete this section okay and the only other thing to fix in here is this background image so this background image obviously does not go with our website so to change this image you're going to make sure the the setting tab is open here and then you can kind of just go around to see different things you want to change well we're going to change the image but you can also change different things such as the the position you can change the width of things the minimum height how high actually I'm going to make it so it's not quite as high and for the width go to about there but let's go and change the image so I'm just going to click change image so I'm just going to upload a new file here and this is a file I just made for the website I basically made a hello world program that was as complicated as possible and then I'm going to use that as kind of uh an image that's going to be in the corner there so I can specify the alt text so I'm going to do hello world and then I'll select that okay so now um it just has this hello world I I made this curve here so it kind of be similar to the other image uh it looks like you can you can see this like we could change the size the color of this text or we could change this green if it was going to be hard to read but I think people will be able to read that so since this is mainly a Blog I mean we could make a section that talks about me the creator of the blog but I'll just skip that so I'm going to delete this whole block so you can see when you move your mouse around you can see a blue line that goes around whatever section you're on so I want to go onto this section you can see the blue line on the corner here and then I can go to delete right under this we have featured articles which we want to keep and then Learn Python quickly instead of Articles I'm actually going to call these tutorials and then where it says view all articles I'm going to change this to tutorial so these articles we will update later so if you keep scrolling down we can see see where's this child care topics the child care block if you see these blue Lin inside this other bigger block and the other bigger block also has um what they say and it has meet the experts so these are all things we can update it's very easy to update like if I wanted to update this expert with a different picture I could just go to replace upload and then just bring in a picture of me here and it would be easy to just update this name bo KS and then the social media links you may not want all of them like I could delete this one so pretty much all of this stuff can be edited but I am just going to remove this section because I don't want any of this so I'm going to go to delete but let's say we wanted to add a new section I'm going to get to this stuff down here in a second so if I want to add a new section I'm going to go up here it says toggle block inserter and then we're going to decide what type of block we want to add so I'm going to add a container go down to the bottom we can see what we decide what layout we want so I'm going to do this this layout that has the three different sections and then we can add a block to each of these sections like for instance maybe I want to add a map in the first section so the first section could be a map and then and then the second section go to browse all again let's say we want a video and the final section let's say we just want an image so each of these things we added we can customize and you can see over on the side we we can change like we can change the zoom we can change the height we can select the address like I can say so now we're the map is of Los Angeles California and I could zoom in further on there and then for YouTube I can just put the URL to embed a video and it's a WordPress tutorial that I created and then for image it's just like before you can upload or choose an image from the media library I'm just going to choose this one that's already in there so basically with adding different blocks you can customize the page how you like but I'm just going to actually delete the this whole thing I don't need this and I am going to update the page and we're just going to see what the page looks like for now so go to view page oh we can see there are some things on the page that we didn't see before because we edit those in a different place um but we can go down we see featured tutorials Learn Python quickly now later we're going to update those with the and then we also have some things that we still have to get to to learn how to update like the subscribe to our newsletter and some of the stuff we still have to update the logo there So eventually we're going to get to using the AI to write some articles for us but let's work on updating this menu here changing this button right here and then also updating the footer so first let's look at the header so first let's just see what's we have here so we have the blog which we do need to update we have the babies Tab and the sensory Play tab and both these just have the same article here and then we have the contact page so for our website we just want the home we want blog but want that to be called articles and then we want the contact page we don't need these other Pages for what we're trying to do later if we want to add a section for different types of programming languages we can so I'm going to go back to the dashboard and this is could be the first time we're seeing the homepage of the dashboard and some of these things we can get rid of like we'll just dismiss some of these things and then what remember we're trying to update the header so I'm going to go to appearance and then menus so to update this top menu I'm going to go back to customize and then if I scroll down we have menus and then we see there's a few different menus but I'm going to go to the header menu and see it says home blog baby sensory play contact that's all we have up here well I'm going to to get rid of some of these so sensory play I'll remove babies I'll remove and then blog we're going to change this to articles okay so now we have home articles contact and then to get rid of this appointment button I'm going to go to header Builder and then it has the all the elements in the header and you can actually see it right down here so we have the site title and logo we have the primary menu and we have the button over here so I can just click remove element to remove that button okay now just click publish and then we have that done I'm going to go down to the bottom and let's update this stuff we do want a newsletter so I'm just going to click this edit button and will take us right to what we want to change here and it's this section is called the above footer so there's a few different sections we can see them down here so this copyright section that's right here this where it says Power by Pyon Playbook that's this and then we can see all these widgets here are in this footer right here and then this top one right here is this this widget right here so I'm just going to click edit so I'm going to click this settings button and then here's where I can make some changes so I'm going to say get python tips in your email so if I select this form and go to show more settings we can see more information about the form so once you submit it it's going to say the form has been submitted successfully and you can change what it says you can change what the error message is there's just a bunch of things you can change on it and then later we'll see where we where all the information comes in but we got that how we want it and now let's update some of these things well this add widget add widget um we don't need any extra widgets right now so we'll remove those and we do want to change this logo here so I clicked where it says hl1 now this logo I'm just going to delete it and now I can insert an image and I can resize it it's just going to say the best place to Learn Python and as I think about this I just want this stuff to be in the middle I'm going to make sure to Center this I'm going to remove this widget and then I can just move this to the middle and then move the social tags to the middle and then we could just do some modifications like we can change I can change the YouTube url I can change the Twitter URL and then I can just delete anything that I don't want okay then final thing I forgot to change the background for this subscribe to our newsletter cuz these colors are not the colors we're using so to moove this background and to change it I'm going to click the edit here go to design background remove the image I'm actually going to set it to a color a gradient okay I'm going to click publish and then let's see what the website looks like no for some reason it didn't save the text here so let's go to footer widget one looks good so let's see how to create articles I'm going have to go back to the dashboard and then if I go to posts I can see all the posts we currently have and I'm just going to delete most of these except one that is the one that we create with AI to describe what the website is like so I'll just do bulk action move to trash and apply why so now if we go back here to the Articles and if I refresh we should just see one article and if you go read more see the whole thing but we want to create a few more articles so there's a few ways to do it on this page I could click new post or on the post page I can do add new post post so I can create the title and then I would just start typing the post here and then I could add blocks I can add images or anything like that this is how you create the post if you're going to Rite it yourself but if you want to use the AI tools to to write it I'm going I can going to leave this page and go to the main admin dashboard and then I'm going to hover over hope hostinger and then AI content creator and here we can create as much AI content as we want earlier I was showing you Spectra and this only gives you a certain number of credits and then you have to buy more but with the hosting or AI content creator it's actually separate you can make as many as you want so we can either create a post that's like the article or a page a page is like the homepage the contact page page or a page is generally something that's a permanent main part of your website a post is like an article or blog post so I'm going to use a witty tone length I'll say long it says usually use to make high ranked articles that will generate more leads and then what your contact about this article is about the basics of the Python programming language and I can do keywords or the AI can automatically generate the keyword suggestion so I'll just click generate content okay so this will create an AI generated image for the article and we can either set it as the featured image as we can set the featured image as home and we can either set this as the featured image as a thumbnail or insert the image inside the content I'm going to set as the thumbnail and then it basically gives an article about python the basics of python and so it's going to give some of the history of python some reasons why to Learn Python and down here uh it gives a bold list of all the different reasons to Learn Python and then getting started with python talks about installing python setting up an IDE writing it first program object oriented programming so this has a lot of features in this article so I'm just going to click publish so let's create a few more articles about python so go back to the dashboard hostinger AI content creator and this time I'm going to say it's a it's going to be a funny article a humorous tutorial about if statements in Python okay that's an interesting uh photo but we'll go with it the Wacky World of if statements a hilariously informative python Journey now one thing about some AI generated articles is that there are certain words that will really give it away that's AI generated two of them are in this first sentence I've never seen them so close together but delve and intricacies articles that use the word delve and intri intricacies a lot uh it's generally give away that it's AI generated but one thing cool is that the code even is kind of like in a code block here and overall actually this article is pretty good it's giving a lot of different examples and this time I'm going to edit it as a draft instead of publishing it so I'm just going to call it the Wacky World of if statements and then I'm going to say before we talk about if statements now it's my own article kind of it's it's at least not so obvious right away that it's AI generated okay before I publish this one I'll actually talk about this you've probably seen this at the bottom of all the pages and articles this is all stuff to help with SEO so it's going to show what it's going to look like in a search engine and then you can make changes to what the post title is going to be so this title you can see right here the it has the post title the separator was is this Dash and then the site title Python playbook.com and then for The Meta description um that's what's right here it's just going to be an excerpt from the post if you don't want this post excerpt we can just say an article about if statements and you can see how it it changes right up here and then there's just some different things about SEO like this is going to just give you some some tips for improving SEO we need we should have a longer metad description that's I mean this is pretty short here so we could make that longer there's no internal links so we may want to add links there's no external links so we may want to add external links and all that will make things better and readability we see that there's not a lot of images or videos it's uses a lot of passive voice and that doesn't have good subheading distribution so we could go through and update those if we want better SEO but for now I'm just going to publish the article and then we click publish here and let's just make a few more articles so I'm going to go to the AI content creator again and this time I'm going to create a short post because one of the ideas behind our blog are is short articles about python write a humorous tutorial about variables in Python okay the AI generated image is the same so I guess it may be AI Chosen and not actually generated but it's still a pretty good image for the article and one thing you can do if you look at it and it's not exactly what you want you can make some changes so I'm going to say with a lot of code examples okay this is a lot better and I like that there's some code examples so I'm just going to publish this and we'll do one more write a humorous tutorial about loops in Python with many code examples and I'll edit this so I can insert another image just so all the images are not the same so one thing that we can do to get a new image is go to open media library and go to free images and now I can just type in coding and you see it's powered by pixabay so we can use any of these images from pixabay and save and insert now this may not be the best image because it's actually not python but we'll just use this for now and then I can hit publish so let's check out the Articles page I added a few extra articles so we can see we have a list of Articles and then if we click in to one we can read the rest of the tutorial so this is looking pretty good so we can see it has the recent post and the categories well pretty much all of these are going to be programming for the category but they do all have different tags so if we go back over to the dashboard let me show you how we can see the tags we're going to go to posts and we're going to go to all posts and you can see that a lot of these have tags that were automatically created by the AI system so instead of showing categories there on the side of the post page let's make it show tags since we have a lot of different tags here I'm going to go back to this page and then I'm going to click customize okay now I'm going to hit this edit button here and you can see there's this category section I'm going to go into this category section and I'm going to delete the list of categories and I'm going to hit the plus button and search for tags I'm going to do a tag cloud and then this word categories I'll just put tags okay now we can see we have this tag Cloud instead of the categories and there's tags for different articles that we have so I'm going to hit publish and we can try that out if I click polymorphism we'll see the articles with polymorphism if I click python we'll see the articles with python which are basically going to be most of them or we can just see all of the Articles now another thing we want to do is go back to the homepage and update so these feature tutorials are actually real tutorials and then we want this view all tutorials to go to the article page so I'm going to edit this page and I'm going to go to this button here and we're going to change this link to the link of this page which right now is python Playbook SL blog but we actually want it to be articles instead of it calling blog we want to do articles so let's first change this URL so it will be python playbook.com / articles and then we will change this link to be the Articles page so let's go back to the dashboard and we'll go to pages and then we have this blog page so I'm going to click edit so there's two places we need to change to make this tutorial so first I'm going to change where it says blog here I'm going change this to tutorials and then where it says URL I'm going to click this button and then type in tutorials okay now I can update this and then let's just uh go back to the page to test it out so if I click articles it's going to go to the tutorials and we can see tutorials here oh yeah we do want this to be the word art tutorials instead of Articles and I know I changed this to articles before but now I realize the menu should say tutorial s so header Builder and then we have the primary menu let's see oh wait here it is header and then articles and this is going to be tutorials so we had change it to articles but sometimes as you're building your page you'll change your mind and then you can easily just make the changes so I'll publish that okay we're getting close to being done with this page but let's make sure the contact page works and then we also want to make sure the subscribe to our newsletter works so let's go to the contact page so I've been kind of zooming in and zooming out so we can see better but we can see even at the 100% zoom level the word contact is still on two different lines and a lot of this this stuff needs to be changed so let's I'll zoom in a little bit and I'm going to go to edit edit page okay first I'm going to make this font a little smaller there's a few ways to do that but I'm just going to change it to an H3 tag or I'll do h2 tag instead of H1 contact us if you want your tutorials to appear on our site we're going to have an email address but we are not going to have a phone number so let me just delete the phone number section and then for the email address remember we made a custom email which is just bow at python playbook.com I'm going to make this so it's a little smaller I I have to select the text and then I have to make sure go to open this content Tab and then I'm going to click P so these social buttons are actually social share buttons they're they're the wrong type of social share buttons these are the buttons that will try to share this page on social media it's not going to link to our social media accounts so to make sure that these can link to our social media accounts we're actually going to have to delete this whole section and we're going to add another social section so this is going to be social icons and we're going to add Twitter I'll select parent and then I can press the plus and then I can do another one I'm going to do a YouTube and then here is where we're going to put the address so I'll put my Twitter and then for the YouTube okay and then the final thing is we want to change this background so we can go to style here and then I'm going to go to change image I'm going to use this image that we're using on the other page and just see how that looks and and all we can change how it's positioned if we want I'll leave that all the same okay now I'm going to go to the send a message form so if I click on this form and I go to the send message form the send message button we can go to actions here and then we can enter an email address to receive the submissions so it defaults to the site email address but just to make sure I'm going to put B at python on playbook.com this we can select what the subject is and we can also if we want to change different things like if we want to instead of calling this subject we could say what is this about and we can add different form Fields by clicking this form button and then click plus and then we can say oh we also want to have a check box box and then you could have someone check if they're contacting to say hi if they're contacting to submit a tutorial or whatever you want to add to the for the text box but I'm going to delete this for now we don't need a text box we'll just leave this how it is okay I'm going to click update and there's one more thing we have to set up to get emails to work we're going going to go to SMTP here and then we're going to install and activate WP mail SMTP this is going to improve email deliverability to make sure the emails go through so let's open the setup Wizard and get started here and then we have to choose the mailer we're going to choose Bravo because it's free so it's it's good option and we'll just go through the setup process here and after we get brao set up we need to get the API key so if we just go back to our setup page on WordPress and click follow this link to get the API C and then we just need to generate a new API key which you can basically name anything you want and then we copy the key paste in here and then the sending domain is just going to be our website and we can update the email of who the emails will come from and then save and continue and then I'll save and continue again and we can skip some of these steps and now we're basically done so let's go back to the contact page and try it out I'll put in my information here and send the message now I'll pop over to my email and if I refresh yep there it is the form submission and you can see the form comes right into my email it works so now let's make sure this subscribe to our newsletter form works so basically we have to make sure that when someone puts an their email address here in here and clicks sub subscribe the email address gets sent to the right place currently it's set up to just email you their email address and then you can add it to the list to make sure that this gets sent to the right place there's two ways you can go about it all forms automatically get sent to the default email address for your website so if that's correct then you don't have to do anything let me show you how you can check that I'm going to go to settings and then General and then we go down here and we can see the administrative email address I'm going to change this I'm going to change this to B python playbook.com okay then I can save changes and then I'll just have to verify that okay so now if someone signs up for the email list you'll get an email here there's one other way to update the email address um if you want this to be sent to a different email address we'll go back to our admin panel and then I have to go to appearance widgets the newsletter thing is actually a widget it's actually the footer Builder widget one so I will go to this is what appears there you can see it a get python tips in your email I'm going to just basically click into this form here I have to make sure that I'm not just clicked on the email address section but I'm clicked on the whole form and you can see this is the form and then I'll just scroll down to actions and then you can put any email address you want here so if you put a different email address you'll get the form submissions to that email address so just to make sure it's correct I'm going to put the email address here again and then we'll update and now I'll try this out I'll subscribe and see if this gets sent to my other email so if I refresh here and form submission okay now we've collected the email address that we can add to our email list now we kind of got sidetracked but on this main page we want to update these featured tutorials here so they aren't just these random things that don't actually exist so let's finish updating that so normally at the top here there will be an edit page bar like if I click tutorials I can see it sometimes it won't show up on the homepage and then you can just get to the editing page right from the admin section so I'm going to go to pages and go to all pages here it allows us to get to quickly to get to any of the pages so with have the contact page the homepage privacy policy tutorials I'm going to go right into the homepage and click edit and then we can see these the problem with these is they're not going to automatically update basically we have to manually update what these featured tutorials are so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put in a new block here and I'm going to go to browse all and you can kind of go down until you see what you want but what we're looking for is the post grid so I'm add this post grid and I can now remove these posts down here so I click here and let's see I'm going to go to delete and now we have this post grid right now it's showing six 1 2 3 four five six it it defaults to six but we're going to change that I'm going go to General and then I'm going to do three so it would be just kind of like how it was before and there's a bunch of other settings you can change you can change how it's going to be ordered uh you can change the number of columns and all these sorts of other things but we're going to just stick with changing the post per page and you can see it's only going to show three posts here and I'm going to click update okay we can see the three posts and then we can go into one of the tutorials click read more and we can go right into it here and there's one more thing we're going to change this view all tutorials let's see where this button goes to it currently just has a a pound sign or a number hash sign so that means it's going to the page we're already on we actually want to go to the tutorials page so we're just going to put slash tutorials and I'll update that now there's a few other things you may want to change like removing or updating this but I think you've learned enough to finish the rest by yourself so now we've learned the basic of creating a blog or an article website using WordPress and AI well that's it you now know how to create and launch a Blog using Wordpress if you've been following along you can continue to customize your blog as much as you want good luck on your blogging Journey
