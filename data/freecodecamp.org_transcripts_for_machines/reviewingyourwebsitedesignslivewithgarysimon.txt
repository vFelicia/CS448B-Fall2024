everybody we're going to get started momentarily and you could say hi in the chat which i have on the screen here i'll be the first to say hi okay i guess i wasn't hello ali and like i mentioned in case you're just filtering in we're gonna get started here in a minute or two hello quincy founder of free code camp emery hello muhammad sudeep i i'm just i'm terrible at these names all right here they come craig mullins with a verified check mark hello everybody hello hello hello all right so while everybody's getting filtered in um i will go ahead and start the introduction first i'm gary simon i've been a ui ux designer and frontend developer for the last 20plus years i've been an instructor in teaching for the last 10 years and this is the third of the three streams that we've had scheduled uh for myself to stream a live ui ux review show here at free code camp on the youtube channel so perhaps we'll do this again sometime in the future but basically what we're doing is you are submitting your ui designs and i'm reviewing them live here all right so i already have a few picked out but you do that on twitter and you just use the hashtag live ui ux review and i may get you to yours i may not but still there's value even if i don't get to yours because a lot of people make the same mistakes and we can all learn from from each other of course um and so this is uh just a real quick plug uh designcourse.com i'm going to be we're actively working on this and it's going to be the most comprehensive that's my goal at least the most comprehensive service for learning ui ux design um so that's coming in several months time if you want to be notified when that's i released go ahead and enter your email here at designcourse.com and then secondly my youtube channel i right here it's design course it's linked here in the youtube description of this video um so yeah let's go ahead and get started so here's one that i chose this is a levi landing page with gsap all right so if you people don't know what gsap is gsap is an acronym for the green sock animation platform it allows you to do uh more complex animations rather than just using something like straight up css animations um so notice how everything comes in sequentially gsap makes this very easy to do in the front end development process it's javascript library it's very powerful i have several courses on it on my own youtube channel so you can definitely check that out to learn how to do this sort of thing so this is a a nice design overall a there's nothing i can't scroll a lot of this doesn't work so kind of what you see is what you get here um and in terms of the ui design itself i really like it um it's it's unique it's interesting um i don't think see anything that really is coming out as being uh negative with this one um it's using some modern ui design techniques like uh having kind of like this vertical bar over here um the whole circular navigation up here assuming this were ever to be finished so yeah i i like it i can't really say anything negative for what it is so also as a part of these live streams i do um i ask everybody watching here in the youtube chat to give it a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best you have about 15 seconds and then we'll see if i agree with you or not so go ahead and do that one being the worst 10 being the best consider the ui design any ux potential issues you see and factor that into your result somebody's already given it a 10 no he said eight well let's see if this is responsive first of all we could check that out no not quite just kind of made it for desktop should always learn css first and then try to use gsap for your animation purposes okay i'm going to go ahead i'm going to give this one for what it is a straight up 8.1 yeah there we go all right i think it's pretty solid okay next one i have picked out all right so sort of a cool loading animation we saw here let's refresh that very cool um the thing that i notice right off the bat that is an issue is the lack of white space or the too much white space here so this isn't necessarily a white space issue it's an alignment issue this block right here which is comprised of this headline this sub headline and this call to action should all be pushed down considerably so when i say that we're going to give this like a margin top of i don't know 5 m units there we go so now we have almost an equal amount of white space from the top and bottom and now it looks in it's it's quite a bit better i would also probably make this right here a little bit less width um maybe put in on the next line right here that way it gives it a little bit more white space between this element and this element i really like the uh illustration here it being animated like this uh so this makes sense has like you little skeleton ui windows so it's always a good idea to use illustrations that are relevant based on the purpose of the landing page and the surface itself um let's okay up here we have a light and dark mode i kind of don't like this one because you're not sure which one is cho is really chosen yeah this is light version obviously but it should be a little bit more obvious like this should be filled in here perhaps already by default and sometimes to me i wasn't even sure what this was at a glance i thought it was like a chocolate chip cookie but just the moon but look checking this out anyhow this is pretty good um just for how everything reacts when you're switching from light to dark all right coming down one thing i do want to say is this this section right here this container because it's a very very subtle difference from this white to this very light desaturated sort of blue i think it's not enough contrast i think we needed to just maybe a little bit make that a tad bit darker so you can see it's almost white up here in the color picker so if we come down just a little bit i think that's better so now we can clearly see the separation of these two you know this this section up here which is traditionally called the hero section and then this section right here so i would say the same thing about this section over here same color you'd want to change it to up here so you have a more of a distinction between these containers so if i refresh it you'll see the original and it just kind of makes it a little bit harder to see the card and this section being separated itself this i really like this section right here um everything is is i aligned correctly there's a good white space the topography is good there's a good visual hierarchy which is reinforced by the fact that you know your different pieces of type are um changed and they're separated with each other to create that hierarchy through uh the font weight through the font size and contrast between these elements so those three things will really give you good topography if you understand how to apply them so and this is all pretty solid i like the icons they're simple this here again you could probably on it on a large viewport like this put in three or four of these um in a different columns so three instead of just having two because that really makes them really large i'd probably put at least three when you're out here in the larger viewports but other than that this is all solid i like the the type inside we're using labels on your forum that's excellent you should always have a contact form on your site don't just put your email address like a mail to link or something i always have a form that people can contact you with but i would also say always give them a way to email that you if they wish instead of using your form so offer both you want to give them as many ways to contact you as possible this is solid though so i what do you think this person should get for a rating for their portfolio one being the worst 10 the best i think the biggest issue was just this area right here too much white space get that centered here vertically oh we got a chat thank you for that which goes to free code camp one being the worst 10 mean the best get your answers in is another high higher rated entry for sure so for me i'm going to go ahead and give this one and 8.3 or so i i notice so there's a lot of eights there's a lot of nines there's some sevens so yeah pretty pretty solid quincy says seven he wasn't as impressed okay all right next up is going to be an adobe xd prototype all right so what we have here is digital marketing agency um there's several areas that we can click one thing just about the topography i like the colors um this seems to be a good font size this is the mont cigarette type of uh font family which i know because i use forever and i still use um i think a little bit more line height it's a little bit scrunched up in my opinion um so i would increase the line height just a bit um outside of that pretty solid uh call to action here so adobe xd has the ability to animate on hover um i'm not sure if i would increase the size of these honestly on hover but uh nonetheless your alignment's good you notice you're in the the very first link the home nav uh defines a column here and then right along this column is the rest of this content and that that creates a nice uniform consistent layout it just makes it look better um one thing i don't like is that me our team button the the gray the mid gray right here it's very hard to to use mid gray effectively in the ui design um in this button here being blue it doesn't contrast very well so i would change this color to to something else you could either go light i probably wouldn't make it this blue color because then it competes uh for your your primary call to action so i would use maybe a really dark maybe very you know almost as dark as this for the background here next up looking at this area this area it's designed well like the cards it has good white space inside however it's a little bit confusing um because you've chosen to emphasize a few over the others and i'm not sure if that's necessarily what you wanted to do um so sometimes also i don't know what these little dots are for it almost makes me think like there might be some sort of weird inner navigation within this this card so it's kind of confusing um but i would probably opt just to style them all the same unless there's some type of reason that you want to emphasize one or the other over the other next up this is this right here is pretty solid and this is kind of quite bordery or lining if you will you could probably either drop the uh significantly on the border you know making it just a very dark gray or you could get rid of the border entirely and make the background of this card i just a little like a shade lighter than the background um that way it won't feel like so many lines it's fine here because you really want to emphasize this middle one but it becomes a little bit cluttered in my opinion with the extra borders and always make sure you're using labels so if you're these look like they would be placeholder values and you don't want to rely on those make sure they're floating good call to action here and yeah again same comments about this this mid gray all right what do you think this person should get rated one being the worst and 10 being the best you have about 15 seconds to get your answers in the font family for that one was monsterat which you can download that that's available for you google fonts i've been hitting the gym hard so i'm like i need to stretch i'm like very sore right now oh we got a lot of ratings that came in all the way all right so for me um based on what i see here it's it's overall this part's a little bit cluttered and misaligned um but overall it's pretty decent there's no significant issues here so i'm going to rate this uh like a 6.9 maybe even a 7 or so i think that's pretty fair based on what i've rated the other ones all right so let's do yet another one so we've been looking at some pretty decent uh entries up to this point so far um this one needs some work though a little bit more than the other ones so why do i say that well first of all the first issue that i notice here is alignment all right so we have this logo right here in the logo by the way there's too much type in that logo i'm not sure whoever created this if you have control over the logo which you might not because you're a ui or designer or you're a friend of developer whatever um there's just i would have it refactored there's just too much type occurring here outside of that though it creates a a a column here and it in in also in and of itself if we're just going to take a look at the nav bar which is which is the logo plus this navigation right here navigation is completely fluid all the way to the right of the browser and then this is just kind of pushed over like randomly if it's going to be really fluid then this should be pushed over all the way over here as well to create that nice symmetry um but one thing so we have that issue but then the next issue is you have this column defined by all the type right here so it's thrown off in a couple of different ways the best way to deal with this is to take this logo put it right here and then also take this navigation and put it the contact us should probably end right here and so it would go like this length and then if you're kind of worried about the navigation being a little bit too close at that point to the logo because it'll be moved here and this will be moved in the middle um you could expand the width of this this fixed container that's centered here at this resolution or this this eye viewport all right after that there's not a ton of contrast with this red and this background you can read it but when you get to this this area is pretty fine because it's dark but when you get over here to this table or whatever it is it it there's not you could have more contrast this could even possibly be white the way to fix that is multiple ways changing the color of the type on top like making it completely white or further taking this photograph and making it darker there's an issue also with your call to actions so we have three different buttons in this area call us send us a message in free estimate that are all designed in the same exact manner so that's a lack of visual hierarchy the free estimate button is probably going to be the one that's most important and the one that you want people to to click on so every every page should have a goal of some sort and this one clearly it would probably be to free us to get a free estimate also a free estimate i'm not sure what that entails verse call us i guess this is just the phone number and then to send us a message so if you want to have these buttons here make style them differently it's so that they don't catch as much attention from the eye that this one does this one should this is what you want people to use so style these differently i wouldn't use red as a background for these there's a lot of different ways you can do it to have secondary call to actions and also this kind of seems just misplaced i would place these maybe underneath the free estimate or to the right of the free estimate button outside of that this part's pretty decent right here in the middle there's nothing really a hundred percent wrong uh happening at basically for the most part everywhere else whenever you have two columns like this here's the left column and here's the right column i prefer to not center text that's in the right or left maybe just left align these elements and that way you really define this this this uh column right here outside of that that is it and it's uh there's just a few small things that could improve it what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the very best quincy asked i've heard the right number of call to actions is always one are there exceptions to that i think it depends on what you may define as a call to action so um if there should always be at least a primary call to action and if we're talking primary then by nature we're talking one so yes you'd be correct um in this case uh we we have a lot of secondary sort of call to actions if you will or you know areas that people could actually leave um and in that case they should be not styled as prominently as that primary one if that makes sense so for this one i'm going to go ahead and give this i mean there's not a lot of like horrible things happening here so for me i'm going to give this one like a a 6.2 or so once he's uh says 5.5 i think he's just a little bit we're pretty much consistent in in our ratings though a little bit lower than what i'm writing all right i oh there we go 47roofconstruction.com all right so this this layout to me it feels dated it's uh it's like back in 2013 2014 2015 these are the type of like layouts that i saw often um it has the logo here and has like these little areas where you can have you know the access to to call the people there's also the address um we have a very standard um hero section with the centered area here and my dog is barking down there um having said that i guess you could you can maybe take a little bit of a point away just because it's dated however the things that we need to be most certain of is that the ui in the ux is working well so in that case i can't really say there's anything too wrong sorry my voice is cracking up about what i see here request a complimentary inspection today that's a good headline get in touch i would probably bold up the white because this green versus this white text you lose a little bit of contrast there so i might use it maybe a slightly darker green or bold up and make it a little bit larger this getting touch button where does a get in touch button do um is there a contact page unfortunately it's kind of a slow loading right now and it's not secure maybe this isn't live yet i'm not sure one of one of here's a tip if you ever want to increase your leads and this would be considered a lead if somebody contacts you using this contact form i would and you only have a few or a small amount of fields that you're requesting there's one of two things you could do you could just take this feel free to contact us page and you could put this in a right column and then left align this in the left column that way it's one less click that people have to to to to to do in order to get in touch with you uh especially if you have a server that this is being hosted on that's kind of slow because that took too much too long way too long to get to that page so you're gonna reduce your your bounce rate you're going to increase your amount of leads and the other way to approach it is maybe just if you have more fields than you're comfortable with putting you know in your hero section of the landing page then maybe just put one or two and then it will just take them to the next one because they're already invested i in filling out all the the information outside of that about us maybe a little bit more white space here we are insurance experts contact us yeah i mean this is all it's all pretty solid here i don't see anything that's that's coming out and just being completely wrong with exception to this area because they're only placeholder values we want to make this accessible so make sure you use the labels as always all right so one being the worst ten being the best what do you think this person should get for a rating some people are saying five five three i'm going to go ahead and say let's see let's see if at least if it's working responsibly and it is yeah so for me oh we agree this time i'm going to say maybe around 6.5 to like a 6.8 or maybe even close to a seven now that i think about it yeah so pretty solid here all right um next up this is like an english learning app of some sort um it's a yeah english leading course center all right um by the way like if it's a template there's no way for me to know if it's a template or not um so i always just make the assumption that it's not a template um so okay first thing i think is a little strange is this this little settings cog like what does that do theme color oh interesting okay so they let you choose the theme here which on a landing page i'm not too certain makes that much sense to be honest with you um random background right bullet i mean it's cool to showcase that you can do this and you know how but i'm not sure if it makes sense on the landing page um the biggest issue here though when i check this out is the headline and the sub headline they're just really i they're they're boring in my opinion um this needs to be enlarged a lot especially in this viewport you know this right here i'm not the size is 2m i mean you could bump that up to like 6m uh or 5m units and that way it's already so much better so look at this scale so this is an issue of a ui design fundamental called scale the size of things it doesn't necessarily have to pertain just to type it could be anything but if i refresh this oh not cool you know so beef that size up considerably this is also lacking a call to action um you know at the very least if you want to tell people to scroll down go ahead and do that these up here i wouldn't call these really any any sorts of a primary call to action so same thing with this over here just kind of gets lost sometimes it's not immediately identifiable so you want to give somebody you know an area where you know they need to click and where they have to click that's up to you and that's a ux concern where is it that you want them to land first so just this is quite a long about us section i at the very least if you're going to keep all this text maybe use um two different paragraphs because it's kind of like a wall of text so peop people don't like reading that um this is these cards you gotta scrap those um in what by i mean scrap i mean you need to change up the design uh the borders plus the thick uh drop shadow makes it look amateur and dated so i mean i'll guarantee you right now i can fix these up the box shadow get rid of that so there we go we've already simplified it much more you add these back and it just looks cheesy so you don't need that um you could where's the border at um trying to find the border i'm not sure where the border property is defined here oh there it is if we get rid of that then we can use this box shadow but it's still the box shadow is still too strong you want to take the opacity which is at point 76 um drop it down a lot like 0.2 and then we could probably increase um the blur reverse spread that's better that's a better take so there's when it comes to design ui design as well you know you have a certain amount of subjectivity or in other words personal preferences um so this is one way to take it but what one way i would not take it is this the original i'm not sure why this is you know really emphasized there otherwise if you if you styled it similarly to the rest it would look a lot better it kind of looks out of place and then this is a big issue here these are broken um the little uh circular pagination buttons are overlapping but yeah what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best somebody asked why you should use a label instead of a placeholder the placeholder value when you start typing in that text field or the text area or whatever it's it automatically clears it and then some people may forget what they're entering um and so it becomes an accessibility issue so always having it in plain view makes sense this this definitely is not a one now i've seen ones before and i've rated a few ones this is this is this is higher than a one um but for me i'm gonna have to rate this maybe a little bit lower than normal let me see what it looks like responsively it is responsive so they're doing all that correct i'm going to go ahead and rate this one a about 5.8 or so 5.7 all right all right um next up i had just two more that i had you know that i checked out beforehand this is there's a number of issues here with this one so scroll down the biggest issue with this this right here is a is a ux issue it's not even a ui design issue um you're not addressing and telling me what the purpose of the site is about why why do i have to scroll down why should i scroll down why would i want to scroll down people are going to leave this site quickly second i would say having these two navigations like this both encased in this high contrast white area um or this container rather that doesn't make sense um you're if you're gonna do this the navigation makes more sense to do that than this secondary uh and i mean secondary in terms of importance your social navigation so you know one way to fix that because that creates an issue of visual hierarchy is you can just take this and the background is white so what we can do is we'll change that background to just slightly lighter than this and then you would want to take these icons and make them all white and also get rid of this weird block this outer glow that you have and then that way things are kind of restored to normal so scroll down whoa i wasn't i wasn't expecting that initially i did see this before i started the stream but i didn't scroll down so if i start scrolling down things are really happening quickly oh no and if you're gonna do this sort of thing that better be a watermark in the background because now you have visual clutter all over the place you're lacking white space between these sections you don't want to stretch your images like that it does not look good you want to work on your type as well this almost looks like a comic sans i would get rid of this eye border completely unnecessary yeah we just have some issues here you know quite a bit of issues with topography these should be styled a little bit more differently from each other this would be a great example of somebody who could definitely benefit from checking out like my ui design courses i have several that are free on my youtube channel also you can check out skrinba.com i have a ui design bootcamp there because you kind of need to really just start from the beginning um and really learn your ui design fundamentals much more all right so we're going to go ahead and rate this one being the worst and 10 being the best number of ui issues uh ux issues as well so we got to factor those in this is a big no go absolutely not nobody can read this you don't want to have vertical text and paragraphs of vertical text you can get away with it if it's just tiny amounts of text i but when it comes to this no no no no i'm gonna have to give this one i'm looking at the ratings coming in yeah i'm gonna go ahead and give this one a 2.8 or so yeah i think that makes sense all right we have one more um that i i checked out beforehand and then we'll switch to twitter wow quincy gave it a four and i give it a 2.8 all right all right so here's one of those issues and one of the dangers of trends design trends um being overused and maybe not being used correctly and that is at the start of this year i did a video about it it was really popular about a new design trend called neomorphism and you could see these buttons with their real soft appearing and stuff and people went crazy on twitter i mean on dribble i because it was really cool the person did it in a really good context for a user interface of an app um but as we could see these it's been applied here what knew more new morphism is is we could see like elements and containers have this light uh shadow over here done achieved through the box shadow property and you can have multiple block shadows and then the second one is just like a shot a darker shadow here and they're real soft but when you do this like on almost every element it just makes it look just too amateur in my opinion because it's very similar to your typical shadows that you've seen that were your drop shadows that we've seen for 20 plus years we have issues with alignment so we have this column that's here but then we have this slightly inset so that's not working out i do like the take though on light and dark mode um these could be okay so for your hot your the hover of these the contrast gets killed with this blue color you're using based on this mid sort of gray color here and another thing that kind of hurts it too is using this mid gray color it kind of just looks bland in my opinion so you need to think about that it looks like you're just taking people straight into your portfolio examples right here but it probably would be it would make sense at least to have a little section at the top that kind of describes what you are and you know what you do it does say front end web developer but you could probably expand on that a little bit more um in sort of like a hero section it doesn't have to be the 100 100 viewport height or whatever but just a section up top instead of just having people go straight hundred percent into your your uh projects all right so what do you think this person should get rated for their portfolio one being the worst in ten being the best let me go ahead and check and see how long we've been streaming all right 38 minutes ago okay try to be constructive by the way i mean if i showed you some of my first designs back in the late 90s yeah you would all die um i'm going to go ahead and give let's see if the let's check responsiveness it is responsive so for this i'm going to go ahead and give it something like around a i think a 4.5 or so would make sense all right now designing sites is not easy it's definitely a skill that has to be learned um in fact let me do something real quick i'm going to take a a little bit of a detour and i'm going to go to my youtube channel and i'm going to go to my search my channel search i'm going to type 1999. here it is lol i found my old design work from 1999 so this is going to make a lot of you feel better if you watch this video um and this is when i put this out about three years ago this video and if i i'm going to scroll just to show you some of my designs back in like there are some that are from 1998 i think um and you're going to see some of my designs like that was my portfolio look at that this was i when i was i created a lot of portfolios like that's almost all of my work comprised of was like that's how i got practice by by making a million portfolios um designs like look at this my skills flash three four i have three years experience html dhtml java i never mess with java i don't know why i even put that maybe i meant javascript mysql php visual basic i was one of those horrible people who created aol apps or they were called progs back then or progs for like kicking people offline and stuff like punters and stuff um but that's kind of how i learned to code um but yeah just looking through this i'm looking there's a lot i mean look at this now get you have to remember look at that you have to remember that this was this is actually i was really proud of this one it was really unique back then um this is one of my first portfolios right here hi my name is gary simon i'm 16 years old and i live in warren ohio i mean can you imagine this i mean so yeah i mean this is all learned stuff then i started to get better eventually oh this i was showing uh slicing which was a frontend development technique way back a long time ago so i i got you know quite a bit better as you know i kept practicing all right so now let's keep on uh now we're gonna switch gears and i'm not gonna i'm gonna take uh doing reviews that i haven't seen yet so um let's go to twitter and we're going to search for live ui ux review latest you got a speeding ticket more in ohio yep so did i all right so let's just check some of these out i'm going to try to avoid prototypes i want to do live websites i'm going to move them off all right so here's one all right so okay welcome to david's portfolio this page is being tested on different devices as of september 15 2020 you may continue huge ux issue don't do this nobody cares if you're you're testing it on different devices like this is this should be assumed so don't do that let them go to your main user interface and this is one of those things i where someone in your shoes if you're the person who created this or if you're somebody creating things like this definitely go back to the drawing board when it comes to ui design watch my my crash courses on my channel i have ui ux design crash courses and front end development crash courses as well because there's just too many things that are happening here for me to sit here and try to give this a comprehensive review um so yeah there's a lot of things that you shouldn't be doing here like the borders are over the place the strong drop shadows this is all just stuff that's very dated and it's been quite a you know the yeah the the shadows everywhere for some reason new ui designers they get excited and in front of developers and they want to use all the cool effects but it's not it's a hindrance try to keep things more simple eye than not so for this one just because there's there's there's so much that needs to be improved we're not even going to bother with a rating let's just move on to another one thank you for the submission though let's see here we got a netlify app one now this to me looks like a a template sorted design but again i don't like making the assumption that these are templates um cosse all right pretty solid here but you know when you get out to these large one second here when you get out to these larger uh resolution like this is 4k right here um it just seems like it's a little bit too stretched out like it might make sense to take this nav net this nav bar here and create and make it into a fixed centered container kind of like how this is right here outside of that it's simple i mean it's ultra simple i like the little um this type of uh gallery right here like the masonry gallery style this is all pretty pretty decent looking i don't really have an issue with this yeah this is a great example of a really simple design that i it works well though has all the ui design fundamentals there we have good contrast we have good white space we have good alignment for the most part uh good visual hierarchy so i can't really say anything too wrong uh this right here though that's you need more line height for sure on that i probably want to use a better ad copy for this a spring sale of 30 that doesn't i would put that as like a subtitle but then use something that's completely different above that so one being the worst tammy and the best what do you people think this person should get for a rating i already know what i'm going to rate it yeah for me i'm going to give this a let's see here 7.8 or so yeah i think that's fair i mean again when i say 7.8 you know this could be depending on when you ask me like we could have like a threetenths variation one way or the other let's check out some more 360 magnet solutions so i'm always moving these off just to make sure that there are designs that i can present all right okay i was getting i was getting a little bit worried because i i was i was what we were like almost 50 minutes into this i think yeah 47 minutes um and we didn't have any of these uh the whole crazy vector animated designs occurring all right so the first issue with this design is this image right here for one it's pixelated it's a photograph so you should never use type baked into photographs like jpegs or pngs or whatever this is meant to be red easily and it's just not working here so if you're going to use a photograph make sure it's of like nontypography things second the type is just really large and it's suffering from a lack of white space and it's really spread out so i would just if you're going to use this this uh design right here or this photograph rather get rid of the type in the image leave this white background here and then just use html to put the the images on top um baking the type into the image or the photograph that's something that we used to do back during the slicing days sometimes you don't want to do that now outside of that this right here the animations completely unnecessary they're they're distracting so i remove that even though it's cool it's just not it serves no purpose outside here the next section yeah you're having issues with alignment because the bottom of this it's wrapping around this image but really this whole left portion should be maintained uh because it's just throwing off the flow of the type you also have quite a bit of type here i'm not sure if everybody or most people will want to read through all this so you might benefit by reducing the amount of type here also the type is a little bit screwed up because you have you have this larger this this one this right here is fine but then you have a smaller type as a sub headline not enough white space but then you have slightly larger type here so things are thrown off like the size of this type should be the size uh of this type or vice versa um and you need more white space like let me show you how easily i could just improve this area in a second so like margin bottom okay that's not working oh it's oh there we go uh margin bottom all right so we've moved moved things away just a little bit and then we also have this element margin top oh what is happening here there we go margin top there so i fixed the white space issues at least with this part but again we have those other issues here that need to be addressed um digital agency services this part's not not too bad actually i've never really been a fan of having embedded youtube videos just because they kind of uh it's hard to make them look good especially like depending on what the thumbnail looks like and also the default ui design for the embedded controls so you might wanna just have a button here that just launches into it perhaps or you can actually i think with the youtube player api you can have your own custom uh splash image and then when people click on it then it will it'll play right inside of their um their ui design all right so what do you think this person should get for a rating by far i mean this stuff is better this page or this sections these are sections right here are better than what's happening up here the biggest issue is this background you have to fix that one being the worst 10 being the best let me know what you all think let's see if it's responsive it is so that's working out at least now i'm going to go ahead and give this one a 4.5 or so seems like most of you are rating it a little bit higher all right let's check out uh let's see how long we've been doing this about eight minutes we probably do um one or two more um so let's continue on um simple website made for learning purposes all right uh let's see here yeah it is definitely on the simple side um and that's okay i usually it's better than than trying to make things complex because we see what that does okay what's interesting is if you go to my youtube channel i just did a video about full screen navigations and i did link a video because it was supposed to be included in this one about the ui in the ux of full screen navigations so if you come to this url definitely check this out because i talk about this sort of thing right here this here don't do that on desktop i because uh there's a few reasons why the main the the primary reason is when you have this hamburger on desktop you're requiring a user to click to access links that would otherwise already fit right here so that's just it's a bad pattern to use of course if we're talking about mobile design you don't have all that physical room to place these links you can do this all right but not when you get out to around here and you have enough space so use and adjust your media queries accordingly outside of that um it's a little bit it's a little bit boring i would say for this this particular illustration um you might want to try to either get a custom one or a rethink or get a different one um i'm not a fan of see i would rather have your your call to action because it's really important that it sticks out be styled like the hover state rather than the default state right here the borders just kind of add a little bit more complexity this makes it more simple but it also stands out more too so i would change that and if you have all this empty space here um you could probably restructure things a little bit more to where this type is larger so we can bump that up to like twice the size no not not twice the size like 6.5 rem units possibly now that's looking a little bit better it's filling things out this then can become larger as well not the same size or anywhere near the same size as this but it can still be larger and then you'll fill out this area a bit more who we are i've pushed this stuff down just a tad bit more more white space beneath this it's a little bit too close to this text area and also when it comes to these photographs or these illustrations you know one way to do it is way you're doing it just put it right there and slap it there but you can also um use it as a background image and make them real large and kind of like offs off it's hard for me to explain but um you can have it so that these are enlarged a lot larger and they can even be cut off to the half of the screen and then coming in naturally it kind of it's a more unique approach um and a more appealing visually appealing approach in my opinion this part looks pretty decent make this bold and maybe a little bit larger more white space between this section and that right here but overall it's pretty good um i probably get rid of the thin borders around these areas you don't need those all right so what do you people think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best i'm going to refresh to see just to show you what it originally looked like and we can see there was definitely an improvement by making that larger it is responsive um i'm gonna go ahead and give this one like a yeah probably like a 6.4 or so 6.5 all right thank you for that submission um we've been streaming for 57 minutes apparently so i'm going to go ahead and give this uh probably we'll do one more one more review let's go ahead and i'll refresh all right starved collection one second i'm checking it out all right so first let's refresh it so you can see what you experience on load so by default we have a we have a um a an embedded youtube player that's starting automatically probably wouldn't do that we could see the at least it is muted by default but there's a more there's more interesting ways you can go about doing something like this you could take this video clip and then um you can make it as a part of like a hero section like a watermark or whatever because again you're not it's being muted anyway um and then also continue to cite huge ux no we don't do that anymore the whole splash page thing um you want to bring them to your site by default already the main site with your user interface so if i click on continue to cite this is what we are presented with which unfortunately there's not much semblance of a user interface here it just looks like we have a navigation up top the logo over here and then we have just kind of like a random band graphic over here with tour dates um so i think there needs to be more of a restructuring you know music sites are fun because they're really unique uh and they're creative and so i would maybe i'll even do a video about maybe just compiling some of the most unique or interesting effective and noneffective banned websites because they like like i said by nature they're usually really cool looking and they're very different they're able to do different things because they're based on a creative industry um but i would like to see like for instance the navigation kind of seems more of an afterthought in this context and we have photographs overlapping each other um and so there's not a strong semblance of a ui here um like merchandise what happens when i click this probably just scrolls there okay yeah it does and if you're gonna have a merch section usually people want to know how much it costs so including that makes sense and maybe scaling down the size of these and putting them in into actual card containers might make sense as well then again um like your music's uh label and in these two things right here they could be left aligned so having them on top you know it makes more sense to put those in two columns rather than just putting one after the other all right uh what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best remem remember we have this initial page which is a big problem with the uh the whole splash page and requiring people to click here completely just send them right to this page instead but again this has a number of issues that need to be addressed here as well for me i'm just going to go ahead and give this is it responsive i wonder yeah it is i'm going to go ahead and give this a 4.5 or so i think that's pretty fair it seems like most of you agree with me anyhow all right so that here is it so that was the the final stream of the threepart stream series that we've set up with uh free code camp here of course i do this on my own channel uh my own channel is available at youtube.com forward slash design course um i do these like these see here's one i did just four days ago it's the same thing live ui ux review i call it the negative space which is just a play on um ui design fundamental i'm not very that much negative but it's the same exact show that you saw here so if you enjoyed these subscribe to my youtube channel and i do them usually once a week sometimes uh once every two weeks and just do the same exact thing also we're working hard me and my team on getting designcourse.com ready it's going to be months out from now but if you want to be emailed in order to take uh become a member of this service where we're going to have ui tests live workshops challenges and full courses yeah go ahead and just enter your email to be notified when that releases so i want to thank uh quincy larson for having me on i'm definitely interested in doing this again sometime down the road in the future um and yeah this was fun hopefully all learned something here as a part of this check out the other two uh live streams i did here in the prior two weeks if you're more interested in learning as well i will see all of you sometime in the future all right goodbye
