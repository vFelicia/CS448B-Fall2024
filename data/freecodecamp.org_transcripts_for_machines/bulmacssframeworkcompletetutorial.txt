hey welcome to my Bommel course before we get started I first want to make sure that you're familiar with scrim ba scrim bow is this interactive platform that you're using you can record and edit other people's screencasts and see the changes in real times if I have a website here you can actually copy edit the code say let's say hello Roma save it and then that will be reflected in the browser so everything that I do here you can do it as well or copied and save it as your own all right this is my beaumont course and in it you're gonna learn how to use MoMA MoMA is a modern CSS framework from Jeremy Thomas who goes by Jake Adams it's based on flexbox and using MoMA we can describe our websites design using just classes flexbox is a newer CSS spec that makes sectioning and aligning more natural we don't need to know flexbox but it is how boma works behind the scenes and when I say classes what I mean is that instead of writing around a CSS per element you can use it predefined classes this is really what the bulk of boma is and with enough classes we can describe our websites design using just semantics so before we deconstruct what that means take a look at the icons that you see below with OMA we can prototype columns form elements components modifiers layout elements and elements themselves the way that we interact with a boma is first we use this template this is the standard template that you would use when you start to author any MoMA website I've added one line of code and this is so that we can understand our website it's just a CSS debugger if you want to enable it you can just uncomment this line and see that it looks a bit different we'll use that to make sure that our website is designed perfectly other than that this is where bulma is getting linked to our website and then this these are font awesome icons this will load it up into your website okay we were talking about classes before this area right over here well boma is styling classes for us and with enough classes we can make a really robust and response website this for example would create the website that I've been showing you so far which already out of the box is responsive doesn't mean a lot so far but it will going forward okay this is a boma website and it's one of the three websites that we're going to learn to make in these screencasts this is what it would look like on a mobile device and on the right a tablet device whereas this was the desktop and then we're going to learn how to make a beautiful blog I already created a course for this but this one will be using boma and will take a fraction of the time instead of 40 minutes you'll be able to do this in maybe 15 or so minutes then after that we're gonna make a launch page for a product here I've recreated the Tesla Roadster page this is not the actual page it's just my version of it it is responsive and that's how it would look on a mobile and a tablet device alright so this is pretty exciting stuff if you have any questions or comments you want to reach out to me you can click my face reach out to me on Twitter otherwise I think we're ready to get started alright I'll see you in the next screencast where we'll first build this website and then that will slowly turn into this one all right I'll see you there hey welcome back so in this screencast we're going to turn this website into this one this actually is a website and then we'll use this as a base to add some complexity and make it a bit prettier until we get all the way back up to our original slide which again is responsive so on a mobile device this and then as a tablet on the right alright so how do we begin just to start let me point out that we have a few folders and files ready to go I have our images that we use across all of our websites and then I have some of almost documentation this is by no means all of boma this is maybe 10 or 15% if I had to guess might be much less than that but the point is that way Poma works is that we have our classes and these classes usually follow some HTML contract and that means that our boma is pretty idiomatic and that another boma developer could look at our website and just by looking at these contracts understand our website so looking at our website this is the first thing that we see and in our code we have a section a better component that we could use instead of a section is a hero so section is more generic whereas hero signifies it's important it's the first thing that we see so now we don't have very much let's go ahead and look at the debugger and we can see that the element is occupying just a portion but by no means all the height so what we can do is hero has a modifier called is full height modifiers allowed to just modify some other class and in this case is full height is limited to hero you can't use it everywhere we're also going to add another modifier as background black turning off our debugger okay so often when you want to put something inside of a hero or a section you put a container we can see that the container is trying to create a space for us to put some content okay and then in our container I'm going to add a image so we're gonna add the image contract and put that right in here you might be wondering why do we need to specify the dimension what can happen is that the website will resize itself because the images are loading and images can occupy a different height when they're unloaded as opposed to when they are loaded and so to avoid this behavior you can just specify what the dimensions are so there are predefined dimensions but you can also use an aspect ratio if you need more generalized dimensions now in this case we don't actually need this because our website is so simple right and then we'll swap out image source with our actual logo so say voila or the light which was in here right there and then that's in our images folder so we're almost there we definitely need to constrain the width so I'll just add X width and we'll say maybe 512 pixels all right and then last we want to Center it so here I'm going to add a style tag this is how we can interpolate our own CSS with homeless or create a center class which is just a generic centering class and then justify content is for the horizontal centering so we do use Center as the value and then align items is for the vertical centering the center class will Center whatever element is inside of it so we'll go up one element and we'll put it in here and it's centered we'll turn off the debugger and now we have a responsive website albeit pretty boring that's it for this one in the next one we are going to add some columns and make it a bit more like an actual website all right I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so this is the state of our website it's terrible and what we can do to make it a bit better we're going to add a section so this is the hero at the tops the first thing that you see underneath we have a section and so we pretty much know how to do that we'll add the columns class and then three columns now we'll add some text and then we're on our way first things first let's go to our Docs and then get these section that right here so let's get rid of our is full height see how that looks and then let's make these size a bit smaller so I'll reduce it by a factor of two it cool looks good and then now we're gonna add some columns they'll go back to the moment dock and then here's columns okay so we'll just put that there turn on the debugger and then let's take a look so we have a column a single column occupying pretty much the full containers with what if we had two columns it's pretty smart here and it can figure this out for us we don't actually need to state how many columns we desire we can pretty much just put it right in here so we know that we're going to have three so I'll just add one more and then we can add in some text and then we'll turn off the debugger it's not quite the same so what's going on you can see that there is an area around the text but the text here is occupying pretty much the full column there's no padding there's no margin let's take a closer look alright there's no gap so what's going on well what we can do is can add a container inside of here but instead of container when you use what's called a notification in a notification will give it this sort of gray style that you see here so we're going to wrap the text in a notification class and see that it's got some area around it now yeah all right looks good all right looks great now what's so cool about flexbox and boma and all this stuff is that it can do a lot of the heavy lifting for us so here's what I mean if I resize or it's already responsive we didn't actually need to do very much to do that and you're here responsive design you have to have media queries and then you have to understand how everything connects to each other but boma understands these ideas and pretty much takes out the labor for us so that's awesome it's optimized for tablets desktops and mobile devices out of the box now I want to point out that notification can be modified just like we used has background black before you can use other modifiers so for example I can do is primary and take a look how the text is white and the background is green whereas over here the text is black and the background is gray all right now the last thing is if we want to control the text we can add a modifier so we'll need to wrap this in its own paragraph is size so we can do you like is three and you can see it got really really big so much that it's overwhelming believe there's one through seven and what we use for now is five so just a bit bigger and that's it in the next screencast when I add those is primary and some others to make this really beautiful and then add a title for each of these columns all right I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so this is the state of a website not bad but we're gonna improve it with some color so it'll look like this by the time that we're finished which I think looks a lot better so how do we do that how do we go from here there all right so we know we need to remove the background make this the color logo because that is a different one than it is here and then we can give the columns their own background and then add a title and then add a color to our notification all right so that is pretty straightforward okay so like we mentioned we'll get rid of the has background black it'll default to a white but now our logo is invisible so we can go to our images and then we're gonna swap out the white one for this one alright just like that nice that's a bit big so let's change that max width so now we don't have a partition between our hero and the section to make that more obvious let me point that out with the debugger so here we can see that there's a beginning and an end to the hero and the section to make that more obvious we need to add a color that's why this one looks a bit different so we'll go to section I'm gonna add has background and I'm gonna use light for this nice so now we have a problem we can't see our column from the section right we need to be able to separate these two so what we can do is add a modifier to our notification right here we can do is and then of the available ones we have I think there's info is linked and you have danger warning and primary right so these would all happen is before them so let's see what they look like just turning off the deep bugger so yeah link gives us a nice blue feel free to experiment with these I'm going to use is info is primary and then is warning now let's really cool about using these thematic modifiers is they actually modify more than just the background take a look at the text the text has now altered firm black to white depending on which theme we're using so this is a really nice feature of OMA well we'll inverse the text in this case to make sure that it's readable if we force this to be a has text white right here it's not as readable as before so this is one of the things that boma is doing for us behind the scenes that I think is really cool now we only need to add a title so what we can do is we're going to add an H element so do h1 and then we'll do what was it oh yeah almost the first one and that does not look good that looks so inferior all right so let's attribute this so right now it's not getting anything from MoMA because it doesn't have a class so I'm going to give it a say title now we get something that stands out that's a bit big so I add a modifier to per title and we'll do is size to do I think one less yeah that looks good that's pretty quick right so Roma is doing a lot of the work for us now we're ready to move on to adding the columns that you see beneath all right I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so our website looks like this which is alright I mean it's a bit boring but what we can do is beautify it so we're gonna give it some pecans and then another section and then that section will have its own cut icons that have a color and then the title and the paragraph will hug each other here so how do we do this we're gonna go to the boma documentation and we're gonna grab two classes we need the media class which is like a Facebook post or a Twitter post and then we need to grab the actual icon class which is here all right and I'm going to put that right in here we have our media left which is this area over here and then inside of it we need to put the icon class which is what we did here okay and then our content well we already have content it's here so we're just going to insert that right here and that's really it so let's go ahead and refactor this combine our notification with the media class so we'll do media notification and then all we need to do is we'll make this article this article and then we'll get rid of this guy alright so let's see how this looks got the wrong icon but it's a start the icon that will actually use is this one and I didn't memorize that that is coming from an awesome com so that's where we get the codes for the font awesome icons and we don't want this to have a color so we can just get rid of that for now our icon is appearing as white because of his info and that's pretty interesting if I put is warning the icon goes black that's a really nice feature to make the icon bigger we can add a modifier here let's say FA LG for large and you also have 2x and then every X and there's probably more so with you 2x for now I think that's the right size yeah that looks really good now if you want it to have more of an area around the icon I'll show you what I mean yeah that box is like really narrow it doesn't have that sort of nice area around it an easy way to fix that is we can add a modifier to the icon class of is medium or as large or try it as large yeah so that red definitely makes a difference and then let's turn off the bugger so it's a bit big let's just make that is medium instead cool yeah so that's really all there is to making this a media class who's gonna paste in the results pepper use act code that we wrote before just copied and pasted and yeah the rest of it is really the same thing so let's go ahead and just take all of this copy and paste it again all right and we know that we're gonna have six instead of three so we're gonna repeat the column so instead we have six columns and that does not look good so we need to fix this how do we how do we fix that so we can add a few things for every column we need to say it's one third there's a whole bunch of modifiers in use here we're gonna use is one third and then this will basically force each column to occupy one third of the website's width so we just repeat that process and then let's see how that looks all right that's a bit better but it's definitely on at the same line which is not ideal hope you had another modifier called is multiline and then this will force it to break Thanks now you probably know what to do here right what do we what's left we can get rid of the background for the whole section the notification doesn't need to have a color now it's great okay so let's just go ahead and force that so we say it has that ground white in our paragraph to make these hug to make this hug the title you can just give the class of subtitle now finally we're just gonna make this a little smaller and then get rid of this space around the icon we can give it a color by doing has text let's say warning I'm gonna go and paste in the results and then we'll load that up and what up it's really that cool and it's all responsive which is really amazing because we didn't we didn't even need to code that right one was doing all of this for us so bomb was really incredible at rapidly prototyping and shipping websites quickly and then coming up we're going to learn how to on the blog I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so you just finished your first Bulma website and that's really amazing just how much fun looking new for you you think about it you did responsive beautiful website design without even touching was it any CSS like it was it's like for hot it's like five lines of CSS so bomb was really a powerhouse here and understanding and mastering boma can really I mean the thing is even if you don't use boa in production it can teach you how Jeremy or Jake Adams might solve a problem using boma and I think that's pretty amazing all right let's start up our new website this is going to be a blog and to start you'll note that we have this little breadcrumb at the top so let's go ahead and paste that in one of the components that we can use is the bread crumb so it's right here note that we're starting with the section in the container if we're not starting with the hero it makes sense that we would start with a section instead alright so put that right here and then let's take a look and it doesn't do anything because it's empty so I'm just filling with values all right so that looks really great now let's go ahead and open it up and it's okay but in our design here the contents pretty narrow so how do we how do we change that so I couldn't find a hundred percent idiomatic way to do this with bulma's so instead I relied on CSS grid so now we're going to learn how to embed CSS grid into boma and so here's what we can do create a grid class which requires it need display grid then when a template three columns because you can imagine that this website is really just three columns the container is the reason that this doesn't go all the way to the edge of the web page that's why we have a gap here but if we just ignore that gap we basically have a small column a bigger column and then a another small column over here well what we can do grid template columns and we're going to divide our website into thirds to start so we've new one if our one if our one fr fr stands for a fraction unit so now our websites being divided into thirds anywhere we put the grid class this one okay now we need to be pretty explicit here because if we just use grid as it is the content will fall into this column so because almost always the content falls into this column we just need to be explicit about that you belong to the second before the third column I want the content to start here and then end here so the syntax is two over three and then we can just put the grid here because of our content is inside of this div we put the grid here and the asterisk is referring to anything inside of the grid that would include this nav that will inherit this grid com rule okay so we go ahead and load this up our websites divided into thirds now with the content occupying just the center column it's a bit too narrow so what we can do instead is we'll give this a fixed width all right that's great and let's turn on the debugger so if we make this responsive oh and I forgot it off right there okay all right so looking with the debugger see this little these white lines right here well that's because our column is too wide on a mobile device it can't be 624 pixels that might be wider than the screen and say this is a responsive column with a minimum and a maximum width anywhere from 0 to 624 pixels so now you'll note that we don't get that side effect so that's great all right how we how do we get these bigger images if you look on a mobile device you'll note that they occupy the full width whereas on a desktop device it's just occupying most of the width so remember the reason we have this gap here is because of the container given that what's called this column medium and I can update this it's really amazing that grid is that subtle and then now if I wanted to refer to all three columns which is pretty much what this design is these images are spanning all three columns then I'll just create another identifier and then here I'll use Excel okay and then to use our new excel identifiers I need to create a class so that we can give a specific element say for example nav occupy all three columns and not just the the center medium column so now I wanted our nav to occupy all three columns I can just give it the class of grid Excel wait a minute what's what's going on we've got this gap right here well that's actually boma trying to help us out almost trying to make everything pretty but in this case it's adding padding and we don't want it it's interrupting the design what we can do this would new is padding less here so this tells the section to not have its own padding there we go right now it's occupying all three so that's great and let's go ahead and turn this off and now it's just occupying the the content column it looks like we can keep the vertical padding it's just the horizontal padding that that we don't care for so let's go ahead and make our own class because it doesn't exist in Omaha but we'll just make it real quick so we say is padding less horizontal we'd say padding left I mean right right okay and then let's see what happens oh I just realized we mistyped hang on okay it's better now all right so we created the class and now it's occupying the full width which is really really what we want we want to have a hundred percent control of the layout in this case now we're gonna have a problem which is our content doesn't hug the wall but our image does ooh how do we do with that well it's actually pretty subtle something has the class of grid excel we just don't care about it but in general we want it to have a small gutter so the way that we can do this is very subtle right we put a extra column right here and right here now no matter what there will always be a 1.5 RM which valuates I think 24 pixels there always be a gutter to the left and the right of our content column and then the one if R is just the the remainder space so check this out it's really it's really amazing right so we load up the web page and now we've got that gutter so so that's good and then we go ahead and put grid excel and then it's gone so it's really that easy for us to define the laying out using CSS grid and still embed it into our boma so we get the benefits of both CSS grid and OMA next we're going to learn how to make this author thing at the top and then we'll make the title and I'll see you in the next screencast hey you will come back ooh now that we're code gods we're ready to ready to move on and we're gonna start with the title of these all right the author at the top then we're gonna do the the title under that so how do we how do we do this well if you recognize a pattern here that's good we're going to use the media class the media component again because it makes simple how do we do the icon or the image at the at the left and then a title and then a paragraph to the right so one difference though is that we're gonna have this icon or the image in the center right you can't hit here but if we had multiple lines we would still want that image to be centered so we'll learn how to do that too and we're ready to go ahead and grab the media component and one thing is that this will belong in its own section so we'll grab that too all right and then one thing that we'll want to do is it's pretty much safe to assume that we can use this again and we can use grid here again as well if we wanted to refactor this we could go into here and then make a rule for section to automatically get rid of the padding left in the padding right so that we didn't have to put it here every time but for now I'm just gonna put that like this so here we go right here we're gonna put an image so I'll grab the class for that component for that do this one all right there I change this to 64 by 64 and there isn't a class for every size it's just that this is there's a few predefined classes 64 is one of them so I'm not there's not like a 65 by 65 and so on and so forth all right and then here we'll swap out the image new images and we're gonna grab the which one was it me me me me me me me JPEG okay great now for the content the content what we'll do is put this in a paragraph and then let's see we got zenok okay so let's put that in real quick all right so we have a strong tag to make a bold we have a link that goes nowhere right now then I'm gonna force the text this text to be gray so to do that I've got it wrapped inside of a span and then I've given it the class it has text grade to just force to be a bit lighter then I'm just using a break to break to the next line because it belongs to the same paragraph and then here this is definitely recommended we're using the time element so that search engines can basically document when this when the intended publication date was so for this I've just put the same date as I have that I published this article so that was April April 20th all right and the rest is pretty simple by the way this is not the bullet character it's actually I think I'm saying a right interpunct right this is an octave thorpe so alright wait so let's see how this looks nice now you'll note if you are OCD like me that the image is not in the center right we've got that little gap and Neath but not above so how do we deal with that to feel a little while to figure this out but it's pretty simple we're gonna make a general use class that we can use and I'm gonna call it Center which this will use flexbox so we just got flex here and then I'm going to Center horizontally and vertically if you were asleep earlier we did this like a few screencasts ago so this really isn't anything new do where do we put that know where we can actually put it as right here the reason is is because we're going to Center not just the figure but the text too because the text is taller than the figure the text will not actually have a gap above or beneath it but because the figure is shorter than the text the figure will have a gap above and beneath it now huh all right we'll turn out the debugger and that's one problem solved but we have one more not this huge gap up here and you might like that I don't so the way that we deal with that again is the padding here because we've started a new section Balma basically said hey I think I want you to have some padding where's gonna be lips it's gonna be a little dirty here and just can mine that out all right so now we've got that nice even gap above and below the nav and then the other part really looks ideal now on for the title I don't know that this is the most idiomatic way to do this it's just sort of what I worked out and put something inside of a div ID of it we'll do an h1 and h2 remember I want to give this style and give them a class of title and subtitle remember there's modifiers to change the size so I'll have this Cascade I'll do is and then is 3 and here do how to build yeah that's great let's take a look Oh so when I came up with was this well we know that sections will go ahead and give us some padding why don't we just use a section class here we don't need to use the section element because that's not semantically correct this isn't really a new section but we can borrow the properties from section to style this very consistently so I just grab this and voila alright let's see how it looks on a mobile device not bad we'll do some things later to make the text appear a little bit smaller so that it fits better but other than that it looks great alright in the next screencast we're going to figure out how to do our images which are gorgeous and then we're going to go and do the content in the screencast after all right I will see you very very soon hey welcome back we've got this beautiful blog design and now we're ready for these really nice images so what's that about well what we can do is go to the docs and we're gonna grab the columns like we used before yeah and then looking here I've got three so do three columns we're going to do three columns so do okay we have our three columns inside of each column there's going to be an image which could be a link it could be just an image that's fine and then we'll have a caption at the bottom alright so we'll grab the image class and then that goes inside of each of these I will remove this guy from now and then with you up three images right here it's gonna be blog one through three okay let's see what happens all right hang on right images yeah ooh yeah it's okay so we forgot to make this a grid excel right how's that look hey looks okay so one thing that we can do in boma is use the remember how we use notification before to give sort of a background well there's a few more that we can use there's box and card I really like card so we use it here and that'll give us that little nice line and a very very subtle shadow beneath it so that's the effect that we have here all right and then I'll just add a card to each of these yeah so you've got this gap which is a bit weird and then we had this other problem we're on a mobile device we probably would like this in general but for images we just want it to be wide the whole time okay let's go and get rid of the gap first so there's a feature called is variable which has its own modifier I think it's like one through a few maybe one two three four and if we use zero that will turn off the gap now if I want to increase that just little bit one or two or three let's do two yeah so this is a really nice feature if you don't want to completely remove it just partly remove it all right so we're gonna make this zero and yeah that looks really cool how do we deal with this there's another modifier that we can use for columns because columns are such an essential component God is mobile I want you to keep your aesthetic whether you're on a mobile or a desktop device really quite simple and again the reason that this isn't going full with here is because of the container if we really didn't like that it wouldn't be hard for us to just remove it all right and let's go ahead and add a figure caption below do you think caption a caption you know what I'm gonna make this a figure so that it's easier and then we can just make these good as for now instead now I want this to be small and Volman eise's that so no problem and then what was the text it was like that and you don't need to quit because you're already here good stewards of the Internet let's gonna make these links that go nowhere okay and then over here let's who happens so okay I think we know what we can do right we could put the class center here all of our problems go away yeah that's not bad and then let's just see how this would look with some content beneath it so just do you like yeah right we need a we need a we need some we need some space there so what we needs is because this doesn't belong to boma boma isn't giving us any any special treatment instead the Bommel way to do this might be to use level allows you to align content along level this is just indicating that anything in it needs to belong anywhere on the left the center or the right and then here I can make this a level item now basically saying I want this thing to be a level and then we have one item so this should be centered and because the belongs to MoMA he knows how to give us that breathing room that we so desire right before the concent was hugging it and that was an ideal yeah so we now we had that little space right there and then let's make the text a little bit lighter du has text gray and then the last thing is there's for me I'm really picky though I don't want this gap right here well if we inspect it eventually we'll find that that is a margin being applied so it's a market being applied to the columns what we can do is just say remember we use is penniless before well here I use is marginalists oh yeah that looks so cool and of course it's all responsive yeah all right I'll see you in the next screencast where we add this content and then we'll add a rule to make this a little bit smaller on a mobile device so that the content fits a bit better alright see you soon welcome back Internet now we're ready to add the content of our blog it'd be a pretty terrible blog we just kept it as is and it's beautiful but it's kind of useless so what we can do is in the documentation there is a class that we can use called content and you my friend have seen this before voila right you've seen this now content didn't do anything for us at the time because we just had a boring old paragraph but now we're gonna start to understand really how powerful content is and content becomes especially relevant if you want to use markdown in your websites because doing on these attributes all the time can be a bit annoying sometimes you just want the element to describe the content and for that to be enough and so content is a great example of this so let's do an h1 view and h2 right so note these don't have the title or the subtitle that we've used before which was necessary when we wanted to give this the style here these are just naked HTML elements when we load them up note that they do have a style and that's because content is helping us out here content is really magical because we basically don't have to worry about any of the trivial elements that we might want to use it's good for paragraphs for for lists whether they're ordered or unordered you've got your h's that i've showed you before we've got block quotes and even tables it's pretty awesome I'm gonna grab a really complete example from the website super complete and I'll show you what I mean wait there are no funny classes right I mean even have stuff like this where there's it's it's super right and then here we've got the sub four I mean it stands for so maybe submarine I don't know what that stands for okay well let's take a look whoa what so look at that right our blog is really gorgeous and we have to do so little work to get there now this let me just point that out that is my tabs screwing with the source code so here this is wrapped in a pre which means basically pre process don't cross us this text you want to have that hug the left wall where there's no no space to the left then that extra space we can fix that like that at least that's one way to fix it I'm sure there are others anyway this is really powerful the rate boma has done so much heavy lifting for us and all we had to use is HTML I think Tim bernerslee would be like extremely proud right now so anyway for for our website I'm gonna go ahead and just get rid of this instead I'll put the content yeah now check this out this is also why content is so powerful the content can scale so we can have medium content we can download content contents pretty miraculous I mean you can have different paragraphs in your website have different sizes and that's not just true for text it's true for all those elements that I showed you just a moment ago so boma is really freaking magical let's say you wanted to do like is large notification that's a really simple example of how we combine different bola moment classes to make like an advertisement or like a banner and then let's say we want to like style it right it's really crazy how powerful boma is anyway let's go ahead and just leave that I think this medium was good and that's it this is how you make a beautiful blog you know in a responsive sense it's not optimized I mean it is mobile but the text is a bit big so I'll show you a fascinatingly simple way that we can we can fix that make a media query which means I want you to override some code in this circumstance and the circumstance if we're rendering our website at some max width then consider the following rules so I'll say I want my route element to update its font size from the default of 16 pixels to say like like 414 let's just do a percent be like 90 percent 100 percent would be 16 pixel here 90% with not 14 but definitely easier on the eyes and then the circumstance is when I get to right here so we know that this is 624 and I need some way to say 624 plus these guys so I can say plus 1.5 REM so remember one REM is 16 pixels so 1.5 REM is 24 pixels and then we knew times 248 and then we do 6 24 plus 48 and then we can say 6 72 pixels all right now when we get to that when we cross over from a desktop or a tablet device to what we're calling a mobile device we get a slight update and everything that is defined with an e/m or in rem as its unit will also proportionally change to its really powerful if we wanted to go even further totally possible to that's it you've made a beautiful blog in like record time and it's ence responsive and we have like what the team lines of code it's crazy yeah so that's amazing now we're gonna go all the way up to a launch page I have stolen the Tesla Roadster page and then made it our own using boma believe it or not this will also be responsive and we're gonna do it with again very little code all right enough talk let's get into it I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back I'm pretty excited I'm not gonna say much about this we're just gonna get started alright so we're gonna use a hero I'm gonna drop the hero body I'm just gonna start with that alright let's take a look with the debugger turned on and ah it's not occupying any height so for that we can do is full height remember we do that pretty recently when we were designing this webpage here we have its full height and then here we just removed it so for this website you can imagine that we just have a hero and it has a modifier of is full height okay let's take a look now it's a darker color right if I remove that it's a little lighter and that's because it's a darker color on top of our whole website that being the hero okay so we can start to fill in the background so in our images we've got one two and three and we're going to use multiple images because we want our website to look different on a mobile or a tablet device so this is actually a different image than this one I mean it's the same picture but they've the the tesla team has edited it so that it's optimized for a mobile or a tablet device I'm going to do the same here so all we need to do is target the hero I want to say you have a background and Lee a background of images and then 0 1 right see what happens oh hang on the debugger is overriding the background yeah the first time this happened I thought my screen was dirty yeah it's the pictures huge right so we need to let's Center it all right so we need to go a bit further when you use something called cover which means I want this image to basically want the image to fit inside of our websites browser yeah that looks really good and it is responsive in a sense but the problem is is that on mobile devices it's just too narrow we we can't see the car it just doesn't look ideal so to fix that what we can do is use a media query actual Renee is two that are max that are max with is a thousand 24 pixels or we're 768 pixels then wanted to display a different background and we just update that let's take a look hey we move a yeah missing the hero okay yeah so that actually does look better right alright so there is the desktop right and we get to a tablet changes a little bit and then on a mobile device that changes even more so the point is that these images are optimized for different devices and that's great we'll get a better experience as a result now you might have noticed when I was changing the the widths you might have seen it like a flash of white well that's because the background behind the image will default to white if we're not explicit we want that to be black which i think is a bit more a bit more brand we can just do this and while we're waiting for an image to load as we're changing the width we'll get a stroke of black yeah so now we get like a stroke of black if our image is still loading which i think is just a little bit better than white so that's it for this screencast and the next one will focus on the the navigation bar at the top which of course will be mobile but in a different sense we're gonna hide some content in the event that we're on a mobile device all right I'll see you very soon hey welcome back now we're going to add that nap bar at the top and it's going to require some extra CSS so I have these helpers here and we're going to link to them like this so it's not that different than the way that we've linked our debugger it's actually the same but looking at our helpers we have a few things that we need to add in order to make this work you're familiar with Center that's nothing new but now instead of just centering an element inside of another one when you put it at the top the right the bottom and the left so that's nice and we have this special case where by default Flex Direction sets to row and in the event that we want it to set to column then we can just use center column instead might be wondering what the heck does that mean well looking at this the elements are following each other across a row whereas here they're following each other across a column so this is an example where if we want the elements to fall vertically we can say Center column and that will still Center Center the element inside of a column all right these just make this stuff work and then down here this is how we can have a single single space text and here this is if we want to hide something if we're on a mobile device so at a thousand 24 pixels anything that has a class of desktop I want it to just disappear all right so now we can add that nav bar and to do that we're gonna go into our Docs if I want to grab this guy instead of body we're going to use head here okay now the way that I thought of this design is to have this split into three columns so I have the left the center and then the right column over here we know how to do that just go to grab the columns and then we put that there and we know we'll have three so I'll just put this like this now remember when we're on a mobile device it's gonna stack the columns so to fix that we can just put is mobile and I found that if we put is margin list it'll look a lot prettier right it's just very simple now so now I'm going to fill in the valley with some texts for now this hey cool so our elements are falling vertically and we don't want that we effectively want them to fall horizontally if you remember a moment ago one of our helpers well these helpers do that because flex direction is set to row by default that's exactly what we want in fact we can just leave that there and it won't do anything at all I'll just put the center here and that actually centers the elements inside of their parent easy enough we can just make that left and right cool it's looking better now to deal with the fact that the text is just too close I found that there is a class just for this purpose so use nav bar found that there's a class to do with this so commute now our item mount will space it out real nicely so we just put that everywhere hey great this is looking phenomenal now on a mobile device we still have the trouble of having all this data so the way that we can deal with it is we'll just put desktop here remember remember that's this one here saying at thousand 24 pixels or less hide the content instead of putting it here for it for shop and signin we want to keep this button here so instead you can put desktop there and that was really easy okay now really all that's left is just style so all that's really left is basically the icon and then the style so the style is actually pretty easy everything is a heading and it has a text weight of fold we also want the text to be black and I found I can't just put has text black here it doesn't work so instead we're gonna be a bit lazy and just put it right here so again if we wanted to we could just refactor this in the style or even go all the way to Beaumont and customize it for our needs but for now just do it this way alright that's looking really good let's swap out the text here and the text here with the right image and icon so we know so for so we're familiar enough so we're familiar enough with how to do that so we know how to do that we just grab that and we go to here and I want to keep our item and I don't need will link our logo which is right here and you'll note that it's gonna be like crazy it's because it's rendering the SVG's height and width and not the desired height and width I'm just gonna inline this for now and we can say height one REM which kind of works but the width is still way too big you can see that here but a fix that I worked out that the width to the height was six point two five that's great and now we just need to deal with the hamburger so we just copied that put it here and then there is a font awesome icon for this now you'll note that the text is grayish so should we say it has text black and let's just make sure it's all good you might be wondering why is the height changing so again what we'll do is we can give it a fixed width and height make it one two one and let's take a look so we got the the boundaries right but here it's just doing something funny found that if we put the center here all of our problems go away let's take a look all right now to emulate that this is active go to a rope stir and make that way I believe that there's an is active class that you can use or you can make your own style or you can do this your own way I just want to show you the fastest way that you could so I want to show you I just want to show you the fastest way that you could emulate that design now unfortunately I don't have enough time to make this interactive but we will finish this responsive and all alright I'll see you in the next screencast hey welcome back so our sites awesome and now we're going to add in the Tesla and roadster text that you see at the top to do that I'm gonna add a hero body and then we're gonna have an each one and in h2 whoops and you can probably work out how we style this right we just do and actually let's do subtitle here because the text is smaller not bigger and then we'll put title here yeah so just put this in a good for now I don't know what you're doing just put it in a div okay so this works all the same alright so the point is we want to have this up at the top and we want it to be centered so what we need to do is basically override override where is fault where it falls on the page and there's a general class that we can use to to deal with this so we can view is overlay which means it's position is independent from the content on the page so even though I've got content here the fact that it's overlaid on top just ignores that so it's a good start and there is a modifier has text centered to center the text and then you can kind of work out that we just need to just shift it down a bit so we can use style top and 82 was right now note I'm not using p.m. or REM here because I want the height to always be the same whether we're on a mobile device or not let's take a look so yeah that looks great so we turn off the debugger and I guess all that's left is this gap in between and the the text color itself I think you know how to do this right we could just say hey wait a minute I know how to do that just do has text in black there how that worked and would use single spaced here similar space what do you single spaced here remember our helper we had single space to find because I have this other version of it it doesn't matter where we define it we can put it here or we can put it up here so the asterisk is really vital here okay so now that content pretty much hugs each other which is what we want and then finally I want this to be a little bit lighter so instead of changing the color let's change the the text wave it has text weight light and yeah that gives us sort of a nice aesthetic all right that one was easy now last we're gonna do this like complicated thing at the bottom and I was like super intimidated when I went to Tesla and was like how do I do that turns out that this is actually pretty intuitive if we use grid I'm sure there's a way that you could use flexbox but I found that grid was basically the most expressive way to solve this problem that's it for this screencast see you in the final screencast hey welcome back so our site it's freaking awesome but it's missing the specs at the bottom they're kind of intricate they're a responsive design is not like anything we've seen so far so you might be feeling a bit intimidated now how do you possibly do this and do that in like 10 minutes or less and the thing is if you have the right tool it can be a lot easier than you imagined so what we're gonna do is use CSS grid here so I have a link to a file called grid and over here I have it defined it's just empty when you use grid to create this design and it's going to be a lot easier than I think you might imagine let's go ahead and create our hero's foot do like this and like a main instead would be footer but it's up to you and we're going to follow the format that we did before so we have everything inside of a div just inside of the parent so here is where we can define our grid and I'm going to use an ID for this it could be a class but doesn't really matter at least not right now now looking at this design I want you to imagine that this is four columns and two rows I want you to imagine that this is four columns and two rows so you have one two three four for the columns and then here you have two rows right so you have one and two and beyond that you have five elements you have one two three four and five all right so we'll create five gifts I love so a b c d e so if we go to our grid okay so now let's turn on the let's turn on the debugger okay so you can see the foot is trying to exist here but there's just nothing to show all right so we'll put some content yeah all right so let's constrain the grid to say with 768 and then let's Center here because that will Center its child which is the grid cool and let's just add a padding around here okay cool so now it's got like this little gap beneath it which is like we have here you a grid like this and then display grid set of grid template columns for interview areas so areas are pretty amazing if you remember we have four columns and two rows so in terms of IDs this is a B C D and E and so what we want is to say it that a occupies all four columns in the first row and then BCDE each occupy one column but span the entire row I think I said that right all right so here's how we can do that and say eh eh eh eh so this is one row and then four columns here we can say we c d e alright let's see what happens we've got the text at the top and then these would each be these specs now on a mobile device this won't do anything fancy but I bet you have an idea of how we can do that we can say at media max with 512 pixels and say grid when an override grid template areas it's astonishing how simple this is all we need to do is remove a column and add a row that's it I know I know it's crazy it's who happens so on a mobile device you can see how the reserve now is at the bottom and the specs are in the center and then the text is at the top and then that changes depending on what we're looking at the rest of this is really just aesthetics so what we can do is we can say hey I want the rose to have a gap you say grid row gap one REM that gives us a nice break in between and I think you know what to do now the rest is really just titles subtitles and an icon so I'm gonna go in and paste them in because it is pretty cumbersome but I bet you'll understand all of it once I put it here so there it is and let's just talk about it real quick so one of the things that you'll note is that we're using contact column because I want the text here to be on top of each other if we used Center which is flex direction row it flows left to right and so to fix that we just say center column take a look you'll you'll recognize all of this code now we have a paragraph has text centered has text white here we have a paragraph with an icon inside of it here I've got this speed icon has text gray light we set a fixed width in a fixed height which is just a little bit smaller than the text and we can use modifiers so we have bearing size text right we have 1.9 as big and then small we have s and that's because of the and that's because we're changing the size with the modifier is size 5 for the reserve Now button that's really just a link it has some modifiers and I set the width to a hundred so that always occupies the available width and really that's all there is to it the thing is with boma you can really rapidly prototype and the code is fairly idiomatic so I really hope you enjoyed this course please please share this if you think it was valuable and if you want to reach out to me and if you want to reach out to me hit me up on Twitter right here you can click my face otherwise yeah congratulations you are now a Bowman ninja happy coding see ya
