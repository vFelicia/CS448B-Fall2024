hey everybody welcome to livestreaming with Jessie today we're gonna start new projects and we're gonna use react 16 which just came out recently what was it last week it was pretty recently so there's some cool stuff in react 16 I haven't even gone through all the new stuff yet so we'll definitely be learning about that together we use create react app just like we did for the last project and we'll probably end up using Redux and react router as well so some new stuff definitely haven't done Redux before on the stream so that'll be cool and then some of the new react 16 stuff we'll be using I want to show you a kind of a preview of what the end result is going to be and and then we'll get started so this is definitely starting from scratch you can see my terminal here there's nothing I've done nothing to set this up yet other than have node and NPM and yarn installed on my machine other than that it's pretty much from scratch so let me check I have some comments here in the live chat okay so Shay says congrats on your completing your Redux project I hope you're feeling better today how you doing okay so a few of your asking how how I'm doing so if you saw my tweet yesterday so yesterday I didn't stream so sorry about that I intended the stream but I saw a doctor in the morning who went over my MRI result so last we got an MRI dad to inject some fluid into my wrist and then do the MRI and basically they could tell that in my wrist there's the section of your wrist that has like this triangular formation of ligaments and it holds some bones in place and so those ligaments in my wrist are torn so that's what's been wrong with my wrist since what sometime in July I think I know I've complained about it several times on the strain so anyway so that's what's wrong with my wrist I went to go see a surgeon yesterday afternoon but unfortunately I drove up from where I am to place near Pittsburgh and drove all the way there and found out that they don't take my insurance so I have to wait now until November until that doctor is in Ohio because if that same doctor sees me in Ohio my insurance will work but if I see that doctor at another state it will not work so I don't know I guess that's just how it is but it was a waste of a trip and I missed my livestream so disappointed about that but so I'll probably end up having to have surgery on it at some point the doctor that I talked to yesterday morning said it should just be like really small incisions so hopefully that works out all right said if I decide not to get surgery it'll be okay it'll just hurt and then eventually I'll get arthritis so I figure surgery is probably the way to go especially if I plan on typing on a keyboard for the rest of my life all right so enough enough about the wrist but I appreciate all the concern that that you all have shown on Twitter and in here and everything so all right I got some new people in the live chat so welcome thanks for joining and all right Blake just submitted his first PR awesome congratulations okay all right so let's get started let me I'm gonna start this and we'll do we're gonna do 25 minutes of coding well we're not really gonna code that much at first we're gonna be doing some commands on the command line to get it set up we're going to do that for about 25 minutes that's going to include me going over what the the project requirements are and then we'll take a fiveminute break do questionanswer we're going to do at least two sessions of coding maybe three and we're going to work on this probably not everyday I got some other projects going on as well so we're gonna switch it up we're going to go back to project one do some updates but whenever I get a chance I do want to come back to this and do this project so there's not there's not a hard deadline on this project but it's something that I think that it does need updated so I'm just going to work on it as I as I can okay so this is the objective here last year so quite last summer so the summer of 2016 I spent working on this this bulletin so our old University bulletin was a Word document sent by email so this is definitely an upgrade from that it allows us to put in we put in videos a lot more pictures just a lot more content in general without having to have this really giant word document easier to handle attachments so it definitely benefits also there's now a record of everything that's ever been in the bulletin and it's all searchable so our project basically is going to pull from the WordPress API like we did with with project one so it's gonna pull posts from the WordPress API and display them we have two different display options well actually more than two so we have this grid view or the list view we also have a print view because a lot of people missed that they didn't the word document so I added the print UN basically vicepresidents this stuff are used to having their secretaries print out the bulletin forum and put it on their desk so I got some calls from secretaries administrative assistants that we're asking hey I want to be able to print this out so that's why I did the print view also we have the classic mode which was put in there for people who are nostalgic for the old style and this is pretty much as an exact replica as I could get of the old bulletin it's the same font and so you know the word doc mint style so basically those are the views so it's going to have four different views it's gonna have a place to submit announcements and that includes a file upload which we've done before so no big deal we can filter by date we have all the you know categories that we can filter by we're gonna have a Help section which right now just has some some text and some embedded YouTube videos that I made and that's that's about it it does have a an infinite scroll function so you keep scrolling down it just keeps loading new bulletin posts so anyway that's that those are the requirements things that will change will definitely go with a new look like we did with the Resource Center so we'll have the new logo you know the white header up here one thing that will be different is it you know the sidebar is always open on large screens so this school I do want to redo this once I redo this and react I think it would be really cool to also redo this in react native so that's a possibility not sure if I could convince my boss that that's really a priority but it would be cool if we could do it the other requirement is and this is the big deal that's been giving me kind of a headache right so it was decided that you would need to login to be able to see this but we did a survey and users so it's just this an internal site so users here at the University did not want to have to remember another password to login so I set up a password list login system where if they put in their University email address they will get an email they click the link in the email it logs them in and then it saves the login credentials and local storage and that will persist unless they choose to log out or empty you know their their local storage and their browser somehow for a year they'd stay logged in but the problem has been it for some reason some you know some users do empty out their local storage frequently and that's why they have to keep logging in but some users seem to have to log in way more frequently than once a year so it's been kind of annoying to them and I in some cases I've been able to find why it does that but it's kind of it's difficult I have to actually go around to each computer do troubleshooting that's and there's not really been one common issue so that's something that I'd really like to I'd like to find another way to have people log in without having to put in a password so some sort of password this log in the university is at the end of this month they're supposed to implement a single signon system it'd be great if I can integrate it with that and that's part of the reason why I want to redesign this because if I'm gonna go into this right now this is just jQuery it's not react if I'm gonna go in and make major changes to how the login system works then I don't want to mess around with all that jQuery which I'm sure is probably a mess I mean I I made it all so it's my own fault but I don't want to go back in and mess with it I'd rather just redo it now as react with react and then that way when we implement the system I can try to integrate it into there I still I need to talk to the people in the ITB Department that are in charge of that and and see what's possible or I'm not even sure how they're doing their their single signon I don't know if it's like LDAP system or Active Directory so I have to I still have to find out some more things so we may not have to do our own login system hopefully we can just use that system but for now we don't really have to worry about that we'll just build out the UI pull in the the posts from the WordPress API and it shouldn't be too hard all the big decisions are pretty are made already right all you know how the UI works all the views so I usually when I start a project I don't think it'll be too hard but we'll see we'll see how it goes all right so first things first and also once we get to the end I want to go over a few pull requests I've got in so try not to let me forget that when we do our final question and answer session at the end I'll start out by going over some of the pool requests so let's go into my projects folder that's where I keep everything and let's uh we have create react app installed right let's bring up the documentation first so that everyone can see what we're doing and can follow along so let's fine there we go react up okay I wonder if I need to update create react that I don't know so I'm gonna do oops I don't know if I've ever done this with your anthea is it update now I can't remember well back and forth from NPM and yarn it's coffee in pace whoops I didn't need the coffee and taste that part okay all right this is what I wanted to copy I think I have this maybe I didn't have it installed globally all right good thing I did that okay cool all right so now we'll run create react app let me make this a little bit bigger so everybody can see it and it's call this bulletun react okay so that's step one well really step two step one was install create react app globally we do it globally right because we haven't even made the project right so we want to be able to use this to create you know even the project folder and everything so now it's gonna do its thing so create react app is now installing obviously react web pack you know all the dependencies that it needs and there go done not bad under 30 seconds so you can see there's a lot of stuff here so it's pretty awesome all this stuff gets installed and it's ready to go it's ready for us to write you can see the instructions here not that hard like right now if we type the orange start we have an app so actually let's do that I'm sorry whoops I got a seat all right we got to go into our project folder it's amazing how many times I do that when I start a project like this I forget to CD into the actual project folder so let's type in yarn start and this should start up so I have a lot of other stuff running right now so it's not gonna run on the default local hosts I did not want it to run in that window Olo if you can see right now it's it's running right so we're using react so it's that easy that I mean technically we have reacts up and running it's working it's just a default but I mean that was pretty pretty fast alright so let me go back back over to where we were let's get this running was that 3001 yeah okay all right so obviously we're gonna remove a lot of this stuff but let's find our there we go so we want to I'm using I turn to and I'm gonna duplicate the tab so I have this other tab now since I'm running the server on this tab I can't really do anything there so I have another tab that's in the same folder and now in this tab this is where we're gonna run everything so I think we'll probably let's do a little bit before I actually make this a git repo I really don't like to make something to get repo right off the back cuz some of the early steps to set things up or just so basic I I don't know for me it's just like white clutter up my repo with some of that that stuff alright so I do want to open up Adam so I'm going to use Adam for this project as my editor in it open on the wrong screen so let me pull this over it's my other screen I hope that my machine can handle all this I just have so many projects open right now let's see there we go and make this fool screamed for now all right so here's our project you can see in our package.json we have react 16 okay really basic right now we're gonna pull in a lot of things we have some basic you have set up things that we do that we've been doing for all of our projects on the stream so our basic linting you Auto formatting with prettier standard jazz we're definitely going to bring that on we're gonna bring in react router we're gonna bring in Redux yeah so what you know why don't we we bring in all that stuff now and we'll set that stuff up before we even work at all on on any of the UI so I actually think I think I remember most of these most cities commands so I don't think I have to look up the documentation for some of these since I've been using using these and my my other side projects lately so they should be able to just do yarn add react router Dom okay so if we're using it for the web we won't react router Dom there's other versions of react router for react native so I'm gonna make sure we get the right version and then also we want redux actually I pretty sure it is Redux but I do want to double check to make sure that that is the correct thing so we had I don't know like a month or so ago there were NPM packages that were named like slightly different than the the normal package sisters posted on load and actually had malicious code in it so now I know I had double check there we go Redux on my other screen house trying to look up Redux yep it is Redux okay alright alright so this is gonna install that alright awesome so that was really fast that's confirmed right we now have Redux we have react router dawn great while we're at it let's bring in prettier and standard Jas right we don't really have that much by way of code but we may as well bring it in right off the bat and I found before if I work on a project for a while and then bring in standard Jas and prettier and we in husky and we auto format then I get a lot of errors and it takes it's a lot harder to work through that so if I bring it in right off the bat then I make little changes and tests so it's a lot easier to catch the errors and work through them so and the code is just cleaner right off the bat otherwise it ends up being a mess after a while so let's bring that in and for that I'm just gonna go to let me find the project where I'm already using it so this is resource center okay so yep we're using this in the resource center already let's check out our package.json and we will need this part of it so we're gonna need I'm gonna copy as much of this as I can let's copy this this copy goodness alright so we have a lot of stuff here we're not gonna copy everything I should say we're not gonna keep everything will be our we'll copy it and then take out what we don't need just copy this for now and put this down here so right now we don't need I made all of these right we're gonna leave State in there we're gonna need that eventually so we'll probably need these at some point so I'm just gonna leave them in here this is gonna make sure we don't get errors from using these oops copied one extra curly oops I forgot a comma okay there we go I love syntax highlighting helps to find errors so quickly you know immediately I saw red there and I knew like I never see red in the package.json with with the color scheme that I have so I just knew a use never I just don't realize how much it helps until I try to do something without it and then it's just like just so hard to look at code with without highlighting okay so we have this you don't need see we're not gonna run and there's do we need node fetch probably at some point we'll need it I'm gonna take that nightmare for now we may end up using this for testing at some point but right now I'm gonna leave it off probably need this okay we need okay that looks good I'm not sure about all of these that we need but that's close enough we'll probably want to do as well is update these so we'll do that too now we don't have ships let's find a project with that's let's look we have a lot more going on here with our scripts but at least we can find the lint and precommit and let's see that might be enough just to get us started so lint is gonna run all of this then we commit I actually need to grab actually may be good with that to start test without watch we're not gonna run I'm not gonna run the test because we didn't bring that in yet so okay that should be good enough there may be some other stuff in here that we'll want to bring out bring in after a while but this is quite enough right now all right so I'm gonna save that and then we're gonna run yarn and that's going to install whoa I got an error unexpected token so have something in here that should not be here mmhmm I think it's that one you can't have a trailing comma yep that was it so that'll run if you didn't catch that I've had this happen to me several times the last item in an array or in an object can't have a comma or else you get an error okay cool so that looks like it works but what I also want to do since it's possible that some of these packages have received upgrades since we started the last project I just want to upgrade them right now before we get too involved it should be easier to find any any issues with them before we have other things going on so I think it's a yarn upgrade it's either yarn upgrade or yarn updates all of your dependencies are uptodate okay cool I'm actually really surprised by that is that the right way okay that's not it that must be it must be the command I just really thought that there would have been some newer versions of these okay it's possible that I did update that project recently and I just don't remember okay so let's see what we have all right we have we do have some JavaScript files in here already that we can try to run the lint on and see if it changes anything so to run lint URL is not defined in this Service Worker all right so let's add that so this is why we have this down here this global so you can pull this out into a separate file which I've done some times but our package JSON is really not that big so I don't mind putting it in here for now if it got huge I would definitely pull it out though okay all right great so it ran through it see if it moved anything around I don't really remember what that looked like well enough to know if it moved anything around but we'll see an action later on as we as we do more okay so that's the end of the first Pomodoro session we have react we're an create react apps we have react installed with all the cool stuff that comes along with create react app we have installed Redux and react router we have Auto formatting and linting of our code with prettier standard j/s husky so every time we go to commit right we have this precommit hook now that will run our linter so it will run lint stage down here in lint stays on any javascript file it will run prettier right we have some some parameters here some flags here for what we want no semicolons we want single quotes and this will actually fix it it's not just gonna get less warnings it'll it'll change our code which is awesome so we'll have a standard style even if you you know get once we make this a get repo if you were to clone this and commit it would all be formatted the same and and then we'll do a git add so let me make sure components all right this should all work all right awesome so let's do our fiveminute questionandanswer session and then we'll come back in we do a little bit more and we'll make this a we'll put this on github before we end as well and then that way if you want to review it or if you want to just kind of copy it when it's at this early stage and use it as like a boilerplate that would that would work too okay well I have quite a lot in the live chat already well we have a we have a lot of viewers so awesome so imagine there's probably some new viewers welcome I'm going five minutes a question and answer now but if I don't get to your question don't worry about it I'll get to them later on so at the end whatever I haven't got to I'll go through at all and I'll answer all the questions so if you have a question to stick around and I will get to it okay so right now I'm just scanning through the live chat looking for any questions okay so also some helpful comments I'll read out as well I see a lot of you you're saying hi and what's up so hey everyone so James says I believe that single signon is going to be the best bet I agree I agree I'm hoping that I'm gonna have a meeting about it on Friday and I'm gonna ask more about the possibility of linking up the bulletin to the single signon system I hope that goes through I want to get out of the business of handling login issues because I've gotten quite a few calls and emails about this and it just takes up a lot of my time so I think the IT department is more well suited to handle that they have a help desk and a ticketing system and you know actual like employees whose job it is to take calls like that and so that's not really what my job is although I've been doing that because I I want my stuff to work and I'm upset when it doesn't work but yeah definitely definitely think the single signon will be the best way to go let's see Fernando says are you using JSON P what do you use to fetch JSON P data now it's just it's regular JSON it's not JSON P so I use fetch so currently in the current jQuery version of this it's all clientside so clientside fetch in this version that we're gonna make with react I'd like to do everything serverside or at least I should say this I don't know that I need to do everything serverside potentially we could do some calls clientside I don't need this to be rendered serverside at all so we'll see how it goes I see dentist that said you just installed it again to update so awesome thanks I didn't look up to see you so that but that was definitely the what I was what I was wondering about Kevin says in response to the JMP question is that Jason fees will work around four cores so the cross origin request if you use your own API or one with cores header like the WordPress API then you don't need to worry about JSON T yeah that's that's spoton right there yeah so since we have we are going to use the WordPress API we don't have to worry about that let's see okay Kevin also said Jesse will probably use native fetch with the polyfill fallback yep exactly Harshit says try using password list npm module for password this authentication okay cool I'll have to check that out I was I have been checking out some different options right now I'm using auth0 to handle the password this stuff but I think I do want to switch to something else I mean all 0 is nice but the plan there their level of their plan right now I'm using the free version of ofthere because there's not that many users but to get integration with the single signon I'd have to jump up to their business plan and it's just not worth it for that much money every month for an internal bulletin so I think you know we're going to try to go with something else let's see all right so I'm gonna mark down where I left off at the live chat okay so I did look up on my other screen the password list NPM package so I'm going to leave that on my screen so I don't forget and check that out after the stream so thanks for that Harshit and okay so let's get back to coding I just never the less comment I just noticed was just joined and while insurance in the US isn't that case so yeah I don't really know how it's like what it's like in other countries but here yeah insurance is weird in terms of which where you can go basically you're kind of limited so depending on what surance you have insurance you have you may not be able to go to a certain doctor that you want to go to or hospital and I mean you could always go there and just pay on your own but that's a lot of money so yeah but I mean the good news is I will go to see the doctor that I want to go see I just have to wait a little bit longer so and it's not I mean I'm not gonna be in serious trouble by waiting another month I've already been waiting I've already been dealing with this for several months not that big of a deal okay so the next step so yeah this will running what's our next step oh let's let's hook up Redux into our app and also react router right we don't really have anything set up for routes but let's just get this all hooked up now and so we're gonna want to go to our app I'm actually gonna bring up I'm gonna bring up on my other screen and oh I'm going to github right now and I'm gonna check out that last Redux project that I did on github that I showed everyone was it this I guess last week I showed everyone and that is the Udacity react and the readable projects said it yeah okay so if you if you want to check out where I'm getting the code from since I just implemented Redux with react router um I'm not going to try to go through documentation again I'm just gonna look at what I did and so this is it and this will be probably the last project that I worked on from my own github account so let's check out our source folder and I think it's an abscess yep this is it alright so I'm gonna move this over so I can copy and paste more easily but like I said you can check that out if you want okay so in our app dot J s that's in our source folder and I'll make this a little bigger for you all so in our source folder we are going to bring in a bunch of stuff so I'm gonna copy and paste a bunch and then I'll go through about what all these things are and we'll end up taking out some stuff eventually like you know logo dot SVG things like that but for right now it's fun to keep it in so here's what we brought in browsing router route and switch from reactor outer dome okay may or may not use all these we can remove the stuff we don't need we're gonna import create store apply middleware and compose from redux all right obviously and if you've done this before this is kind of basic but for those of you who are new to react it might be helpful if I kind of go through these we're importing now right now we don't have reducers right so we're gonna have to make that but we're gonna want to bring that in and we're gonna import provider from react redux and are we gonna actually I don't know if when you dunk or not you think yeah we might end up needing so I should bring that in so probably what I'll need to do is is pull these in so I don't get errors so let me check the package.json for this project see what else I need what I forgot to bring in and I did I forgot to bring in a few packages so let's do that right now so the yarn and we need react redux and redux thunk there we go okay make sure didn't miss anything else okay so now those will load well yeah we'll let that do its thing yep coming in so let's go back over here and continue to add these and and right now normally we would import our views so I'm just gonna put some of this here so we don't forget to import our views and just see what we would what we do here so you don't have to do this in your app dutchess if you don't have that many views I think it's fine but otherwise you could have like a routes component where you put all your routes in so we may move it into another component at some point but for now it's it's easier to see it all at once like this so we would bring in for each like page or each you we wanted we would import it so we've imported that component for now we don't have any of these created so I'm gonna comment all of them out and then let's bring in this alright so we're gonna use this logger okay so we want okay we want more than just the basic redux right we want to bring in some tools to help us figure out what's going on with our store so that's where is this some of this comes in so this is optional but very helpful I don't I wouldn't really want to work with redux without some of these tools to help I'm pretty new with redux maybe you know if someone's more advanced with it they wouldn't need it but I definitely need some of this stuff so this this logger we're gonna get a bunch of stuff in our console also let's bring in let's let me bring in a few things here okay so this is going to be our dev tools extension and I think I showed you all that extension last week and we'll definitely see it again as we work on this project but this is very helpful it's gonna add another another tab onto our dev tools window and we're gonna be able to see a lot of information about our store right so while this is definitely useful this is more user friendly so probably not necessary to have both maybe one or the other I think especially in development more information is better but I could definitely see especially with this your console can get quite cluttered so may not be a bad idea to get rid of this if you're trying to hunt out like other errors and it's just too cluttered but definitely keep this one okay and then here we're actually creating our store now here's the thing we are not bringing in that reducer yet so we're gonna at least need to create the file and I'm not sure if it'll be enough just to create the file or if we'll still get errors but I mean we're definitely gonna get in an error nothing there at all and then this is where we pull in our middleware so we're bringing in right our logger thunk our Redux dev tools right so ringing thunk from here bring in our logger from here ok let's go down a little bit further so we need to wrap everything in provider so that way our application has access to the store right so now everything is wrapped in that now since we're also using react router we're gonna wrap everything in browser router as well okay so right now we don't have routes but potentially we could have a setup something like this where inside of here we don't actually have you know whereas right now we have markup for our homepage we would get rid of all the markup there and inside of this would just be our browser router and then switch in and all arouse you can see our home page becomes a component our home component right and here's our other views so we'll probably end up building something like this for now it's not necessary we'll have to take a look and just think about all the different routes that we want and then we'll set those up okay so I'm just gonna look through here quickly just to make sure I haven't missed anything oh we need to make our our reducers right so let's do that now or at least make our reducer folder so we're just gonna make on a command line we're gonna make directory so mkdir to make directory I haven't done this on Windows for a while is it the same on Windows I'm on a Mac right now it's the same one Linux I know there are some differences in command line commands on Windows but having done most development on Windows so it's actually been at least two years now so don't remember all the differences so anyway our gonna make directory we're gonna call it reducers oops we want it to be in our source folder and then and then reducers okay now we're also going to make a file so we're gonna do touch is how you make a file we're going to source reducers and then we want to call this index oops index dot J us not a CMO okay so now we should be able to see reducers index all right so let's save that see if we get any errors yep we got an error what's going on here expected the reducer to the function okay so I'm not I do need to do a little bit more than I have done with the reducers so let's see what's this what's the least I can do and every reducer let's see let's see dishes so I'm look at my other screams Jennifer yeah what's the minimum I could write in my reducer at this point oh let's just do this let's find a producer and let's see if we can get away with doing okay so at first we definitely want to export when we're gonna want to bring in combined reducers some of us will just do it right now okay so we're bringing that in so we can have more than one reducer we don't have any actions set up right now so normally you would import your actions as well but I don't have that set up this is the thing about Redux that's was frustrating to me when I first did it is that it doesn't really work unless you have reducers your store your actions all in place so we'll see I'm not even sure if this will work unless I put in some actions but let's see basically we're definitely going to need posts so let's see if we can get posed let me make sure I didn't miss something up here okay a function and we want this to be say she posts uh name at that for now we could always change it we're gonna make this state so just by default we'll have just an empty object for the state and then you know what I think I am gonna have to pull in the action we'll see we might not so anyway here's our action so we'll pull in here is our state as a default so this is a default parameter so if there is no state passed in it will default to this otherwise it will take whatever state we pass in and then inside of here we want a switch statement and we want action type okay so if you haven't worked with Redux before this probably doesn't make very much sense but what we're gonna have is another file called actions we're going to import that into there based on what the type of action is we're gonna want to do something different in this function so that's what we're that's we're pulling in so if let's say if the case is I don't know get posts and I'm open to suggestions for naming because I'm just trying to name what whatever I can hear based on what I think we'll need we don't need this break so if the case is get posts let's return and we're gonna run a return state and then we're gonna run to turn this house those see see how I'm not really sure what I'm naming everything right now so we'll just put that in there for now I think that should work we'll see we'll get an error if it doesn't and then we're just going to return state by default so for right now we shouldn't get anything because we're not actually passing in anything so it should just return nothing for the state and then down here actually since we're combining reducers let's do this and we're gonna do is I am gonna want to have sorting maybe a sort function or filter let's have some sort of sorting and for now I'm just gonna leave that sorting okay that'll probably make sense later but I want to keep basically information about how we're gonna sort the the posts I'm gonna keep that in our store and then that way it can persist across across components across use more easily okay now let's export for defaults combined so this is where that combined reducers comes in combined reducers and now we can put together our receive posts and our sorting okay let's save that and see what kind of errors we get get post or not to find so sorting okay let's define those then we I think we are gonna have to make our actions as well but that's not a big deal we may as well set the whole thing up now and it'll be kind of a more complete explanation of everything so let's import when we say get post and what else do we wanna get those and set sorting from we're going to say actions okay so yeah right so we don't have actions so now let's make a folder called actions so let's go back here actions and also I'm going to make file our actions and now let's make some actions and let's put it over here put them sidebyside so we can remember what's going on here okay so we're going to eventually we may have some API calls happening for now I'm not gonna worry about that but what we do want to do is export so we want to exports okay and so now we're going to use these constants instead of the strings down here also obviously here right so let's go so this is going to be good Oh schools oh s and in here we're gonna make an object and we're gonna send out it so this is where the type comes in so you can see over here we want to get action type here's the type so this is where we want to put get posts all right so that'll let this reduce or know what we want to do and then we're gonna pass in our posts okay and we want to do the same thing for a sorting so sorter that we called it was it sorting set sorting set sorting and let's go sort by and sort okay let's see I caught it sorter huh let's just changes here loser okay so you can see in both cases what's gonna get sent from here now this is not everything right we actually I wonder if I can make it work just like that normally I would do more it might actually work let's just see if this works enough to get this to load awesome so it actually did load so now at least I can show you in dev tools a Redux panel okay so obviously our state right so we have two parts to our state we have that received posts and we have sorting right and that corresponds to what we've done here receive posts and sorting right now they're just empty arrays or I'm sorry empty objects if I've been saying arrays that was on accident these are objects apologize for that right so right now that's the end of a 25minute session so I'm gonna do five minutes of questions but just to summarize we've got Redux connected here at the root of our our app here we have Redux connected we've added some middleware so we have some console logging going on with our store we have our extension for depth and we have thunk which we aren't using yet but we probably will use later on we also brought in react router although we haven't done anything with routes yet it's all ready to do we've set up our reducers and we set up some actions ok now we're not entirely finished with our actions but it's set up enough so that we don't get errors and we're able to see our state so not bad we've come a long way and in our two 25minute Pomodoro sessions so let me start my fiveminute timer and I'm gonna go to the live chat and answer some more questions all right so I'm pretty behind on the questions thanks for your patience if you're waiting for me to answer your question okay Harsha said if you are using yarn for everything try using yarn Global for global packages actually I should do that I don't know why I used NPM and didn't think about using yarn globally anyway see John Hansen says yarn start is the easy part yes yeah this is all kind of the easy part for right now okay Harshit sis saying you forgot react Redux so thanks for that I didn't see that beforehand eventually I did figure it out though but thank you for for putting that in the left shot for me Ishmael says how can I get what he's copying I don't have the project actually here let me put this on the screen again because this was a different project so let's let me let me copy I'm gonna put this link in the live chat right now and maybe I'll put it it I'm gonna try my best to remember afterwards to put it in the description so that the link I just paste it in is where I was copying a lot of this from this is a redux project that I did for my Udacity nano degree I just finished it up last week actually I did I just finished it up over the weekend I think so Saturday I finished it sorry if there is just a noise my mic fell over so hopefully it's alright now okay Kevin asks if I've used atoms get integration no I haven't used it yet I'll have to try it out this so if anybody does use atoms get integration what do you think about it is it is it better than using you know a separate like terminal to handle all your get stuff I wonder so you get how interesting you can create a repo right from here cool I'll have to play around with that later on Patrick caught that trailing comma before I did too so thanks Patrick good eye on that one let's see Blake asked how long does it take to run create react app I think what it took almost 30 seconds to do it I'm sure it depends on your computer but it was pretty pretty fast oh okay thank you so harsh it says use yarn upgrade with a flag latest so I'm gonna do that now it's always interesting when this happens to see if anything breaks we try to use latest but at the beginning of the project is definitely the time to do something like that so it looks like only one what wood has been updated is in Craig food it looks like a lot of warnings and so I guess a lot did not need to be updated hmm okay bread says I typically just watched Jesse's live streams and don't try to follow along maybe make some notes on paper when I do create the project I watch the video and pause if I get stuck ok cool I actually like hearing how how people watch these I know some people have said that they go back and like they watched the recording on like 2 times speed somebody even said they watched it on four times speed before and then I know some of you work on other projects and just kind of listen in the background and joining the live chat you know if you hear something that you know you're interested in so that's kind of cool I mean I know these it's not like the normal coding tutorial video or anything like that so I think it's cool that there's different ways to handle this live stream alright so my 5 minutes is up and let's see ok so I marked down where I stopped in the live chat and now let's do we've done two Pomodoro sessions which that's usually the minimum I think I'm going to do one more Pomodoro session and in this session we would definitely commit this would make it a repo we'll commit it put it on github that way you all will have access to all of this and then we'll see so probably what I'm gonna start with is making it a repo actually let's just to continue with what we were doing let's finish off this actions file here this is we need a little bit more before it'll really be functional then we'll commit everything if we have extra time after that then we'll move on and see what else we can do ok so what we want to do you find trying to find my other projects the simplest example for now most of my actions involve making a call to an API rather find a better example maybe I actually maybe this is fine let me let me pull over what I've been doing so I've been doing things like this so oh yeah so I've been doing things like this where I wouldn't directly call this I would call like let's imagine this is fetch post into the category so I would call fetch post then it would from from another file which would be this API utility then it would pull in from the API the posts then it would call let's say get posts and pass that in but I guess since I'm not doing that right now this should work and in this case directly from a component I would just dispatch this action and then pass in whatever I want so for now I think we'll be fine but just know that if we wanted to call an API where we would do it is probably in here I would put all the API stuff in another file and then from the component we would call the action that would then make the API call and then what gets returned from that call would get passed to another action this action would only be called from inside of the actions folder anyway and then that data would get passed to the reducer and then the reducer is what takes that information and basically let's see where deucer is so the reducer would then take that information and do whatever we tell it to do with that in this case it's it's combining it with the previous state so what we wanted to do is only update the things that have changed okay and then that gets that's what ends up getting into the store and then it becomes available to our components to use so that's kind of the flow I am NOT an expert in Redux I've developed one thing that has successfully worked with Redux so just keep that in mind whenever going through my explanation of redux this is a way to do Redux that has worked for me one time so I don't want to give you the wrong impression that this is the way to do it but it is a way that does work probably not the best way but I don't really know okay so now having realized that this is sufficient for now let's just turn this into a git repo so let's run git move this up a bit I just now I realized that my timer I never started it and also it's being blocked by my face so now you can see it nothing that matters for to give you an idea how much time we have left so let's get in it get in it okay so we've initialized this and let's go with so now we can see this is what we have that would be being our git repository so we'll see so when we do create react app it already came with the get ignore file so we don't have to worry about that now if you were doing a project and you weren't really strapping it with anything you would want to have your own gate ignore file or maybe you have a global file but anyway so all this stuff doesn't get included right so that's why our node modules aren't included when we get we did status so we're gonna do a git add write kit add also we need to put the dot for all now let's check the status again right so everything now is and is ready to be committed so now we'll do a git commit I'm gonna use the EM flag right to burn a commit message right there in line and I'm just gonna say an it for initial our initial commit right now if we check our status we're all good right nothing needs to be committed but we're not actually linked up with github yet right there's nothing on there so that's our next step let's go to github and let me bring this over so here we have github and let's make a new repo I want FUS mark on so that's Franciscan University still the marketing communications department where I work and we're gonna call this bulletin react okay it's just a little description we are gonna make this public and yeah we have a readme so we're not gonna initialize with the readme doing how to license let's add a license and we'll just go with this that should be fine I'm not really super knowledgeable about the difference in licenses I usually look them up every time but I'm pretty sure that this will be okay for what we're doing and we we don't want to add get ignored we already have one so let's create this okay so now let's wait a second sorry usually I'm losing my mind here I could have sworn that usually another screen pops up initially that has some other some other options did I mess this up let me check the live chat see if I messed it up maybe I hit the wrong thing no nobody said I hit the wrong thing I need to pull in an existing repository is that enough it's possible that I just messed this up hola oh okay so thank you Jake Jake said it's because I added the license so the first commit was the license okay what's gonna be faster it may be faster to just delete this and do it again because now I have let's just delete it and do it again honestly supposed to already exists yeah I didn't want to hit back I just wanted to delete all right okay see there's there's some commands I can just came out at origin all right I won't delete it let's just work with this all right so let's go get remote okay I think this is it okay all right so great there's no tracking information set upstream should be okay using to merge unrelated histories so it's just push them get close nope dang it is there some way you can force okay no refusing diversion really issues again alright let me check the latch out again maybe I should just delete the license and then the fish organized yeah so I I tried to do a git push origin master already and I'm getting maybe doing a pool rebase let's let's just see okay awesome okay so thank you thank you Matt I got the flag now where's my there it is okay yes it's this is whoa all right so it popped up on my other screen to have me put in a merge message there we go okay cool all right now let's check it make sure it went through everything works looks like it works okay great so yeah it was actually kind of cool that that happened I've never had that happen to me before but it's good to know so if you're trying to initialize a new repository probably better just to not add the license that readme get ignore with github because then you're gonna have to merge like we did here so this is what ended up working so thanks again Matt for that get pool with a flag allow unrelated histories ok so there might have been other ways to do it probably usually with get there's definitely like more than one way to do a thing but that's what works but we ended up with two different initial commits so a little bit sloppy here at the beginning that's okay but now we have it so now basically everything that we've just done is available in github if I hadn't have added this license what would have happened is that it would have taken me to a screen that would have had I think like three different sets of instructions depending on what I wanted to do one of those sets I believe it's the middle one would have had instructions for how to bring in the repository that I had locally into into here so would have just had me add you know like the remote so pretty much the same steps only when we did the push it would have just worked we wouldn't have to have done the pool merge and then push okay and CEO Samuel okay that's for 13 minutes let's see let me just take a quick look at where we're at with this project to see if it's worth it to finish out this Pomodoro session or just wait for the next session so we have our linting we could probably set up a few routes for our views I just saw on the live chat Jimmy says does he reply to his viewers yes I do reply to the viewers but I go back and forth between coding and replying so after I finish up this session of coding I'm gonna reply to everything so just hang in there for a little while longer if you can and I'll answer any questions that you have okay so yeah let's go through and just add a few routes that we know that we need so let's get rid of this logo I don't need that anymore we're going to take it out and let me take all of this out we're gonna add in a switch nope not that kind of switch and then we're gonna add in some routes and I think I have some routes that I can copy and paste yeah let's copy and paste a few routes in here just to save us some time so obviously we're gonna want a home route so let's just we'll stick with that we'll make a component called home and then we're going to uncomment that and then let's see what else do we want we don't need to create post actually I think these two can stay what else what else would we have yeah let's just stick with these three for now we may want to add some more I'm gonna have to give this some more thought kind of look look over what we have now and just see what the best way would be to set these up but these three I know for sure we'll need so we have these now when I save this I'm gonna get an error because these files don't actually exist yet get rid of this one and uncomment these so we need to make a folder called views and then we need to add these these files so let's go back to our command line and see we obviously we have the error let me get rid of some of this as well okay so skill I think directory use source views let's actually want to go into it it'll just be easier to make multiple files so we want to make a home is hey let's see we want when we want category dot J s and post detail Dodge ass okay so that should have just made all three of those and we'll check it out yep so now we have all three of these I yeah so that does not not actually done anything because we don't have anything in those files you get so let's let's just make something in these files so we can get rid of yours so that's what would be the quickest thing we could do let me see if I can just copy and paste some you know boilerplate stuff in here hmm a lot of stuff that I'm saying is is way more advanced than boilerplate let's see if I can find something really simple so I can't find anything really simple right now I'm just gonna have to copy and paste something a little bit more complex and then get rid of a lot but it's actually not bad because we can see how we hook up some of these things from redux so let me just go over this for now so up at the top we've imported connect and we're putting in so we have our map state two props this is going to make the state whatever we want from our store available as props in this component so in this case we have our categories available we also are bringing in our dispatch so if you remember in our actions this is how we can pull in and call those those actions right so for one thing we now have dispatch available to use but we can also use fetch we use Fest data within our component and that calls this that dispatches this fetch categories and we could pass in things if we need it to here and then so we're not just normally exporting our component which in this case I just copy side nav from another project but we're using connect first and then we have the side nav of there which there's a name for this it's called currying so when you when you do it like this it's called currying I'm not gonna attempt to explain currying because it's a new concept for me that I just learned within the last month but that's what it's called if you want to look it up and figure out more about what's going on here so for now I'm gonna get rid of this because we don't you'll need it see if I can shouldn't see if I could leave something in here and it wouldn't mess anything up I guess state we could pull in something so let's pull something in here we have get posts yeah so let's pull in posts I know there's nothing right now but since we're going to have this stuff at some point we may as well just bring it in so state ok and for a dispatch let's just get rid of this for now whoops get rid of the wrong one you'll probably end up pulling that map dispatch the props back in at some point when we set up our API calls but for now we don't have those set up so I don't want to include them let's get rid of a lot of this stuff so pretty much everything let's just keep actually let's do something cool that's react 16 let's put in let me remember the syntax for this I think it's we're gonna return an array so let's return an array let's do h1 key one and then to CP okay we are gonna have to rename this and also we don't need this and let's pull out meat connects though but so this is where we would bring in import some of our actions that we wanted to use that we wanted to dispatch so for now we're not gonna use any of those but I guess we could just comment it out since we will be pulling some in when we're not gonna use link right now but we probably will end up having some links probably in we'll probably have a separate side knife component at some point so may not use the link here because each post love its own component but import status I don't think we have that yeah we don't have styles yet so we'll comment it out but we will have styles we may end up doing some styling a different way we may do our Styles try to do everything inside the component we'll see I like to try out different things styling wise especially with react because there's so many different ways of doing styling but we'll see will this work maybe this should work for this one and we can just copy and paste this for all our other views that was category of you know all right let me change this category all right let's save that now let's go to the home view and put that in there great okay save that and then finally post let's call this alright now let's see if this works no I must use the wrong syntax alright I'm gonna have to look up the syntax then I thought I had it yeah I do that all the way already up on a screen alright so let me bring this over she could see what I'm talking about so this is a is react version 16 it goes through some of the new stuff and first thing on here is okay so you returned it like that that's what I was going for initially let's see this will work now and my timer just went up so this will be the last thing that we do so if it works did it not work what am I doing wrong I should be able to return that is it only for for elements that are alike oh do I need to put maybe I need to do this because it's an array right that makes sense see if this works now it's not showing it oh well I guess I'm doing it wrong I didn't read it wrong it's possible yeah it's possible that maybe you can't do elements that aren't alike hmm yeah the only example on here does show all the elements to the same elements so maybe that's maybe that's the issue so actually let's know I don't I don't see why that would be an issue okay I could just I got it I got to figure this out I'm like this will be the last thing that we do let's see all right so I would like to know before we end this dream what what the issue is with this and why it's not working if I'm misunderstanding this all right let's see by this asagi love this other component so maybe I am misunderstanding how this is supposed to work alright I'm gonna try one more thing see if it works and then if it doesn't work I'm just gonna wrap these in another element and so I'm gonna try to make these both paragraph tags that was and see those and just let me fix this page so it looks like this I think the error I'm getting is unrelated to this so it looks like maybe that this would actually work as long as you're using the same the same tags so now what is going on here okay so the root component is wrapped in provider so that should work so what's going on here Connect let's check out see art we're bringing in provider we have wrap this in provider and then this is inside of that okay that's weird all right let me it's preferring this tourism ok so I got something going on with oh you're okay Harshit you're right I'd never passed the store so okay thank you for catching that okay awesome okay so home this is the home page let's go to category this is category page awesome and if we do category slash whatever it should give us the post detail page great okay so this works we already saw that our store was working now we were actually are passing the store down react router is working we have our routes and we've done some cool react 16 stuff and that we've returned to elements without them being in a containing element so pretty cool so so far we've we use one of the new react 16 cool things that it can do alright so I definitely went over my 25 minute session there so I'm going to go to the live chat now it's been a long stream already so I totally understand if you can't stick around for the live chat if that's the case then thank you so much for watching and join us again sometime please but if you can stick around even if you don't have a question it would be awesome if you could stick around and help to add your expertise to our answers to the questions if you do have a question go and put it in the live chat now I'm gonna do my best to get to all the questions and if I have an answer I will give an answer and a lot of the other people in the live chat are very knowledgeable and can can add to the answers okay so I'm going to scroll back up to where I left off and just go down through the list ahman says Redux versus mob x your views so I have not used mob X yet I have watched some YouTube videos on mob X and seen a presentation at a conference on mob X based on that it seems like mob X is easier to use but as I said I haven't used it yet i've only used redux so i don't know for sure you know from personal experience I'm also I'm not 100% sure which situations would be better in terms of you know it is is mob X a perfect replacement for redux you know could it be used in every situation I don't know so I don't have enough experience with it so at this point I'm using redux because I've learned Redux that's what I know I'm definitely open to using mob X in the future but I would like to get a little bit better with redux first so that I could make a more informed you know comparison when I switch and try out my bags rohan asked what single signon provider will you guys be using actually I don't I don't know what they're going with right now so I'll have an answer for you later on so they said on Friday I'm gonna have a meeting the meeting is actually related to how we're gonna brand the single signon there's going to be some discussion about rebranding some of the applications that the university uses so maybe like a different look different naming I'm in favor of just being really simple and straightforward with the naming so we'll see how that meeting goes but I am gonna bring up tying in this project into the single signon system so I don't know if there'll be anybody at the meeting that's directly working on the technical side of this but at least I'll be able to figure out who I should talk to that's that can give me the answers about you know technically how are we gonna tie this in so maybe for Friday's stream I'll have an answer okay so James Henderson says it is a pain let me know if you have any questions on the single signon oh I definitely I appreciate you offering offering the help so yeah I mean I guess it it has to be somewhat complicated they've been working on it for a while so must not be the easiest of things to do q the dev says what level of coding is this I'm fairly new to coding should I stay or view your earlier videos did get some answers to that already Blake Thomas says I'm a beginner but this is still neat to listen and to pick up a few things Brett says I'd stay on but if you go back to Jesse's first react project using next jsut be in good shape that one is simpler to start with yeah yeah basically I would agree with that assessment so occasionally we do things that are more simple more beginner friendly usually when we do some of the like just building out the UI using CSS and things that's somewhat more beginner friendly but sometimes we do get into some backend things DevOps and so those are more advanced but I do I think that there are some things some useful things I try my best to explain things as I go through so I think even a beginner could get some useful things out of this if you can make it through all the other parts also the question and answer session is always open to anything so if you do have a question about something you know you need a little bit more explanation or you have a question that's just entirely unrelated to that project we're working on that's fine too so then you can still get something out of the livestreams but certainly understand if you know maybe at this point you're not getting out of it you know totally understandable but definitely ask questions if you can I'm open to that okay kevin says Jesse just a reminder to check the last few comments whenever there is a bug thanks thanks for that Kevin I you would think that I would remember automatically from now on but sometimes I remember sometimes I don't so I'm sure I'll get better at that as I as I scream more okay harsh it says Redux saga is also great for async calls and Redux instead of Redux thunks okay I have I haven't used saga yet but I have heard about it so maybe I'll maybe I'll try that out we'll see I mean we haven't really done anything yet with thunks so it's possible that we could just switch over to saga at some point so let me know what you all think which one do you think is easier to implement is one clearly better than the other one so at this point you know we're just starting out so now's the time to to switch if I'm going to switch I'll definitely have to do a little bit of learning to figure out how to do it but yeah if one's clearly better then let me know I'll definitely switch to be asked what is a thunk okay so probably be good to look up Redux thunks because I don't know that my explanation is gonna be the best but Redux thunks are good when you're doing things like API calls basically the handle try trying to remember how this was explained initially to me I've used them and I know they're helpful but how do I explain it if anybody has to get explanation please put it in I don't see anything right now but basically let me see it's a it's a way to handle asynchronous things in Redux so someone please correct me if I'm if I'm the this handle in this room but I think the best way it's a way to handle things that would be asynchronous with in redux like trying to think I should just I should look up you know quickly what the correct terminology is I don't want to lead anyone astray here okay so here's the official explanation this may or may not help for those of you who can't see the screen right now I will read it out Redux thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action the thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action or to dispatch only if certain conditions are met the inner function receives the store methods dispatch and get state as parameters an action creator that returns a function to perform an asynchronous dispatch okay so here's some code example to do the asynchronous dispatch here's one to do the conditional dispatch okay so I think in my case how we'd be using thunks is more like we're gonna return basically the idea that we can return a function instead of an action is what's useful to to my case so you can check out as well the repo was that yeah so this is the repo that I was using before to to get some examples when I was copy and pasting things so we can see reserve reducers actions okay so here's what I'm doing with some of the actions then like I'm using let's see where I'm pulling this init yes you've seen some of my dispatches and let me actually show you the API as well I'm kind of flying through this I know but you can look at this more slowly if you want to if you go to my github profile that's or misc is opposed you to okay so here's how I'm calling these and then I'm returning the data in JSON format so plays it obviously I'm not like completely an expert on thunks I just know how to use them and I know that they they work but I can't give a great explanation for it but anyway it looks like there's an indepth introduction to thunks here so I'm not gonna go through it but here's what it is what it looks like so yeah that's that's pretty long that might be one of the longest Stack Overflow answers I've ever seen so anyway I guess check check out the github repo for for Redux thunk sorry I couldn't give you a great explanation but hopefully I gave you some resources they can explain it better than I can okay cool earlier I was mentioning that Windows command line commands are are different so in the case I was talking about the make directory so mkdir for Linux and Mac makes a new directory in windows it's MD so but har should also said you can get the bash commands for Windows pretty easily and you can run Linux subsystem for Windows as well so that's really cool if I start developing on Windows again I'm definitely enough to set that up oh cool har should also typed in the bare minimum function that I needed when I was looking for to set up the reducers so thanks horseshit I'm sorry I didn't look over at that that would have been faster but it's not too bad we have some you know basic stuff set up that I know we'll use later on so I guess it worked out is Slee ninja says why switch if if can do the same job Harshit responded saying it is the common practice in the read up community do you switch to handle action type so also says I feel it's more readable personally so yeah basically I mean that's how I learned to do it I've never seen it done otherwise it doesn't seem like it's very useful right now since we only have one case but usually I have a lot more cases than that so you can see I think one of these is my yeah so you can see all right select for this one I'm like 7 cases here so this is definitely better than than an if statement ok harsh it says Jessie please setup and grub for this project I'd love to see the action live last time alright awesome thank you for suggesting that I had completely forgotten about it so I'm definitely going to try to get that set up as soon as I can and probably for some of the other projects I can do it as well so I had idea for an idea for project 3 so we've been worked out was the project where we were working with dotnet framework so my idea is since we're basically just working on UI stuff now and then at some point we're going to hook it up to the content management system the first stage where we're just working on the UI we don't really need it to be in dotnet framework what we can do is just pull that out and make it a git repo and just set it up and run I don't know maybe we'll just run it with gulp as our as our task runner and I'll have that on github and then that way you all can check out all the code easily on github I can run the project with an grok you can see that we don't have to deal with like manually refreshing things or the slowness in general of the website so I think that's what I'm gonna do so we'll see I have some other project coming up so hopefully at some point this week I can get all that set up and then you all can I mean you all can even submit pull requests if you want so I think it'll be a much better way to do it we can build out everything we want for all the different templates in there and then when the time comes we'll just copy and paste everything in and maybe pull it out into different components and try to hook it all up then but it would be nice to do it like that and then we can even I can show it to other people in my department and get feedback I think it'll be a much tighter like feedback loop in general if we can do it like that so that's coming to I'll set up and drop for that one as well and that says so you're good with Redux now let's use the term good loosely and say that I'm good with Redux right to be more accurate I have successfully completed one project with Redux and that was the the kind of blog projects that allowed you to do comments and vote so yeah that was that was my one project so yes I'd say good in the very very loose use of the term get shine says hello sir what does it do redux thunk and what is reselect library I don't I don't know what Reis elect libraries referring to I guess I'm missing that so if you could clarify more about that then maybe I can answer you as far as redux thunk so I just answered a similar question of that so go ahead and I just go with what I had what I said there and that is basically check out the redux thunk github page and there's some examples there and a link to more information so I don't want to I did a terrible job of trying to explain it a few minutes ago so I don't want to attempt it again and throw you off giving you an explanation that's not accurate so I just go I'd recommend go right to the source and that's probably where you're gonna get the best information Kiyoshi says this is my first time here interesting to see how you do everything in real time thanks you're welcome thanks for watching yeah hopefully you can join us again sometime Rohan says what youtube 4 times speed is that extension what extension I don't know I I don't know how they did it four times speed but someone some point said that they watched my videos in for time speed so yeah I know YouTube only lets you go to what like to time speed so it must have been some sort of extension but I I never asked what the extension was so if anybody knows put it in the live chat please or later on if you're watching the recording in in the comments all right Dule says off the topic where can I find how to use things from materialize in my code pen projects encode pen you can import materialize so if you click on you have to click on where you import CSS and JavaScript until you want to import from the from a CDN materialized JavaScript and their CSS so if you go on the materialized site under the getting started tab they should have the the URLs that you'll need to bring in and that's how you want to do it so let me know if if if you're having trouble with that send me a direct message on Twitter my Twitter a link to my Twitter account is in the description this video and I can I can help you out more but just from memory I haven't actually used codepen in a little while but at least that used to be the way that you would do it I don't think the UI has changed or anything so that's just still work ok so Matt says redux thunk allows you to dispatch multiple readout to actions without returning a Taipan value ok awesome thank you Matt that's that's a very concise way to explain that so definitely better than my explanation so shine again asks then what is reselect library and making react projects so again I yeah I don't really know what reselect is Jake says there's a pretty good flowchart that everyone recommends for react redux but can't post links ok so evidently is a good flowchart out there so we don't have the link but maybe it's hopefully it's not too hard to find so I know I've seen several different pictures of it just to get a visual of the flow which will probably be easier than my explanation at least for me a visual is always pretty easy to grasp so there's I know there's a bunch of them out there so if you want to kind of dig deeper and get a better understanding of redux then you know probably probably shouldn't take too long to search for that Harshit says Jessie I have a great suggestion for you if you are using prettier use its atom package it has linting integration and enable format on submit that is a good suggestion Thanks you know what I somebody suggested that before and I just I just never got around to doing it and just kind of forgot about it so I'm gonna have to do that yeah that'll probably be good and then that way I'll automatically get the formatting and I won't have to wait for a commit so that will definitely be useful so thanks for that let's see okay so it looks like Matt is commenting on this reselect library so this has never used it but it looks like it aims to reduce redux actions and Redux reducers into one function oh that's interesting okay that's kind of cool I might like to see that I mean right now I'm just learning so maybe it's better if I keep everything separate you know and it'll be easier to understand based on tutorials but at some point it it might clean things up actually to have them combined okay so uh Blake says so I ran NPM start and I can't stop it okay and Matt respond to just use controlc and that that works everywhere well at least it works in linic and max I'm pretty sure it's the same on Windows but yeah control see you'll get you out of it all right Madison use a stateless function yeah I'll probably I'll go through and use stateless functions at some point right now probably gonna end up having to use stateful functions or I should say basically using like the class method if that's what it's called but you all know what I'm talking about and react so you know using the class here so for a lot of these components I'm going to end up needing this so later on I can go back through then and change them into functional components but at this point I'm thinking that I'll probably end up needing it like this okay so control see does work on Windows we got verification of that alex says another react project you should do angular typescript and rxjs or some serious stuff you know I honestly didn't even think about that really I since I'm doing the course on react right now I'm just kind of like trying to do like I'll react all the time and just multiply my gains here on on learning so I'm not opposed to other things to be honest with you if I'm gonna do something else right now I probably try out view I just a lot of people that I follow on Twitter seem to be talking about view so I think I tried that out over angular but I'm not opposed to it we'll see for for my work here at the University I would actually like to use the same thing for everything just to make it easier to keep up with and then potentially if we need to hire more developers just to be able to like say like this is the skill set we need and you know instead of saying like we need somebody that can do all these different things that are familiar with all these different frameworks so probably won't use things that are too different from react for these streams but potentially I don't know it could happen but I can't make any guarantees about it right now oh it looks like a few of you also said view get try view harsh that says what headphones ease I don't know let me see I don't really know it doesn't say it just says the logo it's a SteelSeries so I got these so long ago I can't remember I can't remember what they are I could maybe look back at my Amazon history and see so I come from Amazon I think they were around $50 60 L or something like that I really can't remember because it's been so long but I like these headphones they're comfortable I can't wear these all day and you know my ears maybe we'll get a little bit sore but generally like they're they're pretty good if you're like all about sound probably you want to get better ones it does have a retractable mic so I can use this but it doesn't work with with Mac so it's just a regular like headphone jack it doesn't work with a Mac it works with my android phone as a mic so I guess keep that in mind I I had kind of got these before I really started working with max but so I probably go with something different I mean I have another mic for this Mac but it'd be good to have it maybe like for my laptop but anyway if anybody's really interested in what these headphones are let me know because I'll look it up in my Amazon purchase history and then I can get you exactly what information about exactly what these are now that I'm actually showing my face on youtube I was thinking about getting one of those like ridiculous like gamer headphones that lights up different colors and things just so it's a little bit more interesting I don't know what do you think do you have any suggestions let me know huh all right I'm getting almost to the bottom here of the live chat okay somebody mentioned semicolons and Rowan says they're entirely optional in jazz yeah so if it looks weird that I'm not using semicolons it it is weird I mean it it's definitely weird if you're not used to seeing it like that but yeah something you don't need semicolons I don't want to start any trouble here because sometimes people get strong opinions about this whether or not you should use semicolons I like it I like not using semicolons to me it's like as long as the code is still readable and it works then typing less is better than typing more so that's how I feel about it I have heard and I can't remember exactly when but there are some use cases where you want the semicolon in because it doesn't work how do you think it would but it's been my experience that's that's rare so I don't know it just depend on what you're using it for so if you're thinking about quitting semicolons then I would check it out first to see in what cases you shouldn't do it and then see if those cases ever come up for you and if they don't then you know they'd get rid of the semicolons but yeah I don't for my projects I don't like semicolons but it doesn't bother me if other people use semicolons see okay so James Henderson had a followup before he had mentioned to let him know if you need I needed help with the single signon stuff so he said it's somewhat easy it depends on the product I've also tested SSO single signon that is where there are some fun times as a service for the dev team so alright so evidently it does that makes a lot of sense of defense on the product I mean that's okay that's what I my experience with let's several other things as well James also says the only dumb question is the question you don't ask and that is sometimes the only way you learn please don't take that as being rude I always learn from the videos yeah it definitely that's so if anybody's right now watching and you got a question you know I'm sure if you should ask it ask it don't worry about it just ask the question and as long as it's not like something really offensive I'm gonna answer it so certainly anything developer related ahhoho answer for sure so yeah but any don't think the questions to like beginner or anything like that like I'm not gonna make fun of anybody for any questions although if you've been on watching for a long time and I I might be able to get away with making fun of you let me know if you don't like that though but there's some of you that have been watching for so long on a live stream I feel like we have enough of a relationship that we could joke but if you're new I will not nobody's gonna make fun of you and if they do I will tell them not to Blake says what is here he asked what is the best free course on react and or inexpensive courses hmm about courses code Academy has react stuff that's free I think it's pretty good for basics for starting out I think other than that I pretty much just watched YouTube videos for react stuff and just read I didn't really do a course and the Udacity course I'm obviously doing but it's not inexpensive I guess it depends on what would you consider inexpensive yes I don't know that I have any other suggestions that I've used personally kevin says Jesse what is your opinion on functional programming JavaScript is somewhat compatible with this paradigm and react Redux are based on functional programming principles I think you also mentioned currying yeah yes I mentioned currying we were talking about like this stuff down here as currying so and I think I said I'm not going to attempt to explain currying right now because I don't think I could do a great job at it so you could check out you know search currying and it's not really a complex thing I just would rather not mess up your understanding if this is the first time you heard about it so yeah in terms of functional programming from what I've read about it I guess I like it that's weird to say as compared to like objectoriented programming I honestly do think it makes sense with JavaScript all right I don't really think that I'm at a point where I can have really a really informed opinion about it so I guess I can't I don't feel like I have enough knowledge about things to really make a call like one way or another all I can say is that from what I understand I think I would prefer it to objectoriented stuff with JavaScript so let's see I just got a message from my boss so I'm gonna have to wrap this up quickly because he wants me to go to his office so Kevin so we're at authorization whatever you want yeah that that was the actual example for the projects I just stuck with it Harshit says any plans on graph QL yeah I'd love to use graph QL at some point not sure when but I would definitely want to Rowland says the SteelSeries Siberia 100 yeah I think that's it for the headphones Blake's has thoughts on react license change I was pleasantly surprised by it so I wasn't that worried about the old license for me personally but I I do I like the move I think I think it's good for react and it's definitely good for developers not a legal expert though so that's my my uneducated opinion let's see see all right let me alright so if I missed your your question I'm really sorry about that you can ask me on Twitter or in the comments but my boss is messaging me on slack several times now so I need to go in there and see what's up and anyway thank you so much for watching she'd be back tomorrow around 2 p.m. Eastern Time and until then have a great day
