hey everybody's Jessie and I'm gonna switch things up a little bit from what we've been doing the last two episodes all right so I want to work on some UI stuff so specifically when the let me bring it over what I've done so far just to give you just to get you caught up a little bit actually had I didn't have a ton of time to do work today because I had two phone interviews with candidates for a web developer job and actually went well so I'm happy about that but it did leave me with not a lot of time for this so what I've done since the last four since yesterday is I Trent change these into checkboxes and I made it to that they they work if you check them both you can see all both free and paid obviously or if you uncheck them both you can still see free and paid so it's the sorting works I'm sorry the filtering works this kind of works right now this is the materialized dropdown or select input to use this some JavaScript it needs to be initialized and right now I'm having trouble making it initialize after the API call comes back and it should populate this with our categories so basically it's initializing too soon and it's not including what we need so I'm gonna we're probably not gonna work on that today today I'm gonna worry more about this down here going to change these and instead of cards they're gonna be more like full width sections with an image over here and then some text with the option of having even more text you can click and it would expand and show more text there so this is all based on my last meeting with the people that I'm making the site for and that's more of what they want they're not really fans of this this layout so let me check the the live chat before we get started so say I hey everybody I see someone asks when to use react j/s and I'm not sure how to pronounce that name because there's no vowels in it well unless you count the Y at the end so it's certainty I'm not sure what you're asking about when to use react j/s so if you could explain that a little bit more I'd be happy to answer but since there's not a lot going on in the live chat right now yeah yeah the theme just reminded me that Y is indeed about it is I almost almost forgot that for a second but I'm gonna go ahead and just get started so I have on a piece of paper I have a sketch of what I want this to look like so I haven't converted that to anything else but so you won't be able to see what I really wanted to look like until it starts to take shape other than you know my brief description of it so I'm gonna move this over and I think I'm a right now if you want to follow along with the repo we're on the branch that's called resource sorting so I pushed before this started I pushed everything up to github so it should be up to date I think I may do this UI stuff on this branch don't know let me know if there's any objections to that I don't I think it'll work I'd hate to I'd hate to start a new branch for this since I these kind of are gonna go together yeah I'll just do it on this branch okay I did have a question about the animation I had a couple questions about the UI so let me just do that first since this this is all about the UI anyway it makes sense to answer some questions about it right off the bat so the first question from Thomas are you using one component for each card yes so it's this is a component separate react component and they're just populated with data from the WordPress API so this is separate component and at a question about the animation for the checkboxes so this this little animation here oops I guess it doesn't work too well when i zoom in but that animation actually is from the materialized CSS framework and it's it's pure CSS it doesn't take any JavaScript or anything so if you want to use that actually if you want to use this animation without the entire materialized framework if you check out my code pen which I don't even I don't remember what the link is to that I'll have to I don't know maybe I'll have to find it real quick and put it in but basically I made a version of this that works pretty much the same way that doesn't use I don't it's just pure CSS it doesn't use JavaScript you don't have to download the whole framework so if anybody's interested in that I will I'll put that link in the chat in the description let me know otherwise I'm gonna take the time and bother with it okay cool maybe I will find that link hey Bill made it glad you could join us bill okay Thomas maybe the animation for the card reshuffling yes so the the animation is using a JavaScript plugin called masonry so this all does exist within one component called masonry so within that component I have all these other components for the cards but it's all wrapped in the one masonry component which I get to show you that here make this a little bigger there we go so within so you can see this is the masonry component everything Rhett is wrapped in that and then the cards are just produced within here so we had to do something cool was I think it was Fabien who did this pull request so I actually had someone submit a pull request that that perfected all of this because I could not get it working on a live stream the way I wanted it to so Fabien if you I don't know if he's joined in to the chat or not but he could probably talk even more about how this works well I have a lot of questions right off the bat it was okay so it's Anna's back hey how's it going glad glad you're back asked are you using git flow I'm not familiar with what git flow is so I'm assuming that I'm not using it okay you guys are hearing static let me see I'm gonna move my phone farther away because it could be from my phone I did have a fan on too but that's been off for a couple of minutes so it's probably not that if you're still hearing it Navan says hey i'm starting out a 100 days challenge free code camp challenge from the 10th of July 2017 how do I start it's vital I think for the hundred days of code I don't don't correct me if I'm wrong but people just start whenever they want right you can just pick your own personal date and then usually people post that you know they tweet out with the hash tag like hundred days of code so I don't know is there somewhere where there's like a an actual date like an official start date for that I don't know okay so then I explain about git flow which I've actually never heard of so I'm really glad that you are taking the time to explain this to me so it says we get flow you create small branches for every feature and then merge them with develop I asked you because I have to learn it for this new project okay yeah so okay cool I mean I don't I guess I don't actually like consciously use that concept of git flow I do try to do feature branches though but a lot of smaller features I don't bother making a branch on so not I wouldn't say that I'd do that exactly okay so let me get I really love all the action in the live chat and everybody contributing but I don't want to disappoint everyone who who came here for the code and not just to hear me so let me go you know what I am gonna start a new branch for this because I'm gonna like I'm gonna change a lot of stuff in here so this is you this is gonna be major so I'm just gonna make another branch I'll merge them eventually but just in case I mess something up I want to be able to go back to the sorting and filtering stuff that I was working on and have that work and not have to worry about some UI thing delaying that so let me bring over my I have my terminal here I'll blow it up a bit sorry I'm a little distracted I always play music in the background and my headphones and just every song that's come up since I started it I haven't liked so it's really annoying the sorry about that so I just want to check make sure there's nothing on here oh wait there's something on here I'm not sure what I did I really thought that I had everything alright doesn't even show hmm all right so I'm not exactly sure what I did to be able to commit so that stinks when that happens I could do get Fred oh I guess I fixed it great so it must have just been a line or something that I put in that shouldn't have been there so now that I know that I don't have anything left on this branch I'm gonna take this branch exactly where it's at and copy it into a new one so if you're making a new branch you can do and someone was it bill I can't remember I think it might have been bill in a previous show told me that you can just do get check out and then B and then name your branch and get and you'll automatically go into that branch which is awesome and save some time and prevents you from accidentally making changes on a the wrong branch so let's name this actually no I don't want to know the one that starts with resource so let's go new new resource you I I don't have a problem with long branch names because you end up never having to type them all out anyway you can just you know tab to autocomplete so why not have really long names so here we go so we're on this branch sweet new branches I just I like to go through that sometimes for those of you who are maybe not familiar with git so now that we're here I'm gonna pull this off to the side and now I can proceed to destroy this this component without fear because we can always just switch back to other branch so this is really gonna make me sad to remove this because this is just wonderful Fabian did an amazing job on this pull request and if somebody else did this pull request and I'm giving credit where it to the wrong person I'm really apologize for that but I'm pretty sure with Fabian and so I don't really need to I guess delete this right away because this is just a constant we're not rendering it yet but I need to come down here and at least start something where I want to put this let me uh I'm gonna pull this off to my other screen just quickly so I can see I think I want to try to do the new UI element right I'm gonna show you right here basically above this section so that these are still down there and like we can see the new ones I'd like to see them sidebyside and I still want this code right there for me to refer to easily so I'm not going to delete it yet it's just a matter of finding where that spot is this components way bigger than I would normally like a component to be okay so there's a search there's our tabs okay and here's where yep okay here's what we're inserting that so I can probably put a component in here and we'll just we'll test this out so what I want us to look like probably so I mentioned early I'm using the materialized framework so I'm gonna try to use their classes as much as possible so we don't have to do a lot of custom CSS and we'll see if it works and then if we need to edit it a bit then then we'll do that but it'll be a lot faster if we can use what's already built in to materialize so I'm gonna stick with they're calling classes I can use normally in react you have to use class name instead of class but I'm using a I always forget the name of it but you can check out the package.json file for this project on github and you can see it I'm using an NPM module that allows me to use just the normal HTML syntax I guess for for the HTML attributes so I can just use class so just wanted to say that in case it throws anyone off who's maybe used to react and that's a little weird to you so we're gonna use column s12 okay so since these are gonna be full with columns everything's just as siliceous means on a small screen size it's 12 columns and it's just gonna stay twelve columns on all screen sizes so within that we want to have an image and in text so I think what I want to do I think I'm actually gonna have some nested columns I mean that would be that would be the best here at least for now so I don't think I don't think I need to put this in a row and then more columns I'm just gonna try to put a column right in here I'm not sure what it'll do but it won't take long to test it out oops so let's do column and I want this to be should I make on a small stream I guess it can stack so we will do s 12 on a small screen but then on medium screens we want this to take up probably 25% of the screen we'll try 25% at first maybe I wanted to look slightly bigger than that but this should work for now and then within there we want to have an image and for now I'm just gonna put in just like a stock photo so my other screen I'm just gonna find a stock photo grab the URL and put it in so let's see if this one works and then our our next oops our next column is going to be where all the text is so we'll just put in some stuff here just so that we can get an idea of what it's going to look like just once again on small screens it's gonna be 12 oops cycling skills are not great today alright so we want small screens who want to be full with and then on medium screens we want this to take up the rest so this is gonna be nine columns materialise use just a twelve column system so as long as everything adds up to twelve then then you're good I guess you could go smaller than twelve if you want so you can't go more than twelve so within there let's just throw in just throwing something to see what its gonna look like and then we can adjust it later so I know we're gonna have a title and I don't know that I want H tags for everything else I think I'll just do spans and we'll just give them a class I want this to be author and let's just say it's me since I'm doing this right now and then I think what else what else do we have oh we have a type I'll just put that here for now I haven't decided for sure where we're gonna specify like what type of resource it is then we'll just say it's audio just pretend that I recorded an awesome song and that's the resource should be crazy I can't sing at all and then we'll just have a paragraph and I guess I'll give it a class oops that's not what I wanted we'll give it a class of the description and usually I'd like to give materialised comes with this this class called flow text which makes the the font size change depending on the screen width I normally go with that for text but I'm not for now I just want to see what it looks like without at first and if it's readable so for now I'm just gonna some lorem ipsum just because that'll be the fastest to do okay let's save that see what happens whoa and let me show you what happened this is so since I'm using masonry on this it's just all these cars just covered up everything that we did so that's no good also my image that was supposed to be Bill Murray just didn't work so two disappointments there wow that's Thanks so here's what I'm gonna do I am gonna have to take these out to make this work so let's remove yeah let's just remove this and that should give us what we need just to be able to see what's going on okay so that's that's roughly really really roughly what I was going for but I definitely want to see what it looks like with an image so oh I see why is not letting me so as it failed to get the resource so this is where I was getting it from me say this was supposed yeah it's supposed to work oh wait maybe I needed the HTTP maybe this just needs updated because it it's without the s all right let's try that so I should just need to add this and hopefully it'll work no still didn't work all right one more time before I put in all right oh well I just have to put in an image that I already have and I know we'll work so let me check my image folder I think all these images in this folder are huge actually let me check the live chat maybe one of you are seeing what's going on here and can help me out also I haven't checked the live chat a couple minutes I don't want to leave you all hanging Oh Naveen asked about with that dot filter and map were so let me okay it looks like Rohan gave a good answer to that so so awesome basically it's just a way to work with arrays so that you can filter out and only get the items that you want from an array map lets you just go through every item in array and do something you know with each item so you would use it maybe like in place of a for loop I see a couple of people's told me to do get DIF to see what changed so I I eventually remembered that okay there's a discussion about code editors which I love it like I wonder I don't know that I've ever done in a live stream without some discussion of code editors in in the stream just always we had somebody so Shaw says hey what's up this is my first time tuning in how are you doing I'm doing pretty good thank you so much for joining in for the for the live chat welcome oh no Torrance says things were not good today was a bad day I'm sorry to hear that hopefully things will get better maybe I hope you have a good experience with it within the live chat maybe that'll be that'll be something me something that's not bad in your day oh I'm bear to asked about image size constraints and that's a good question at one time I did have size constraints but I don't think it would apply I don't think it would apply to where I put this in here I think I had them somewhere up here at least I thought I did now I don't remember where I put the image size constraints but it is right at one time I had the constraints I'm not gonna really need to have constraints like I did before for this layout which is one of the reasons why we decided to go with this layout oh man denna says what about cores so cross what is the cross origin resource what's the S stand for I can't remember crossorigin resource sharing is that what it is anyway that might be it actually since I'm doing this from localhost it might be freaking out and not wanting me to it won't want to give me the the image so all right yeah so I won't work with that I won't mess with the image anymore yeah actually I'm not getting a coarse error in the console I'm just kidding I'm just getting an error I mean usually it says oh wait here we go it was just higher up in the console I was getting multiple errors for it yep you got it you all are right it is a Corsair so let me switch and just get a different image there is a way that you can I forget what the site is there's a way you can get around course errors I used it I was building the weather app from free code camps lessons and I used it to get around the dark sky API course issues but I can't remember what it was so I'm not gonna try to find it now I'm just gonna go to unsplash and I'm gonna grab just an image from there this should give me a random image I'm gonna have the random image one and sometimes I like doing the random image from unsplash shot I T because then you you don't get bored hopefully I don't get a Corsair with this one yes okay no coarser great so I mean probably the ideal image dimensions would not be this but it just gives us an idea of okay we have an image here we'll see how it's gonna work all right so this is the basic layout that I that I want now but now that you all can see what I was saying in my mind what I want is I don't know that I want it to be this tall so maybe a little bit smaller and the images that would then be smaller this description would be hidden by default and you'd be able to click to read the description so maybe it just might say read more you'd be able to click and then it would drop down and you'd be able to see it so they would basically be half this the height of this but then every item would just take up space in this row potentially I don't know if I'm gonna attempt this or not but potentially if a screen was wide enough there would be enough space that we could do two rows side by side but I don't want to mess with that because then I have to worry about the the rows being the same height and I just don't want to deal with that I know that there are ways like using flexbox to make sure they're the same height but at this point I only have until the 20th of this month to get all the features done for this site so you can see I have a Trello board with all the stuff that needs to get done and it's linked in the description and there's still quite a lot so that's gonna fall under probably like hey we'll do it if we have time but it's not 100% necessary so you know for most people something would I don't remember what the average screen size is but this is probably closer to but a lot of people would be seeing the audience for this site is not likely to have really awesome computers with giant screens so I should probably keep that in mind that I think this the screen I'm working on now is a 2k 20 I think it's 27inch screen so definitely not what people would normally have who would be our audience but anyway this is the the basic thing so now we're just gonna fine tune it a bit I want to get the UI completely like ready how we like it before I actually pull in the data and then have a lot of them stacked up so I might just once we get it to a point where it looks pretty nice then I'll I'll just copy like three of them just to see what they look like stacked up and we'll probably do some sort of really thin border between them and if everything is good then we'll plug in the data and and see how it looks my only fear is that it's gonna be a long list there's gonna be a long scroll associated which I mean it's kind of unavoidable you know because this I'm kind of stuck I can't go back to the old layout I'm a little bit stuck and that it needs to be pretty much like this this is what they want but hopefully with all these categories and options and search anything can be narrowed down enough so that there won't be too many items here all right so I'm gonna continue on with this if you have any questions at this point if you're lost or there's something you really didn't understand about what I'm doing let me know right now oh I'm gonna take a drink really quick and then I'm gonna check the live chat before we move on and continue styling this okay so someone did ask about saying use classname so Jonathan said replace class with class name so I explained this a little while ago but maybe Jonathan joined in after that so just really quick you notice I'm using class here and I'm not getting errors it actually works I have a plugin that lets me use class normally you can't use class with react but it's X it's really useful to be able to use it if you're copy and pasting HTML which in this case I do somewhat frequently from the materialised documentation so it's really helpful to not have to change class the class name so this was from some of the old code before I had that plugin and I didn't install that plugin someone else installed it so let me bring up I like to show this from time to time just so I can give everyone credit for their contributions so here's the contributors to the repo so I'm trying to think who I think it was Danny that actually submitted a request a pull request and installed that plugin so thanks Danny for that so if you want your github profile featured on this show then submit a pull request how's this I don't expect anyone to take time out of their day to contribute to this project but if you would like to and you have the time then uh it's really nice I'll appreciate it and you know as long as it improves the project somewhat then you know I'll pull it in okay so let me let me check the the live chat quickly and then we'll move on ah raj area is says he's watching this in one 144p can't even read the code really sorry that you have to watch it in 144p so i'll if you're still tuned in and haven't just gotten frustrated and left I'll try to be as descriptive as possible and what I'm saying even though you can't see it that well that really stinks I'm sorry about that I don't I mean I don't think I could do anything about that it's it's you know the internet connection at the other end but oh man Turin tour I mentioned earlier that they're having a really bad day and I don't know if they want me to read off what they said so I'm not gonna read off what they said but it just seems like they're having a really really bad day so if you're still here I'm really really sorry I'm available on Twitter if you want to direct message me and if you need to talk about anything I'm here for you so that's things sometimes I myself have battled with clinical depression since I was probably 17 or 18 I mean and I'm 31 now so I definitely understand when when you get down so I'm here for anybody that ever needs to talk about that or anything cuz it can be rough I'm not a counselor though so this is not like official medical advice or anything it's just somebody who's been through it so Danis Anton says will you cover setting up a register slash login not on this project I won't need to in this project but possibly on future projects I will need to do that so I can't guarantee I can't give you a time yet because I'm not entirely in control of my schedule it's whatever my bosses want me to work on so but I can definitely foresee in the future me having to do that on some some potential projects that I know are in the works so maybe one day potentially I could maybe just do a video like on my own channel pre record something to go over registration login maybe I'll add that to my list of of topics or potential topics for videos alright so I'm going to I'm just going to get started I know there's some more questions in the live chat I'll get to those later on if you're if you've asked a question and you can stick around till the end I'll answer all the questions if you can't stick around you could always I'll answer it you know you can watch the recording later on or you can message me on Twitter or put it in the comments and then I can get to it later on all right Dana Stanton asked what my channel is the link I have a link in the description for this video I actually can't even remember what the with the address is right now it's probably just my name but oh but it's in the description so okay here's what I'm thinking that we ought to do I kind of think this title is just a little bit too big so maybe I'll drop this down into an h4 it's an h3 right now so we'll drop this down to an h4 these need to be on two different lines and it might be maybe I might want them to be a different color we'll see well mess with maybe making them this red color also I have this kind of goldish color that might work we'll see how sometimes the gold there isn't really that readable so we'll see but it might work I think it'd be nice to have at least one of these be different color and then we'll have to hide this and then put in a little button that will show it and we'll probably want to do some sort of animation so that it looks just a little bit more smooth maybe not even I mean we might just do like a little transition or something nothing fancy I think that's that's probably it also will probably want to do something with a salmon suit right now the the height of this is obviously being set by the image right so if I want this to be shorter what I ideally what I want is the height of this to not be set by the image but instead to be set by the text so we'll have to adjust the styles for this image so that you know it isn't always taking up this full height here and then finally we're gonna have a little border probably web you know like a bottom border alright so that's the that's the plan right now so let's go back to the code so first things first let's drop this down to an h4 also we need to make something in here linked so potentially the title could be a link so I'm gonna just make it a link right now and I just want to see what color it makes this link automatically I think the default right now is blue I don't want the title to be I don't think I want the title be blue we'll see what it looks like but it's really not a part of the color scheme for this so we'll probably end up making it maybe this red color and then yeah I want this to be oops not class style and now if you're not familiar with how to do Styles and react one way to do it is to put it in line as a JavaScript object so in react when you're in this is called JSX this kind of HTML looking stuff in here so if you want to put JavaScript in the middle of it you just put it a little curly bracket and then now anything between these these first curly brackets is JavaScript so now that I've put another set of curly brackets that's just an object and so within that object we can put CSS attributes but we have to camelcase them so for instance if we wanted to put like font weight we'd have to do it like like that instead of the normal hyphenated CSS selector okay so this is just one way to do it there are many different ways to do CSS in react but this is just one so for this one I'm just gonna do color and I need to grab a hex code so I'm just going to pull on my other screen I'm gonna pull up dev tools just so I can grab that same color that is in the footer and that's the hex code we're working with so you want to make sure that you put in in this case I'm using single quotes but you could probably use double quotes and it wouldn't matter you know the actual value of the attribute you want to put inside quotes if you just have just a plain number it will probably work without the quotes but I just put everything in quotes for consistency if you wanted to do something else you just put a comma and then put another attribute and you could just go on just just like you would normally do a JavaScript object so let's what else did we want to do oh we wanted to make these actually mean let me see I if I do oops not distribute displayblock I think this will make the other thing pop down on to a separate line so we wanted to do that so we've made that a different color let's just try out that gold color I don't really have much hope that it will work I think it's gonna end up being too hard to read but we'll give it a shot so let me grab the gold color once again on my other screen just from dev tools okay so that's our gold color and then for this let's go displaynone for now oops and then finally for the image let's go with I'm not sure what is the one right now I know for sure I want the height to be Auto but I'm not sure that'll fix our problem right now because if the width is said yeah we'll see I'll just leave it for that now I'm I'm doubtful that that'll fix it but yeah and it's true it didn't fix it but let me see what this did let me show you show you what this did okay so as I thought blue is the default color for a link I don't think we're gonna keep blue I mean you you you all can tell me what you think but I just don't think that this color blue really goes with the color scheme as you can see you know we're kind of that like a black black you know this dark red and white and then I really only kind of accent color that we've used as this gold this actually is way more readable than I thought it would be so I think I might keep it I was worried it would be hard to read I'll have to try it out on maybe some screens that aren't as highresolution just to make sure but for now I'm okay with that I definitely want to change this color and I think make it the red color and I don't know that I like these being two different colors so maybe this will be this will either be red or the the gold and then the other two will be the opposite color the paragraph will end up being just the regular font color which i think is black with an opacity of 87% okay so I'm gonna open up dev tools and I'm gonna inspect this really quick so I can see what's going on with the image and let me bring it over so I hate to do too much on the other screen where you can't see wow that's an issue check check that up that's just going right over so we definitely don't want that I'm not sure maybe this is because we tried to nest columns and maybe that's not the right way to do it so I'm not gonna worry about this right now we'll wait until we do a bit more but we'll have to fix that but I did want to see yeah I kind of like how that stacks it's not not too bad but let me make this a lot bigger for you all here's our image and we can see in dev tools all the properties here what I'm really worried about here is width and height so I'm assuming that the width is set to I don't know what a hundred percent maybe the width not set at all it doesn't look like it's even set so let's just you know let's play around a bit and see what we can do oops I can't okay so if we set it to a hundred it actually looks better here but it's not gonna look better when we make it bigger so it's gonna look worse okay so we don't want it to be a hundred I actually want the images my idea for images is that all the images will be in this upper lefthand corner and then whatever their normal sizes they'll remain that size unless they're bigger than I want in which case though they'll have to be a maximum size so it'd be something like max width would be a hundred percent so I would never want it to be you know bigger but potentially could be smaller so maybe really I could probably set I could set a maximum height because we'll know as long as the titles don't get huge I mean four it would have to be for each break point we would have a different maximum height but I'm gonna think about what I want to do there for now let's sort this out with kind of what I said a few minutes ago and get that looking how we want it to look and we need a border here and then I'd like to duplicate it a few times to see what it looks like stacked and then also we need a button to show that that description all right so we'll work on that now actually let me look let me check back in with the live chat because it's been it's been a few minutes I don't want to miss too much okay yeah danish anton subscribed to my mind chant my personal channel so thank you thank you for that i don't want i haven't been able to put up as many videos that i had planned I'm just been busier than I thought so sorry about that but I hope to put up some some nice you know short tutorial videos on there as soon as I can alex says materializes to puck and bootstrap is biggie so if you're familiar with 90s American rap feuds then you'll know what that refers to but I think everybody knows Tupac and Biggie right if you don't there are just two famous rappers that had feuds which may or may not have been legit I always have my doubts about celebrity feuds I think most of them are orchestrated to increase publicity but I did I never took sides in that phew okay bill says the trick I've heard is if you make everything monochrome with an overlay using maybe Photoshop and can't read something then the design colors might need to be changed cool I've never heard that that's that's a good good trick Rogerio says I know nothing about next Jay asks would you mind tell me in short what it is what it's about and actually it's some people and the live chat gave some good answers to that just my short answer to next jazz is it's a way to very quickly start building with react and have serverside rendering built in routing built in so you don't have to set that up you don't have to worry about setting up web pack comes with hot module reloading so you can very very quickly start using react without having to learn a lot of the other stuff that at least in my experience slowed me down a lot at first so there are plenty of other awesome things about next Jas but for me at least this that's kind of the core of what's what's great about it okay so Alex is the blue is not working I definitely agree Alex asks about how how I got my code editor to show the color of the hex so this is I'm using Adam from github and it's just a plugin I don't remember I'm sorry I don't remember what the plugin is but it was just a plugin for the code editor to show the the colors as anna says if they had a color scheme to stick with at least you could blame them if it didn't pass an accessibility audit yeah that's true I really have no control over this color scheme at this point so this was the color scheme that I inherited when I took over this the development of the site so a lot of decisions had already been made if you've been watching from like the start of this when I started this site there was already a partially completed site that I was starting from and I had to I didn't have to keep all of it but I did have to keep some of the design elements and the color scheme I definitely had to keep all right so I've got through everything in that in the live chat for the most part so let's get back to this okay lol Brito says Adam the Adam package is called pigments for the hex colors so thank you very much for for putting that in the in the chat so if anybody's interested in getting their getting colors here pigments is the package for Adam I'm sure there are similar packages for other code editors so let's change that that color and let's see I'm just gonna copy this since this is pretty much what we want I don't need this part though just copy that and I'm gonna use this color here I also want to increase the font size of both of these as these start to get bigger in terms of you know adding more CSS in this I like to put them down in here in this style JSX tag so at some point I'll probably do that but for now it's just a lot less scrolling and it's probably easier for you all to see if I put it in here so if it gets really huge and unmanageable I will move it down but for now I think it'll be fine so let's go with font size and I'm not sure what font size we have now but I think I'm gonna I'm gonna see what 18 pixels looks like oops if I can type 18 there we go let's put it here as well might look nicer if these are a little bit different but for now we'll just try it also we need a button right so I'm not sure if I want an actual you know button or just some text for now it'll be easiest to just put some text we'll just say give it a class of read more for now and I'll just say read more and I guess we could do you give it an onclick in I was just thinking for a second if I could fit everything I wanted this to do right into here if I should just make a different function we'll see I don't have to think about it right now for now though I just want to hmm I think how I should how a lot to do this I guess I'll have to say that right now so we're just doing the u.s. stuff right now so I shouldn't I shouldn't be mixing in this this stuff of right now it'll just slow us down let's see we wanted finally we wanted a a border right so what his style and I'm gonna do a border bottom and let's do I want it to be really thin so I think I'm just gonna go two pixels at first see how that looks and we want it to be solid and I think I would like it to be some type of gray maybe I'll just use whenever I need to make an RGB color instead of typing it out myself I just come in here and I think if I made it 54 I can change it but basically if I do it like this then I don't have to type it up and I can preview the colors so occasionally it saves me some time so let's put that in there and I'm gonna try 54 let's see how that looks oops well alright so we had the border didn't do anything at all right now I don't need that in there also I need to make this okay there we go while two pixels this way that's way thicker than I wanted we're gonna have to go down to one pixel actually I don't really mind this right now at least we in the same color I think they may be you should be closer to here so we need to decrease the padding for that title tag and then we need to increase the padding between these two because the serene more should be down here the read more right now it doesn't indicate at all that it's clickable so we need to make that have a better indication of click ability and we'll make this smaller so let's drop this down to one pixel and let's say we did it paddingbottom I think it's patting your nut margin we'll find out in a second here oops paddingbottom and we'll do let's see if eight pixels will be too much okay so that thickness there that I like that that's not too bad I'm not I'm not sure that I like it being all the way across like that I don't know if it needs to be we'll see how it looks though whenever we get more on there maybe it'll look better so that padding didn't do anything so maybe it's a margin thing it is it's a margin oops and I put it I actually put it on the a tag which which wouldn't do anything anyway all right so let's take this take this off and on the actual H tag will do marginbottom and we'll try eight pixels I'm not sure that did much of anything did it yeah that's so the exact amount all right let's try oh it's not why is it not doing anything that's odd all right we'll drop that down then a half I guess okay all right that brought it up a bit I guess it's okay let's share this font size and then we brought it up to 18 but I think 20 might be even better yeah like 20 all right so I must have the worst Spotify playlist ever playing right now on my headphones I normally don't mess with Spotify at all during the streams cuz but I have to change this it's just it's just not it's the new music Friday playlist for this Friday on Spotify and it's just not great today so I'm gonna change that all right let me I'm gonna check the live chat since it's been a while okay not much going on in the live shows I haven't missed that much Oh Alex said that Adam always crashes so I had to switch back to sublime so that's things I've never used sublime I've seen people on YouTube using sublime it it looks like a nice code editor okay Sebastian says color highlighter works for sublime so if you're using sublime and you want the hex colors color highlighter it will work yeah bill Cicero music really throw you off your game for sure I like it just makes it so much harder to focus when the music is annoying to you jack says Jessie sounds like Evan Peters to me now I can't separate the two of them in my head I don't know who Evan Peters is who's Evan Peters does not want to listen to them and see if he sounds like me all right so let's go back and see what else we need thought we need to work on this read more hmm well for sure the read more needs to be a different color I'm running out of colors of highlight colors I guess I'm gonna have to make this one red well we don't really have any other colors that are already being in use unless something to go back to the blue or pull in some entirely different color so we'll make this red we will make it so that your cursor looks like a link cursor so let's do that okay so you want the color to be I couldn't just copy and pasted this whole thing here oh wow and cursor cursor pointer this has been the most CSS heavy stream I've done for a long time so if you were here for a lot of JavaScript sorry but I know a lot of people really wanted more CSS stuff at least a while back there are a lot of people that wanted more CSS that were kind of a little lost with all the react stuff so hopefully some of them are watching and are getting something useful out of this all right so this is more like what we want oh we wanted to add some padding there so let's do this we'll do a margin margin top let's dress 16 pixels and see what that looks like that's weird didn't do anything this didn't look like anything that's weird nice because it's not yeah I didn't set it to displayblock that's my fault okay that's better yeah I don't know if it needs to be 16 but for now that'll work okay I wondered I guess it's not it looked like this was indented a bit but I think it's just because it's a t just looked indented which I didn't I don't want it to be indented so I don't know I don't know that I like audio being here maybe I'll have to think maybe there's a better place I think it might look nicer if it was title and then author and then this was somewhere else so I wouldn't I actually wouldn't even be opposed to using icons because our options are either going to be video text or audio you know we could definitely find pretty straightforward icons for each one I don't know if I want to go through finding icons right now it's not I guess it's not that difficult okay all right at this point I think I would like to see what a few of these look like stacked together so let's try that before we get any further oh man okay that looked terrible at first but it's just because the images didn't load that doesn't look too bad was everyone thing actually looking at right now I think the image section could be larger there's a ton of space over here you know we have multiple ones I could just try to you just change one of them and see what it looks like compared to the other ones so we can make this 4 and this 8 and then we'll try a different one so we'll make this 5 and this 7 and then we'll leave the other one as it was just to get an idea ok so let's see we'll have a vote lay out 1 2 or 3 or none of them and do something else now we will these are a little bit short so I guess you know the title is gonna probably gonna take up a decent amount of space so maybe it would look better if if it was actually filled out I'm gonna do that for this one as well so I'll give everyone in the live chat a minute to to add weigh in on this decision if you can if you want to and I'll I'll put in some more data okay it just occurred to me I don't know why I just occurred to me that I ought to actually put like author and then have something here so that people will know that it's the author actually this doesn't look nearly as bad now that it has a longer and longer title I'm gonna check the live chat see what you all think okay Patrick says we could stagger the images left and right bill likes the stagger idea Sebastian says too much space maybe more spacing between the bottom border and next section Andrew likes number one layout one manish says none of them it's too much space rohan says three looks best but also a vertically center the text blog Phillip says way too much space on all of them Sebastian says Center the image inside of the div if possible Phillip says there's a lot of margin on the right of the image patrick says plus one for author label Genesis I think you need some margin top on the border okay cool all right so if we vertically center the text that'll take care of the margin top thing for the most part unless we have something with insanely long title that rats so let's do that first so let's see if we take let's take this and make it give it a class of feline rapper and then no wait I don't want that to be I want this to have the class of vline rapper and I probably could do it for all of them so okay and then within this we can make it V line all right let's see if that works so materialized comes with some vertical alignment stuff built in that's really helpful because you don't have to mess with it so here's what it looks like if the text is vertically aligned okay they were saying the image almost sits on the border yeah you're right we need to do something about the image actually let's try this the image there's no reason the image couldn't be vertically aligned as well I'll shut on this one first and then what if we set the height to always be no I don't know if this will work but we'll see let's see I might need I might need to use something more absolutely yeah that's not going to work to see if this would work okay so the vertical alignment would work but yet we still need some sort of padding because potentially if it was this small it would be it would come right up there so actually we could probably just do give this section this whole section a bit of padding yeah let's do that okay so let's just do do these big sections here and we'll give them give them awesome padding oops let's just give them a little padding for now see how that looks I don't know I think it needs more and perhaps a bit more padding which I try to double it okay not quite as bad are we getting it's a little off I think we it's throwing it off the alignment because this title has its own margin at the top yeah so that's throwing everything off I'm gonna take away the top margin from the title so that it's not throwing because right now it very Clea looks like it's down a bit lower than it should be if we were trying to Center it completely because we have this invisible space up here that's adding height to this element so I'm going to take that out and then we should get a truer vertical line so where's that all our H fours okay there we go so that gives us a better vertical line the only one that looks weird this one looks weird because it doesn't have any border yeah every all the other ones look like they have a top and a bottom border but you know it's really just the bottom border for all of them so I don't know maybe it would look better if there was a border on the top just for the first one oops border tough okay I don't know if it makes it look better but at least they get a better idea of what these this padding looks like I'm gonna go back to the live show just to check in with everyone okay Santa asks would you have text in there on the right and I hadn't thought of that but now that I see it and I see all this space that actually would be well actually I will say like none of the titles are gonna be so let me let's get an idea of what the average title is going to be anyway cuz I would I think most of the titles are pretty long so we're not actually gonna have a lot of space here but let's I'm gonna go to the live site okay so yeah all right some of the titles are kind of short some of them are longer you know this one is definitely definitely a bit longer I don't want to click the link okay so anyway so yeah I mean if we were gonna have everything be this short I think it would be good to put text here I just know that so the people are making this a four seem to really like long titles like really long titles so that's been it's been difficult for me to try to fit in all these titles I have a lot of like wrapping of text going on where it shouldn't be so I'm just trying like thinking it is likely that the titles for these things will end up being huge especially once they see how much more space they have here than they did in the the cards and even this author thing is not necessarily even going to be someone's name it could potentially be like multiple names so if this is a video with more than one person or a book with more than one person I mean this could end up being like four names and if you look some of the names are crazy because it's not just a name to name Plus like all the degrees that they've had after that so I'm thinking that this space is more than likely going to be taken up actually once we pull in the real data it'll be way easier to see that so for now I am gonna leave a space here and then when we pull in the data if we find that we're still having a decent amount of space then maybe we could put a small amount of text there but I definitely want four just so that users don't have to scroll too much I would like these to be shorter rather than taller so it's thing obviously once it gets down you know to where these stack that has to change because there's no way they'll be able to stack properly I don't know hmm I'm actually not entirely sure that they should stack when it gets lower I mean there'd be some crazy text wrapping going on but now let's see what this looks like okay that's more reasonable I think if I Center that image that that actually is more reasonable so maybe they ought to stack I think actually like I looked better here on a smaller more narrow screen than on the large one the title I gave this is just nonsense and ridiculous but in that font it just it looks like impressive doesn't it well you could write anything in this font and it would look impressive all right let's see Oh Roland's going to sleep thanks for thanks for watching and thank you thanks for contributing I appreciate it it's a what is it about two o'clock in the morning where you're at so that's awesome for staying up that late just just for this l Bri so says what about two per row yeah we talked about two per row earlier that's still potentially an option I don't want to make a decision on the two per row until I actually get the real data in here and see how much space is being taken up and then oh I think we'll have a much better feel for just how much you know extra space we have because even with this I mean I could move this over more I suppose but it would still you know this is a really wide screen let me move this screen down into what a more normal screen would be so I guess a more normal desktop screen would end up being like this so so looking at it from this perspective this actually looks a lot nicer and more balanced so I haven't checked the analytics for a while but I don't think we get many users that have really wide screens so even as we go out I mean even getting into this with you know that's that's still reasonable we're getting a bit more white space but it would definitely you know it's reasonable and it would be tough to squeeze it in to too but I definitely want to do something about these images because I really have no idea what dimensions the images are going to be in there could be all different ones so I don't want to make assumptions about what the image is going to be like or design based on a certain image dimension because it could totally change so all we all we want to do with images is just set maximum maximum Heights that they could be I guess that's all we're really worried about so that's what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna look check the height of this image and just get let's get a feel for like what what is the biggest image that would make sense here you know how big do we want this like I'm thinkin I I guess I really don't want it to be wider than this or taller than this I mean that that's honestly even a little bit taller than I think I would 1 so what if the max image height would be like maybe 200 is this decent for now I think I'm gonna set it at 200 I'm gonna set it at 200 and then let's put in the real data and just see what it looks like and then the streams been going on for what at least two hours now so that's it so well let's put in the data see what it looks like and then kind of wrap things up maybe make a bit some more adjustments but I think we got I mean it's definitely way different than it was from the start so and it's a lot closer to what I had sketched on paper so it definitely needs some work I'm not I'm not happy with it as it is now but it definitely gives me a good idea I like to see that I think it might be good to like sleep on it and come back tomorrow and or what's Friday I'll come back on Monday and hopefully my subconscious will have worked on this over the weekend yeah all right so let's go back I do want to put this Mac site in for the images right now and I'm only gonna put this let's see which one did we want to keep actually I think I want to keep the spacing for this one now that I see it with a longer title so this will be the one that we keep so let's put in max height of 200 pixels it's crazy I keep glancing at the analytics for the video and it's crazy like as the video goes on the viewership just drops off I guess it makes sense you know like everybody gets the notification at first and they check it out so I mean that's the big burst but like we've dropped like half of the amount of years we had you know like in the first half an hour I'm not complaining about it I'm just like observing that it's interesting like you know that we get I'm just always interested in certain times during the video it picks up and it drops off and I just I've no idea why you know there are different patterns I guess and in the people viewing alright so we don't need these anymore so I do want so for now I'm gonna leave this like this but obviously I'm gonna make this its own component you know and it's it's going to be a separate file and a separate component but for now just to test this out we'll just leave it all here what I want to do is I want to give this a class so I can put more easily put the padding top I want to move I want to move a bunch of these styles down not right now but let's give it a class of resource resource row I guess they're all rows now so that kind of makes sense the code a resource row and then down here I'm just going to do one thing research will i always forget what these are what is it first I'll just look it up I think there's like a first of type and a first I guess I guess first of type is what I want right this don't use these often enough to to remember them and now we want to give this the border I'm gonna copy this this is what we want you so much gonna copy this part there we go okay let's make sure I didn't pull out anything really important okay cool so we have the border at the top great all right now let's put this so here's what we want we want to drop down into JavaScript now and we want to get this state data and then we want to map that right and we map that we're going to call it will just call this it's been call each one resource right usually I just call it post let's go I'll just call cocos2d consistent with everything else that I have going on so we can use this arrow function and this will just return all of this so now within post we can get obviously this will eventually be an image URL I kind of want to leave this in for now just so we get an idea of what it looks like with images now you know what I'm going to change it because not everything is gonna have an image so I do want to see what they look like without images and if it looks good interspersed with some that do have images so let me get I have the this is what the the data is gonna look like so we'll have where's our image okay so we need to do a CF URL I'm gonna put this on my other screen so I can see it as where as I'm putting it in so for source it's actually gonna be we're gonna have to do some logic in here so it's gonna say post dot a CF has a zone property I think that's what it's called has been property now you know what it is gonna have URL no matter what let me check this up no I don't want I'm sorry I thought it was gonna be a CF URL it's gonna be better featured image so what I want to say is post better featured image and then I want to make sure that it's not equal to null it's not equal to null then I want to put in I want to use the post better featured image otherwise this is gonna look terrible for now and I need to do it what I need to do is is check this all somewhere else and then just put it in for now unless I can just copy it quickly I might still have it up here then you just copy it to the resource card I don't know what's working how was that I guess I was annoying it like that I was thinking that if I just added a blank source that it would give me that weird little box that says there's no image so we'll just leave it like that for now we'll leave it like this for now and what else do we need we need the title so let's with a curly bracket we're gonna go into JavaScript land here and let's get post ACF and actually it's just title post title rendered so we have that and now for the for the author it's just thing about the author not all of them have an author yet so I am gonna have to check first so what we do want it to say is we wanted to say author and then a space then we want to check and see post ACF has property and if it says author then we're going to use post otherwise we're not going to do anything and for this we're gonna do post whoops gonna go into JavaScript toast dot ACF dots type and then although we're not using this right now may as well put it in I mean it's all it's hidden for now and for this one since it could potentially have HTML in it I want to do dangerously set inner HTML I can use this and be confident with it because the data I'm being it's being pulled in is from WordPress a wordpress installation I have control of it's not a good idea to pull in data this way from sources that you don't have control of because potentially you know harmful stuff could get pulled in so use with caution obviously because it's just dangerously set it but we're gonna live dangerously today and put in put this in and let me think is it trying to remember how this is yeah I think that's what it how you do it oops I just I just noticed the typo sorry title there we go post AC is a VCF yeah description okay and that's what we need for now oops I'm sorry I forgot one very important thing we need the URL and that's gonna be post dot a CF dot URL and then let's go ahead and put in a title tag we'll just do post a CF our post title rendered there we go now I'll save it and let's see what happens getting a long refresh here let me restart my dev server cuz it seems like I messed it up luckily this only takes about three seconds all right so we did have a problem and this was where I went to set dangerously set innerhtml so let's see I know that I've dangerously said it somewhere else so I'm just gonna look at where I did it elsewhere and copy that there we go oh okay I forgot another set of brackets I was kind of thinking I needed another set of Arrakis I think I don't know if you can hear that on here but I just heard thunder outside and I didn't bring my umbrella today so I was gonna bring my umbrella and then one of my daughter's said I want to use the umbrella so I let her have the umbrella so now I'm I'm umbrella this for today okay so I'll shoot I need to dangerously set innerhtml in these titles so that these characters look right but other than that shoot I forgot to since I'm on localhost I can't pull in images from WordPress either so that won't let me so maybe it actually it doesn't look terrible it looks a little weird for the for ones without images here's an idea suit you think what if the image was on this side then the text would be over here so if there wasn't an image which is likely for some of them that they're not going to be an image it wouldn't it wouldn't look offset so like if there was an image here then this one would what do you think what do you think about that I'm gonna check the live chat since I haven't checked in well anyway but I would like to know if we moved it so that images appear too over here with that would that be okay now what I think about it I think it might okay bill says maybe add some styling to an HR tag to have it fade on the left and right side that's a great idea I hadn't I can't believe I didn't even think of an HR tag instead of a border that that's a really good idea thanks for that bill sebastien acts where the text will go when you click read more this will just get bigger and there'll be text here and then there'll be an option to to minimize it again Zanna says give them say like 10 10 vh for the for the image height okay yeah I do I like going with using VH if you're not familiar the VH is its viewport height so if I said 10 viewport height as the image height then it would take up like 10 percent of the current the height of the viewport in the same way with VW you port with and it works the same way Philip s can you render serverside with react if you are you if you're using go I don't know I've never used it with go I they're not not read anything about that so I'm sorry but I can't I can't really give you an accurate answer for that Nathan caught the title spelled wrong before I did so sorry I didn't I didn't look over at the live chat but thanks for pointing that out Athan bill says if there's no author will it say author no actually long as I was typing that out I thought it probably shouldn't say authors should just be nothing I can make it so that author is a required field if I want to but I don't think I really want to because you know maybe they don't I mean I think everything would have to have somebody that made it but just in case I should make it so that nothing would show up instead of author okay Andrew says image on the right would be better okay bill says that he has the an allow control origin star which is like all chrome plugin to let me get around the localhost course issues but it says we're to word to the wise disable that when done or you will have headaches okay that's actually that might be useful for this project Andrew asks what the client is going to input data with in WordPress so the client will be the content management system for all this is WordPress and then it gets pulled in here okay so I think I'm gonna wrap things up now cuz it's been a pretty long stream we're at two and a half out oh I forgot I started this dream late so we're not into an effort we're actually only about two hours I started a half hour later than normal but it's still a really long stream at two hours so I think I think I'm going to wrap it up here I'm gonna go back through the live chat and make sure I didn't miss anything right now and miss any questions if if you don't want to stick around for the question questionandanswer session that we're about to have then thanks for watching and I'll see you next week thanks thanks for being involved in the live chat otherwise if you're gonna stick around you have any questions put them in the live chat or you can put them in the comments to this video or if you're shy you can direct message me on on Twitter my the link to my Twitter profile is in the description below and I'm definitely gonna take into account all everything that you all said whenever I work on this and decide and then once I get this down then I'll show it to everyone else involved in this project and they'll there may be some some other things because that need to change based on that but a decent work I'm I'm satisfied that you know with with the basics that we got here today this is looking a lot closer to what it will end up being okay so I'm gonna go back through the live chat quickly if and it looks like I've kept up with the live chat pretty well so I don't think there's a lot that I need to catch up on so it won't take me too long so if you have any questions put them up there quickly okay I saw weight really early on like right at the beginning we were talking about the 100 days of code challenge and I had I had said I thought you can just start whenever you want but I wasn't sure and I didn't notice before but Zanna says yeah you can just start coding whenever and just keep it going for a hundred days so thanks for that answer sorry I didn't see it earlier but and I'm not I'm not sure if the person that asked about it is even in here anymore Navin or Naveen I'm not sure how to pronounce your first name so sorry if I'm mispronouncing it but that's who asked the question initially but the hundred days of code is a really cool concept I actually haven't done it yet I should do it because I I i usually code usually I try not to I usually take Sundays off and if I do any code it's like fun stuff like I'm working on a game with my oldest son so I'll code that but other than that I code pretty consistently Monday through Saturday so I should just do it okay still going through nothing new in the live chat so I think I covered most of it okay there was still I think I mentioned before there was some discussion about code editors and I kind of skipped over it at the time but it seems like some people are saying the consensus always seems to be that Adam is slow at least slower than all the other editors that everyone uses so the alternatives that were mentioned were Visual Studio code brackets and sublime okay here's a question so Thomas asked in terms of workflow what would you suggest to beginners in react as on how to start their site creation should think of the different components based on wire framing or use a specific approach yeah I mean I suppose it depends on what would you already are used to in which you like but if you're starting like from a wireframe then yeah you could you could actually just take you know either within whatever program you're using or even if you print it out and are just a sketch you can just draw a boxes around everything and each each thing that you could draw a box around could be its own separate component usually it's a good idea to try to make the components so that they only do one thing so the smaller you can break down components it's normally better so as far as specific approach I I don't know of any approaches maybe there are but I mean I don't know like if there's any official approaches to to starting a project like that okay as Anna said she found a really nice tutorial for react and it was called react Jas tutorial number one react.js JavaScript introduction and workspace setup on youtube so if you search for that on YouTube I haven't seen it yet so it's not really an official endorsement but XANA seems to be pretty knowledgeable from what from all the contributions to the live chat so it's probably a pretty legit video under the watcher asks are you saving the stream yeah the stream will be available just a few minutes after it ends it's available to watch the recording so if you can't if you didn't catch the entire stream or if you can't stick around for the whole stream or especially there there are people that just this time of day because the time zones it's just it doesn't work for them to watch it or because of even if the time zone thing is not a big deal they're working or something at this time so there's a lot of people that do watch the recording well I appreciate when when you make the effort to be in the live chat if you can so it's really nice to have everybody's contributions Rogerio asks I don't think he's in here anymore but maybe he'll watch the recording are you developing on top of WordPress I think I mentioned this at some point but yeah the content management system is WordPress but what I'm working with right now is is react so it's two separate servers that are actually running these sites and I just use WordPress for the content management and I pull the data with the WordPress API into react so all the display stuff the UI everything that he user sees is is react okay side Siberian well there's more to the name I'm just gonna say Siberian for short says offtopic question bootstrap versus foundation I know I don't really use bootstrap or foundation often actually I just help someone out with one of their projects last night someone had watched the livestream yeah I've chat yesterday and I had mentioned that they could direct message me to help out so they did and gave me a link to the project and it was using foundation and I haven't worked with foundation for a really long time so that was kind of cool and interesting too I just read through the docs a little bit and I think ended up fixing the problem I haven't heard back from them though so hopefully I fix the problem so that's like the most experience I've had with foundation a long time in with bootstrap the last time I used bootstrap was probably when I went through like the very first part of the free code campaign sorry let me take this call really quick it's just gonna be a few seconds hello yes I'm still here are you are you leaving now okay yeah if you could that would be awesome sorry I didn't come over yeah I'll be I'll hope you hear Thanks all right right sorry about that but here's the the time where I give the usual speech here this shows about me doing my normal work every day so interruptions like phone calls happen and that's okay because I want people to see what my life as a frontend developer is so so interruptions are welcome so anyway there's a lot of talk in the live chat about foundation versus bootstrap so I'm gonna skip over since I am not familiar that much with either one of them especially with any like new developments with them I'm not really gonna weigh in Rogerio asks so I need a framework like that to use react with WordPress er is it optional so he's talking about do I need a framework like next j/s which I'm assuming a framework like next yes and no you don't really I've used you could you could use just plain react set up yourself or any type of scaffolding that like create react app or you know anything there's a ton of different scaffolding options for react so no you don't really need to next yes just makes it really easy to pull in data and render it serverside but it's not impossible certainly to do it without next okay so we did have a couple other like CSS frameworks mentioned so I'll just mention them as well XANA mentions skeleton it's a really light framework so I haven't checked out skeleton for a long time but I remember being impressed with how lightweight it was I'm when I made it was probably a few years ago last time I checked it out also I think there's one other one I saw mentioned Oh many dot CSS I have I haven't checked so bill bill says many dot CSS I have no experience with that but I guess it's a really bill so it's really lightweight I just saw that comment that Jack made earlier about me sounding like Evan Peters and I still don't know who Evan Peters is so if anybody knows telling me please I'm not really that worried about it but it would be cool if if I actually do sound like that person it would be fun to to listen and compare I kept looking through again and it looks like I miss actually two people said that they think two per row would make sense for our resources so I am gonna keep that in mind if you missed I explained a little more towards the beginning of the video why I might do two per row but some reasons why I might not and it's gonna end up being one of those things that may happen if I have time but the way things are going I don't think I'm gonna have time to do anything extra to this right now there's just a lot that needs done before I need to be done with this project Oh Samson said I'm late again so I didn't notice that at first I don't think but what's alright Samson better late than never right you can always catch up on the recording and thanks for joining even if you know even if it was late that's fine with me a los Anna says 11 p.m. it's in if you don't mind me asking what country are you in I just like to get a feel for like timezone so it was about 4 o'clock here and about 11 p.m. where you were I said I haven't done this for a long time but earlier on when I first started doing the videos I always had everyone shout out where they were from at the beginning and it was always cool to see where everyone was from around the world so we we definitely have I mean we started out with like a hundred years and now we're down to 34 so won't have quite as many but if you're still listening and able to it would be cool to say where you're from and I could just read out really quickly where everyone's from I'll have to remember to say that at the beginning when we have a lot of viewers for the next one because that was always really fun and sometimes people who are maybe too nervous to ask a question or give a comment about code are cool with shouting out where they live because you know it's a much much less pressure on them so it's kind of cool because you know more people join in the chat right away vipul said hi hey thanks for joining on vipul also says what is react and what is the difference between react and are so reactive javascript framework and i actually L reto there's some good answers in live chat so l BRE so says it's like react versus angular verse with you so like there's a distinction between what react does and what angular does but like for the most part people do compare them so reacts if you know about angular or about view you can pretty much think of react in a similar way I know people say that like angular handles the entire like MVC if you're doing an MVC like style project and angular is just the V in MVC or MV star is what people say sometimes but aside from that usually people do use one or the other angular will react XANA says tried to learn angular in 2016 but I didn't have solid no js' knowledge at the time and didn't understand much but now I can say it's something I could grasp quite easily but I'm sure react is better actually that's like the same experience that I had so I think it was I think it was maybe for me like 2015 yeah I mean it was like 20 2015 possibly early 2016 when I tried to do something with angular but I had the same problem I just wasn't good enough with JavaScript and I just couldn't get anything to work in angular so but now I'm sure it would be different and I've heard angular has changed quite a lot since when I worked with it it was angular 1 now I think they're up to 4 and I'm not even sure but yeah so I don't know enough about angular now especially the new versions to really say much about it but I've seen a lot of cool things built with it and I know people that have built that that develop an angular and they're really good good developers way better than me now Bree so says I just learned about Beaumont CSS I've never heard of that is it good as anybody used to okay jack says Evan Peters was on American Horror Story and he was Quicksilver in the Fox xmen movie no way maybe the second firstclass movie oh cool I really like that character I'm gonna have to listen to him now I mean like whenever you hear your own voice like when you're talking it sounds way different than it really sounds to everyone else so I'll have to listen to a recording of my voice and then listen to that guy too but that's cool I'm definitely fine with sounding like him his character and the movie was probably one of my favorite characters so so I think that as a compliment thanks jack alright so you did some people shouting out where they're from bill saying I'm not gonna shout out everybody's names in case you don't want people to know where you're from I'll just say where it is so we have Michigan Texas Chicago London New York another Chicago Serbia Ontario and Delaware and says Delaware don't ask cool so we have definitely like all over the United States and then some foreign countries as well Ireland awesome actually uh we have in my department our head videographer director of videography is is from Canada so I can't remember if he was I'm pretty sure he was from around Ontario as well his family actually still lives up there so he's trying to like work and get money to be able to move him down here so but really good guy very talented with the video work he does Oh Romania okay cool I I just love that there are so many people from all over all over the world always my um the people that are like the head of my department are really in pretty much everybody that's higher up here at the University of our work is pretty much really against remote work because they say like all you need to come in so we can collaborate and I always think it's funny and I usually make comments like I pretty much stay in my office and when I need to talk to my coworkers that you slack and and then I come on here with you all and we basically build websites together I mean so much of the decisions that I make are based on your input and then at times you all even write code and submit pull requests so we work on these sites together and I feel like I collaborate with you all even though you're spread throughout the world then I do with I would say 99% of the people that actually work here on campus so so it's always crazy to me the idea that somehow I have to be physically present on campus to be able to collaborate and that's that's just insane in fact I had I had two meetings today I will actually I had three phone meetings today two of them were phone interviews with people and I didn't even go in they had a conference room set up with a speakerphone and I didn't go in there because for me that would have been harder it would been harder for me to hear I would have had to shout for ever someone to hear me on the speakerphone instead I sit at my computer i dial in through I'm a Google Phi customer so I just dial in through Gmail it's the same headphones I have one now I'm using the same mic that I used to livestream I have my my setup here with my computer's so when I'm talking to a candidate I have their websites up and their resume and I can check out everything it's so much easier for me to interact with people from right here in my office and then the third meeting that I had I was actually driving to go get some food really quickly I decided to go get food 25 minutes for I've stream started so I went to the store this I didn't speed but I like went to the store grab something really fast bought it and came back and I made it back with five minutes to spare I was excited about that but I had a phone call meeting on the way there which was fine which I was totally able to contribute to this meeting while I was walking around in a store so it's just I'm a really big advocate of remote work in case you couldn't tell I think there are definite advantages to it there are advantages to being able to meet facetoface but anymore when you have video chat and I mean soon virtual reality is going to be like high enough quality that it's gonna really mimic you know being next to a person so at that point the advantages of being facetoface are gonna keep going down and down and I guess you're just better off meeting online and not sharing germs at that point anyway sorry for the long the long speech occasionally I go into long talks about my opinion but I actually gain viewers during that old thing so maybe it was good so let me I had a couple more questions while I was talking so I'm going to go through that and then if I don't get any other questions that'll be all for today so Sam says for someone who has primitive knowledge in HTML CSS how long does it take an average person to get to the point where you can apply for jobs I would say apply for jobs at any point first of all so that's not exactly an answer to the question but people need like a varying skill levels so like potentially there are a lot of businesses that think they need a developer but in reality they have like a wordpress site that needs just really basic stuff done they need somebody to like upload blog the wordpress and change images and stuff in that case like you can definitely get that job you can get freelance work with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS that's how I started out was just getting freelance and subcontracting work and then I just I really worked on my CSS and HTML skills and once I got more comfortable with that I I turned to improving my JavaScript and I started trying to only take jobs where I would learn what I wanted to learn if I could sometimes I just take jobs just for money because I had to pay the bills but you know all my side projects and things would be based around what I wanted to learn the more you know the more jobs you'd be qualified for but I would say like at any point if you find a job that you really want to do apply you know you know be honest about what your skills are but you know you never know and so much of this is just learning what you need to learn to get the job done that I would say there's not really like a standard time period of how long it would take it's just entirely dependent on how much time you have like every day to put into it what the resources that you use how quick of a learner you are there's just too many factors to say for sure but my only advice is just don't feel like you're not good enough to apply for things you know if you if you meet even some of the requirements for a job it's worth it to apply unless the application process is just way too difficult then then forget it but if it's an easy process to apply you may as well do it I mean the worst that could happen is they say no and you just move on I once applied for a job where the minimum requirements were a master's degree and they prefer to doctorate and they wanted like seven years experience doing a job that I never did and hold on one second I I gotta get this okay someone was at my door but anyway so I applied for this job and obviously I didn't get it but I did actually get to like sit face to face with a person that was interviewing with the job it wasn't like really an interview but it was just the person actually gave me a bunch of advice on what I would need to do to get myself ready for a for this job in the future if it ever came open again so it was definitely worth the experience was good and you know it ended up being worth it for me you know I was totally not qualified for it but I got some really good advice from you know from the person that was hiring for the job so you never know dana says do you also review websites and give tips on improvement I mean like not officially but I've had a lot of people since I started livestreaming just send me messages on Twitter and with links to their stuff and yeah I've looked looked at it I've given tips sometimes like people get err errors with things and they don't know what's going on and so I'll actually try to help them with that you know it just depends on how busy I am at the time like if I can get to it it may take me a little while to get to it but like last night I was able to figure out something for someone that watches the stream and it didn't it didn't take me very long I was looking at their code on my phone just like right before I went to bed and I kind of figure it out so I just opened my laptop real quick tested it it worked and just sent a message back and so you know occasionally I'll just get a few minutes here and there and I might be able to help you out so yeah so feel free I mean if I ever get to the point where I'm getting like hundreds of people asking then maybe I'll have to stop but right now like I'm not really a big deal right now I only have like 40 people viewing the stream at this point I'm definitely open to you know helping you individually if you want me to Ken's Ken says me to remote is great today in in office two days in offices enough so when we were talking about remote work yeah I agree I I honestly think like from my job in particular I could definitely do most of my job from home and I could probably be more productive from home there'd be less like interruptions I could see like if they really want me to come in for a meeting or something then I would come in for that but otherwise yeah I think working from home is is great and then from the perspective of the company like if an employee works from home they don't really need an office they maybe just need somewhere to hang out at when they have to come in so you save space or not providing an office then you don't have to worry about providing the air conditioning and the electricity for that office right so you know you can end up saving a lot of money you know for the long term by having most of your workers be remote or at least those who could be remotely remote so um definitely it's a good idea Gina asks what are you using for backend so this the the backend for the site well I guess node it's running on node and then the content management system is WordPress and that's running on that uses PHP and then I mean just to kind of say the entire stack is the site's the WordPress site is PHP and it's running on a with Apache and I believe it's using nginx as a reverse proxy the node installations are I actually have I'm using load balancing between two digitalocean droplets that are both running Express which is with node and they're running react then they are running behind nginx being used as a reverse proxy and then in front of all of that is a digitalocean load balancer so that there's really like never any downtime for the site so that might have been more information than you were looking for but hopefully it answered the the question Umberto's said I'm definitely an advocate of remote work as well I'm the telework coordinator at my workplace but my boss doesn't allow us to telework so frustrating oh wow yeah that's that's Thanks yeah you would think you'd be able to do that from oh well maybe maybe someday and he gets into it Archer Archibald says okay in response to so the question from Sam was about how long does it take an average person to get to the point where you can easily apply for jobs or where you can't apply for jobs and then Archibald says in reply when you can comfortably build something that uses auth user roles databases then I'd say you've got the skills yeah I mean if you get to that point you for sure have the skills I would say you don't even have to get to that point simply because I got a full time job doing web development without even ever doing any of that stuff so it does depend on what you're doing like I mean if you're gonna be a frontend developer you don't even necessarily have to know that much about the other stuff especially if you're gonna get a job at a company where there are other people handling that kind of thing like the databases and things you just have to know how to talk to the databases you know through api's and things but but yeah I mean your goal should be to know how to do that you know off the user role stated if you have all that you'll be people will want you right yeah they'll want you to work for them if you have all those skills bill says even if you get turned down at least you gain some interview experience yeah exactly exactly just the experience of it is it's really important it is it is important having confidence when you interview is a really big deal when I interview somebody and they don't seem really confident it's just like even if I can see their code and see that they can do the job it just really makes me doubtful if they're not confident in their interview and you know there might not be the best judge of things but you know I don't want people to be like overconfident but it's nice you know if you ask someone a question an interview if they can say yeah for sure I can do that or I can learn that you know that's that's important and I think to get to that level of confidence in interviewing it helps that practice Dana says I'm actually looking to hire people skilled in react post post I'm not pissed Postgres QL I never know how to say that but etc where would I go to find qualified independent coders I would like some way to verify their skills before hiring I guess to defend like if you want to employ them directly I'm not exactly sure there there are some places where that will help you find candidates trying to think I just saw a place like that recently where they handle the testing them like doing coding tests but I can't remember what it is I'm sorry if I remember at all I'll try to let you know but I don't remember it but then also like if you wanted to hire developers through like a middleman company their companies like top Tao it's t.o.p tal where you can hire a developer but you know tops how it handles all the contract stuff and payments so it's just I guess it depends on what you would you need okay actually well this is really cool so there are a few people in the live chat that are responding to danishes question about being able to hire people so so that's cool I don't know yeah Danish if you uh if you're on Twitter and you want to tweet you can like mention me and a tweet about wanting to hire people and I'll retweet it for you that might help I mean I have I think I only have like 250 followers or so so it's not like I have a lot but if like I could potentially get retweeted some of the people that follow me have a lot of followers so if I get retweeted it could get out to a lot of people so so I guess let let me know you know send me a tweet if you want me to do that it's it's worth a shot ok bill says that he's seen people use hacker rank as an initial interview process actually that's cool I never thought of using hacker rank that's a good idea Oh Sam asks how does WordPress CMS played with nodejs isn't it a different stack all together as in a lamp stack this is the first time I was watching your livestream I am yet to browse their previous upto uploads yeah that's cool lot I mean honestly it would be a really daunting task for someone to get through all the live streams at this point because they end up there's a lot of them and they're really long so yeah I don't I don't mind I did explain a lot of it before but I don't mind at all giving a little explanation basically the WordPress installation runs on a totally different server so it can have its own stack and then node has its own stack and they don't you know mess with each other I have heard of people I've had people message me on Twitter and telling me that they've gotten it to run on one server together so I'm not exactly sure how to do but it's possible I always just run them on different servers and then it ends up I mean obviously it just works and then you just share data from through the WordPress API is just a REST API so you just make normal API calls from node to WordPress no unbuilt bill basically just said the same thing about the API so thanks Bill okay and Berta said dice comm so that's also another place to find coders so awesome so I've gotten to the end of the live chat and well I just looked at the time it's a long chat all right so probably won't be doing too much on this site before the next for the next show so you won't miss too much we'll probably be right back where we started so anyway have a great weekend and thank you so much for watching and I'll be back I'll be back Monday I should probably check my calendar really quickly just to make sure I will be back Monday it's possible that I might have a meeting or something so I have my calendar up here on another screen so just take me a second okay yeah I'll be back Monday it looks like I have a meeting at 300 p.m. on Monday so it might be a little bit shorter than normal but I should be back at 200 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday so anyway again have a great weekend thank you so much for watching and contributing in the live chat if you're watching this later on and you have questions or anything like don't hesitate ask me on Twitter ask me in the comments I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can and I really appreciate everyone's contributions today you all are really awesome so I'll see you see you next week
