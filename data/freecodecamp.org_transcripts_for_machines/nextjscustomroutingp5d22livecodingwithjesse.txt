hey everybody sorry about that i didn't realize the stream has started uh and also sorry it's a few minutes late i was trying to um adjust some settings i don't know if you remember last week we had some trouble with the video uh kind of stopping and things and i realized that i used to have a wired connection that was obviously a lot faster than the uh the wifi and i had we were troubleshooting why i couldn't get into the database that we've been working with they had me unplug it and then somehow that allowed me to to get in and then i never plugged it back in so when i stream i'm gonna try to keep it plugged in and i'll try to do transfers from the database when i'm not streaming uh if if that causes me not to be able to get in so hopefully the stream goes well if if you are having any trouble watching it uh let me know and then i'll adjust the settings some more today's gonna be a short stream i have my first intern is starting today and they're gonna come in and i'm gonna try to help him out you know get him set up and just kind of walk them through um you know what how how we do things you know walking through get you know github how to submit pull requests and things like that uh it looks like you're getting audio only all right let me switch to my other screen get video issues too buffering only hmm so it looks like there may still be problems i switched to a different view i don't know why that would work but last time i think some of you said that it helped when i did that if that doesn't help i'll stop the stream and restart it because i think i think that helped last time all right uh so i guess the audio is fine so i'm gonna s still buffering huh that's weird the network is just not as good as it was i don't know what happened with the network here but i used to be able to run on these settings easily all right so since you all can hear me at least let me walk you through what we're going to do because the first part i was just going to explain it anyway so that's fine let me let's see live latency 75 seconds all right all right let me stop the stream quickly so i can set turn the settings down a bit and then that might help all right let me know if it's any better now or if it's still bad i did turn the settings down a bit and i shut down a lot of programs let's see all right right now it's saying i'm not dropping frames all right cool i also shut down i was running the slack desktop app uh the sql studio um app and uh the microsoft office or the um microsoft outlook app as well so i don't know maybe those could be draining things i i know i've always heard that electron apps are resource intensive so you know two of those three i i know are electron apps i don't think the um the outlook app is but and we're also running a couple of windows of visual studio code which i'm not going to shut down because we're going to use it so that's it oh and i have spotify running so that could be it uh so so the webcam is still dropping frames but it but it is better uh i'm really gonna have to mess with the settings at some point but as as long as you can see the code let me let me get some code up here so let me know if this is readable all right so i'm waiting for a response let me see there i know there was a question up here uh blake asks if he should go with uh something like shopify or woocommerce wordpress um i've never used shopify uh so i can't i can't really comment on it i just know that i hear about it a lot it seems pretty popular uh i'd say for woocommerce if you don't plan on having a lot of traffic to your site woocommerce would be fine it's pretty easy to use but i have seen sites that when they get a ton of traffic woocommerce seems to run really slow and take up a lot of resources so that's something to keep in mind but as i said i think that's only really a problem if you're gonna have a lot of traffic at once and um i just saw a site like that and they would run sales and things and whenever that happened their site was really really slow all right harsha's saying it's kind of unwatchable all right let me see what else i can shut down the code is readable all right it seems the code is readable i'm gonna shut down more stuff let's turn off everything um actually i'm going to turn off ang rock as well let's turn off some posters we're not going to use this today make sure we'll need that all right so it looks like um you all can see the words which is fine you don't really need to see my face anyway um so as long as as long as you can hear me and you can see what i'm doing then this should work and i will work more on getting this to work uh like i said i'm i don't know i don't know what's up with the internet um so anyway hey everybody that's saying hi on the live chat sorry for the the weirdness uh again on the quality um let's see oh hey um viniqua norwood is here i think i said your name wrong last time so i think i said verneek and i'm pretty sure you told me at the november conference it was for neuqua let me know which way is the right way to say it because i felt really bad i didn't remember until after the stream that um i'm pretty sure i did the same thing when i met you and uh and then i forgot again all right harsh it says streams at 720p um not 1080. harsha says changing coding settings um yeah i can try to mess with the settings more it just is so weird that the the settings that have been working for i don't know the last eight months is not all of a sudden do not work anymore all right let's see let's see all right is it better when i don't have the video there all right all right let me try to let me try to work um all right so here's the problem that we need to fix so we need to do it in like less than 40 minutes i mean we don't have to but i'd like to in the stream so i have is this it yeah uh so right now we have some routing set up so we have our default routing through next js which all right the stream status is good right now i changed the output so let me know hopefully this is good now i definitely don't want to drop down to 720p all the time but uh 10 i'd rather have 1080 for now it's okay let me know um leonard says your boss needs to sort out his priorities it's definitely not up to my boss what um what my internet i have it's it's definitely uh another department and higher up than that all right cool so it's better now i don't know maybe maybe something was done to the internet that i'm not aware of and i won't be able to stream at the same quality as before i don't know we'll see i hope that's not the case but i mean 720p i guess is is doable all right so it looks like the stream status is staying good at least from that's what youtube is telling me okay all right let's let's do this now but uh really really sorry that uh we've taken up this much time on technical difficulties um okay so here's what i want to do in order to keep the urls the same uh what i need to do is instead of like a uh top level your like for instance if we were to type in right now the way this is set up if i were to type in something like franciscan dot university slash about it would route to a page named about here it would render that page but what i wanted to do if someone were to type in slash about i wanted to send all the traffic for that to a one component but that's not what it's the only thing that's going to happen i want multiple routes to be sent to that one component and i want to pass in some data just like we're doing here and that's going to determine what data gets rendered there so you see it's these are no longer going to be like single pages so we're basically kind of like overriding the default behavior for uh for next but i don't really see another way i discussed some of these in the latest issue in this repository if you want to read more about why and what i'm trying to do you can check that out uh the possible solution i gave there i don't think is the best i thought about it more and i i think the one that i've come up with now is better so you can see some of my idea here in my comments i'm gonna route each page individually to one component like majors and then pass in the correct slug manually as the id and then we're also gonna have a proper route so we're gonna have one route that matches the old routing system which i don't think is is organized properly then we're going to have the new routes what's that that is going to end up having two different pages with the same content which is not great for seo but we got to do it because we want a more reasonable routing structure url structure but then we also don't want to break links uh so i'll take my chances with the seo so here's what we're going to do and this is very much gonna be like a test of whether or not this even works so i've thought about it it should work but i haven't tried it yet okay so let's do this down here we um let's see we pasted yeah let's put that there let's see here we go all right so we're going to work first with majors um no no it's not there so let's work with theo i know theology is a uh right now there's a theology is like a um i'm gonna say like a top level um in in the hierarchy of our urls and let's route this to the component called major so what i want to happen is let's see id is theology as a string there we are so what i want to happen then is to have several of these and let's go nursing and this will also be nursing alright so this might be a little bit easier to understand so we're going to have to manually put in these and then pass in what we want to major that's more work than i wanted to do uh but the alternative would be and this is the alternative that i had in uh the issue uh that i opened the alternative i was thinking would be that everything we basically put an id right here and then pass in whatever that string is here and the the problem is then we won't be we can't use custom post types for everything everything in wordpress would have to be a page or let's say a blog post i'd probably do it as a page because it would make more sense to people um but then you'd have a bunch of different stuff in there together so like all your majors would be in there but then you'd have like your privacy policy in there and you know everything that's that top level in the hierarchy of the url would all have to be in there so it would be a mess to to keep up to date so i think i'd rather have a bit of a mess here in the code and that way i only have to deal with it and then the people who are going to edit things in wordpress will have things looking a lot more neat and organized it mean it makes sense for me to be able to do this is going to be a pain now but it's not going to be that much of a pain later because these aren't going to change like ever but we'll have you know students uh student workers editing these things and you know people that don't have necessarily that much uh experience so it'd be easier if things were more straightforward for them so that's why i've decided to do it this way instead the other way it's going to make our file here a lot bigger but i just i don't really see any way around that right now all right so let's give this a test here so let's see theology and nursing so we already have this data in yeah i think we have this data and i'll have to check on the slugs and make sure we have the proper slugs but we should be able to pull some of this in so let's go into our oh let's bring this back and let's make a component now called major file all right so we make this component called major and i did a test component a little while ago i think i can just copy this and paste it in a major and it should work for what we want to do now we we're going to need a new query yeah we're going to need a new query as well but this should work query id all right so this was just showing the id that's getting passed in so i want more than that i think what i'll need is what are we doing for news here yeah we'll want something like this all right so it's not going to be news it's going to be major and we're gonna have to change this query so this would be major query query major major query why all right um i used to find it never used all right well let's get rid of it all right so we have this query and let's change it here major all right so now let's go to where we have our queries let's make one called major so i'm trying to go more quickly than i usually do because this it has to be a short stream um i will get back to the live chat and answer some questions before the stream is over uh i just want to get something i want to at least do one test of this uh before the stream's over did we make ours called major i thought i did oh well uh new file okay um let's try nope not that one um i do need that one and news yeah so basically need the same thing as the news query um but we're gonna put it in major and we'll name this major query i'm gonna double check directory all right maybe maybe we need this to be plural majors where name okay id title slug content exit i don't think we're gonna have an excerpt for this i don't think we brought it in and i don't care about the date i need to just okay that's this is i think all we care about right now all right so we have our query ready we have our page ready our our component uh i don't care about console logging this and let's see and we're bringing the right thing in here all right uh let's see see if we can get this to work oh i know we need to check our um our slugs to see if they match up in wordpress so i have wordpress open here i need to log in again but we should be able to check so uh i guess i'll search oh i didn't bring theology in what did i bring in business program texts all right we'll just have to change what we're sending in business all right did this come in as maybe as business things so i guess this came in differently than i expected let's see if this one is more what i'm expecting i don't think so all right let's change our slugs in oops uh let's get this sorry miss clicking let's go to our screen options and slug so i can see it and i just wanted to say economics and we probably should double check that i'll let that load because it's going to take a while um economics and let's change this one to accounting let's check this and let's go to undergraduate academics i think that's where we want to be all right we're okay on time not too bad and our major programs economics and accounting we should have yep okay so economics and accounting yep they they have the url structure that i expected them to have and good all right so we're trying to pull i suppose this content i'm not worried about this content uh it's basically just this that i i want to pull right for right now and i'll have to decide with my boss how much of this we want to keep or even what format we want to keep it in all right so now we have the right slugs i just need to change up the slugs in our code to match uh so let's go back to our server and we'll change theology to economics and we'll change nursing to accounting for those of you who really love alphabetical order sorry about that um all right so let's see if this works i wonder i don't know if i have to restart the server for this to work we'll find out in a second uh i'm on here we go localhost let's give it a refresh and let's try economics okay i might i'm gonna have to refresh this um i does anybody have the location stuff activated on facebook where it tells you when nearby people are around so some of my coworkers have it activated and it always tells me when i'm sitting in my office like say hi to this person they're nearby i'm always like of course they're nearby they work in the same office as me uh i guess i should turn it off comedy property edge is undefined all right so it looks like we weren't getting the data that we wanted all right let's check out what we did um am i passing the right thing yeah i'm passing economics i'm passing accounting um all right and then within our component yeah we're trying we're grabbing the id it should return the id so our id should be in props and then we're passing this id to our query oops i forgot to change the name of this component major major oh so simple it's easy to forget let's see i guess it didn't matter much yeah it didn't even matter at all right because it was still going here um let's see i see there's some uh questions in the live chat i will get to the live chat soon okay veronique thank you for um correcting me i don't know why i thought it was it was different anyway i just i'm glad that i got it right and uh thanks thanks again anyway thanks for watching too uh i hope everything's going well with you all right did i date a major edges maybe it's majors let's try that out yeah that was it i just needed to put majors yay all right cool so we have our economics courses and then we'll have what are we gonna have here um accounting accounting great we have accounting now let's try to go to a page that we have with our next router uh the way i've done this it should work our next router should still work for anything we've set up as its own page so this test graphql page should work still okay cool um i'm assuming that's what we wanted to do here yeah we did we hardcoded that in great all right so so far this is working well not an ideal situation because i'm gonna have to put a lot of these in the only other thing that i wanted to do is to do something like this and we can test this out very easily is i want to say if we have major economics i wanted to do the same thing basically so let's save that and restart this and then economics awesome and that works as well uh let's just verify that the the first way works too cool i was actually uh i i majored well actually the school i went to you couldn't major in economics you it was like a triple thing all put together but economics is one of the things i studied all right cool so hopefully you can see how some of that worked now we will be able to keep the old urls working but still have our new url structure so the url structure that has like major and then economics that one is going to be what we use for all the navigation in the site and then for any old links this will still work uh i think i don't know it's it's a way that works i can just move forward and just grind out all this you know just play some music and just start copying and pasting and changing things and i should be able to get it all finished you know in an hour or less um yeah i think it can work um i need your id oh yeah har thank you uh we could just put in um the major id so yeah let me do that now that's yeah that's actually um a lot better so just like we're doing up here with the news id instead of passing in economics manually we're going to pass in um these params from here and let's save that and test it actually let's test that with accounting right now all right i just wanted to verify that i do in fact have to stop and start the server when i do that david says remind yourself jesse overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer i think david did you say the same thing in the last stream i do think it was the last stream i mean it's good advice um all right awesome so it does work excellent and economics yay all right great wow can't believe i got that uh harsh also says might remove that extra heading in the component yeah yeah we'll remove that uh too that was just for some testing i was the one earlier um so we won't we won't have uh this heading this was just to verify i don't even remember because i was obviously wasn't testing this component i pasted it over from a different one so i was testing something and i left it in there because it was a component that was never gonna be used i was just gonna delete the whole thing um all right so let me now go to the chat i'm gonna answer as many questions as i can before my new intern shows up and so it uh if the intern shows up and i'm not done yet then i might not get to all the questions but i'll do my best so uh three one says when tech experts have problems it makes me feel better it makes me feel good that that that implies that i'm a tech expert which i really don't consider myself a tech expert but uh it still feels good to have that implied all right john hanson says famous words have been spoken this should work sometimes when i say this should work it doesn't work but in our case it actually worked exactly like i i thought it was gonna work so does not happen all the time but it happened today which is great because we didn't have that much time for troubleshooting uh rook asked if there was a stream yesterday there was not a stream yesterday uh i was i did a little bit of work from home yesterday um i wasn't feeling well over the weekend i'm not sure if i had food poisoning or the flu uh just in case it was the flu i didn't want to come in here and get everybody sick so i thought i better uh just do some work from ho let's see i heard harshad said can't believe that data is well formatted the old style sheet is working fine in here too um yeah can you i it's amazing i mean this this formatting is really good um like now i mean this is compare if you hadn't seen some of the stuff we brought in earlier it might not look really good to you right now but for sure compared to the other data that we brought in this this looks great uh which is good these this i think is one of the things that we're going to be able to just bring it all in and just let it go as is at first and this will be adequate and then we can add on to it as if we get everything else finished or even after we launched as we had have time yeah so that's going to be the idea for every page except for the home page the home page we're going to put is you know a lot more effort into because you know way more people are gonna see the home page uh than any interior page uh so we want that to look nice and if you go into an interior page you want info so as long as we have the information there i'm okay with that we can always add something that looks nice a little bit nicer later on um rowler rauler says i just got here what are you making all right so uh just a quick recap um i was using next js with react next comes with a builtin router but i needed to do some things with the url structure uh because we're migrating from an old site and need to keep the old links working i needed to do some things that next doesn't do by default but we already kind of had some we had some custom parameterized routing setup anyway so we just kind of extended that and was able to uh we were able to keep the old urls route them to where we needed and so that's pretty much it it didn't it didn't even take us that long now i did give it some some thought beforehand and as to how i would do it um but it all worked out john hanson says is it possible to pull the ids needed for the page routes so you need to only write one function i i've been thinking about that so here's what i all right here's what i thought and i think i explained this a little bit before but i didn't really do a great job um so let's say i just did this and had let's say id what would happen then i mean it assume i have the right stuff here as well but what would happen then is this would make the uh the next routing it would override everything none of the routing and next would work so what i would need to do then is make sure that every page that needs every page that a user would go to that would have a url that would just be slash and then something and no slash after that would need to exist as the same post type in wordpress you can't currently search for a string in multiple post types at the same time with the wp graphql plugin there was an issue open about it it's something that would be nice to have but right now it's something that would take a lot of work so instead of trying to do php which i'm not great with and somehow um make that happen with the plugin we're using this is easier it's gonna be let's say uglier when you read the code but it's definitely going to be an easier solution a faster solution ideally what i would like to be able to do is do this and then search but as i said before that is going to make things messy in the admin panel uh for wordpress so i brought in you know so right now we have things separated out in a post type so we would end up have having is a lot of stuff in here as like pages and it would query whatever the string is that gets passed into the as the id from the url it would query that and it would look in all the pages for that slug so we would just have a lot of different pages and i don't even know how many pages use this but i'm i'm pretty sure uh like the privacy policy so all the majors have it the um contact us privacy for policy uh directions nondiscrimination i don't know this is consumer information see it's not even consistent so we have consumer information has it but then also we have um page within consumer information so basically what would happen you know this site's been added on to over the years so we just have a lot of variety so i think this way is going to still let us keep the custom post types as much as possible but still give us a way to kind of manipulate the urls a bit when we need to pretty easily so anyway all right john john said i get it you got to do what you got to do yeah this is definitely one of those you gotta do what you gotta do situations here i met with my boss last week and he was he said no we gotta keep those urls and i just said okay i'll figure it out so uh i didn't work i didn't really work this weekend but i was thinking about it all weekend so i guess i've come up with a solution i i just it's a tradeoff i came up with several solutions and they all involve tradeoffs this one seems like it will work out the best considering everybody that's gonna be working on the project and what our needs are all right so i think i got through all the comments questions uh so i'm right on time here and yeah so i will be back tomorrow uh i guess maybe i'll probably be back around 1 i don't know if 12 is a better better time maybe i'll try to do 12. uh 12 is normally like my lunch break but i could always take a lunch break like earlier or later not a big deal to me um but i will be back and uh hopefully i'll have any issues sorted out with uh my streaming so we don't have you know the craziness that we had today uh let's see if anybody if anybody's really knowledgeable about obs which i'm using for streaming uh and you have or if you know of any articles or anything that could help out without with that let me know um i'm gonna try to look up some stuff test out some different things okay all right it looks like 12 is is a good time for some of you are saying that in the live chat okay all right maybe i'll try for 12 then yeah you know there's there's actually way less of um a chance of me having a meeting at 12 since it's normally everybody's lunch hour so maybe it's not such a bad time okay well i'm going to wrap things up here thank you so much for your patience with all the technical difficulties we had at the beginning of the stream and uh thank you for your your help as well in the live chat and uh it's just it's really cool everybody being here especially all of you that stuck through all that stuff at the beginning it was like almost half the stream i think was just taken up with you know trying to get the stream working properly um all right that's it for me uh i'll be back tomorrow and until then have a great day
