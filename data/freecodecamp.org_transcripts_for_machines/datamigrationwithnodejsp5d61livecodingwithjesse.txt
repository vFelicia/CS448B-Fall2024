hey everyone welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going gonna do a shorter than normal stream because i have a meeting in less than an hour uh and also we're doing something that may end up being a little bit boring we're doing some data transfer so it needs to be done i need to get all this data transferred really soon because i'd like to have um i'd like to be done with it be done with the data transfer and just finish out getting a test version of this site available on a public url for everyone to try and give us a month before we need to launch you know to have as many people as possible test it and get feedback so that's why we're doing uh just some data transfer stuff you know on the stream which i usually save for uh when i'm not streaming but i thought it might be useful to show it and um i'm a little bit a little bit tired today my daughter cordelia who's one and a half just wanted to party last night so she didn't feel like sleeping uh so if i if i sound a little like uh less enthusiastic than normal that's why so i'm gonna try my best to fight that though okay so let's get started let me switch my view and the first thing i'm going to do is just introduce you to the code we're using to migrate so it's been a long time since i've i've showed this code uh on a stream so you may not be um you may not be familiar with it unless you watched i don't know maybe two months ago it would have been the last time we showed it so this was basically built by one of the the viewers so harshit uh built this and i've modified it depending on the type of content that i need to bring over but what we're doing is we're bringing in a few packages right so this is node.js in particular we have sqlize and fetch so sqlize helps us to get data from a sql database in one case we're going from one type of sql database to another type of sql database so sql server to my mysql so we're we have our database info right so name password everything we need to actually get in there and i can connect to this database but only from this computer that i'm at right now and only if i'm on a certain network so um i'm a little bit limited in in what i can do so we're connecting to the sql server database and then we're pulling out data so we have this sql query here and this is just using a template literal right to write our sql query so i manually modify the sql query based on the data that i'm getting so on my other screen i just have an excel spreadsheet that i i created from that database that gives me the content of each um what do you say like each row in the excel spreadsheet gives me one item in the database and i can see the content i could see the folder id and that's what we're using the folder id is the key piece of content so we want to bring over the content id the title the content html the teaser the date created from our content table where folder id is whatever we set it to in this case i just imported everything from 4 to 441 and then data length of content html is greater than zero so there's there are a lot of items in the database that have no content at all i don't want to bother bringing them over so that's why we have this piece to filter out so we're grabbing all that and then the next step is let's insert it into my sql database so that's why we're using fetch that's why we imported fetch here node fetch so in the browser now depending on your browser you would automatically have access to fetch but this is server side so we have to bring in node fetch or something like that there's another package called unfetch that'll do the same thing so we're going to use the wordpress api to put the data into our mysql database because we're using wordpress to manage that database so why not just use the api and it will make sure that that data gets put in in the proper order in just the right way that wordpress likes so that's why we ended up doing it like that so you can see here we we take our wordpress um our uri so basically we have the url we already have uh the url that we're we're trying to send it to here and then we just add in the post type that we wanted to go into in this case i was adding an into graduate program which is a post type that i just created a few minutes ago to handle some of that data we have a few other options here that are commented out but if we needed to make some changes to the titles we're using some regular expressions to do that in this case we don't need to or i didn't need to for that last post type we also are doing some things to manipulate the date so that the date gets into the the format the dates in and the old server is not the right format we need for the new server so we do some stuff to make sure it is in the right format and then this is the how we format the data so we basically just take the data in the way that the wordpress api wants it and we just plug in what we've gotten from the sql server so wordpress doesn't want content html they want content see so we just put it in the right the right way and we just do a simple fetch right and we just send that data to the right place and then the wordpress api takes care of all of the rest and actually inserting that into the right place in the my sql database so that's it i mean it's it's it works it it works really really well but it's not it's not super complicated to go through it so let's do some some more migration uh let me say hello to everybody i see this uh some of you saying hi um i see there's already a few questions let me let's do it like this what time is it okay let me start my pomodoro timer i'm gonna do one pomodoro session and then i'll answer all the questions after that up until um maybe about five minutes till three p.m eastern time and then i'll have to stop and go to a meeting okay so hang in there if you've asked a question or if you want to ask a question i'll get to it in about 25 minutes so for now let's we're going to basically be here for most of the time if we need to make another custom post type we're going to be here if you're interested in the plugin that we created to handle all these different custom post types and taxonomies this is now on the github repo so if you go to that fus marcom github organization this is the latest repository there i've i've added that plugin which that's that's new i i just did that last week before that i wasn't tracking it with git all right so i have on a few of my other screens i have some uh some data uh already set up in terms of like that spreadsheet that i told you about and just a list of items that i've as i've gone through building the site i've noticed like hey we don't have this data yet so owners program pages saving the same savio pages all right so let's see here's here's my process let me drag some of this over to the screen and here's my oops let me organize this a bit better let's pull this over here there we are okay so what i've been doing is basically just searching the site to find out some of the pages this is the current website summer ancient and biblical languages institute so i currently don't have any of the data for this program that we have um so our ancient language institute oh that's a pdf all right definitely don't need to worry about that right now there we are so i go in here and just try to see like all right how many pieces of data are we looking at two three four five maybe like five pages so not really a lot occasionally these pages will be broken up into different pieces of data so it may be more than five that we're looking at and then i'll grab some of the text and usually it's it's just enough to grab like seven or eight words and then i go over to my spreadsheet which i'm gonna pull this over so that you all can see it let's fold over here so i go over to my spreadsheet this is going to be really small it it doesn't really matter to be able to read it it's just like the concept of how i'm doing this so i paste that in and try to find it it looks like it's not here that's not good news so well it may or may not be good news it could mean that i've already brought it over uh and didn't realize it at the time that i brought that data over let me try to grab just some other piece of data from here um let's see maybe this one uh the other possibility is that this page has been edited since i made a copy i had a copy made of the database and so uh this data is actually newer than what i had so that's why i'm going to try to grab another piece of data and try to do a search with that there we are okay so it looks like we're we are able to find this awesome so this is a little bit small so you may not be able to see it but i found a few pages that do say that that's sabl institute and now i can look over here at the folder number and it's 346 and if i look every piece of data here in that 346 folder all have to do with that same institute so safe to say we can grab this everything in this 346 folder and categorize it in in our new database as um as that type of of data so let's see i know i just lost it three four six yeah this spreadsheet is a little intense um now i want to make sure it seems like i'm missing a pitch one two three four why is there only four so one two three four five let me see what this page is see this is like part detective work all right this explains why i only have four pieces of data because this page doesn't really have content it's pulling um other content that we've already brought over but just in a different post type these this content is stored under our faculty profiles so we've already pulled these over so that explains why so i i need to be really careful to make sure that i don't miss parts because that could be a mess later on uh when you know i'm trying to launch and people are saying this page doesn't work this page doesn't work and uh so this is good this this should be fine sapos yeah so we may need to make a custom post type for this so let me bring over and show you what we have going on in wordpress so right now okay we do have a post type for institutes let's check out if we have anything in there yet what you gotta be kidding me i have this institute texts ancient languages all right let's see read the ancient writers from the words experience immersion we may i may have already brought this over if so that is excellent course credit descriptions let's see if we have that wow and it's already categorized you got to be kidding me so uh this is really good news unfortunately i didn't when i first started bringing over data i was just bringing over a ton of data and i didn't take the time to mark down what i was bringing over and so occasionally not often but occasionally i run into this where i've actually already brought over data but it was so long ago that i didn't even remember so this is great now what we can do is go in here and delete these rows i made a copy of the original spreadsheet i was working off of but in this one every time i verify the data is there i delete the rows so ideally what will happen is once i have no rows left i will know that i've transferred every bit of data so that's the idea i just have to make sure i'm very careful so that that in fact is is really the case so it looks like for sure everything in this folder here i can go through but also we have this veritas center which i believe i saw that in there as well we can verify that um there it says i thought we had it in here oh there's two pages let's see the shout out conference hmm oh you know what i guess i gave them their own custom post type so where it's uh so we do have veritas stuff in here there's a center for bio ethics do i have that it doesn't seem like i have that particular piece of data oh i do i have it here veritas center for republica all right um i will i'll have to figure out what the heck is going on with that because i don't really see why i would want to separate out those two into different post types but i have verified that it's there so we can delete that as well that's great now i can mark that off my list and next thing on the list are honors programs which is awesome because i just happen to have the honors program pages right here all right honors program it looks like we only have three three pages here honest program requirements let's verify though and we can get rid of this and this we'll go back to our search type in honors program okay so this is actually treated as if it were a major in terms of um where this content is on the site and the url it's given so it's the same way as as we would treat a program or a major so that's interesting and we also have two different urls for this we have one with a hyphen and one without a hyphen i bet they go to the same page do all right we'll have to make sure we account for that in our routing uh if we haven't already but um all right so it looks okay like we we have that honors program the great thinkers requirements list information there we go requirements is here under owners program as well and then austria so those are the three things we need and none of this is okay good so we have this honors program stuff what i think we'll do then is we'll put this data in the same place as we would put other majors and things like that and i think we'll categorize it underneath the classics category that we already have since that's where it's it's being categorized right now we probably should verify that it's not already there so let's go into our majors section type in honors honors program quick links so it looks like we don't have everything honestly quick links okay so we do have one piece of data here oops but not everything so let's pull this over then so we need a few pieces of information and that is the folder id which looks like it's 340. so we're going to put in 340 into here okay and then in this case we want this to be under the major post type so we're going to type in major and then we also want to make sure this isn't the right category so we have this faculty department taxonomy and we have to get the category id so let's go back over here where wordpress is and make sure we can get the right id so if we go to faculty department and we go over to classics if i hover over it the url shows up really small at the bottom and that url has the id number which is 19. that's the fastest way that i've found to just get the id right away with the fewest number of clicks so i get 19. so now i can go back here type in 19 and that's all we have to change and now i can just run this so i'm going to run node migrate.js because that's what this file is called that we're working in we can do migrate.js and see uh it's you know it gives us a little message here of you know here's the sql query that we're running and then here's how many posts we brought over which is three which is what we expected i cancelled that out just by pressing ctrl c now we can go back over to wordpress and verify that that data is there now so if we go back to let's see uh classics because that's the category we went to and click that it'll give us all the classic stuff we should be able to see yep we have the honors program front page honors program requirements on this program for students in austria and we could click that and see how this comes through it's actually not bad right we can see the the raw html here it's not too bad you know we've got h1s and things so um there's occasionally weird stuff like right down here we just have an h5 just hanging out in empty h5 i'm gonna get rid of that i don't clean up the data always i just wanted to show you what it's like eventually i do want to go through and clean it all up but it's not a hundred percent necessary before launch at least not for most pages i mean ideally i also wouldn't have like eight h1 two h3s and an h4 all right there at the top it's a little odd um but all in all that's not really bad that you know this data is coming out of a totally different content management system and we're able to pull it into wordpress and it it basically works so i'm just going to update that but we can see it also pulls over the correct publish date so this data was actually published in 2014 long before i was working here but this gives us a way to keep track of like how old is the data actually so that's why we're bringing over the original publish dates otherwise everything would seem like it was published this year which is definitely not the case wonderful so now the next step would be make sure i get rid of this data in the spreadsheet so it's just those three pieces i'm going to delete that and then on my other screen i just have a checklist in google keep so i'm just checking things off as i go through and i do wanna at this point check how much time i have left see if we can get into anything okay about seven minutes and i see there's a lot more questions in there i'm not i'm not ignoring the live chat forever i will get back to it in about seven minutes uh let's see i'm gonna try to get one more type of data in and um depending on what we have i i may even need to make a custom post type here or taxonomy add categories to jobs okay i need to get hr profiles so this i i might need an another um custom post type for this so first i want to try to find where this is on the website so don't think about there we go human resources i won't need to search for this one i i know where it's at in the menu uh let's see hr i think that's these are where they were yeah so there's this whole section of why i chose franciscan and it's people that work here and it's their story about why they they work here so the data that i really want is this here and you know this image as well it should just be a url linking that image for now so that's that's what we want to find so once again i'm just going to grab some of this data and i'm going to go back over to our spreadsheet i'm gonna paste that in and search for it no couldn't find it all right let's try to grab it from somewhere else you gotta be kidding me oh thank you i i maybe since i had highlighted those sections it was only searching in that section so uh all right great so it looks like we we have these um those same names of the people that we just saw up there and this is in for 615 so let's double check um wow this profile is actually for the head of my department so uh i believe sh the ex she's the executive director i think that's her title um great so let's bring over everything here in the 615 folder i'm going to create a new post type and these are going to be hr profiles as far as i can tell they are definitely different from some of the other profiles that we've we've brought over so let's create the post type first and then we'll we'll bring them over so we we do that we have an option actually so we already have we can see in wordpress we have an hr section so we could just bring these over into hr into that section uh human resources and perhaps give them some sort of um category or something that would say like okay these are our profiles we want to use either way we have to set up something either a custom taxonomy or a custom post type i think it'll be easier right now to do a custom post type it's something that could definitely be changed at some point let me see what the url looks like this is going to be the probably the big deal actually uh how the url structure is whoa that's awful i don't know if you can see that url but that's no good all right so i don't know what's up with that one but this one let's see all right so our ur structures hr slash profiles slash and then we have uh last name hyphen first name hmm what would be would be the easiest way to bring this in all right let me think about it just just for a few seconds uh i'm trying to think how our how our router works in our server.js file in our react site i think we'll be fine i think yeah we'll be fine to just pull this into our hr pages i don't even think we need a category yeah i think we'll be okay uh there's gonna be a slight chance that this data could be pulled in if you type in a different url but i'm not worried about that it won't conflict with existing urls so i think we'll be okay all right so let's go over so this this will make it a lot faster so let's verify was that 6 15 okay where am i at six yeah so let's go 6 15. 615 and let's go human human resource i think i did it let's let's make sure that i did it like that human resource yep all right so when you bring it in uh in here it has to be the singular so it sounds a little weird to say a human resource but that's how i named it and we need let's let's go with let's clean up the names first all right so we're going to clean up our names and we're going to add that to the slug that'll help us uh it may not perfectly get the slugs how we want it but it'll get them a lot closer and i i think that'll be easier we might luck out some of them might have the right slugs automatically we won't have to manually change them so we don't need this faculty department and i think we're i think we're good and that's what we need all right so let's save that run it there we are we got six of them it's stopped that process and then now we can go back over here check out our human resources and see oh nice so we we do have now these people here and let's check out our slugs so i do i want to see how it works with someone that has a doctor and their name where the slugs come out i mean all right awesome those slugs are actually perfect so it's been so long since we did that regular expression i couldn't remember exactly what it would do but it actually is uh is perfect it reverses the name so you have last name first and then first name takes out doctor or any title like that and adds the hyphen so uh there will be no need for us to go in and manually adjust those slugs and you can see we we have urls and fortunately they are relative urls so once i eventually transfer all of the image the images from where they reside now to our wherever i'm going to have them later on as long as i keep the same folder structure all those relative urls will still work so it'll save a ton of time and um that should work so i think yeah it won't work automatically right now because i need to set up a few more things in the router uh but otherwise as soon as i i set up that route in our server.js file those should work fine they should be good awesome so my timer is is up um trying to think so what i need to do i don't need to um push anything to github because all the changes we made we're just transferring data we didn't make any changes to code so now i got to keep an eye on my time so i make get to my meeting on time but i'm going to go back to the chat and oh let me check off check this off on my uh to do list here it's always nice when you start checking things off and you see that list getting shorter but i am now i'm going to spend the whole rest of the time answering your questions and checking out your comments in the live chat uh tech techie gang says sir i just graduated and have moderate knowledge in html and css what should i do to get a great start in career if you want a career as a developer like a web developer then keep learning more about html and css but then also learn some javascript as well start into that so i recommend uh if you if you have some time now uh start with free code cam if you already know a little html and css the first few lessons are going to be really easy for you but then you'll you'll move into javascript and that'll give you a nice foundation so if you go to freecodecamp.org that's a great place to start there are a lot of other resources but you know kind of as a simple answer to your question i would start there and as soon as you feel comfortable start building some projects set up your get your github profile and put your projects on github after you get a few projects made get more comfortable you could start applying to jobs and you know you gotta you have a real shot at becoming a developer you know depending on how much work you can put into it you know somewhere maybe in the next year even uh you'd be ready to get a good job so that means different for everybody depends on a lot of the factors but you know it's definitely a possibility javascript is here hey what's up harshit's here nikki everybody's here we got we have all our other regular people i think are in here awesome marshall says yeah i remember that file yeah that's honestly hardship that that has been great i use it constantly uh for migrating data it just worked perfectly uh javascript just says why not use algolia for search instead of powered by google so this is the the search uh that we were talking about um i'm just gonna type in rugby because i'm curious to see whether or not we have sports pages on here anyway this website i've had very very little to do with it was developed before i started working here so a lot of the decisions that pretty much all the decisions were made without me really i've the only work i've done on this is just really really minimal things like if something looks really bad sometimes i get to change it um i did do some work to try to make it faster and i did make it significantly faster but it's still really slow like if your load times are like 160 seconds on 3g and you cut the load times in half your site is still insanely slow right it still has 80 seconds load time so i percentagewise it was impressive how i cut the load times but it's still too slow which is a big reason why we're completely redoing the site so anyway javascript that's why we're not using algolia because i had no say in that hey dimitri says hi jesse how are you not bad i'm a little bit tired but other than that i'm okay uh any how are you doing if you're still here dimitri let me know michael says just remember to build a cute 404 page before a launch just in case you know what i i actually put that in as an issue in the github repo uh that we need a 404 page i thought about it sometime last week and i i thought i definitely need to make this an issue so i don't forget chris is that html inside your database uh yes i'm i'm pretty sure i know what you're talking about like what with that and what i was showing on the screen and yes like the the actual html uh comes over michael says instead of deleting out of the xl why not add a um you know a yes or no column for imported and filter out for blanks uh or no that way you want to accidentally delete something that probably has been a better idea at this point i'm just going to keep going with that with what i have i do have a copy of that excel sheet that doesn't have any of anything deleted that i can refer to if i if i need to if later on i realized like i'm missing something i can always double check on that and i still have the actual database that is still intact so there's a few ways i could still find that but anyway michael that that probably would have been a better way i just didn't think about it javascript just says i forgot how does one shoot a vid or do a live for free code camp um you could try to like make a video on your own and then send it to you probably want to talk to beau carnes um you could try talking to quincy but i think he usually says like talk to beau because beau handles a lot of um like bringing people into the channel and letting them know like he he did like some training with me uh when i came in and bo is actually the one that saw my live streams on my channel first and then invited me to come onto this channel so i would get a hold of him on twitter or through email or something like that and let him know you're interested you know send them a video that you've done something like that and then that's you know you just go from there uh good gideon i'm not sure how to pronounce that but gideon says isn't there a better way to do this if anyone knows a better way to do this let me know the problem that i found is that the data is so separated out i i can't bring over large chunks at a time if i want it to be organized at all on the other side uh there's no there's just nothing i could find the only thing i could find that even remotely groups data into reasonable groups is that folder id and there are so many folders that i i have to go through and say okay what is in this folder what should we categorize it as and then bring it over so there were some chunks some folders that had a lot of stuff in it and i was able to bring over like 700 things at once and that was awesome but now i'm getting to the point where all the folders that are left only have a few things in each folder so it's just kind of slowing the process down a lot i mean really if anybody thinks there's a better way to do it that would be easy to implement and switch to and get through all the rest of it you know let me know uh i'm open to trying but at this point i migrated more than half of the data i hope and uh so just i'm kind of gonna like stick with what i have and get through it uh destroyer of world says what cms was it a cms content management system uh just in case um you're not familiar with that term uh it was called ektron all right nikki says is ektron yeah yeah and the new cms is wordpress the old one is ektron so extron is not very easy to work with in my opinion um not nearly as easy to work with as wordpress and it costs a lot of money to use it every year and you have very limited amount of users uh who can actually edit things in extron wordpress way more userfriendly um and you can have unlimited users for free so it was kind of a nobrainer and like should we switch our content management system like absolutely another big thing is ektron the company is no longer a company anymore got bought out by another company so i'm not even confident that it's really receiving good support anymore hattie says i am new with this project where do you get this data from and what will this website do are you writing a personal code and running it with wordpress are we able to do that um okay so nikki answered so i'm writing a site and this is how nikki says he's writing the site in react and using wordpress as a headless cms so yeah i'm getting all the data from an old uh database and i'm bringing it over into wordpress uh heidi says i heard that wordpress does most of the work but you're writing your own code can you explain a little yeah okay so the code that you were seeing was well two there are two pieces of code that i showed you one was the little bit of node.js that we were using to migrate data and then the other thing i i showed briefly was a php plugin for wordpress uh so if you're not at all familiar with wordpress you you write plugins in order to add functionality to wordpress and in this case we're adding post types so like if you think of a post in a blog that comes standard in wordpress but if you want to add another piece of a type of content in and you can do that and create a custom post type so that's what we're doing as a way to organize data uh and it's better for the people who need to edit it and then it's better for us to be able to grab that data and use it and react if we separate it out into a lot of you know different post types different categories and things so that's what i'm doing and then there's a whole lot of other code for a react site so we're really only using wordpress for the content management and not for display at all so that's why we say it's a headless wordpress install all the display part of it is happening in reacts an extraordinary of world says lol ektron do you do you have experience with extron very few people have had experience with it but i've never met anybody that actually likes it i apologize if anybody that actually developed ektron is watching in the stream um i'm sure that when it came out it was probably very state of the art it's just by today's standards it's not um a great cms uh heidi says why not use database directly uh because um we need a way for users who don't really have any experience with uh programming to be able to edit content so wordpress is that that user interface that's going to allow them to edit content and have it get saved to a database so if we just were going straight from the database it would be difficult for users to put data in i wouldn't want to put data directly in a database and i know how i still would rather have like a nice whizzy wig editor to do it in uh if it's just some simple you know text content changes so that's why we're doing it like that hey phoenix is here how are you doing uh heidi says can you share your list please i'm interested in how you have uh created it you mean my uh my checklist it was just it's just check boxes in uh in google keep so it's not any like custom thing it's just the standard that comes with it uh chris barker says i would i also would advise people who are familiar with css to look up css grid uh rachel andrews is a good place to start she created the spec uh grid okay actually that's a great i've been meaning to to learn more about css grid lately um my wife and i both we were just talking about it yesterday uh so rachel andrews i'll have to i'll definitely have to look that up thanks for that chris john's here john hanson's is uh i'm here too hey listening today as i'm painting up a storm awesome all right i don't know if any of you know uh john is a really talented artist so he's a man of many talents programming and art and i'm sure other things that i don't even know about uh nathan says really great content jesse i love this content and delivery wow i'm really thank you for saying that i really appreciate that uh sunu says hi hey how's it going nathan says create a solution for this that is generalized to migrate any data set uh it would be cool to catalog the problems at each way uh an ideal solution yeah i i i started doing this i guess before there was so much data it was just so much data and it wasn't categorized in the best way that it was just really difficult to create a solution that would allow me to just bulk import data and really cover all the different situations because some of it just wasn't there wasn't the same set of logic applied like routinely throughout the development of the site so different people who don't even work here anymore added things in and contract workers who never worked here added things in and it sometimes we had like student workers working on it and so it's just really difficult to come up with something that would work for all the data when it was just so uh i guess in a sense like disorganized in some ways all right let me check my time okay i only have like two more minutes so i'm gonna just try to get some of the questions uh harshit's asking me about uh jsaf i really like it i we can get in more into it and twitter today i'm actually super busy so i apologize if i'm not um that active on twitter for any of you that are you know trying to talk to me on any social media uh today's just a busy day for me um okay phoenix says westboss's course on css grid is also really awesome right i'm gonna have to look into that as well i haven't ever taken anything by westboss but everybody says it's awesome so i'm gonna have to try it out john hanson says someone's him a bit of a birder as well uh hattie says i thought cms is something used for both database and uh showing all the content and it can't be separated but you said using cs cms for database why didn't you use database directly yes so um essentially you you can separate them so that's what we've done we've separated all the um basically what a user sees when they come to our website is no longer controlled by wordpress so essentially like you have let's you can't really see my i was going to do something with my hands but like imagine you have a database that lives here the users who are content editors interact with the database through wordpress which sits here and then over here separately i can't get into over here separately sits our react site and that's what users who are coming to the website will see the react site pulls data from the database through wordpress so like no one ever interacts directly with a database wordpress is the intermediary between the two that's both helping to pull the data in in an organized way to a react site and helping content editors to be able to in a very easy way edit things that are in the database without even even realizing there's a database there so that's kind of what we're doing so i think yeah i definitely have to go now my meetings in just a few minutes so anyway thank you all i apologize if i didn't spend couldn't spend as much time as i maybe normally would answering questions feel free to always you know ask me questions in the comments of the videos on twitter uh instagram facebook uh email anything you like in any way you can find me you can write me a letter if you want i'm sure you can find my address if you google me it's probably not that hard uh so you send me a text if you want to um i know my phone number's out there as well but anyway i have to go to a meeting thank you so much everyone for all your great uh encouragement and questions and uh i had a great time doing the stream it definitely woke me up a bit and uh i i'm working on my home setup for streaming hopefully i'll have it ready tomorrow so i can stream from home i'll let y'all know uh on twitter uh for sure uh if i will be streaming or not tomorrow uh so hopefully see y'all tomorrow until then have a great day
