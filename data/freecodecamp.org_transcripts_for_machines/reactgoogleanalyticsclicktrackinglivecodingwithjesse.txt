hey everybody it's Jesse and I've been gone for a while been on vacation so I hope everyone had a great week last week I thought about streaming while I was on vacation but there's no way WiFi would have made it work would have been able to handle it it could barely handle like streaming Netflix at times so I did release one video on my own channel so if you haven't seen that yet you can check that out there's a link to my channel in the description for this video just really short kind of explaining how I got to be a frontend developer today I want to set up some click tracking so I was asked to track the clicks for every link that goes back to our main website from this website so it shouldn't be too difficult so we're already using we're already using a let me just let me show you what it is it's you know like an NPM module that we've imported and it's called react ga so here's reusing and we did do I did do a stream where we initially set this up or at least I remember doing a stream where I was trying to get this to work and I couldn't get it I don't think I get it to work out the way I wanted it to work but at some point I got this trying to get up to the top here so this is what we're going to be working with today and I included a link to this in the description as well so you can check it out if you want there's really only one part of you know it's pretty welldocumented there's only one part of the that we're going to look at today that we're even going to need and it's the click tracking part let's see there we go this part I think we're going to try to use the component version of the click tracking there shouldn't be too many links that we have to edit so this should work hey everybody ok I see in the live chat everybody saying hi oh is hello from Brazil awesome welcome Oh Sean says back after so long and I'm left far behind what haven't done anything for a week so not quite as behind as as it could have been alright alright so we got our viewer count is is up to decent number here so I think we're going to get started first thing I do want to show you all is a course a course that I'm going to be taking and it looks it looked good and it's definitely definitely what I'm working on now so I'm just go throw this in here I don't know if you saw this I think I saw it on Twitter first and then actually then I noticed the email I got from Udacity after that but I noticed I saw on Twitter of quite a few retweets of this course on Udacity so if you've never done anything with Udacity before it has a lot of free online courses in a lot of different areas not just web development but this will be the first time I'm actually going to pay for the nanodegree so I've already already made my payment the course is $500 and I'm not like officially recommending this or anything I haven't even taken it yet so I'm not sure if it's good but since I'm building in react and I know there's going to be a lot of sites that I will be doing in the future with react I thought it would be cool to take this so just wanted to share that it hasn't even started yet as you can see there's a countdown timer here so I will let you all know how the course is this one is unique a lot of the courses in Udacity are like totally selfpaced this one is actually it has a definite start and end time and you have to get everything done within that amount of time so hopefully I can do that my schedule is like pretty busy but I'm hoping to be able to to stick to this you know this schedule this for months scheduled for this course and yeah don't let you know how it goes and if anybody else has signed up for this let me know or if you end up signing up later on let me know whoops there we go all right okay so I do have one question and the live chat about the analytics that thing that we're using the react GA the question from Philip is what are the advantage of you of coding with this overusing tag manager well in my case we're not set up with tag manager right now so all of our sites none of our sites are using tag manager that might change in the future but at least the easy answer is I might I'm it's just not set up like that I'm not the one that actually sets up a lot of these I set up some of these Google Analytics properties but not all of them so I didn't set up a lot of the sites when I started working here it was already set up so anyway we might move to tag manager in the future but for now we're going to use this I have from what I have read about tag manager it does seem like everything is easier with tag manager especially if you have a lot to manage and it would just be insane to do all this manually so I know that's not really a great answer sorry it's not a great answer but I don't really want to try to you know say any more about it when I'm not knowledgeable enough to give you a good answer looking for there we go footer I know we have some outbound links in the footer that we're going to be using so we'll just start there I'm trying anywhere else we have one in that in the header as well that maybe all the places that we need to to do this for so this is actually going to be a shorter video than normal I have a meeting at 300 so that there might be so some changes coming to this site that we've been working on for the last few week and all the meeting today and another meeting Thursday afternoon which I probably won't be able to stream Thursday afternoon because of it but based on what happens in the to meetings it's possible there could be significant changes coming to the site which I don't know to tell you the truth it doesn't excite me too much I mean this sites not perfect but I kind of like where we have it the direction we're going with it and I don't want to have to redo things that we've already done I wouldn't mind adding new features that'd be nice but I'd hate to you know go back over things since we put so much time into it so many long hours it would it would be a little bit terrible to have to go back in and I either completely take out or redo things that we spent so much time on so I'll let you know how that goes all right so I'm gonna move this these instructions over to my other screen so that I can look at these while we're while I'm coding so like I said before the link to the instructions remember following is in the show description so it looks like and we're going to test this and I picked this on purpose because I think this is going to be simple I think it's gonna be pretty easy and I don't have a lot of time to stream today so it looks like all we're gonna have to do is make sure that we include react GA here and then we're going to use the react GA dot outbound link component and all we have to do we bring it in for a second since I'm talking about it all we have to do then is then add an event label and a two so basically so instead of like an a tag we'll replace it with this tag and then we put in the link text as normal so hopefully that works and we'll test it out I have my Google Analytics open already on my other window I'll bring that in when it's time to test it but that's the plan so I'm just going to grab I want to check out in our analytics J's file import all right Y type it when I can just copy and paste so I'm going to take that and then I'm going to go back up here to footer and I'm going to report that as well and now let's find over yet here we go so this is what we want any links to the main website or what we want to actually let me let me check one of my Trello board this is where we have everything that needs to be done and has already been done all the tasks for the site yep it is just Franciscan dot edu okay I just wanted to doublecheck before we started doing this that I had the right length so let's change this to react ta dot outbound and same thing here okay now we need I'm going to copy some of this here I guess we just need to label alright so I'm assuming it doesn't show this in the instructions but I'm assuming we can still have a title tag and it would just go right here so I'm going to leave the title tag in there that's pretty standard on a link tag so hopefully that still works so I guess for the label we'll just say to francisc and I wonder if I can and you know about this to main site all right that's basically what we call it around here Franciscan dot e to use is always either called the dot edu or the main site so that'll work for us and you can change this href to a two all right like I said I said I don't know if this title having a title here or mess it up it doesn't say anything about it and documentation so I'm going to leave it in there for now see if it works so everything else should work I'm going to say this I do want to check out to make sure that it doesn't mess with the display all right so it looks like I'm gonna bring this over so y'all can see it so this is the link that I changed down here and it looks like the title is still working awesome I'm going to click it what pop uh plugs yes I always allow popups from low blows all right so it looks like it's trying to go there so the main site just happens to be really slow great so that went to the right place now let's bring over our analytics our analytics dashboard here so if you haven't seen the new Google Analytics dashboard this is it so this is actually the first time I saw it I haven't checked analytics since this happened this is pretty recent within the last I don't know a week or so right so we should be able to go it looks like all this stuff over here is still the same so hopefully it is let's see events let's see if we had an event happen hmm sick we didn't have anything happen it's it's possible that I'm not going to see it until I make this live so let's so actually working on some stuff earlier that I forgot to commit so let me bring this over I'm just going to do a I'm going to commit this I'm going to push it to github and we're actually we're going to pull this live the stuff I was working on some stuff earlier but I've tested it out I think everything's working well most of it was just really minor things so let's do all right so I was working on the events page and I'm not going to say anything about the link tracking yet I'm not sure if it even works but it's a good sign that we didn't get an error message at least okay now here's our servers alright let's see if you get the IP here we go I turned my computer off and turn it back on and for some reason my normally I have a history of all the commands and it's separated per tab but it's not it's not working out like it normally does all right so let's update so if you remember from previous episodes we have load balancing happening so just to explain in case anyone missed it all we're doing right now with this long string of commands which I just copy and paste it in we're stopping nginx we're stopping the react app we're going into the directory where our project lives and we're pulling in the changes from github we're installing anything that there's new any new packages that need to be installed we're building it and then starting it again and then starting engine X that ensures that our load balancer routes everything to the other server while this is down and then when this is back up then we can go to the other server and do the same thing and while this is how whoops while this is happening I can catch up on the live chat since I've been ignoring you all so far sorry I just feel the pressure today to be done since I have that meeting so let's uh let me go back okay there's not a lot I thought I missed it a lot in the live chat but it looks like there's not a whole lot that I missed so I'm going to go through really quick a with someone from Dominican Republic awesome hello from India Andrew asks why master's degrees are so expensive online I mean that I think they're expensive everywhere online or on ground it's degrees or dis for me being expensive nowadays yeah I mean I was unless you really need a master's degree for a job that you want then I wouldn't do it I know people to just get done with their undergraduate degree and they aren't sure what to do so they just decide to stay and get their master's degree I mean if if your family's rich maybe that's okay but but for me that's that's not what I did this too much I mean few scholarships maybe that would work out but it's just too expensive especially if you're not if you don't have you know a pretty good chance of getting a goodpaying job from it alright if someone says hello from Iran hello awesome alright Philip earlier Philip that asks a question about google tag manager and he did mention he said it is much easier so something I yeah I know I didn't fully answer that question but definitely if you are setting up a site in a Google Analytics property for the first time and you could do it however you want I recommend checking out tag manager everything I've seen about it looks great and I at some point I would it would be nice to switch everything that we're doing here over to tag manager oh no I just checked out I'm sure you all saw this but I just checked out the the output here in the terminal and it looks like local changes would be overwritten by the marriage please commit your changes which stash them before you can merge oh goodness okay all right this is I know what happened okay so someone else that works with me here when I was on vacation tried to make changes directly to the server so these are those changes I've forgotten about that so I actually don't I don't want to keep these changes let me actually I wish I don't think he changed anything that I need to keep I think I'm good and I can just get rid of these changes so let's see I wonder how he did it he must have just used like Nano or something to edit these uhhuh okay yeah I I was just thinking that Patrick Patrick just put in the lab chat get diff that's yeah I was I was thinking the only thing that I probably I do want to keep is this image all right let's uh actually let me check let me check quickly on I want to see what the difference is went between this image so I just want to know what changed with it all right so here's the one page this is the live page and here's the image I think this is the image that we're talking about here and then this is the one they these look nearly identical right what is the difference here okay there's one difference in the names so we definitely do want to keep this alright so actually we do need to keep these changes and all right so all right well this makes things slightly more difficult and I wonder if the other server is the same all right so it's actually not really that bad that this happened because as I always say when I make mistakes then you don't have to make them you can just see what I did and how I messed it up and can avoid it hopefully so I yeah so don't edit files on the server directly that's a moral of the story and if it does happen don't forget about it so let's just yep it's on here too okay all right so here's what I'm thinking here's what I'm going to try to do I'm going to commit these changes on one of the servers on just one of the servers and I'm going to push them shoot it's like pushing I guess I'll just I'll commit it I'll merge everything and then I'll push it back up to the main git repo and then I'll pull it down to the other server and then I'll have to pull everything back down locally does that make sense I think that yeah that'll I think that'll work okay so actually okay it looks like the changes are just really really minor all right tell me who you are what I have to say Who I am alright then let's say UI I can't believe a change so simple ended up not being simple I finally thought I was going to have an easy one but okay so at least I can go back to the live chat while this is working alright great so I'm going to do get pull and I'll remember that one okay now unfortunately I won't really be able to see it on okay I guess if I want to try to test I was just thinking about testing these out I can just pull this down and then we can make sure that it's working so I'm gonna bring this over this is our local version just my server not working let's see okay this is our new one no it's not right this is still yeah it's yeah it's only one so okay so that's our new one so did fully changes down what's the other thing we have one of the lines up here I'm not going to try to find a line but all right so it looks like that's cool that works now we can go ahead with starting to get pull and I need to we got stopped right in the middle of that long line of command so we got stopped right at the get pull part so I'm just going to copy the rest of the command and paste it in there so we're going to do the art NPM install we're going to run a build process and then we're going to start ok so a little little inconvenience there but pretty much passed it all right so Sebastian says five hundred yeah maybe I'll stick to youtube tutorials he's refering to the Udacity course yeah I had the I signed up for it last week when I was on vacation and I actually had the page open to sign up for the course on my laptop for like two days before I made the decision finally to do it but I thought I don't know I thought it would motivate me since lately I've been really slacking on doing tutorials on my own I thought it would motivate me if I actually spent the money to do the course so the plan my plan is to wake up early before my kids wake up which can be challenging but to wake up early and do oh man more more problems so my plan is to wake up early and maybe like do a workout I have like a exercise bike in my basement so maybe I can do my work for this course while I'm doing you know a little workout in the morning and then maybe again like on my lunch break I'll do the course so I could probably get in like around 2 hours everyday if we with a course and then a little bit on Saturday I think it said like estimate is made 12 hours a week so if I do that then it should be good Monday or Monday through Saturday I put in 2 hours a day and it should be my twelve hours and it should work so hopefully it works out like that all right let's check out what's happening here who well this is not not good here so our build is not working all right Patrick says another reason not to make changes directly in production this is justification for a load balancer stuff you went through I was just thinking the same thing Patrick so yes if you I think I mentioned earlier but this site is using a load balancer so if one servers down everything gets directed to another server so right now the site I'm assuming is still up because the other server is fine so since we just since I don't know what just happened with this server then at least the site still up and somebody else asked something like like with what are you doing and I edited that but basically what we were trying to do is something really simple and it should have worked but basically some changes were made on directly on the server that it seems have messed some things up so we're trying to sort that out so let me this is just really weird um she this Patek is Jason yeah it's not like nothing's changed in my package.json I haven't really added I was trying to think if I added any packages since the last time I pushed anything to the server and I think no I really I don't think I've added anything on the master branch all the stuff that we've been doing has been on separate branches and it's not actually even been merged in one master so yeah so this should be let's see I realize we'll probably get the exact same issue but it's worth the try occasionally run something a second time and for some reason it works I also want to run this locally just to see if something's I do have you aren't installed locally so but I want to try to do it this in the same way way did it work that time you gotta be kidding me there's no way all right let's all right so the next command would be it works alright alright this is if anybody knows what just happened here fill me in but it's obviously the first time this was run we got all these errors the second time I got nothing oh well so I'm going to continue with the rest of the commands to restart this server and then we'll check it out so at this point we should just restart we're using PM 2 to start things up ok and what I want to do is I want to try to go directly to this IP I think if I go directly to that IP address I can get right to that server and won't get switched over to the other server so we want it to look like so basically we'll be able to tell if we've gone right to that server if it's worked if we if this area has changed significantly and say yep there we go okay so everything has changed correctly I'm just going to inspect really quick to see if we're getting any weird errors okay so we're getting this weird error a page does not exist speaking the truth and love conference so I'm trying to prefetch this page and maybe prefetching doesn't work with the dynamically yet so let me I do want to test this link hmm all right so that link doesn't work it's this actually did work locally so I did test it earlier this is from something I tried to do earlier today all right so aside from that which can be changed really quickly aside from that this is pretty much working so it's working enough that we can at least try to to test what we were going to we were initially trying to test so let me find my analytics and let's see actually let's make sure that we're one for today yeah looks like see two main site okay so it looks like we didn't have to do it in fact I completely forgot that by default Google Analytics doesn't show you the stuff from the current day so it was actually just showing me from like the last week or so I forget what the range was so when I set it to show today's stuff it actually did work from localist so that part worked so since we've kind of gotten into this big mess now anyway with the servers I am going to fix that quickly but basically this works so let's go back and let's add this I'm not going to update the other server just yet which is going to it shouldn't cause a problem for the two minutes that it's going to take to fix this so let's go over let's go over here back to our page and we need to do two things one on events we need to not prefetch let's see photos up here someone let me it's dumb yeah it's down here okay so and eventually all this stuff will be out of our code anyway and it will be pulled in through the WordPress API but for now for now let's get rid of this this prefetch and I'm wondering now should I get rid of whatever I should get rid of all of it let's just let's see I'm going to say that hopefully that'll fix the issue now you know it might not because we're still getting the 404 so let me bring it back that error here so the error is trying to go to saying this doesn't exist let's see if we'll get the same error see if we can go on our our test version of this which I'll pull it over so the test version let's inspect this okay so I'm not getting that error and our test version but I'm still I'm getting the 404 but then it then it works okay so now I am getting that error see I'm getting this error here so here's what we're going to do let's go that's that's really odd it's an odd air so basically I'm just going to remove this link and I'm not going to use the link I'm just going to use a regular a tag and we'll try that out and see if that works so see oh right all right let me check we're getting to the end I'm going to have to finish up soon for my three o'clock meeting so I'm going to check the live chat quickly just see if there's any questions you all have let's see all Patrick mentioned you could put that in a bastion alias oh that long string of commands that I copied and pasted in when we were trying to shut off the server and then update it and restart it he says you can put that in a bash alias and you can I do recommend doing that I just haven't done it yet but I do want to do that for now and especially because it's just me working on it for the most part it's just easy for me to just copy it over but it would be a better idea to to make a batch alias for it okay so we've taken this we've just made it a regular a tag let's click it and see what happens so I'm gonna see that looks good alright that looks good only bad thing is we're not getting our clientside routing you see we got a full page refresh I don't like that but I think it's ok it's ok for now I'm not sure if we can have the clientside routing when we've because for this we've used custom so we've edited our server ojs file and we've used some custom routing to use parameterised routing so that's like outside the scope of what next does so I'm thinking maybe the next clientside routing system can't work with that I don't know but for now this is good this gives us what we what we want for the most part so I'm going to stick with that and let's go back to alright so we had we were working in footage is so this worked I do want to make sure I want to see where else we have this goodness I wonder it's just going to you very much sooner yeah I don't think we need to track all these links like obviously to the privacy policy and things like that we don't need to track that so I think we're good we're good tracking that you said we have one in the sit in the head I mean maybe the nav yeah oops and there's my Google my calendar for my meeting oh yeah um okay so we need to track this yeah I need to check this let me make sure I'm a cantina okay I have ten minutes so let's do the same thing with this one hopefully it our class name stuff still works as well let's pull in this and we at nav and this react actually with time today you know I'm not going to do this right now because two things one I want to answer your questions and live chat also I want to make sure I sort out this server thing before I have my meeting so we'll stop here because I can always basically we've got it working so for the purpose of you know figuring out how to do this we've done it we've accomplished it we just need to apply the same thing to a few other places so that's worked what we need to do now is push our change up to github so the change we made to the to the length so we got rid of the prefetching to get rid of the clientside routing we just used to read your link and then that that fix the errors we were getting okay shoot okay so you see the areas we're getting where we define some things and never used it basically we added this and nav and we're not going to use it yet so we'll just add that back in at some point and then in footer not footer events we added in the link but then now we're not going to use that anymore so very useful to to check this stuff out beforehand and whoa okay I just saw this in the lab chat so Sebastian says check issue number 71 for react GA it says browsers block react GA length hmm that might be an issue I'm still going to push this change to fix the other thing but I'm going to come back to that after my meeting though and check out that issue because that could definitely a problem all right okay so if you're not familiar with github we've just committed our changes and then we're pushing them up to github on the master branch now I can go in here to our server and let me run our our set of commands that we've been copying so actually go back out the commands assume that I'm not already in the directory for the project so hopefully this all works now we don't get any errors we can test it quickly and hopefully it works all right let me go through world boss asks you have a bachelors yes I do have a bachelor's degree I have a bachelor's degree in business sharmi says usually master's degree for people who love to do research or an academics or the company requires that for our position yeah you're right a lot of times higher degrees are for research stuff I know at least the United States a lot of people get master's degrees in business and then they can get higher up in their organization even though they don't do any research that's so that's you know the only other reason that I've seen for them else like if you want to teach like normally they don't let you teach anything at a university unless you add the very least have a master's degree prefer a doctorate so that's another reason why some people get them all right so let's check it out and what do we have it maybe I pulled it over to a different place I think this was the one where we actually went see that pulled us over to the other server let me try to let me great try to grab the IP address again see if we can get straight there so see without with our load balancers right now is taking us to the older version of the site that's on our other server let's see hmm still taking us CEO sir mmm all right well let's let's see shoot I run this again okay okay so now we should be good to run run these commands okay all right back to the latch at get in this I have two minutes so sorry if I can't get to all your questions okay so it looks like looks like I'm going to I am going to need to check out the issue where with blouse browsers blocking blocking the links from react GA so um Patrick says it might be a target blank issue so I'm going to test that out after my meeting sorry didn't really have a Q&A this time get to it definitely next time hopefully I won't have another meeting tomorrow but anyway thank you all for for watching thanks for your help my meetings in one minute so I have to go but I should be back should be back tomorrow and if anybody has any helpful links I know you guys were talking about some issues and stuff please post it in the live chat or message me on Twitter or something because I do want to figure out this problem as soon as my meeting is over all right but anyway I'll see you tomorrow have a great day
