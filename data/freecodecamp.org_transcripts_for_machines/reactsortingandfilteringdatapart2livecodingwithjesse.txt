hey everybody it's Jesse and uh today we're going to just continue with what we've been doing yesterday I I did a little bit more uh so after the stream yesterday I pretty much just was done with work hung out with my family uh this morning I had a meeting and so I did actually come in to the office for the meeting and and I uh stopped over after the meeting in the IT department and asked them about GitHub being blocked and they said it was okay they could unblock it so I now have access to GitHub at work which means I can stream from work and the quality can go back to 1080p for the videos uh so I'm excited about that I think it'll be a much better experience for you all to watch uh so also feeling good today because I remember to eat so if you've watched my streams before I often forget to eat and then I'm like my stomach's grumbling on the stream so today I ate so I should have more energy and hopefully my brain will work better um let me uh I'm going to check how many people we have see if we have a good number to start okay we have a a decent number uh number of people watching sorry I didn't I didn't schedule the stream till um pretty recently uh so I didn't really get a chance to put it out there on Twitter and everything for the link so um I'm thinking maybe some people didn't know the stream was going to happen or what the topic was so we may pick up some people as time goes on I think I actually forgot to check the box that uh promoted the uh event beforehand so it's probably just now uh having notifications uh on everybody's apps so sorry about delay I was just checking some to make sure I didn't forget any uh any other options okay now the viewers are picking up a bit hey everyone I'm just checking out the live chat oh cool Ben says it's first time checking out this live uh awesome glad to have you here live so people were said it made made him want to eat when I was talking about food uh Lance maker asks when will react classes be available on free code Camp um I don't know I don't know the answer uh you can test out the the new version of free code Camp the beta version uh if you want to I I think you'll lose your progress in the other one I I don't know for sure I haven't I haven't tested out the new version myself so sorry I can't give you a better answer uh but I don't know that there's an a date set uh for the uh every every time I hear an answer it's usually like soon but not an actual date oh cool Sophie says this is uh uh her first time as well for live thank thanks for watching thanks for joining live it's really awesome uh I think to be here live because you get to ask questions uh not just to me but everybody in the live chat is really knowled eligible and you usually get some some really good answers uh to questions uh that you may have so I'm going to get started uh just really quick I'm going to explain what we're trying to do in case you weren't able to watch yesterday's episode uh what we're trying to do let me bring over the uh the actual site for you so what I'm try trying to do is to take this section of the site this just has resources so we want to be able to sort these Resources by category which we're going to add a drop down for category at some point so we want to be able to I'm sorry filter them by category filter them based on whether the resource is free or is it it's paid also based on what type of resource it is and then be able to search within them we also o want to be able to sort them alphabetically uh and also by by date added so if you can think of another way to sort them that would be useful let me know we don't have any type of rating system on here right now and that's not it was mentioned but it's definitely not going to make it in this round of updates uh but for now you know those are the main things that that need to get added for today's show I need to keep this show today to an hour because my wife is going to go get her hair done so I have to go home and watch the kids so uh so I have an alarm set to stop me in an in an hour so uh hopefully we can get just as much done as we can in an hour uh so let me go to the code I'll show you this the little bit that I've added which is really not much at all uh so basically all I've done is I've added another filter so this is the filter that we did yesterday let me make this a little bigger for you all so this is the filter that I added yesterday and this one was just kind of a test we're going to modify this a bit uh because had some good feedback in the live chat saying that we should add another option besides just the toggle if you wanted to see things that are free and paid at the same time so we're going to do that but then I added this other filter and this is going to be our category filter I did do some work on the PHP plugin that we had made to handle our um all our custom post types so I created I used this function to create a new taxonomy a custom taxonomy so it's called resource category and this resource category taxonomy gets applied to Resource the the custom post type of resource in our WordPress uh content management system so now there'll be this category if you've ever worked with WordPress uh you know that I guess I can just bring it over I have it on my other screen so on WordPress I know this is small make it a little bigger so normally like on a blog post you would have a little box over here that just said categories and you could check the categories well now we have resource categories and the way it it's nice to do it like this instead of using the uh the plugin that I had used for these custom fields which is advanced advanced custom Fields plugin I like to do it this way for categories and tags because this takes advantage of all the native category functionality that comes with WordPress so these resource categories will now act like just like the categories for WordPress so I think this is just a little bit nicer and more familiar to users uh I I do like the um custom uh Advanced custom fields for a lot of other things and it works really well but in this case it's just so easy to to do the PHP I mean look at this it's basically you know I didn't write all this out this is copy and pasting and then just changing the name you know literally going in here and just using you know the multiple cursors to go in and change the name of everything okay so it took you know probably a minute or less uh to update this plugin so that's about that's about it so I did start to make this function that's going to we're going to filter by uh so here it is I started the stream right in the middle of making it so basically my thought process here in this function is that it's going to take in whatever the post happens to be right off the bat if the category equals all it's just going to return true because it doesn't really matter what you know every post is in the category all but if it's if a user has selected something else other than show all they've selected a category then it's going to take into account you know what is that category and it's going to try to compare so here's where I'm at I'll show you the data just give you an idea why I'm doing it like this so in WordPress the WordPress API is going to give us this data this is actually a little bit more than I'm going to get I'm going to cut this down because there's a lot of unnecessary data but the data that we really want to know about is this right here each category each resource category has its own ID it's going to give us the ID uh now normally this is a pain but I'm already going to be making an API call to get the categories including their IDs for a dropdown so I'm already gonna have access to that data so it won't be a big deal to match up by ID number instead of by category name which would make more sense and be easier to remember I can get the category name here if I wanted to but I don't think it's going to be necessary and I'd rather not pull all of this in if I don't have to it doesn't make a deal big deal if you're only pulling in a few posts but if if the site grows and later on there are a lot of there's a lot of data to pull in then it'd be better to just trim it down so I need to to match up categories but the category returns an array so resource category as an array so potentially a resource could belong to multiple categories so I need to make sure that I check each element in this array each number to see if it matches up so that's why I have this um well I'm I'm going to go through this I've done a map right now and this is where I stopped so I'm I'm going to have to look at this for a second just to remember what my thought process was gu before I do that I should check the live chat just to make sure see if anybody who's maybe new has some questions um let's see all right we have looks like no questions but do have someone uh n says it's not blurry anymore thank you yeah def I'm I'm at work now I'm in the office so uh when I stream from home the quality is not great but now I have great internet connection and so it should be a good quality as long as your connection is good quality you should be able to stream this in 1080P and it looks like from the the analytics that uh there are there are quite a I wouldn't say mo most people are doing seven getting 720p right now but the second highest amount of people are getting 1080p almost tied there with 720 so I don't know if I don't think I've ever showed you the analytics this is doesn't have anything to do with the topic today but I'm thought it'd be cool to show so this is what I see what I'm looking at when I talk about the analytics so if you've never streamed before you might not see this uh but this gives me how many viewers we have lots lots of things I I usually don't even look at this stuff uh too often when I'm trying to do this but um there's the live chat I can't actually view it in public but that would get crazy because I would hear myself on the delay and so I don't do that but this at least lets me know how many viewers we have and you know gives me a little estimation about the stream quality so anyway just thought I'd share that since I'm always looking at it but I just not sure if you all knew what it uh would it looked like okay oh I did do had one question so one question appeared uh Ben asked anyone ever had an issue with dynamically rendering something like an accordion panel and have the title appear on set state but no functionality until page reload also he said sorry for the interruption um let's see I have had I'm trying to understand think about what's going on here I have had issues with trying to um like initialize things and it not working until I actually did so when I like when I navigated through just client side rendering with no page refresh things wouldn't work but then if I did a like a a refresh an actual refresh in the browser they would work so I have had things like that happen but I'm not exactly sure that that's what you're asking so uh maybe someone else in the live chat understands this a little better could give a good answer I think I'm probably missing I let me know Ben and if you need to you can direct message me or something and uh or give me like an example I'd be happy to check out the code and test it uh see if I could help all right so I'm G to I'm going to start uh going into some of the code now oh okay Ben said I do understand the problem yeah so I'm assuming then that the um the accordion panel has to be like initialized the data has to be initialized um somehow with JavaScript uh I have this issue if I try to use like uh something with jQuery that needs to be you would normally put in a document. ready function I've had success with putting that same initialization uh code into the um let me just show you an example since I I'm here I think I have it okay so inside component did Mount like I'm initializing in this case the tabs so these tabs otherwise these tabs wouldn't usually they would work on first page like if I refresh the page but they wouldn't work otherwise if I went client side so I'm not sure if that helps or if that's possible and then the way I basically this just calls a function the this calls a function that initiates it in my Javascript file so within here this isn't in a document uh ready function all right this is just out there I will say there's a better way to do this and for some of the stuff that I coded later on uh in this site I did use a more like react style way of doing things but this does work and it's helpful especially if you already have some stuff coded you don't really have time to convert it all over uh this worked for me uh the init tabs right here is just I'm using a materialized framework so there's not a lot of code in here it's just the initialization so anyway I hope that that helps uh somewhat and uh like I said if you need like some more help uh my Twitter uh link to my Twitter is in the show description so uh just you know send me a message on there and I'd be happy to help more okay so let's finish this uh this filter here so as I said the thought is I need to I need to Loop through all of the in this case we don't have any posts that have belong to multiple categories but down the road we probably will so I need to make sure that I go through each category that's listed for the post and see if it matches now I'm sure there's probably a better way to do this but the first thing that popped into my head was uh well what if I just have a variable that's set to zero and if any of these are true right so if the category equals what's in this state this an auto uh autoc completed or another this in there so this state category so if the category equals this state category then it'll just add one to that variable and then if that variable is greater than one then it'll return true or I'm sorry greater than Z zero it'll return true okay and then that way uh we should know I mean if you have a uh if there's a better way and I'm just missing some simple way to do this let me know uh because this seems like a bit much to just get this result so I'm probably just like blanking out on a simple answer here um oh I'll start working on this and then I'm sure there's a little delay in the video so I'll be working on this but if someone has a good idea and wants to put in the live chat I'm I'm definitely open uh to your ideas on how to do that so I guess um can just do this so if that's the case then we want to do uh actually I don't know what I was thinking okay um I don't have to do this all all right let's try this let me know if this will work so I don't have to do it like that I don't need this either now's a great time for the usual disclaimer if this is your first time watching this I'm not an expert this is just a show that lets you see my usual work I am uh employed fulltime as a frontend developer at a university uh but this is not really tutorial this is just a glimpse into my normal day and this is very much a collaborative effort between all of you watching uh and in the live chat and and me and um I hope that I help some some of you to learn how to do some things but really I end up learning a lot from you all as well so if you're wondering why I'm I just deleted what I what I wrote and I now I have a better idea it's because this is not prerecord it's not rehearsed at all you know this is just my normal workflow so that said here's my new idea my new idea is I can just return can't type today I just return true if if that's the case so if if category then I return true um otherwise I need to return false somewhere right so now I can't return false yet maybe I did need to do it the other way and I just kind of out thought myself here um return all right what I'm thinking I need is basically this is fine but what I need to do is uh if it goes through each of the categories and this is never true when it reaches the end then I need to return false so I guess if I put it out here that would work uh yeah I think it would work out here because this will get evaluated first uh then this and it'll Loop through everything uh so it'll never get down here if if either one of these are true it'll never get to this point um in in case there's people who are new to JavaScript normally the way it works is once you return something then anything below the return uh it it just doesn't happen uh you just exit the function uh so that's what I'm counting on here to kind of simplify things so I think that should work uh now I haven't built out any of the UI to to test this yet but we can hardcode uh some of the things into State just to give it a test so for now what should happen since we have the state by default is for category is all it should show us all the posts so let me well assuming I didn't make any errors here unexpected token I if you can see this uh all right so what do I have map C I probably just something with the syntax let me check it out uh let me compare that so I think I was doing something similar down here and it worked oh you know what I think no I'm not sure what I'm sure okay uh pedroo asks why are you using map to Loop over that array um I guess I didn't need to use map to Loop over the array uh I was just using map so much elsewhere I thought I would use it is there some benefit to using uh just a regular Loop in this case Okay uh Sergio says I forgot some curly brackets so let's see what did I forget category oh okay I'm assume you're saying right here I forgot the curly brackets and I need shoot I'm thinking okay just trying to figure out where I needed to copy it from see if that fixed it no it didn't now I probably copied this wrong or did something wrong uh sorry I wasn't I was looking at something on my other screen sorry for the uh the period of Silence there um okay what Benjamin says in the live chat uh I'm missing some parentheses after map category okay so I should put category in parenthesis yes okay let's see if that now I probably that's odd seems like everything's closing this is real programming right here trying to figure out where where you misplaced a bracket or parentheses okay Sergio all right now Benjamin saying or no Sergio says one line lower after bracket okay uh let's see so I should put this one line lower then I'm assuming this is if um hey all right well that's a different error so I'm happy with that that's progress so filter by category is not defined which line is this3 well that's odd it's obviously what's def find H all right it did this sorry I just restarted the uh Dev server for some reason and if you've been watching for a while uh some previous shows something's weird with my Dev server and it's odd because it doesn't have like if I pull down this this repo on other machines I don't have the problem but on this machine uh my Dev server just Will Will just hang and it'll just act it'll just load you know it'll look like it's loading for a long time and nothing happens why I'm just reading through making sure I didn't misspell something let me check down here all right that looks like it's fine everything's spelled right hey Sebastian just came in the live chat how's it going I'm glad you could join in okay there was actually some discussion in the live chat about my use of map so I just want to fill you all in in case you're watching later on and can't see the chat uh so uh Pedro had asked me why I was using map to Loop over uh that array and let's see where I'm at um Bill said map is more efficient than four or four each if I remember correctly uh Pedro says says no map is used when you want to return an array based uh on the previous one all right so is the consensus then that I should totally change this and not use map or is it cool to just use map um oh I also have some do some things here it says uh Sergio says you don't have if you only have one parameter to the function uh to an arrow function you don't need to put it in brackets that's what I thought so why I I didn't have them at first and then I threw them in there um so let's let's just remove some of this and try to simplify it and then maybe it'll be easier for me to see what is going on and why I um why I keep getting an error okay so this should be simple I I should be a ble to do this with the arrow um now I have so that's in the right place that's in the right place this closes that this closes that all right I'm pretty sure that's what I had before so let's see if I get the same error okay yeah I'm getting I'm getting an error here so obviously I'm doing something wrong then in the way that I'm doing this maybe I ought to just do a normal Loop H Sebastian Sebastian said uh he missed yesterday because I was at the pool aome much I was uh I was in the pool myself a few days ago I got actually I had all my kids are in the pool with me and I they wanted me to keep like throwing them and see like how high in the air could I throw them and then they'd fall Splash in the water and uh I tell you what I was really sore after throwing them for for a long time so it was a great workout so if you're looking for some good uh you know alternative workouts go throw some kids around in a pool hopefully they'll be your own kids though cuz not not sure parents would like it if you just grabbed their kids randomly okay so Pedro has actually uh written some code and posted it in the live chat to try so thank you Pedro I'm gonna I'm G to copy and paste what Pedro has put in here and see how that does I really appreciate that Pedro all right so let's paste this in uh let me see okay it's the whole function so put this whole thing in here actually and Sergio I see yours now too so uh man too bad they don't have um like you can't put code in to the live chat and have it be formatted so let me make a a this a little bit formatted o filter by category I guess I don't have let's see if it works first and then I'll format it no sense in formatting it if it's not going to work ah shoot now I'm getting this this error again filter by categor is not defined actually I don't I don't even need to format this uh since we're using prettier as soon as we uh commit this uh then it'll do all the work for us so it's a waste of time right now all right so I suppose at some point what we put in did work because we're getting the same error now with with this with what Pedro gave uh which I'm assuming also will work uh so oh okay ambero thanks for bringing that up again ambero said remember that there may be nonprint characters when you copy and paste so let me okay it doesn't look like there's a space there the last time this happened I copy things I just had to to go through like this although usually when that happens uh the error message tells me at least where the space is this error message is not all right it looks good what will usually happen is there's like some space that's not visible to me but as I go through with the arrow key I'll hit the arrow key twice and the cursor won't move it won't move twice it'll stay in the same spot once and then I know there's some invisible tiny space there so all right so now we're getting some I'm getting some feedback in the live chat um that's it oh man good good job Pedro all right let me let me share why I just said that Pedro said you have have to use this filter by category how many times uh this happens to me I don't know if I want to say frequently but maybe like once every week or so at least uh I forget to use this when I need to use this so I don't know does that happen to anyone else I can't just put filter by category there I got to put this all right let's try it now all right not ex just refresh there we go wow that's still not what I wanted what is going on oh I just had it zoomed in okay all right so oh all right I don't think this is all of them so we're so something's not something's not working H that was that was odd because that gave us all the posts but if you could see like this should have gone through the same like when this state changed it should have uh re rendered gone through the same filter process so it just didn't work right off the bat which is which is probably just due to my my Dev server freezing again okay so I'll just restart that quickly but basically uh that worked so um Pedro thank you and uh sorry everyone for overload looking that really really basic thing that I needed to do and uh taking up a lot more time than I needed to with that uh so Samson says I'm love I am loving this awesome uh thanks Samson I'm glad you're enjoying it uh so all right so we have our category filter that's working now now what I want to do is change right now the only category that I added in did I have the um I thought i' I pulled over the actual uh Json here we go so let me pull this over to show you what I added so the only category I have right now is would just be two so I should be able to put two in there in in the state of actually I hope it doesn't mess it up that I basically put in I think I'm going to change this so that I'm not going back and forth between strings uh and numbers so what I'm going to do is category is going to be zero and so now down here instead of saying category this state category equals all I'm just going to say equals zero uh and then that way we can just keep the same type uh I know it probably would have worked uh regardless where's our uh here we go okay actually so we're we're still getting the same thing here we're not we're not actually getting everything being returned let me do a refresh again yeah that's odd so something's wrong then all right let's go through I had some questions about what I'm working with uh so yeah this is it it looks kind of like HTML but it's actually uh called jsx so it it's like HTML mixed with JavaScript basically and that's what it's react uh reactjs is a JavaScript uh Library framework uh that lets you do stuff like this in intermix HTML and JavaScript uh it does a lot of things but like just to really simplify it a lot lot uh you can mix HTML and JavaScript and it sounds like it's not a good idea at first but it actually ends up being really nice okay so at this point this isn't causing an error anymore but it is actually filtering out some things that we want so let me make sure I had uh price paid no it's not that's my fault I um I had set the price paid to be the default let's change the default to um what was it is it free trying to think what the value is I think free is the value for that so I had forgotten that we were already filtering so this is actually working and since I changed it we'll see now it is actually showing these so uh I was mistaken that is working so CU we never changed that uh this filter uh for price to show all by default uh so we'll have to do that and I don't know if we'll have time for that or not because I do want to answer your questions so I'll probably stop the actual coding a few minutes early uh so that I can answer your questions so we may not get to that but I do want to test this so we should be able to put in two and we should only see one post if I put in two because that's the only category uh that I've created and I've only applied it to one post oops uh cannot repr property sum of undefined let's see I may need to put in a check here because okay yeah so what's happening is it's saying it's undefined because some of the data let's go to the next one it's giving an empty array so let's just do um I guess I could say if if resource Academy category I'm I'm going to have to do like some nested statements here so it's not going to be the most beautiful thing um else if basically what I want to do is to say if the post resource category oops I don't know why I named it with a hyphenated thing and then now I have to use these brackets instead that was a mistake uh but I wasn't thinking when I was doing the PHP for this okay so uh else of post resource category um equals is not equal to undefined right yeah if it's not equal to undefined then I want to do this stuff what I want to and then okay let me check my my brackets out my bracket matches this one matches okay that should work and um just to explain uh what I was doing here um I know a lot of you are like more advanced and you don't need the explanation but uh if someone is not quite as familiar with JavaScript or any of this stuff I like to give a little explanation uh I don't want to leave anyone behind if if it can be prevented so what what we needed to do was put in a check to see if it was undefined so that we don't get that error so if it's undefined if the resource category is undefined that means we have an empty array so no category's been assigned if it hasn't been assigned to any category it's obviously not going to match so we don't even have to check to see if it matches we can just return false immediately so all right cool so we haven't gotten the error oops but we didn't get we didn't get the post that we wanted either let's see what happened let me see it's possible that that's a paid resource that has that category so before I all right I'm still not seeing it I don't know why it's taking forever okay all right while this is reloading I'm going to check the live chat and we'll probably hopefully I can get this to work and not end with it not working but uh I'm going to stop the coding in a few minutes regardless and shoot yep all right so it's not giving us so OB so this is the data that is being pulled in wait a second I know why it's not working I was trying to get this this part of things finished before I started the stream and I didn't get it done and I forgot I didn't get it done so I need to what I'm doing when I make the uh API call is I'm fil I'm telling it exactly the fields that I want and I did not put in there the resource field so it wasn't pulling it in so uh it basically appeared like there every time I used it it was undefined so let's see all right great so see it it is working so this is the post that I put it on so um awesome so the filter works so basically the next step would be make a dropdown that actually pulls in we'd have to make an API call uh the API call could be made separately it doesn't necessarily have to be server s side rendered uh that wouldn't be a big deal uh so it could be made client side but in any case we make an API call that would grab all the categories uh and then we would get the value of that so basically every time the value of that element changed then we would call a function that changed the state so it would just do a this set state that would change the state of category to the number that corresponds to the name of that category that would trigger render and then everything would get filtered through and then our category filter would work so if that doesn't make sense to anybody let me know in the live chat I'll try to explain it uh because maybe maybe my thought process is wrong but uh at this point we got about seven minutes until I want to end the stream so I can get home on time uh so I'll take any questions um let me someone just asked about uh es lent or something so that just reminded me that this will turn prettier when I commit because we're using prettier so I'm going to do a commit uh I was just doing it on on my other screen um I've I've gone through the process of doing git commits uh often so if you're not familiar with Git we have a lot of good videos on this channel the free code Camp Channel um not for me uh but we have some good videos on how to use git and on some of my previous streams I've I've explained it a little little bit uh but it's nothing like a comprehensive tutorial so if you need uh you know some more practice with that I recommend you know some of the other videos and there's a lot of other good resources out there as well all right so that cleaned it up and now I'm going to go through the live chat and just to make sure I didn't miss anyone's question from earlier if you have any questions right now please put them in the chat uh if you were just here for the code part of it and uh you can't stick around for uh for the Q&A uh part of the show then thanks for watching and I'll probably be back tomorrow it might be a little later I might have to push it back to 230 Eastern Time 230 p.m. eastern time uh because I'll be doing another uh phone interview for a web developer position that uh we'll be hiring here hopefully soon so uh I'll I'll let everyone know on Twitter and then you'll you'll get the uh the update through YouTube if you're subscribed to the channel uh so otherwise if you're going to stick around please put your question in live chat now I'll try to get to all the questions if I run out of time then you can direct message me the question or put it uh on Twitter or you can put it in the comments uh for this video all right so I'm starting up at the top I'm just going to scroll down and try to to take the questions uh as I get to them I'm I'm not going to read everything just to to save time um but anything that's like directly uh a question for me that I can help with I will answer oh looks like someone uh put something in the comments uh but it's in a different alphabet than I'm used to reading so I'm sorry I won't be able to answer that right now if I had more time I'd probably try to use Google Translate but uh I'm not going to do it now if you're still here if you're this was early on if you're still watching uh if you direct message it to me or put it in the comments then I will take the time to use Google Translate and uh I'll answer you back I I'll translate it back into your language and try to answer you back that way and uh Google Translate is pretty good now so we should be be able to understand each other um let's see okay someone asked about my editor which uh uh Rohan answered thanks Rohan it is Adam oh so um custom crawler production says hello been trying to learn to write code on your website and it's a lot of fun so uh thanks for that awesome um I'm I'm glad you that that you're learning uh let me know if you have questions it's not I mean it's not my personal website free code Camp so I just you know do some some videos for them so I can't take any credit at all for the website uh but I myself uh am going through uh a lot of the stuff on the site and um a lot of the problems to to learn more so uh I'm glad that uh you're finding it helpful naen says uh guys have a look at VSS code uh so it's Visual Studio code yeah Visual Studio code is really nice uh I used it a bit in some of my early streams for a different project that I was working on and I'll probably use it when I go back to that project uh so I do use that as well as Adam uh aswin asked is there any good responsive UI framework for react uh so I have never used it but I think there's a uh a bootstrap react framework and I assume it's responsive because bootstrap is responsive uh and I know bootstrap is pretty reliable in general so I like I said this is just I'm assuming that the react version of it works um for I use materialize for my framework but not the react version I'm just trying trying to basically make it work in react uh I'd love to switch over to something that's like entirely you know based in the the react style of doing things and I know there are some material design react Frameworks that are responsive I just haven't had the time to really test them out and see which one I like um so I can't give you a great answer to that just some ideas hopefully I find a a good one uh for a future project okay still just scrolling through trying to find a question oh and there's there's my alarm so I'm almost through all the chat so I'll I'll go just a few more minutes to find uh to to answer the rest of the questions oh no at some point about a half hour ago uh sea lion lost sound so I guess not much I can do about it now I wish I would have seen would have seen that did it did anyone else lose I'm assuming that it was no one else lost sound because I'm not seeing any other messages about that but uh sorry C uh hopefully the sound came back in for you um and assuming the sound is okay on the recording you can catch the the recording uh later on and uh here the rest of the video uh ATA asks is coding hard um I would say uh coding yeah I mean I guess it's hard it's hard to I don't want to say it it's easy because I think it's misleading to say it's easy like I've been doing this for years so there are some things to me that seem easy now that at first were really really hard uh and there are things like obviously anybody that's watched this show knows there are things for me that are still really hard um things don't always go the way you want them there are bugs so yeah coding can be hard but once you get experienc a lot of it isn't hard anymore and a lot of it is actually really fun so at first when you first start out it a lot of it can be really hard because you're just not familiar with it uh but so if you're starting to learn how to code and things seem hard for you don't feel like you're not cut out for this it's hard it's I it's hard for everybody I know a lot of people say coding is easy and say you know anybody could do it I don't think that's true I think people just probably forget how hard it was when they first started uh and it's it's not easy it takes a lot of hard work I do think pretty much anybody could do it if they put the work into it if they were dedicated and really wanted to do it uh but that doesn't mean it's easy so hopefully that answered your question uh if anyone else has anything to add to that in the live chat uh you know please do uh zanana Zan I don't know how to pronounce that but I'm I'm just going to say Zanna uh I'm not I'm not sure if that's like a combination of words or it's supposed to be all together is one name I don't know but Suzanna says uh so sorry just got here late yeah no problem about that uh with L some live coding on beginning react I need to catch on it quick uh then react native lots to learn currently on code academy or code academy 82% of the beginning course there uh can we discuss projects and tasks we have like can I come up with questions when I get stuck and if I catch you live yeah um so basic I think you're as you're asking a couple of things but um right now I would love to do some videos that are more like beginner based tutorials but and I've been saying this for a long time and I apologize that I haven't come out with very many videos or you know tutorial videos at all I just I've been really busy I started a react course that I'm doing also in my my free time uh so I've just been busier than I thought I would be uh and this website has taken me longer than it was supposed to take uh so I don't have those videos yet and I can't give you for short time on when I would be able to get some beginning videos I did do the course on code academy as well so that's a good start um there's a course that Udacity is offering right now it is a paid course though if the money is not a problem for you so far I've been impressed with the course if you just want free resources though uh then uh I'm trying to think what I used for react I mean react's documentation is is really good I would encourage you to try using nextjs because it does a lot of things for you that sometimes can be intimidating when you're starting out like you know it just sets up everything so you can just start to code uh so and yeah if you have projects and stuff and you want to ask a question feel free uh I always try to do Q&A at the end of my videos uh or you know you can message me on Twitter or something and I'll um I'll try to help you as much as I can Brian asks how do you get square tabs and Adam I'm not sure you mean up at the top these Square tabs I don't really know maybe it's just the theme I'm using I don't know how there how they would look otherwise do they look different in other themes I'm using the seti theme so s SE TI uh so maybe that's why okay Tim asks wait what part is PHP did I hear wrong uh no you did not hear wrong uh there was some PHP so what I did in PHP is the uh content management system for this react site is actually WordPress WordPress is built with PHP uh so I needed to make a custom plugin for all the different custom post types that I wanted and for custom taxonomies so this is that plugin so this is all PHP uh that's on the screen now and to see it's just just a simple plugin uh that I had I had made and it looks like it's a lot but really all this is just the same thing kind of copied and pasted for each post type uh so it's really not that difficult and then I just upload this you know into WordPress like you would a normal WordPress plugin and that's the extent of the PHP that I really need to do for this just really simple I'm not a PHP developer at all I just know enough to do some things in WordPress and do like basic like form stuff with PHP like I can build a file uploader in PHP and you know really basic things like that which comes in handy if especially if you're working on a site that's on shared hosting a lot of times shared hosting will not let you install node so you can't do it in JavaScript but they will have PHP available so if you can write some basic things in PHP it does come in handy oh Pedro says next time I hope to be at the beginning of streaming and help if I can awesome ped I really appreciate that uh I hope to see you back in in some future streams uh and thanks for all your help in this stream too you you were a really big help you were actually you were the key to the solving the uh the errors that I I was getting uh serg you ask anyone know any other streams on coding um I I tell you the truth I don't watch a lot of coding streams uh but I'm pretty sure Google developers has some live coding sometimes um I can't remember what it's called supercharged or something like that I can't remember what the series on their channel is called but look check out like the Google coders Channel on YouTube and there's somebody else I think his name was Andy M so A and D Yem uh would be like his last name um he does some live coding stuff that I've seen uh but he doesn't I've seen his stuff he doesn't narrate as he's going he just has music playing in the background so a little bit different uh style but still live live coding um I don't know of any other ones though if anyone has any you know put it in the chat now or uh you know put it in the comments below the video and um if it's legit uh I know normally if you put links into a comments on YouTube you will uh it'll get marked as spam but I I check out all the comments even the ones that get thrown in spam and if I see that it's a legitimate comment I'll approve it and it'll get on there anyway so don't don't worry about that oops and uh Phillip said he was having trouble hearing me as well so I'm I'm really sorry about that um hopefully I was was just two people had trouble I hope it's not happening I mean sometimes I move around and I I like put my face closer to one screen or another to try to look at the code so uh I'm not exactly facing the microphone so it might just be me moving around that's causing the uh the issues uh being able to hear me so I'll try to remember to speak more into the microphone um uh Zanna says if you need a nice workout uh you need a big Garden lots of work all day actually I have a garden I wouldn't call it a big Garden maybe a mediumsized garden I don't really know uh but I haven't been doing any work at hardly at all because I've been so busy uh my wife's been doing all the work uh some years I do a ton of work in the garden but this year it's just hasn't been time but I do agree gardening is can be hard work especially keeping up with all the weeds um philli says do you ever have access to multiple taxonomies through the WordPress API how do you handle those I'm actually trying to find a way to handle those properly right now so I don't have a great answer for you but I can tell you my ideas um so obviously you could make lots of API calls to each of those taxonomies and grab the data and then do whatever you need to um what I'm trying to find is a way to get all those different all that different data in one API call I found a plugin that lets you get some but unfortunately you can't use like different parameters for each type so you basically just have to get all of everything which is okay unless you have more than you know the post limit which is 100 and so I haven't found a solution that I really like uh yet but maybe I'll do a video when I finally do find a good solution uh and let you know uh C lion asks are these live sessions done on a set schedule uh yes pretty much uh I try to stream every day well Monday through Friday at 2 p.m eastern time I don't always get to do it at 2 so occasionally I need to adjust the time or sometimes I need to cancel all together uh depending on what's going on but um I'll try to be as consistent as I can be and I'll let you know through Twitter so if you follow me on Twitter then I every day I I'll tweet uh what time the stream's going to be and if I'm not going to do a stream I'll let you know also uh if you're a subscriber to the free code Camp Channel you should get a notification on your phone or um through the browser about when streams are happening so uh basically Monday through Friday 2 p.m. Eastern but occasionally a different different time Ali says uh thank you Jesse oh you're welcome thanks for watching uh nit dog asks uh said sorry if this sounds stupid this is oh don't worry about don't uh I don't want anyone to ever worry about a question sounding stupid like I fully expect there to be people of all levels um and experience levels so uh if you're you know starting out or you're just maybe you're really experienced but you're just not familiar with what I'm doing like with react or anything like that then your your question might be one that's easy to some people and not easy to others so don't worry about that um but uh the question is this is a WordPress site are you using a custom theme or plugins to do this uh so it's kind of a WordPress site um the all the content is in WordPress but I'm using the WordPress API to grab that content and use it in a separate react site so the WordPress and the react site exist on two different servers uh two different droplets on digital ocean so uh I don't really need a theme for WordPress because no one will ever view it like directly through WordPress but I do have some WordPress plugins that make it easier for me to get the data um and add in the different post types and Fields that I need um Andre says coding isn't easy takes a lot of dedication and daily training find your pace and just do it every day okay awesome I think that was probably in response to an earlier question about coding being hard and that's a great um great response Andre also says if you want to work in the industry study a bit about agile and how software projects work with the agile methods and apply that agile idea to your learning that's a great idea Andre so uh yeah if you're not familiar with agile check it out I did take a a course on agile it was through plural site which sometimes you can find deals where you can have get plural site for free for a couple of months uh so try to find one of those deals and uh maybe you could take the course for free I'm sure there's there's other courses out there that are good as well but just from my experience that's where I took a course on it um but that's great advice thanks uh uh thanks for uh writing that Andre Okay Oscar gave an answer uh to the question about this being a WordPress custom theme and basically says he says correctly I created a static site first and then converted it to react and then through the content on WordPress so um yeah you can check check into it more in the uh the repos the get uh GitHub repos that are linked in the description and then also some of the previous shows uh I explain more about how I set up WordPress and everything uh Rohan says I haven't touched react and a really basic knowledge of other Frameworks but I'd still recommend getting to know vanilla JS vanilla JavaScript in and out yeah that's definitely uh that's great advice um actually the uh the person that I interviewed for the dev job the web dev job uh yesterday gave a similar response because I asked I asked the question about what do you think about different Frameworks like what are your thoughts on like react versus angular or what do you think about Jake R and he said and this was the response I was actually hoping that he would say he said you know it doesn't really matter about the Frameworks because there could be another big framework a couple years from now what really is important is knowing vanilla JavaScript and then you can learn any of the Frameworks that come out and I thought that was a great uh a great answer and this is you know basically what what rohan's saying as well uh you know don't at first if you're starting out don't worry so much about learning one framework learn JavaScript well and you'll be able to pick up any framework very quickly uh Sergio says this JS Learning Resource really got me hooked at some uh es6 cota.org yeah I've I actually checked that site out before it is really cool so es6 katas ks.org uh has some cool resources for obviously learning es6 um Andre says one that is cool more towards gaming is the bug Smashers series from the Star Citizen Channel okay cool um I haven't uh I haven't checked that out before for uh but that sounds cool uh I'll have to check that out oh Philip said my comment was a joke should have used an emoji all right sorry Phillip I do that sometime sometimes people joke and I I'm like so focus on trying to answer the questions in the best way I can that I just totally don't even get that some things are jokes so um sorry that went right over my head uh Andre says uh thank you thank you Jesse your videos are really inspiring Rohan says so when do I start yeah honestly if anybody is interested uh let me know like just direct message me on Twitter I can give you all the info you need to apply for the job here I'm not going to be I'm not the one in charge of hiring I'm just on the hiring committee so uh it my opinion will count for a little bit uh but I'd be glad to have you you know working here with me it would technically be working in another department but we would probably collaborate quite frequently um uh but Ro Rohan says but honestly apart from reac and a couple of others most Frameworks are really easy and just comes naturally just in an hour or two of working with him that's that's true some of them like I when I first tried to learn angular like like way back when it was angular 1 I had a lot of trouble with that I think a lot of the trouble was though that I wasn't very experience with vanilla JavaScript first it wasn't necessarily anything wrong with angular it was just my knowledge uh I managed to pick up react a lot faster and I'm still learning a lot about react uh but if you want to throw in jQuery into the JavaScript framework category I mean you can pick up jQuery and like I don't know a couple of hours and start doing things and and it it's pretty easy um let's see okay so Phillip said uh that he may have found one uh a WordPress API multiple taxonomy query so it's like whyyen designs.com boog slash here let me just let me just put it on the screen so I don't have to read you this uh URL which I'm sure is annoying to you so it's basically I haven't gone there yet so I'm not saying that this is good or bad or anything this is just just letting you know in case you're watching later on and can't see the live chat uh so anyway thanks Phil I I will check that out uh well probably not now because I'll have to leave immediately so I can get home in enough time for my wife to get her haircut but um I'll check that out probably tomorrow all right so I'm gonna have to uh end this um which is cool there's not really any other questions in the live chat I've gotten to the bottom uh so I really appreciate everyone uh joining in and uh and watching and especially uh for those you who are contributing in the live chat were really helpful uh today and uh help me help me find out some really obvious errors that I should have seen but didn't uh so I really appreciate everything I'll be back tomorrow uh like I said earlier probably a little bit later probably 230 p.m. uh I'll I'll send out a tweet and let everyone know exactly the time uh my Twitter uh is in the description for this video but it's it's Jesse R Wile uh is my Twitter handle it's j SS r w i g l uh and like I said the the Link's in the description so uh thanks for for watching uh have a great day and I'll be back tomorrow
