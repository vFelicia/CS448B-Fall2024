hey it's Jesse and today I've been doing a lot of research on how to do file uploads with with node so I'm gonna fill you in on what I've what I've learned what I'm thinking about doing and maybe you'll have some better ideas so on the screen now you can see I've successfully set up a let me take this out really quick because I just added that in there I haven't really done anything with it yet but so I've successfully set up the server j/s file so yesterday I was talking about that and had I think it was Kevin that had mentioned like just put a server J's file in there and it will work and it that's it that's exactly what happened it works so I put this in here and I this is like straight from the documentation on github for create react app so really simple and they worked I started it up and basically so it took I did have to build so I ran yarn build created this build folder and now it's just serving everything from that build folder so really cool everything works so this is then where we're gonna handle our uploads in our server dot JS file so I was thinking about using this package Moltar because I've used it before with react to do file uploads so I thought why not why not try it again but maybe there's something newer and better out there that I don't know about so let me know if any of you have experience with that otherwise I think I'm gonna go ahead with this since I have some experience with it I do it one question alive said I'll just answer it right now so I don't forget since it's the first one there do so and ask this did he already set up some JWT so JSON web token off with Express JWT it said no I haven't set that up yet although I probably won't need to for this project yeah I don't think I'll need to there's another project that I did that I really really want to redo in react and I might need it for that so I'm gonna keep that in mind for the future let's see Oh pool request I've got some really exciting news from the pool requests so check this out let me look at this it's the SAS file so this is SCSS syntax so Patrick submitted a pull request where he set everything up so that we can now use SAS on this project so if you clone this repo you can use SAS too yeah I'm super excited about it so yes I haven't actually written any SAS yet but I'm excited to be able to do it I can have variables and all the other awesome stuff and be able to nest things so really cool I honestly didn't realize how much I missed SAS until I had it back again and now I'm like I'm so happy because I haven't used it for well for this project or for the last project and that our last project was I mean what that was at least a month of working on that I think so yeah and then actually what I was working on before that was like an existing project that I had to work within the constraints of that project and it didn't have SAS so it's been it's been months since I've been able to use as so if you're not familiar with SAS it's a CSS preprocessor so it allows you to do some stuff with CSS that you can't normally do and then when you're ready you have you have it set up so that it converts all of that s CSS or SAS into CSS that browsers can can read so that's what I'm talking about here so it just makes it really nice and as the project continues and we actually write some things in SAS hopefully you'll get to see like some of the advantages of using it and it's it's just so some things are just so much faster to write if if you're using SAS so hopefully we'll get a chance to show sure the advantages had some other pull requests as well I just want to make sure everyone's caught up with with where the project is so let me let me double check yeah so we had two other pull requests so the the SAS one was from Patrick and then Kevin submitted two one was actually it OTO calculates the pixel Heights so if you remember yesterday the last thing that we did in this tutorial was we were vertically aligning it but it was off and it was causing the scrollbar as well because we had set this section at first we had just said it to be this container div that basically is here goes from here to here we had set it to be a hundred percent of the viewport height well then we obviously had three things off and it made us have a scrollbar so we needed to deduct the height of this this NAB at the top well I just hardcoded like 64 pixels because that was pretty much the height it was its axis like a fraction of a pixel smaller than that well Kevin I think even said it during the live stream was like you know which maybe you should Auto calculate that so he went ahead and did it himself so now this gets calculated so even if we end up making this bigger or smaller it doesn't matter it'll always look good so that's really cool so I mean you could check out the code for that I'm not gonna go through any of the pull request code like line by line because I think what we're gonna attempt to do today is a pretty involved project so I want to save as much time as I can for that so that's really cool also he added some more testing and if you check out the closed pull requests in this this repo and the link to the repos in the description you'll see so in the latest pull request for and to end testing says for requests 23 Kevin had a really nice description of the different types of testing so the one that we've been doing and then it so other types so check that out if you're if you're new to testing you're not really sure what's going on there it was a really really good description and I got a lot out of it so thanks for that and then not only that but Patrick also explained his pull request from yesterday if you member yesterday I went through and I showed what he had done and for some of the parts I said I honestly don't know a hundred percent what's going on here but I know it works because I tested it so Patrick went through and provided an explanation you know pretty much line by line of everything that that he had done so if you like me we're slightly lost by that that code then check out that that description and that was on pull request let me let me see I have it on the others my other screen here nineteen so pull request nineteen and pull request twenty to have some really good really good comments get information on there so thanks thanks again Kevin and Patrick not only for the pull request but then for taking the time to explain things to me so thoroughly I really appreciate that okay so let's go to our service request forms this is where we have our file upload this is where we're gonna be focusing on not really anything with the the visuals with the UI or anything like that we're basically just we're gonna be setting up this server j/s file so as you can see I brought in so right now like this works I can turn the server on I could go to localhost 9000 and the site it works it looks good just the same as it does you know through an grok oh I forgot to turn in grog on let me do that right now and actually fill for right now I'm going to turn on the port 3000 version of this but if we start with the file upload stuff later on and we start running things through port 9000 honours from our server JS file maybe I'll switch and I'll run that through in grok we'll just see how it goes all right salute yet here's a URL and I'm gonna put that in the live chat oh and there's a lot going on the latch at let me take a look Adrian asked to use meteor with reacts I have not used meteor with reacts is that a thing didn't do people normally use meteor with reacts I'm not I'm not really sure I've seen some demonstrations of stuff built with using meteor and it looked really cool and like super fast so I'm definitely interested in meteor I just don't know a whole lot about it mohamad asks what's the what's the difference between sass and scss the syntax slightly different with sass it's based on indentation so you don't have like your curly braces and things like that and I see John Hanson had answered as well I just thought it might be a good question to repeat out so yeah mainly that's that's pretty much the difference just a little bit different syntax but they can do the same I think all the same things the benefit though to using SCSS is that you could copy and paste normal CSS into an S CSS file and it'll still work if you tried to do that in copy and paste normal CSS into a sass file it would not work so that's why I use s CSS instead of sass if that's that's really the only reason otherwise I think it's actually faster to write sass than s CSS okay I was just doublechecking and seeing what's going on in the live chat okay cool so I had some answers about meteor so evidently Adrien is learning meteor and react together so that's awesome Patrick says I think meteor is moving away from defaulting to blaze and is defaulting to react okay that's really cool I'm gonna have to read up more on that because it's been probably over a year since I read or saw anything about meteor so I need to need to catch up okay Kevin says the downside to using the custom servers that I'll lose the hot reloading yeah I don't like that you're basically what I'm thinking is so let me let me fill everybody in on what's gonna happen so like right now I have this running on port 3000 localhost and this is through the the create react app server so it comes with cool stuff like like hot hot reloading and like everything else is hooked into that that start command so now like our our sass compiling and stuff so that's really good and I don't want to lose that what will happen though if we run let me see oh I don't have it running anymore okay so I was going to show you the screen where I have the other server running but I turned it off so when we start running this like we lose all that so what I'm thinking about doing is getting the file upload and the form stuff to work making sure it works with this and then doing the rest of the development like we normally did and basically just kind of ignoring this until we're ready ready to move this into production I don't know maybe there's a better way to do that but I mean I I don't really need the followup loads to work all the time I just need them to work once so I can test it and once I'm satisfied that that works then I'm I don't really care about it okay and there's someone in the chat and I can't I'm not sure what their name is because it's not in normal characters that I'm used to but they're asking about like getting started and coding and things so I just want to acknowledge that I I see you're asking you're getting some feedback there in the live chat so yeah like stick around watch what we're doing and you know ask questions if I would say free code camp is a really good place to start if you're just beginning looks like you've studied Python so maybe like you're a little bit more advanced than that so you probably fly through all the beginner free code camp stuff and probably won't slow down until you get to the more advanced JavaScript things because you know if you know Python the concepts will be the same they're just just the syntax you'll have to get used to so all right so I'm gonna get started I'll do one more question since it just popped up and just Andrew asked if I've used redux for any of my projects not yet but I will be probably in the future because I'm gonna take a course I'm taking a course right now Udacity nanodegree I finished the first I think that I think they call each part a course so I guess I finished the first course the second course starts in like a week and I'll go over Redux in that course so after I finished with that I will know at least the basics of Redux and I can start incorporating it into my projects okay cool also as as you all probably know we have a secondary stream going on on Instagram the links in the description for that so if you if you happen to join in on Instagram if you're watching on Instagram and you don't know what's going on I'm coding I'm building stuff and react so tune in to free code camp YouTube to see the code alright so let me pull over so I I have up on my other screen screen just to shake way too many tabs of tutorials for how to do this okay so this is what I happen to be working looking at right now so multiple file upload with nodejs which is exactly what we want right here so I've been checking out different tutorials I haven't seen one that's like perfect one looked really good but they it was in typescript and I thought I don't know anything about site script so I'm just gonna try to find a different tutorial so maybe type strips not that different and like I could have figured it out but I figured there's got to be a lot of tutorials on this so you just move on so like this one is using Ajax which we're not going to use Ajax obviously but it seems like the common thread between a lot of these tutorials is that they are all using Moltar and some of them are using body parser I don't know if we'll need this or not I did use this in my last project but looking at the documentation for Moltar it didn't say that you needed this so I'm maybe this used to be needed and now you don't need it anymore not really sure it looks like yeah this looks like this is not gonna be a lot of code this one seems to be the most straightforward of the tutorials there's not a lot of extra stuff in there that that will be confusing that we we won't need so I'm gonna copy a lot of this I you know what I do want to know about body parts or let me go back to the MultiAir documentation if anybody knows anything about this please you know let me know in the in the live chat definitely open to your suggestions also let me get my Pomodoro timer going if if you're not familiar with the timer so this is a way to kind of organize your workday and track things so I use this normally but for the streams I use this to remind me to stop coding and talking and instead check the live chat so I don't miss too much so yeah let's just I'm probably gonna end up copy and pasting this and just testing and see see how it is I also have somewhere in here in one of these tabs the older project that I had done where I did something similar so I can refer to that as well if I need to because I I know it works and I've done it I just need I'll probably pull led to my other strings I need to make sure I don't have anything since it's a private repo I didn't bother like hiding any of the keys or anything so I don't to make sure I don't have anything in that file that I shouldn't show everyone on YouTube so I might I might not show that I might just copy and paste some stuff out of there and then bring it over but it looks like it's really similar to the tutorial okay here's the multi documentation so let me bring this over to show you so this is this is a package that we're using actually let me before I forget I'm gonna make this bigger cuz I had a comment on one of the videos sometime within the last day of somebody saying that I need to make it make this stuff bigger so I apologize when I'm not streaming I make it smaller so that I could see more of the code and I probably had forgotten to make it bigger so sorry about that this this ought to be big enough I think this seems seems pretty big let me know if it's not okay and then I'll also make this a bit bigger as well probably too big alright so for this like I said they're not using the the body parser at all so I'm not sure I think I may end up just using it because that's how I did it the last time that's how this tutorial does it so it'll probably end up going more smoothly if I use what's the you know exactly what they're using so hey we got somebody in oh cool so it's a new day is is also in the Instagram stream and sorry if I'm mispronouncing that I think it's day but I just want to bring that up because I hope he doesn't mind me saying this but today is ooh today's birthday so happy birthday and that's it's really awesome that you're watching my stream on your birthday you can be doing whatever you want I guess on your birthday so anyway thanks thanks for watching hopefully this will be a good stream and we can do some accomplish some cool stuff here okay cool I got some in the live chat got some info about the bawdy parser package so kevin says bawdy parser parses query parameters passed through the URL and form encoded data or json and the body of the post request I don't think you actually need it okay cool ajaan okay John recommends looking at node formidable that's worth worth checking out since we haven't really done anything yet this is the time to explore alternatives so let's check this out okay always I just like to look when I see initially like how many stars does does it have and once the last time was updated okay so within the last year it's been updated you have four months okay whereas motor was did we have it on the screen still I guess not I guess I pulled it over to the side I'm just comparing okay so in terms of stars they're about the same formidable is a little bit more and it actually looks like formidable is more uptodate so this looks cool it's definitely worth looking at that's it for me especially follow yeah this looks like cool I like it so far Wow okay it looks like this may already be integrated into Express well it looks like there's a lot more to this documentation as well which I guess is is a good thing see the the moon surd documentation is is pretty short oh I guess there's more to it than I initially thought now that I look at it I guess I just didn't scroll down enough all right what do y'all think I'm kind of split here I'm gonna I'm open to suggestions to see if you all have any opinion should we try to do this with multi or should we try to do it with formidable I really have no idea which one is the more widely used of the two and I'm gonna pull a pull the documentation over and then that way we can have all the code on the screen kevin said maybe branch off and throw a coin yeah so I'm actually working just so you know if you want to check out the repo I don't think I've pushed any of this new code up yet this is a new branch wow that's really small this is a new branch and I named a custom server so everything we do now will be in terms of this will be on the new branch so we don't mess anything up and if we get it to the point where we're confident that it's working and not messing anything up then of course we'll merge it back in but so for now I don't think it's it's actually available but I will before I leave today I'll make sure I'll push whatever we're we did up to to get home and that way you co can see it all right so I'm trying to see if I have a coin in here I mean oh yeah actually I do I have a coin in my backpack so I am actually going to throw a coin so you can you can't see this but you could if you're on the Instagram feed you'll see it so what do you say heads will be formidable and then tails will be multi all right so I'm flipping it now it's heads all right so we're gonna go with formidable okay now Joseph put in the live chat that Google has you can do Google a coin flip so we didn't what am I thinking flipping a real coin you know there's got to be a virtual way to do it that's better all right but anyway flip the coin its formidable so this is like real serious coding here right we're making making big decisions by flipping coins all right cool so let's then remove I think I had already added yeah I added this package I'm gonna remove it and then let's maybe we have to add formidable so I don't know if you caught it at the beginning of the documentation but it seemed like it was saying that it's already included in express so I guess we can find out by just trying to use it and seeing if it works so I'm going to do that let's go to our code let's get rid of this and I'm I guess I'm just gonna try to paste in some of the just really basic example code and they're using their instead of constant the sample code what the heck in case you don't know what I'm talking about by that it's the es6 you can use constant let instead of their to declare your your variables so if if you can if you're if you're using a transpiler then definitely use a Const or let alright so I'm just trying to see what I need to copy and what I don't need to copy and I just I don't like how they formatted this oh well we'll copy it over I can always change the formatting so definitely want this to be Const and I don't like this okay now that looks better okay so they're doing yeah this is a bit confusing the sorry I'm talking about their example so in formidable github page it's slightly confusing because you know they have it's not set up exactly right so like there's no Express here and things like that so I need an example that uses Express I mean if if there is one that would be nice I guess we can figure it out without that but just want to want to try that out let's see I thought there was a link to something about using it with express there we go okay cool Joseph just said there's there's an express formidable awesome okay so here is Express formidable although it's let's see how this works I mean there's like 30 stars so let's let's see what's going on here maybe we will use this or at least we can get some idea of how to use formidable I mean that that looks really really simple okay so you have some questions so formidable sis's marks asking a question about formidable it's going to help us upload files and store them so we have a file upload input and that we need to do something with the files once we get them okay john hanson recommended looking in the sorry looking at something else on my screen he recommended looking in the examples folder in that repo and I did not so definitely should do that so let me I'm checking it right now my other screen okay it's still looking yeah it's still looking pretty much the same as what was on the homepage in terms of like not having expression both actually it looks like there's a lot of information on using formidable with express it's just I just did a Google search on my other screen and a lot of people trying to do the same thing which is good all right so there is a tutorial so let's check this out I think this was from 2015 so hopefully it's not too outdated but at least this shows this is what I wanted to say something that's starting with Express and then also bringing in formidable okay yeah this looks like definitely looks like something I can use so I'm gonna copy this as a start just to give us something to work with and there we have formidable I guess I don't need these okay so basically okay so this handles uploads we do need to make sure that we can handle the rest of the form as well so I'm assuming that formidable does that I mean it would make sense that it would do that okay yeah I can handle form data okay this is a good place to start I kind of just like really want to test something first before I start secondguessing things and copying other things and so first thing I want to try to do is just see as I was saying before the do I really need to have formidable like the documentation seem to was seemed to say it already came with Express which I'm not really sure that it'll work like that but we'll see so I'm just gonna start I'm just gonna try to start the server let me think what did I use before I came here what I used before their note sir well I couldn't I remember that it's the same every time you use it anyway okay cool so that was easy enough we do need a to add it which makes sense so okay what's yarn add formidable okay so we're now getting that package and installing it and all the dependencies okay cool I saw it John I saw your comment there about formidable does pull in all the form data also Andrew I see Andrew asked how I like the react nanodegree yeah I am I like it so far like I said I'm through there's basically there's an introduction and there's three courses or three sections to the nanodegree and I'm through the first one I like the first one the the biggest benefit that I've seen so far from that program has been being able to submit projects and then get feedback pretty quickly like within 24 hours and for me it was it was always way less than 24 hours and that that was really challenging and good so hey I guess somebody in the Instagram that's been saying hi hey welcome yeah that was really challenging because that's not something that I normally have like trying to teach myself something usually is just me reading through things and trying out out on my own without any feedback from a real person so that was good my my project ended up I had to revise it a lot more than I thought I would you know the first time I turned it in I thought hey this thing works it's done and it wasn't there was like rounds of I don't remember how many but like maybe like five I don't know it was crazy how many times I turned in the same project thinking that I had it completely done and not realizing that there was some little bug or some piece you know one of the user stories that I just was not completing so that was really challenging and it forced me to learn more and to you like refactor a lot of what I had done so that that was cool I really I did like that now I can see the value and paying for those courses that really the value is in real people putting in work going over your code line by line making comments challenging you you know that's that was the best part of it so anyway sorry for the little sidebar there I am my intention was to address that question while this was loading but it's it obviously loaded way faster then I thought oh now we have this and now let's just let's try to start this server okay cool this is this is good it doesn't it doesn't say anything right now when I started so this this means it's probably running and we can check this by going to localhost 9000 awesome it's working okay now we didn't actually do anything to link up this forum so we can't test this yet but at least it shows that like one we have formidable now and also like we don't have any crazy errors in our server ojs file so good step my timer went off so I'm gonna take five minutes try to go through the everything that's in the live chat so far answer any questions and hopefully hopefully I think I may be able to get through most of us in the live chat there's not a whole lot and I kept up with it so after the five minutes is up we'll go back and let's link up that upload and see what happens when we we actually try to upload something what all right so Patrick says extracting 306 million cracked passwords from a 5.4 gig 5.4 gigabyte seven zip file is really taking a long time what are you doing why well how did this all come about okay we did have a question how can JavaScript help you for working how does it help you as a programmer pretty much anything on the web now runs at least some JavaScript so if you're into web development at all then you probably going to end up using javascript especially since like the web has moved away from alternatives so flash is not really a thing anymore like Java applets they don't you don't see those you know anymore so everything is pretty much JavaScript so it can definitely help you with web development you can use javascript in other areas as well although you don't have to so you can do JavaScript on the back end you can you can build apps with JavaScript you can even do BR stuff with JavaScript so now you don't like I said you don't need JavaScript for that but if you knew JavaScript you could do all of that with just JavaScript so I think there's value in its versatility right now the Moose says the atom editor what does its hackable mean I'm new to coding basically it just means that pretty much everything in the editor you can customize so you can actually go into the code and customize what you want it's I think Adam Adams an electron bright I'm pretty sure so if you go into the code for Adam it'll look really familiar because it'll they'll be like CSS that you can edit and things so a lot of I mean probably your basic place to start with that would be editing CSS to change colors but you know you could get deeper into it people make a lot of plugins to make Adam do a lot of different things so that's that's what they mean by hackable it just means customizable okay I see Patrick said there there's a he looked up but and npn compared calm and compared a bunch of the form packages that are used with express in note and said that formidable wins by a lot so awesome so our coin flip picked the right one okay patchy should surprise grepping a 12.7 gigabyte file with 306 million passwords to make sure your passwords aren't in it is very slow okay now I know what you were doing that okay that makes a lot more sense so that's actually really cool so let let's talk about this for a second so you so you have a file with all these crack passwords and you're checking for your passwords where did you get the file varun says hi Jesse greetings from India hey how's it going thanks for for watching for joining us Jacobi says hey what's up folks just just building stuff with react how's it going thanks for watching okay Kevin said the express formidable package is really just a thin wrapper over formidable so that it works as a middleware it's literally 23 lines of code okay cool so probably not really a big deal to go with that then not it's not gonna really add a lot and it might help us out so I'm gonna I'll check that again in a minute okay Rohan asks if I visit if I did visit the doctor and how my my hand is soso lately my right wrist has been hurting a lot and so I actually did go to the doctor two days ago so yeah so after work two days ago I went basically I have a wrist splint like a brace thing that I wear I actually I can't wear it when I'm working I tried to but like when I try to type on the keyboard part of the brace like hits keys that I don't intend to hit so it's just and it's sometimes it even ends up hurting worse so I basically only wear the brace when I don't need to work and then I just like keep trying to put ice on it they gave me like a pack of like steroid pills that are supposed to take the the inflammation down and other than that I just need to try not to use it which is hard because I'm righthanded so I'm constantly trying to do things with my right hand and I have to stop myself so I'm starting to get used to it now driving with my left hand was a little weird and actually brushing my teeth lefthanded really weird eating lefthanded there's a lot of things that you don't I just never thought about doing with my my offhand and now they're they're really weird so anyway that's the update on my my wrist so it is slightly better than it was yesterday so I have been making more of an effort to to not use it and actually the ice using ice with it helps a lot so it feels really good after I sit okay I'm Patrick this would be the last thing before I go back to the code here since my time is up but in answer to my questions about the password thing Patrick says I have been poned dotcom slash passwords awesome cool yeah I am I've been on that lift site before I guess I just didn't look around enough I didn't realize you could actually get lists of passwords but that's really cool I'm definitely I'm gonna have to go on there I'm typing it in on my other screen just so I don't forget because I need to be extra careful I think with passwords dang it I can't I have a VIN phone did I type it wrong but anyway I need to I feel like I need to be extra careful because I have access to so many people's websites that I like have an obligation to be more careful than than normal with passwords so I don't know how it is with you all but if specially if you've done any freelancing do you all have access to like a ton of websites because that's how it is with me and it makes me nervous sometimes especially if my kids want to play something on my computer that I I'm like no you can't you could accidentally like break somebody's website yeah so anyway I mean how do you handle that like I'm still I'm still an admin for so many WordPress installations though for a lot of businesses and though they probably never ever login to their WordPress thing so it's never changed they've never like I had I bet you probably 90% of my clients even from like four or five years ago I could probably log into their site right now because they never think to change the password and I would still have admin access I'm pretty sure I still have FTP access to people's sites and they don't even realize it yeah so I mean that's probably a bad thing but otherwise it's sometimes you get clients like I could give them everything they need to access it through FTP and they'd never even know how to do it or want to do it so it's not like you can hand over that information because there's there's no one there that can understand that and use it so anyway sorry for the tangent but it's a little ethical dilemma of like should I just lock myself out of everything and then those clients would probably then be locked out because they really probably shouldn't be admins on it either sometimes their passwords are like really really simple so definitely should not have admin access so it's it's a bit of a dilemma I don't know let me know what you think about that like it does make me a little nervous I mean it doesn't keep me up at night but I am a bit nervous that I have I have so much access to so many sites but I don't really I don't really know a good solution to that okay so anyway in case you had no idea what we were talking about this is the site I have been phoned com put in your email address or username and then it should tell you if anything is any accounts associated with that email or username if those sites have suffered like a data breach and then potentially your password has been exposed and if you use that same password on other accounts then potentially your other accounts could be exposed as well so really useful I'm not gonna search for mine in front of all of you because maybe I am maybe my stuff has been exposed and before I'd have a chance to change it somebody might I don't think one of you would try to get into my stuff but it's possible okay so let's go back to here and let's just see what are we doing okay so what we need to do is post two uploads from our request form so right now I don't really care about the rest of the forum right now I want to test out the file upload first because the rest normal uploads are a lot more simple it's been my experience it's way more simple to handle other form data and it's the file uploads especially multiple file uploads that are always a bit tricky so like I said I've done this and node one other time but using Moltar and instead of formidable and then I've done it in PHP which obviously we're not going to do in PHP for this project so this is a bit new for me okay our idea is upload and I do have I have the code from my other project so the last time I did this I actually did use Ajax so I don't think I'm gonna use Ajax this time obviously so let me so as I said earlier I don't really want to bring over my previous code onto the screen where you all can see just just in case I have some stuff in there that I should not show because it was for a client I have no idea if there would be okay with me showing the code anyway so that's what I'm doing right now I'm just kind of looking at that code alright so I can see okay I did do one thing that I did do before that I'm not doing now and I'm not sure if it's needed or not is I use name upload and then I put this in brackets so and now that I see that I know that at some point I did try this and it was needed I know for sure I needed to do this when I try to do it with PHP not exactly sure that I need it with this we'll see okay it looks like I do have a file that I'm pretty sure I could bring this over and show you also let me show you all what I did just to give you an idea of like what what at least worked not sure if it's the best okay so this takes form data both text inputs and multipart upload and then it submits it so yeah so this is Jake it's using jQuery so when you click the submit button it goes through and it grabs the values which in our case our values are already stored in state so we won't have to actually go and select the the elements themselves we already have all that so that'll be easy okay I do have a toggle so depending on what's checked this this data gets sent to a different email address okay and here's what I did with the form data so this is what I'm I'm actually most interested in so I created a new form data object and then I appended all the fields and then I loop through the files and I appended that as well and then I use Ajax to do a post request right here to send a post to our upload okay so you can see these are the steps we're not obviously not going to use jQuery to do this but these are the basic steps that we need to follow oh okay I just so John 100 says I've been saying I have been poned but the site is have I been poned that's probably why I kept typing it wrong have I been phone so I was trying to type in I think I was trying time and I have been phone so thank you for that so sorry for the for the mistake so have I been poned that makes more sense alright so I'm gonna pull this over and just as a reference for the steps that I need to take so we need the button and where's our button our submit button here we go so here's our button so we need to have a non clay and hello form data so appears somewhere no probably gonna get yeah I don't know that we need to pass it anything okay so within this okay so from what I understand basically so we're not gonna use the submit button in a normal way so like we didn't wrap this in a form element and the normal thing would be like that you you have a submit button in your form element it just automatically sends the form data but normally the behavior would be that you would have a page refresh so at least one of the ways to handle that when you don't want a page refresh to happen which we don't in this case is that you just create your form data object with JavaScript and that's what happens when you click the button I'm pretty sure there are other ways to go about this and maybe this isn't the best way but it is the way that I have used in the past so it's a good place to at least start from to see if we can get it working and then we can always refactor if we figure out that this is not the best way to do it so let's um can you check out of state let me I forget how our state ends up looking area there we go okay so you just stayed you should be able to do okay all right so I see Kevin this yet this is exactly what I'm thinking right now Kevin says you can pass a form element to the constructor of form data and it will be populated with the forms current keys and values okay yeah that's what I'm trying to do basically I just want the the keys and values to be in the form data object so what I was what I was thinking of doing was I was just going to map over all those and then append them so is there then a better way to do that okay all right so so I was looking up some things on the other screen so you're saying basically I need to use a constructor oh but you would need a form element you can map over them but you need object dot entries okay so I was reading that out from from the live chat okay okay so basically Kevin is saying in the live chat here that I was trying to use map which is not the right thing to use here because we use map with arrays and state is an object so it should not be zoom at so any just I'm so used to using Matt because normally well at least in our last project we dealt with JSON all the time and use map with it okay I got a link alright so John has sent a link in the live chat for using form data from NBN so that's probably that was probably a decent idea here to look to check out form data before let me pull this over on this screen it okay so basically it so we're all on the same page that the what we're trying to do right now is get all the key value pairs that are in state that's all the information that's it's in the inputs we're trying to move that into our new form data object that we've we've created so we're basically here at this point it's empty right and then what I was going to do was loop over everything and then just append but this is what we want to do well not exactly this so because this is still assuming that we wrapped it in a form I guess we can't we could write there's no reason why we know I don't want to because I'd rather get it from I think I would rather just get everything from the state I'm not sure it is there what do you think is there any value and using kind of the more traditional form elements and then just preventing default on when we click on the submit button and then doing what we want I mean I guess that would give us everything that we needed all the values we needed and technique like those values would all be exactly the same as what's in state because that's where the the values are coming from aha John said I went to the wrong page alright let me go back form data values okay I'm not it looks like values are this would tell me what all the values are from the form data object but I guess what I want to do is get stuff into the object first okay Kevin has put some code in okay I see Kevin Kevin stuff let me copy this over so everybody can see this I'll just add this down here okay so this is what Kevin has pasted or typed in the live chat so basically she's just a okay so we can do this but I'm I guess I'm still now that I I saw that I'm still wondering are we are we trying to do in JavaScript something that the form element already does for us should we just use that is would I mean is there any reason why we shouldn't just use that so you know again like basically you know this and then creating our form data objects with what's already in this this form which is fine I'm fine doing it either way I'm just kind of wondering what the is there a best way in this situation just send me a lot to wrap from yeah okay so John says maybe wrap it in a form seems easier okay and then Kevin adds the the code would just be appending the key value pairs so like that okay so Umberto is saying if you are not going to have a way to handle an actual post with postbag then do not rely on clientside JavaScript to perform prevent default okay so this is a reason against using the form elements to just wrap everything in the form tags okay all right so I mean that's what I was looking for basically is if we could think of any reason why we should not use one or the other so let's let's go with this then okay so within this let's pop this in first all right so Kevin let me look at this so I'm actually not I actually don't really understand this part and what's going on here so I'm assuming that this was necessary to be able to use map on the state because originally you say we can't use map on the state because it's an object so if you if you can if you'd like to please let me know like just a brief explanation of what's going on here and then I'll I can read that out for everybody cuz maybe you all get what's going on here but I'm slightly lost at least this part so I can explain the rest which is basically we're gonna iterate over everything and state which are all our key value pairs for all our form inputs and then we're gonna add it to this form data object and then the form data object is what we're actually going to pass over to our server J s and then it's going to be handled here within this okay so everything in here is where we're gonna actually do what we need to do with that data okay cool so I have an explanation now Rudd rivering Shu says the object dot entries method returns an array of a given object's own innumerable property key value pairs in the same order as that provided by a for in loop okay so basically it's doing we could have done the same thing by using a loop but that's just a much shorter way of doing it am i understanding that correctly Jacobi says it almost seems like you don't have to use the map function yeah that's a good point so yes so if this is already going to go over everything do we do we need the map okay so patrick said it's it's a second array of key value pairs that that line is d structuring those back into key value okay all right I'm starting to get it starting to get it a bit more Patrick's is a two dimensional so okay cool so rude rude rang Xiu is as put the link in the live chat for the NBN article on it so I'm gonna just save that and check it out I'm gonna check it out later on and just you can see so basically if you look up global why is this going off of my screen that's odd anyway global object object entries if you search that on Indiana it'll probably come up okay all right so Patrick is put in let me paste this over so in the live chat Patrick just put in so it ends up being like this okay which this makes more sense now that this basically allows the map to work because now we are dealing with an array okay so John hundred says speaking of since this is a teaching video you might want to edit the soundtrack for the right website so it's a have I been phone maybe we can put out a cliff notes version of all these live chats yeah that's yeah I actually since these are all done live like I never go back in and edit mostly because so like YouTube just automatically post them so you can't edit a YouTube video I'd have to take the video down and then upload an entirely different video so that's why I don't do that it's possible that I could set it so that YouTube wouldn't automatically do it and instead I would record it at the same time that I'm streaming on my local machine then I could make edits and then upload but I don't have the time or the skill to do that so for better or for worse these remain unedited but I'm definitely interested in the idea of a Cliff's Notes version of all these these chats alright so let's let's just try it let's see okay now I want to so we need to send a post Oh actually we need to we need to handle that those uploads so base if you remember in our law to show you in states I believe well actually let me check I was thinking that in state like basically we're just gonna have the names of the files correct I thought that's what how we had it I'm pretty sure that's how we had it so obviously like we need more than just the names to sin trying to find how I handled these uploads before now I can't find it I had the screen up I'm just gonna start closing some windows here because I can't find anything at this way there we go that's what I was looking for just looking on the wrong screen so that's a okay let's go we need to append the files so if we grab wood I think we just name that upload so is there's got to be is there like a better react way to get the value of an element other than document dot get element by ID he said upload upload upload okay use ref okay okay so I can use ref I remember trying to use ref at some point within the last six months and not getting it to work so I'm gonna look up in the docs how to use wrath so here's wrath many focused readers okay Kevin says you can use react Tom define node react element so which way is between the two waves between ref and using react don't find note which way is the better one oh man I kept thinking like you know what my timer hasn't gone off for a while and evidently I had never reset it after the break so yeah it's definitely been enough time let me do a short break and go back to the live set I'm sorry I ignored you all for so long and then we'll come back we'll get this to the point where we can at least give it a shot of testing it out and and then we'll then we'll end so this will be definitely keep this short since we're getting towards the end anyway okay so Barack says Jesse thank you for doing this you're welcome I he says I've watched the first four videos and this is the first live session how many days do you expect this project to be actually I got some information today from one of my coworkers that we might be changing more about this than I thought so I'm not really sure I can give a good estimate right now because if there are going to be changes then it might be bigger a bigger project than we thought and then also if they're going to be changes I might have to wait and have things reviewed before I can actually put the changes in so I mean nothing like code wise but just the text that's going to appear on there might have to be reviewed by multiple people before it's approved to be on here so that could lengthen things so I would I would say like I mean what we're on day 11 I mean I kind of think we could have this usable by day like 20 this is probably the biggest thing that we're working on now everything after this is going to be pretty easy we'll have to take some time to set up a server but that shouldn't take too long yeah so I'm gonna guess maybe around 20 days if everything goes well and there's not a lot of changes if there's more changes more than that kind of didn't think this would take that long but I also thought that we would basically be copying over all the stuff and not changing much so we'll see we'll see how it goes I really hope I don't have to like stop and go to a different project and then come back that would just mess up the continuity of the streams but if I'm waiting on things you know texts to get reviewed I can't really do anything about that Alberto says hello I'm from Cuba I'm also learning react and I like your videos a lot I could contribute with your project by adding progressive web app capability let me know if you're interested to coordinate yeah actually that's that sounds really good so yeah Albert so yeah let me know I mean you could I mean certainly it's on github you could do a pull request if you'd like or if you need to like talk talk about things with me to get it to a better place like let me know because I'm definitely interested I'm interested in that I appreciate you offering to help with that huh John asked when I was talking earlier about having passwords to everything I mentioned I don't like my kids on my computer he said you don't have your own desktop login and your kids and other would save you a lot of grief yeah on my um on my macbook my kids don't have a login it's just me and my wife so I I pretty much never want them on the MacBook at all I do have a Chromebook that they I'm surprised at how durable it is like my kids destroy it they spill things on it they drop it they take it like everywhere they take it outside and just lay it on the ground and the grass and stuff it's crazy and it still works so I probably should make an account for them they usually just use my wife's login but that's a good idea I haven't really had to worry about it until now because they haven't really used computers that much until kind of recently so I'm gonna have to think about setting things up in a better way Bryan says use one password and generate unique passwords for each site actually I use I use LastPass so I do have unique passwords for my sites okay all right so I did say this was gonna spin any short break and I am gonna go back to this so I'm gonna be true to my word there and I'll come back and finish with a live chat as soon as we get this working I guess I mean I'd be okay even if it like as long as something happens even if like it it fails I just wanted to do something okay so what were we oh we were doing this okay so the the last thing we were talking about was they're using refs okay so kevin says ref sounds like the way to go on this so we'll go with that also Kevin says since we are not returning anything from map you may want to change it to four each or to a four loop okay I guess we can change that all right so we're talking about this part here and replacing it with this for loop like this correct alright and for this part we're gonna basically try to do this but using refs because that that seems like the way to go so as I said I have never successfully used refs so I need to take a second here and check out how to use it oh man I totally forgot I've had a fan on the whole time it can you guys hear that or can you all hear that is it annoying the fan okay cool it doesn't seem like anyone is the faith it is on the lowest setting so it was just really hot in here today so normally I don't run run the fan when I'm streaming okay okay so on our on our input okay and then now we can access this this upload input okay okay so this will select that and then within our upload input we need to get the data and append that to our form data objects so we need files oh wait Patrick says refs don't work with functional components this is not yeah this this particular component right is not okay good for a second I'll say all admit we gotta change it again okay but that is good to know so refs do not work with functional components so just FYI okay so we need to get our files and we need to append that so how's the files do you get an array of files or do this give it an object I can't remember what we're gonna get actually let's just I want to see what we're doing I wonder if this will even run hey oh that's not now which one do I want to see for now okay so for now I'm just using it at the local hose 3000 because I don't have to build things over again so let's throw in some files and I just put in some stuff here and then submit should console oh yes awesome alright so here's what we have so we have in fact successfully selected our upload field or upload input and then we are getting the file so here's a file list so we did up one two three yeah so we uploaded four files we see all four files here awesome awesome cool so that's what we needed that's what we want to do so we just need to append these so let's see how did I do this before all right so we need to wait actually I wanted to see that these were okay living objects all right so since it's an object we do not want to use map correct so I guess we could do a four of again and we want really we want to pen the whole thing and okay Alberto says how can I get in contact with you if I'm on all like all the different social media things so if you're on Twitter you can direct message me on Twitter or whatever whatever social media that your do you use most often you can just you can find the links to all my social media stuff on my personal YouTube channel and the link to that channel is in the description otherwise you could email me too you could use just Jessie why go at gmail.com I'll type that in the live chat we yeah so whichever ways most comfortable for you okay so uh Kevin I'm seeing Kevin offered some alternatives to this so Kevin just will this then work or if this works I'll probably just keep it like this just for the sake of time at this point but if if you're saying that this won't work and I need to use one of the alternatives then that's cool I'll replace it all right so now that we're a pending that the next thing to do is would be to actually post the data so what I want to do is use fetch so let's show us in the studio with fish it's a 10point it's just yeah and then first my head yesterday to even need headers maybe not trying to look on my other screen I have what I had used for when I was doing this with Ajax so I'm just trying to translate that into my fetch to make sure that I'm doing the same thing okay I don't need that it's it's slightly different how you put things links in with fetch hello says I give up it so hard no don't give up yet we're almost there alright fool as a body what if I can get away with this and just putting just putting data in the body maybe that's all I need I had a lot more to my Ajax call but I just kind of want to see if this works looks like the minimum that we would need to make this work I don't really want to do anything with the response just yet I guess all right so at least now at this point it would go here now let's make sure we're doing what we need to over here okay the only thing I'm not I'm not sure about this last part why are we I'm not sure what's going on here and I don't know where my documentation is at for formidable I can't remember we got this from from a tutorial didn't we yeah we did yeah I'm not really sure why we're sending this and there's not there's really no explanation given in the in the tutorial so I'm going through the on my other screen I'm just scrolling through the documentation and formidable alright let's just get rid of that for now since I really not sure about it okay so at least this should give us a console.log all right let's try it out like this see um we'll build it let's stop the server let's build it okay all right now it's good we get some errors okay check this we got nothing in here expected to see something all right so we had so nothing have nothing is probably the worst thing that could happen I would have rather had an error message all right let's see okay the good thing is since since I just changed this I don't need to build again I can what did I do with my terminal I put on my other screen okay you should be able to just close this and then reopen it okay actually okay we got an error so here's our error those slip those uploads can I should reset all right cool and we got our message here awesome unless I wanted at least an error message not really sure what to make out of this but at least I got something okay Joseph said no need for the get method also in the server jazz the get method was in here from the this as little as came from the create react app documentation so I think I need this to serve the the site itself I mean we were those you see those areas we were getting all right so I guessing I was trying to figure out where to look first okay these are conflicting all right I'll show this oh this is who we get okay cool got some different error best progress event status I don't have a file uploads okay so we're just expected at project resource center uploads okay alright now let's share it again haha look at that look at that alright take this out can everyone see that the files have been uploaded yes alright so we did it we got files all right I'm not saying that this is completely like a hundred percent the way we want it to be in the final version but like we have no error handling so but basically it's doing what we wanted it to do the files are in there and so basically our errors were our first error was pretty much we were just trying to do two different things that were conflicting here is basically I just copied this over from a tutorial and I'm pretty sure they were trying to do something that I was not trying to do so this was what was better to put in here then we got a second error simply because I was telling it to put the files and the uploads directory and I didn't create an uploads directory so I just had to create that directory so just for future reference if you're trying to do something like that watch out for for those errors probably the first error you might not get but this I can imagine that this might be like a common thing that gets overlooked awesome okay cool I thought I just I knew we were close so this stream has gone on longer than a normal stream but I just we were so close I just didn't want to stop until we got it so really cool so basically we you know we've got the uploads coming in and now they're going into this folder which is great which means so unlike I think I explained in a previous stream the problems I was having with the current uploads in that the files are being uploaded but they're not being stored anywhere instead they're being sent to our project management system and the issue sometimes is that the files don't get sent and I know they're supposed to be files because the file names are sent but the files themselves don't get sent so I'm losing the files I have no backup of those files and what happens if somebody from my department has to call whoever it made that submission and ask them to resend or just email them the files or something that's not really ideal so this what this allows us to do is we have a backup of the files we can choose now to try to send the files to the API through the API directly to our project management system which will probably still do but as a backup we can also send the URL to access these files if we wanted to so I'm not exactly sure how I want to do it but the bottom line is we have a backup now so we should not lose files anymore would never want to leave it like this right now I'm doing no checking to see if somebody's trying to upload a malicious file or anything so definitely don't want to leave it like this but you can see that it works everything else basically is just checking things out before we do this step of actually saving the file so now on to questions yes I see a couple a couple of good suggestions so Joseph says now get the return from the response and print a message accordingly yeah so we want to do something right to let the user know that it worked right I'm like I'm not gonna do anything else for this stream since I already applaud you all for suffering through all of that until it works so 25 of you it looks like made it all the way through to the end so hopefully getting it to work in the end was satisfying enough that it was worth sticking around it definitely was for me I feel so happy that we get that to work so yeah definitely wanted to have a response Kevin says are you gonna do a thankyou page or show a modal F reformist unsuccessfully yeah I think probably a modal yeah I think currently I show a modal so I'll probably just keep it like that Patrick says you may want to think about making uniquely named folders under the uploads folder to prevent naming collisions yeah that's a good idea I think what I had done previously is when I done something like this before I actually used like I got the date and I appended that to the file name so that every file name was unique and then that made sure because the only thing I'm thinking is can I even make folders because it's not I may have to do something else or maybe get another package to be able to let let me make folders automatically because it it wouldn't let it didn't find the upload folder maybe it's already built in but I just need to do something else to have it make the folder first so either way I'm fine with it either having a folder that's a different name for the folder like let's say each folder has a date on it and then the files go in there or actually changing the file names then as long as I keep track of what I changed the filenames to which shouldn't really be a problem then I can always go back and access those if I need to so yeah but anyway good suggestion okay yeah Kevin said or unique prefix yeah yeah I can um had it and usually like date date is pretty good I mean the odds of somebody like what what are the odds of like files being uploaded simultaneously at exactly the same time like is that is that even possible like I don't know so okay Kevin says FS dot make directory or FS dot make directory sync okay cool so there's definitely a way to do it okay it looks like alright cool Joseph is I said I know I said I wasn't gonna do anything else but says also some response like this so let me paste this in says this correct so what I can I have all these at the same time or these gonna conflict you can tell I'm definitely a noob when it comes to using Express in nodejs so I like I've done it when I had to do it and I was able to get things working that I needed to but not really confident enough to customize it a whole lot it takes a lot of research for me to do anything with this okay I need to remove one remove the first okay cool let's remove the first one okay cool so and then like so I've done if I've done this now on the other end when I get the response I can do something with the response which like I said I'll probably end up having a modal appear so I'm definitely not gonna try to code that right now actually I've never done a modal with material UI before so that'll be cool get to learn how to do modal so maybe that'll be tomorrow we'll finish up and give the user some feedback okay.what bangs shoe says not semicolon it's a chain function okay cool so I'm gonna get rid of do you want to get rid of that semicolon success your status fine okay I'm better just saying we can do it like this lots of options so let's see so I can combine that then and do something like this cool all right cool I'm going to alright at this point I'm just gonna save everything I'm gonna make sure let's um what do you think this is is this working enough that I could actually put this merge this back in the master at this point or should we leave it on a separate branch and want to get it like actually finished maybe I'll just leave it on a separate branch for now cuz it's not like it's really finished finish it's you know it's we've got the first like major step done we've got that to work but we still need to finish it off so let's check it out everything that we have here I do not want the uploads folder actually yeah I don't really want the uploads folder to be synced let's put that in in our get ignored there we go okay just saying I could do a blank upload folder and not the files themselves yeah that's true I kind of want to make it so we were saying earlier that we could automatically make the directory so I think I want to do that so I want to not sink the uploads folder but instead maybe make the floor is there a way that I could check to see if the folder exists and if it doesn't exist then create the folder because I think that would be ideal I don't know we'll see I could always add it in later I guess it would be a big deal right now to get rid of these so don't really want to keep them there anyway let's get rid of those and then I can take this off for now you just comment that out for now might put it back in all right so now I don't know it was already in there and I thought let me do it again okay cool here it is alright I'm gonna save that but like I said I'm not gonna do anything about it right now but so this is what I want to check to see if this if this suggest if not we'll make it so that's what I do want to do at some point but not right now cuz need to get this finished up how about this let me just answer the questions now and then I'll worry about committing this so I think I've gone over enough git commits that most but pretty much most of you if not all of you will have seen see me do a commit so you know I normally do like to do it but in this case it's been a really long stream so I'll just do it after alright I'm definitely gonna have to go back over the chat to get because there's so much good advice here that I want to make sure I don't miss it also after this is over I'll go back through so at this point now I'm gonna do question and answer if you don't really care about question and answer and you know you want to stop watching at this point that's cool thank you so much for watching I'll be back tomorrow 200 p.m. Eastern Time otherwise if you have any questions go ahead and throw them in here I'll do my best to get through them all probably I don't want to take too too long so I'm going to try to go through quickly because this is going to end up being a three hour long stream all right so I'm at this point I'm just scrolling through trying to find questions to answer and I'm skipping through most of the discussion and sometimes I do read out everything if I have time but I'm not going to at this point okay all right I found the point where I left off okay we were talking about I had said before I still have access to a lot of stuff from past clients and it's just like a weird situation so I did get some responses here about things so it seems like seems like at least a few of you also have access to things like that but Rohan had a good suggestion here so I'm gonna really says I probably wouldn't want to access their sites to distance myself if they try to blame me for something that went wrong but on the other hand yeah some people can be dumb yeah so yeah that's just I don't really want to get in and access the sites either I'm just not exactly sure what to do because I mean what do I do at this point you would I you have to contact the client convince them that this is actually something they should care about and then make them an admin have them delete my admin account yeah it just seems like it would be a lot of a lot of time and a lot of steps and probably wouldn't be a big deal I mean most of these sites are talking about are like very simple WordPress sites for small businesses so it's not like it's going to be the end of the world if if something ever happened to them patrick said so patrick was going through a bunch of passwords that that had been stolen looking for see if his were in there i said he searched password and act and did find it in the list so that's crazy i can't believe people we use that okay so i'm actually not seeing a ton of questions it's a lot of a lot of the advice you you all were giving me along the way okay so it looks like nexi asks is he creating a website or what so I'm assuming that that question got answered but just in case yeah it's it's a website so it's the main purpose of the website is to allow people where I work to request services from my department through an online form and there's going to be a few other things they can do as well but that's that's the big the big thing that we're working on the thing is going to take the most effort and time to get working it's funny going through this live chat now I remember like all the things that I messed up along the way because I I can see y'all saying like no don't do it that way or do this oh man John Henson says kids can be surprising my son in the early days of computers had magical powers of how to get around locked shareware games at the age of six Wow yeah I definitely gotta get my computers ready for my kids I have an 8 year old so yeah I need to and like I said they weren't really on the computer too much except for like that we had a Chromebook they just watch shows on it but now my son started playing minecraft so I have them on one of my old Windows computers playing Minecraft so I really need to get that locked down so you can just play Minecraft and not potentially mess and that's with anything else ciao ask anyone used draganddrop functionality on react app no I've never used any draganddrop stuff Patrick says Dan Abramov wrote react D&D for that the end is react D and D he thinks that's the name of it so awesome also asks anybody have experience getting values of dynamically created input fields and react and revering xu says put it into an array with indices for the new fields update the state with a new array every time a new field is added cool thanks for that thanks for that answer ok Kevin says in response to that same question in the code that generates them passed them and on change and then you could just do this handle change and use the same code for handle change that I use that in this project so and add them to state when you generate them okay Wow it looks like I've gotten through everything in the live chat so there there's a lot of stuff in there the majority of it was stuff we've already gone through it was just a lot of suggestions of what to do when we were building this I did get something in a language that I cannot read so let me translate this really quick because there is a question mark at the end so it's a question Google Translate is so useful okay I think the question was something about are there any Russians here so yeah so I not me I'm in the United States but yeah occasionally we do have people from Russia in here as well so I don't know if there's anybody in here right now but I think that was the question is or that was what the question was see yeah I think it I think it was basically just hello or they're Russians all right so I'm to the end of the chat I'm actually really like exhausted after all that don't livestreams takes a lot out of you all right so I'm going to push this stuff up to github before I leave today so probably within the next half an hour it'll be on get up and that way if anybody wants to take a look at it you'll have it there I'm probably not gonna do anything else to it I'm just gonna push it as is cuz it's getting pretty late here is about something for me to leave work thank you all so much yours like such a big help I know I say that at every stream but it is true for every stream and especially today this was like this was a big deal this was the one thing in this project that I was thinking like how am I gonna do this and and we did it so so it's awesome so thank you and thanks everybody for watching I will be back place at tomorrow 2 p.m. eastern time yeah and I have have a great day I'll see everybody tomorrow
