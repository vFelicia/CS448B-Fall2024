in this video i'm introducing two more algebraic laws for sets associativity and commutativity associativity is uh essentially just saying that we can regroup uh the sets that we are talking about so a intersection b intersection c that is a intersecting with the set b intersection c is equal to the set a intersection b intersection c and if you look at the definitions of uh intersection you can actually go through and figure out why this is and i'm pretty sure you'll be able to do that based on the videos that uh you've already watched and the same is true for the union uh commutativity is essentially just saying that we can um switch which side our sets are relative to the the operation so a intersection b is the same thing as b intersection a and the same thing is a union b is equal to b union a so if we look at the actual definition we have a intersection b is defined as the set containing elements x such that x is an element of a and x is an element of b and that's going to equal the set containing elements x such that x is an element of b and x is an element of a so if you just look at these uh the conditions for these for the set builder notation here it's essentially just a argument of grammar at this point so basic english will tell you that you can just switch which side that you have these on
