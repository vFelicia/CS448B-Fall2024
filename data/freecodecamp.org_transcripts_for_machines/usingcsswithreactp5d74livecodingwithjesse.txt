everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're gonna get back to doing some stuff with react components specifically we're gonna style some things so I know for the last week or so we've been working with my sequel databases and cloud storage and setting all that up which was really really cool learned a lot about that but I haven't actually done any react in a while so I'm excited to get back to it and hey everybody see some some hellos in the in the chat and just as I guess an update from yesterday so decided not to go with the basically like setting up a cname or an a record to work with that Google Cloud Storage so right now what I've been doing is trying to set up the my sequel database to work with WordPress running on now so that's what I was just doing just made an export of the database from WordPress and I was about to import it into our cloud sequel database but I think I'm gonna put that on hold and we're gonna do some styles and then I'll come back to that later on after that I'll need to set up our WordPress URL to go to the right place instead of our digitalocean droplet and then we should be all good to go with with WordPress and that'll be our production ready WordPress deployment some weird stuff going on outside my office this is just checking it out all right let me get my other screen ready and then I'll switch over the view so that you can see it all as well we will mostly be in Visual Studio code we bring this up first place will be all right cool I think everything is set up and should be working fine there we are okay so this is the main website should be pretty familiar to everyone at at this point and I was just finishing up a Pomodoro session so that's how much time I have left almost got the full session in and we're gonna go today we're gonna look at a few different pages and see like what what styling needs done and we'll we'll just kind of go from there and see what you know what we can do so here's one thing that my guest yesterday noticed so we had a kind of a guest on the show towards the end of yesterday's show named Haley and she's gonna help out with the site I'm hoping to hire her on as a contract worker so I'm gonna try to get all the details figured out today so she can start but she noticed here that we have you know this this length it's just playing a plane length right it's got the underline it's got the blue everything it it doesn't really like match right I mean it has the right font at least but it's a little weird that is just there in this case the title actually makes sense right it's we can tell it's a CV right at curriculum vitae but some of the other file names don't make any sense so we definitely should style this a bit differently and let people know what it is so this is this is what we're gonna work on first and it is going to take a bit of CSS but we're also going to potentially need to do some stuff with JavaScript as well so that's first up let me set my timer there we are and let's get to it so this is let's make it bigger so don't need that I was sort of limit plan and we don't need this right now and we don't need this all right let me know if that flan is big enough for everyone if you're just joining us for the first time I just set a Pomodoro timer and so we're gonna code for about 25 minutes when that timer goes off I'm going to go back to the live chat and I'm going to answer your questions so if you do have any questions please put them in the chat now and I will get to them in about 25 minutes alright so very simple with this component I'm gonna just describe this hopefully said even if you don't know react you'll know what's going on we all our data is stored in WordPress we're using the WordPress AP app while we're using graph QL to pull in the data and we're bringing that data in and we're basically just displaying all of it in a div on the page up here we're changing the data a little bit there's some things in there that just don't work for us right now so we're changing that data so here we're we're changing the data I think we need to I think we need to change a little bit about that curriculum vitae let's see harsh it says it's not readable and mobile art I'll make it bigger hopefully that's better and I think if I go any bigger it's going to be a little hard to to see it enough to actually do anything let me show you what the markup looks like and that way we can come up with a plan on how to edit that so I'm just going to inspect this in chrome dev tools and it's really small so I'm gonna make this bigger okay so we see here the link is contained inside this CV link element and then we just have an a tag and we have our file and the title there so this is going to be add straightforward to some of the other adjustments that we made that are already present in the component but this is what we need to target right the a tag within the CV link so let's let's try to do that so we were using regular expressions here to find what we wanted and then we're just replacing that I'm not sure that that's gonna work for us now at least not in the same way so the problem is like I can definitely target this and this will be the same across all of these pieces of data for these faculty profiles but I target this and then I still need to I need to at least get this this href right so I guess a truth all right my people out there who know a little bit more about regular expressions let me know what you think of this I'm gonna tell you what I want to do but I'm not exactly sure how to do it so let's let's work that out so here's what I'd like to do I'd like to potentially find this section basically CV link a href equals and then this first quotation mark and then grab everything up until that second quotation mark I want to grab that and then insert it into a template literal and then put that inside the CV link so I think that'll be the best way then what I'll do is just change the title of this to curriculum vitae something like that and so everybody will have a link that just says curriculum vitae so it'll all be standard will style the link to so they know like there won't be a million different you know names for each professors curriculum vitae so no matter what the file name is that they upload it'll say the same thing but I do still need to know what this with this href is pointing to so let's see I'm gonna see what you all are saying about this right now michael says can't you do CB link first child John says find CV link and change it to html5 details element will probably be the only of this type and style the tag a tag under details I'm not necessarily worried about the styling because that's going to be I can just style the the CV link directly would I basically I need somehow to grab this value inside the href if I can get this whoops if I can get this value then I'm fine but I just need a way to get this value only this value in it the only information that I'll have across all the pieces of content that we'll have for faculty profiles is this CV link so I need to grab the HR value inside the a inside the CV link if this was back in my jQuery days this would be easy but it's not and essentially remember we're not dealing with like the Dom here at this point this is just a string coming through so we're still dealing with this content as a string right it gets set as you know HTML here but we can't use like normal at least if we're going to make the change before it actually hits the page we can't actually I just had an idea okay so we can't I really hate to do this because it's react but alright here's an alternate plan what if we just let the data go to into the Dom as is then afterwards so like I don't know after the components mounts or whatever then we do some stuff to manipulate it while it's in the Dom would that be easier could we just go in at that point find the a SAG within the CV link element and then just change the text and would that mess up reiax ability to track what's going on would that also mess up our serverside rendering would the serverside rendering be off from what's on the clientside okay so our should say and that would work Nikki's saying you just want to do it in component did him out okay all right well let's we can try it I think for me at least because I'm not an expert at all in regular expressions I think it might be easier to try the second way but I'm still open to the first way all right so let's let's see let's assume I guess we can we can do some work here in the console actually so let's go in here the console is clear all this out it's a document elements a tag name and then let's say see the is a CV link is that what it was let's see if we can grab it yep so we have CV link we can get that if you have our CV link and we have our inner HTML in our inner text yes all right how about this the shudders you know text equals no it didn't it didn't actually change it shoot I need to get more space here let's let's open this up all right so I can change it here but it doesn't actually update in the dawn see okay harsh it says it won't mess up as that part is not frequently rerendered okay all right cool awesome Michael I think your ear I think you get the right idea that CV link let's try this oops what was I thinking why don't I do this yeah yes okay that's what we need all right cool but it's not it actually changed everything in there okay so this is not exactly what we want let's see let's look at this structure a little bit more text content I think that's what might work better out of HTML out of it and it says hmm it looks like there's a lot that we we kid tried it's argued here let's try something else then let's refresh the page and try something else so it looks like we can we could try text content or we could try outer text I'd rather not have to mess with the a tag at all right so let's refresh so want to get the original the original stuff back here we'll inspect this again and then all right so let's check it out instead of inner text what was I I say we were gonna do it was a text content okay let's see if this works it equals it still takes a lot okay we'll have to get hard saying use query selector Michael's saying could we try CV links here yeah let's let's try that so let's say see what we get if we put a zero in here undefined okay you know all right so Harshit that's a great idea so hard saying we could do document dot query selector and then do CV link a shoot it's not working oh no wonder it's not working I just took it out of the page all right now let's try one more time CV link a yes okay so we have CV like a and let's try to go what was it inner text let's try to change that inner text yes and does this work it does we're getting the right nice alright so that's what we need to use so let's copy that and let's go over here and let's add a component it mounts and let's try to do is like a query selector equals you see me we'll save you CV see if that works we'll save it so this is let this be a lesson to everyone my my mistake so when you don't take the time to learn how to select things in Dom with vanilla JavaScript plain JavaScript and you just rely on jQuery all the time you don't remember all of these selectors so you all were giving me the names right luckily I also had dev tools that was Auto completing stuff for me so I could see what it was but if we were working with jQuery I would know automatically how to do that and I would have done it in you know a minute it would've been easy right so that's awesome if I always get to work with jQuery but I don't in fact I rarely use jQuery at all anymore and I know how to do a lot with react but when it comes to stuff like this I don't have that background knowledge of of it I assume it's possible but I always have to look it up so it slows me down so I appreciate all the help there but starting out sometimes you for me at least I I know like I would look at stuff like this and say it's so much easier to do a jQuery I'm just gonna use jQuery right and I never took the time to learn that so there's value in taking the time to learn that like this is always going to work but the jQuery will only work if you're using jQuery right and you there's not really a guarantee that you're always going to have that of so just just a note if you're thinking like I did that this is just way too much typing to do something that you don't have to type as much to jQuery there's definitely a time for this alright so I know enough about that let's see if it actually works refresh okay re it does work there's a little flash which is not is not unexpected there's a small flash of the original content so I'll say this at this point essentially we've done what we wanted to do with that I don't like that there's a little flash it's not the end of the world but that's where I think that the regular expression solution that I talked about first would probably be the better solution because we would never get that flash of content so I guess what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do this right now and that way for those of you who aren't quite familiar with git and get up this might be helpful to you we will go to see that yeah we're gonna go here and I'm gonna open up an issue right and that way this will be good for two reasons one I won't forget about it but then also this is going to be there for anyone that would like to tackle this issue and will say this jeez all right so we're just gonna leave a little a little issue right so if anybody wants to try to tackle it and they're good with regular expressions they can try to you know fix that I shouldn't say fix it but fix it in what I think will be a better way right they'll solve that problem in a better way so all right so right now and the faculty j/s components this is probably hard to see as a man so right now in the faculty jazz component this text is changed components it mouths there we go so that's just a really basic amount of info it does say what what component to look in so I think this would be OK for now potentially I could add some screenshots and things like that I'm not since I'm streaming right now but I mean the more information you can add to an issue the more it would help someone who wants to actually solve that issue and we can give it a label as well and we can say help wants it and now everyone will know hey like this is up for grabs let's submit this issue okay and you know maybe someone's interested maybe someone's not let me check my time and before we go on all right about two minutes this is enough time to do some basic CSS stuff just to see like what we'd want to do so when we're doing CSS I think it's always a great idea to do your initial stuff in the end F tools so let me get rid of my console area here and I'm gonna push this out so we have as much space as we can because really what I want to get to is is this portion here so on this a tag that's what we're gonna focus our Styles so what we want to do is get rid of that line so we're gonna do textdecorationnone okay right and that just got rid of that line for us and I definitely want the color to be something different so we're gonna change that color and I I want it to be the same color that we've been using for links elsewhere and let me let me find where we have that color and do we not have it anywhere in this place I thought we'd have it somewhere all right let me open up a new a new little window here so I can find where that color is since I can't remember what the the hex code is pretty sure that we have it here oh there it was I skipped over it so this is the color we've been using for links let's inspect grab the hex code there we go I knew we were using something that would be difficult to remember so we did change it up a little bit use the hsla instead of just a normal hex color color there we go so that's much cleaner I think to just have it there because it's a different color you know it may invite users to click if we wanted it to stand out more if we thought maybe that was really like important we could make maybe the font weight a bit bigger we could even think about making it a button but I mean the words view CV seemed to invite a click right so in general I is for something like this this is not really an action that I want users to take I'd rather make it subtle but clear if I really really wanted users to click on that CV I would probably make it a button and I would make it stand out so that as soon as you see that page like you that button is right there so I think this will be okay my timer did just go up so I'm going to take a short break we do a five minute break and then we'll come back and we'll transfer those Styles over into probably a CSS file for this particular component and I'll explain why we're going to do it like that when we when we come back for our second Pomodoro session so right now I'm going to scroll up to the top of the chat try to answer as many questions as I can in this fiveminute period I'm also going to very quickly look at my messages and make sure that there's nothing workrelated all right it doesn't look like it I did I just got a charge from Google services for four dollars and 23 cents I wonder if that was from yesterday when when I did all that stuff I don't know for sure if it's from from yesterday but it's possibly a light in space says greetings from Germany hey how's it going Oh a zekiel says free code camp has been updated and its new oh I didn't let's check that out free code camp dot org I have not seen the new stuff signin wait really didn't you used to be able to do this with github if you create signin you're gonna click here to add an email address to your account sign ok yep yep yep submit yay go to the coding curriculum yeah let's learn about that Wow alright sorry I'm hijacking this this fiveminute session here but I think this is amazing okay so new stuff on free code camp a thousand coding challenges more than a thousand new coding challenges amazing that's really I I might have started doing coding challenges again I mean just for fun just to check it out so uh the information security stuff testing really cool new certifications so these are in addition to the old ones we have there six new certifications Wow okay so you can skip the coding challenges and just do the project if you're able to complete the project that you can get the certification that's cool alright cool they're test Suites for the projects very cool coding interview prep challenges that that could be very useful very cool enhanced privacy I'm not that worried about the privacy just assume I have no privacy on the internet but if you're worried about that that's cool fully customizable portfolio pages that's cool oh that's really cool so the free code camp portfolio pages were kind of you really couldn't do much with them before note the platform another for Athena learned free code camp org very cool all right let's check that up as you type search very cool if you've watched what we've done with search before you know I'm a fan of the as you type search password the signin you y'all know I'm also a big fan of the password the signin as well that's cool new welcome dashboard awesome really cool yeah for sure let's give that a what this is a separate account from the throw things it over your town I know I know I'm pretty sure I already have this account too right I do yes awesome all right cool alright so here's the new some of the curriculum the new stuff I'm not gonna go through all of it but just to see like what we have here cool got some react stuff Redux dative is AP is security and the coding prep stuff really cool new stuff like CSS grid that's cool that this is really cool what is this introduction go to the first lesson really cool that's awesome Wow there are a lot of coding project all right challenges you can see I haven't got any of my certificates yet zero out of six but anyway that's that's cool hopefully that that was helpful for you all I was just really excited so you know what let me let me needs to reset that and answer some questions since I said I was going to do five minutes of questions who aim high seer yeah I I haven't seen you here in a long time I was it going how's the the job going you don't have to tell me on the chat if you don't want to but send me a DM or something and let me know I'm interested to see how it's to know what's you know what's going on with that Dutchess is here good morning thanks for watching harsh it only has two days left for the summer holidays so will you have you have a lot less time then after the holidays harsh it and Ezekiel says this is the best day ever in my life is that because the new freakout cam stuff came out lucifer says hi hey how's it going Luke kesh says can anyone explain how to set up a basic react app with an express server project without something like create react app or gas fee I want to do that on cloud base I des like glitch is intended the truth dive I don't know that I've ever setup react without using something like next or create react app I think I use Gatsby once so yeah I don't I'm not the person to talk to about that just because I always I never really had a use case where it would be valuable for me to do it like that but I'm I'm sure you know probably some of the other people with a chat have done it like that I like to asked if the this method that we ended up going with is more reliable than the regular expression I don't know about reliable to be honest with you I would think the method that we used is probably less reliable I mean they're they're both it's probably gonna work but the fact that there's a delay between like the Dom loads the user actually sees this I don't know that makes me a little bit nervous so I think for this use case either one would work but I would definitely feel more comfortable with a regular expression way of doing it but sometimes it's just like you make it work and then if you have time like you can go back and do it but on a project this big it just doesn't make sense for me to spend a ton of time on small details like this at least not before launch like after launch I couldn't go like work out all these details but if I try to do all the details now like the site won't launch for you know months and months Michael says I didn't realize you could use multiple tags in query selector I usually cascade them I didn't realize you could either but that's really really helpful I'm going to take a drink before we start our next session okay I didn't get through everything in the chat so I will have to pick up where I left off and when we come back but now let's do some CSS and where's my timer there we go let's set this we'll probably just do one more Pomodoro session and then I got to get back to spending the rest I have so much to do today actually if you excuse me for a second let me just vent for a second on air so I'm giving a talk this weekend at Pittsburg tech fest on basically setting up what we've been doing here for the last few months react with WordPress as the content management system using graph QL I wanted to do videos so that I could set tell people at my talk like if you want to know more in depth check out the videos because I think I only have a half an hour so obviously I'm not gonna go stepbystep through this whole thing I didn't haven't made the videos yet like well obviously we've done it on the live stream but I'm not gonna tell people like hey go watch on a 100 plus hours of the live stream just for this project so I need to work on that I have a little bit of work to do for client like realistically it'll probably take me 15 minutes to do the client work but it's still like it's something else on my mind that has to be done by tomorrow at in tomorrow morning and then I sell both this work right for this site so there's still data that needs to be brought over both to the database and to the google cloud storage bucket so a lot I haven't done any work out today which may not seem like a big deal to you but for like mental health purposes if I don't get workouts in for a few days in a row like I will definitely feel depressed so while I'm still feeling upbeat I need to get that workout in if I wait til tomorrow I'm afraid like I will just not be up for it and it'll probably be a downward spiral for a few days so alright then over just wanted to share that with you all let's get back to this all right so I like this let's take this now which why did I do that let's grab this and I'm going to copy this not really that much to type out but I'm not gonna remember that to type it out and let's go over here and see first of all do we have styles yes we do we have a faculty CSS file that we can use and that's awesome so let's put it in there and as we're putting that in there I'm gonna explain why we're using this instead of styles inside of our component which we've done on some other components so in within our project we have a static folder and styles and then there that's where all our CSS files are okay so let's go down yeah I'm just gonna put this down here and we'll go see the link a and then we'll paste those in save it and let's refresh and make sure that it'll work yep there we go our styles are there and we can verify here yep the styles are there it's coming from our faculty CSS file great here's what we did it like that the the content that we're bringing in that we want to style right we're bringing it in from WordPress as a string and then we're adding it to the Dom here right so there's no there are no elements present within this component as it is now where I could just put a style on there like in line or where I could add a class to to let's say if I did all the Styles up here is like a JavaScript object you know I couldn't add that as we've done in other components right because those essentially like those elements that are ending up on the page don't even exist at that point so what we end up having to do then is kind of do it the oldfashioned way where we put in this this head tag here with a link to our CSS file as we move forward and clean up this data and pull it in as I really want to do it you know the best way that I know how we can phase this out and we can start putting all our Styles inside our component either as inline Styles or as JavaScript object all right then everything can be truly like modular right and reusable we can get rid of the CSS files for now of posts now that we have in WordPress of custom posts which I've shown you all before it's just it's too much so that's why we're doing it this way if if I could I would do it differently but there's not really anything wrong with doing it like this it does just get to be a bit of a mess we have so many different CSS files for a different component some components we have styles going on in three different ways we have inline styles in the component we have styles in a JavaScript object in a component and then we have styles in a CSS file that gets pulled into the unit so we don't have a lot of consistency in our CSS right now but that's that's a known issue it's it's what we have to work out now it's kind of like an inbetween step to get this thing running but eventually we will this will be in better shape you know once we have more time but right now a lot of people are expecting this site to launch so in terms of what the user will see they'll never know the difference when we switch all this over it'll be the same for them so it's only going to be from the standpoint of developers and how easy it is to figure out what's going on and and you know contribute edit the files that'll be a lot nicer once everything is you know organized properly and in terms of you know all the data like how we're pulling it in okay so let's move on you check the time yeah let's move on we'll do a quick scan at this page and just say look over here I think it looks I mean the rest of this page looks alright there's nothing that stands out in ink when it comes to styles there's always more you could probably do but right now I'm not looking for that I'm looking for is there something that looks really weird on this page that looks maybe broken or something like that so from that point of view I don't see anything right so let's go let's see let's just check page we'll just go down through and check some pages just really quickly I mean look broken actually I did see something so let's go to device and let's try this pixel to see what it looks like this is not good all right so we have this split here so I noticed this yesterday when I was looking at this on a phone so let's try that out we try to fix that and see wow that's just hanging out there right so it's we have an h2 tag then an image and then right below that we just we just have the text so the image is actually within the h2 that's a little odd you usually don't see that but that's what we have to work with right now so ideally what we want to do is if we can keep the markup exactly the same and just use CSS that's ideal that takes the least amount of time for us if we have to adjust the markup we want to do that within the component using regular expressions or like we just did you know with a bit of JavaScript because that saves us from having to manually edit it if both of those things are impossible which we haven't really come across that yet but if they were impossible that would mean we'd have to go back manually edit all that stuff in a bunch of places you don't want to have to do that so let's try the first thing CSS let's see what we can do so we're gonna have to put the styles on the h2 tag itself and I'm gonna make this bigger since you know we're dealing with this small viewport so we can make this a lot bigger we already have our h2 here so already putting some Styles on here in the department dot CSS file so let's see just wrap I'm not really sure what's it what to do here word wrap all right so we have break word that looks terrible as well so I'm not I'm not gonna go with that maybe let's put something on this image how about that let's see wow it has inline Styles on it already so that's getting pulled in floatright let me know what your thoughts are on on this image but here's what I'm thinking what if we go with left and let's do let's take out this height 100% take out the height now is this gonna I want to see how this looks up here actually I know this that's way too big great we don't want don't want it that big all right how about let's refresh the page reset it and let's go with we on the image you may just need to go with a media clear here Oh John Hanson is saying whitespacenowrap John is he's also saying how does that even happen image nested in an h2 should not even render yeah but this is the markup that we've inherited so we got to work with it at least for a little while alright so let's try I'll get rid of that let's see what John said whitespacenowrap and let's go back to this maybe I need to put that on the h2 oh not Lucas just try a fixed height with auto width okay you try that Nicki says doesn't make it so that CSS isn't global and only for that page yeah yeah so each page has its own CSS file all right so that's not it's not gonna work at least not like as is but let's go down to this image and see if we can mmmhmm let me see some of the other things I mean it's resized and soon all right let's let's reset again and alright let's assume to make this simpler let's assume that we're going to use a media query so we only have to deal with the mobile size so let's figure out where that query needs to be so we'll figure out exactly where this starts looking really weird right here so let's make that media query at about 500 pixels just to make it a nice even number so that we can remember so at about 500 pixels then we're going to do this we're gonna get rid of the float and let's go with cities are our let's go with eight pixels Auto actually I don't really like that being centered let's let's get rid of the margin and margin Auto and let's just go with the margin of eight pixels all around so I like now you know what I don't even like that let's go with the margin of eight and zero all right that looks a lot better like and by better I don't mean ideal right not perfect but it doesn't look like it's broken now alright so basically here's what we've done and this is only gonna apply when it's under 500 pixels right because let's just see like this is what it would look like when it's over not terrible but it definitely doesn't look as good we have all this white space right that's not that's not better than what we had before where you had a nice wrapping effect so for under 500 pixels we're going to get rid of the float we're gonna add a margin of 8 pixels top and bottom right because we need a little bit of that space here up at the top it's fine we already have some space but I'm putting the 8 there just in case you know if if let's say I come back in and do different things with this facing I don't have to worry about it being too close so but we do want at least 8 pixels of space between here you know potentially even more you know that still might be a little close but we got our mounting this is on a smaller screen so we don't want to have a ton of space that's going to increase the amount of scroll and then we set it to display block right that's what finally kind of pushed this down from where it was so let's put this now in our department dot CSS file and we're going to have to use important because this is on the element hopefully this alert that's on the element alright let's see if it works yeah so we need to be able to override these inline Styles right that are right there coming through like from the data that we're pulling in alright so let's find our toys are static static static Department don't see it so we are using Department dot CSS I guess we'll just continue to use that technically this isn't a department page but let's let's do it and let's go with inch this is h2 yeah I guess I'm okay with this it's we'll put this on the h2 image yeah so this will only work on images that are in an h2 tag which is fine I'm hoping that that's a rare occurrence so let's go h2 image forgot I'm not using sass all right we got to do the media query first at media and media screen and max with this is 500 reset 500 pixels what did i do what did I mess up nothing right this works and whoops and then we need to say h2 image we'll add that in there and we also need to do floats what we want to do float none yeah none let's just verify that that works yep so we're gonna do floats none and we're gonna put important on there we don't normally want to use important right so in this case though we have to because the the markup is really forcing us to because I'm not going to be able to override inline styles without using that I'm just going to go ahead and throw it on each one of these it might not be necessary on everyone but since we're already using it there's not really that much value in messing around and and potentially not having ourselves work so let's see if this works refresh okay awesome so that works we can see these styles are being overridden but the real test is was this work yep that works awesome so you can see we don't have all that whitespace once again probably not how I would make this page if I was doing it from scratch but now it won't look broken and not only that hopefully every other page that's using that CSS file that has an image inside an h2 tag will now be fixed all right cool let me check my time three more minutes let's see if we can find something to squeeze in here in there's three minutes also I'd like to see like are we having similar issues Wow so this is going float respect that's not a great image like I I normally like the image of the San Damiano crucifix like we used it in the catechol Institute website that was project one and it looked amazing but with this background color it doesn't stand out so I'm definitely gonna at some point probably try to replace that image but for now that's the image that we have so this is an image within an h1 tag Wow okay and it is using Department CSS so let's let's do the same thing that we just did but let's also add in h1 tags so within here let's just go with each one image and h2 image are gonna have the same same styling we'll see that will do a refresh and we'll see okay that's on this side and then but when it gets bigger we still have the effect that we want all right great I think that looks better you know not perfect but much better than having it flow to the right all right awesome we've got about a minute left not really confident I can get anything else done in a minute but let's see new info coming soon employment HR wonderful all right that page actually looks like there's no change needed faculty opening nope and that page doesn't work I have a list of all the pages that don't work so I am aware of them all academics undergraduate this page yeah this face is actually okay we can go did we already check these out we did some styling work on these pages this is kind of weird so we have different font with our font font weights I mean they're different font weights going on a lot of different font weights and sizes happening here so it could probably use some cleanup at the very least if like this text we're just all the same I think that would be better but that'll be I have to save that for a different time this will end up being an easy fix though but my timer is running out I am curious to see why it's doing this mmm okay so these have some inline styles that are overriding what we have here so really if we just went with you know something like using important for the styles that are likely already there those P tags then I think that that would work so for instance we could just important here and this should override it right so now we have the proper line height and then I'm not sure where yeah so the font should be Roboto font family but that's all the way on main so we're bought a saying say San serif should be important to interesting but that's not hmm yeah so we may have to go ahead on the P tags and put in font family Roboto important right that would fix it see so not not really a difficult fix here so and this is a major CSS but like really this is something that could probably be used like across the board this is standard for P tags so they may want to make some sort of global style so we don't repeat it all over the place I kind of think that font is a little small I mean it's 18 pixels but maybe it's just my screen okay now I'm gonna go back to the live chat and answer as much as I can also let's let's go ahead and push these changes to github get status so we can see we've changed faculty a Dodge is our department dot CSS and faculty dot CSS so let's do a git add and yarn CM let's do a feature and let's just say styles for CV link and images and header tags heading okay that works no breaking changes it does not affect open issues it's going to run all the linting all the Auto formatting all the tests and then it will commit after that assuming everything passes all right so while that's doing its thing I will answer some questions and then I'll make sure that I push this up to github so that you all can check this out if you want oh that was fast awesome so now I just do get push and everything is now available on github well now it is I'm just trying to find where I left off okay let's see now I should ask can anyone help make an awesome card component for the UI library that I am working on alright so let her should know how I should I would love to help you make a card component but I don't think I'll have time for sure not this week or weekend so I guess it depends on how soon you want it done but if I can I'll try to help John says have you not been using therefore your CSS colors no I haven't I haven't I really I should I should use CSS variables Nietzsche says did the new curriculum finally launch nice yeah it looks like it John says it can be helpful if the link text that isn't an obvious link to load with a subtle but obvious animation like color scale translator transform when the element comes as well yet now I don't have it up there yeah you're right you know maybe it might not be a bad idea for all links to I don't know if this is exactly what you're talking about but now that you said that it kind of makes me think you know potentially maybe there should be some sort of animation on hover for a link other than just the cursor you know the typical course or pointer I would want it to be subtle something just like a very slight shift in in color maybe just in the maybe a little lighter or a little darker nothing nothing too crazy that Duchess is this is really in comment to someone else in the chat Matt duchesses only game minecraft once in a while I just stood out to me cuz I really like Minecraft I got my my oldest son into it actually all my kids except for the baby or into Minecraft its they love it even like my threeyearold wants to play Minecraft he gets him so stuck in in like holes and needs help to get out but he likes to run around and and like dig get skeletons and stuff but anyway I don't know anybody else a Minecraft fan out there like you can you spend a lot of time in Minecraft and just get lost in that that world but uh I think it's a fun game Aniki says new livestream idea Jesse gets free code camp certifications actually that would be fun that would be really so if it ever happens that I can't livestream my actual work projects like I don't know if it happens he it probably won't happen here but like let's say I have to get it done another job for whatever reason and I can't then maybe that would be a great idea for a stream to do like all the free code camp projects live that would be fun although like I already have so many side project ideas to do as well so I could definitely work on those too Nicola ass is this website only frontend no so we're doing everything for it for this particular stream today we were just working with frontend stuff but in previous streams and in future streams you know we were working with backend which is node but we also have WordPress setup and we build PHP plugin for that and got cloud sequel database cloud storage like we're working on a lot of a lot of stuff so kind of a larger project and so I think there's there's something for everyone in this process a Nietzsche says is there a reason that you import that stylesheet and the head tag instead of just importing the CSS file is that an XJS thing or is it serverside rendering thing to be honest with you I don't remember why we did it that way I just vaguely remember that we had to do it that way and that I did try to do it a different way but I really can't recall I mean it's probably on a stream but I don't remember when that that happened so yeah I really don't remember what it could be that I could do it another way and then I just didn't figure that way out and this one worked so I went with it but I can't remember this scrub scrub I don't know how to pronounce skru BYZ says no love for flexbox and that was probably when we were doing the image thing so I like flexbox but we just were having to deal with floats already set like we brought this content over from an older system and that's how how they were doing it so we're just kind of dealing with what we have let's see Aniki says the what frequency in a code review of that stuff you have to work with would be off the charts yeah I'm like I'm so used to it it doesn't really surprise me that much so when I see this but it's it is pretty wild though I mean it keeps it fun like surprising like it's really it's cool like like wow I've never seen that before I mean that's that's kind of fun that I've been doing this for years and years and it's like I still see stuff in websites that I've never seen that in terms of the markup like haven't seen that before that's cool it's just amazing what will actually work in a browser you know like you can you can do crazy stuff with a markup and it still actually renders michael creo says do you run lighthouse audits on your sites i was thinking about accessibility yeah I recently ran an audit on on this site that we're working on and I actually got a decent accessibility score so that's going to be something that we will be working on it may be I'm not exactly sure if it'll be pre or post launch when we do a lot with that because realistically like even this site as is is a huge improvement over the the current web site so I think it's even if we don't have perfect accessibility score it's still gonna be more accessible I want to double check that to verify but I'm pretty sure it is still be more accessible so I think as an incremental step launching this would be good and then we can try to work towards being like fully accessible so but it is coming it's something that is definitely on my mind and I think it's important so that I not I hope hopefully would love to do work on that during a stream go through the whole process of using lighthouse I don't know if everybody knows what it is or how to use it but it might be cool to do a whole stream just on going lighthouse and trying to fix all the stuff that can get our scores up thanks for bringing that up Jeff says I have a minecraft server running at home cool med that just says cool I fall off in love a lot then log like I hate that I mean you get your character they all build up and you have the sweet armor and stuff and like no enemies can take you out and then you just mess up and fall in love at once and you're done anyway oh cool you know what I've never tried to do anything with servers like playing online with servers on minecraft I always because my kids are playing it I was like I'm just gonna let you play this offline and it'll be safe but maybe like if I'm supervising I could get try that out because that's a whole like part of the game that seems really cool that I've never experienced without my minecraft by the way Zuber says hi i disconnected from your Shing for a while is this still university project any plans for starting a new project from beginning then oh yeah we definitely will this is so the university project we for sure have have new projects coming up so it will start one from beginning to end here I can't tell you for sure when that will happen but it will definitely happen I'm sure my bosses have lots of stuff lined up for me after I launched this site mate it may seek says can you show what you did already create the website yeah you know what let me let me show you this site but then also so this I'll just show you the home page there's likes way too much to show the whole site but I can give you the link as well so I'm gonna type that into the live chat here now okay so I just put the link in the live chat if anybody would like to go to the site check it out you'll feel free let me know if you've got any ideas for making it better or if you if you see something that's like for sure broken please let me know anyway but you know just kind of really briefly here's the home page you know one thing I was thinking about for accessibility is I don't really know if this text is readable enough like for a person with like good vision it's okay but if somebody doesn't have great vision I'm not really sure like I I'm thinking about maybe doing something I mean I like this image and yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do about that but that's something I'm not I've been thinking about lately you know about maybe doing something with it John Hanson says mistakes in HDL markup get rendered in the Dom only because the dome sees the mistakes and bandages them on the fly not like PHP that's cool I mean it's I know it's good and bad right it could it can encourage people to write their markup in ways that aren't the best you can write markup in ways that are let's say entirely unaccessible to screen readers and things like that and it'll still work and so unless people get away with that but at the same time it makes it really easy to build websites even if they're not great websites you can so I don't know I guess their pros and cons to that duchesses yeah I wanted to see accessibility and lighthouse I heard of it but haven't used it yeah it's really cool I'll definitely I'll try to do stream on that soon then this is I yeah it's it's awesome so I definitely want to kind of show it to you all Anna says hi it's my first time here and I don't understand why we left image in h1 and h2 is it because you're working on an old project and you are afraid that initial styling would crash well kind of right so it is an old project but what we did is we brought over all this markup from one database and transferred it to a new one so that same pattern of image tags being used inside heading tags is used in a lot of places most likely so trying to find all those places and change the markup in every place would be really difficult it would timeconsuming so that's why we're just trying to work with it as is I do have a plan to go through and change those eventually but right now I just need to get it looking good on a screen so that we can launch it and then hopefully I can have some student workers interns contract workers go through all that data and clean it up so that we don't have weird stuff like that going on but that's definitely a legit question you normally would not want to leave the image in the h1 tag although like it renders not really the best markup right but anyway good good question and also let me know if it's an ax or onna or I don't want to mispronounce your name so let me know what you prefer Chris says how is CSS grid coming along for me personally I haven't really been able to do much with it I haven't had time to to work with it Aniki says you can outrun a lighthouse check on a page directly from the chrome dev tools it's inside the audits head yeah yeah it's it's awesome it's so easy to run it Oh Jeff says this is for Minecraft again but this stream has gotten hijacked by minecraft so Jeff says you can set up a server using docker and then let them connect to it locally that's your genius you are a minecraft genius that's an awesome idea I'm gonna have to check that out like I literally have like old pcs just sitting around not doing anything I could like have a server running locally with docker like all the time and that's that's cool I love that idea thank you that doesn't says it's good you monitor your kids on there I played on servers with some creepers so I play on a kidfriendly one okay cool that's good to know that I'm not just being paranoid I like I just assume anything that's multiplayer online it potentially there's a way for inappropriate stuff to be done or said or whatever on there so that's why I just never let let my kids try that so so I guess that is that is in fact the case unfortunately Michael Chris has set up a Raspberry Pi as as a sir that would be cool that'd be really cool Ezekiel says they have a question sure what's your question I'm not sure so Ezekiel you never put your questions so let me know what it is if I in the stream before you can give me the question Senate DME on Twitter or on some social media site and I'll answer it and that just said site is looking good thank you thank you I appreciate it Chris says I have 2050 and 2070 vision and the text looks fine to me however I am on a 32 inch TV ok cool out you know maybe I'll just we'll see maybe I'm worrying about it like prematurely you know I haven't gotten any like complaints about it so yeah maybe it's not it's not about Jeff says I can see if I can find a docker file for you yeah that would be awesome yeah if you could that would I would really appreciate that primal fear says keep up the good work thank you I appreciate that Phoenix says I love the grid and I have a slight crush on flesh that's awesome I love that the way you expressed that oh cool this is John and Nikki both are saying that great and flexbox can be used together that's really cool all right I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat and wow the stream is pretty decently long we're over an hour and a half now so I'm really really hungry I'd love to get some lunch right now and I don't know this was a fun stream let me know if you like these streams where we kind of do some more like basic CSS stuff it's definitely fun for me because usually everything I try works eventually and so anyway I had a good time with some art tomorrow's Friday I'll do my best to stream tomorrow although like as I said I have a lot to do before my talk on Saturday if anybody is in Pittsburgh and I don't know if they're still selling tickets to Pittsburgh tech fest but if they are check it out come see me and if you're gonna be there like find me and introduce yourself I'd love to meet meet you all in person so maybe I stream tomorrow maybe not if I don't sing tomorrow then and probably won't see you until Monday but until next time have a wonderful day and work weekend
