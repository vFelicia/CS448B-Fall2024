hey everybody its Jesse and it's we're going to start out today doing a going over a pool request and I was just testing it out so I've gotten pretty much nothing done since yesterday so we're gonna start right where we left off that so yesterday after I ended I just answer some emails talk to my boss a little bit and then left this morning I bet I've been in meetings all day so there actually have been interviewing someone for web developer position so we did an interview like a panel interview and then I just got back from doing a technical interview it was kind of cool because we actually used some free code camp challenges for the technical interview so I thought that was kind of fun and I've heard that other people do that as well so I don't know if it's a widespread thing but hey you know if you go through the free code camp challenges then you got a shot at maybe seeing it in an interview so might help you out also I got a comment on one of my videos saying that I should talk less and code more and I was actually thinking the same thing yesterday afternoon so I'm gonna try to do that I can't guarantee anything because as as you all know from watching a I do tend to talk so I'm gonna try to talk when I need to to explain what's going on in the code and then of course to answer questions but other than that I am going to try to do more code I let's see was I gonna say oh okay I do some silent streams on my own channel occasionally so if you really would rather just see the code and not worry about my commentary on the code check out those streams I don't really schedule them too far in advance I just kind of do it whenever I have some time here and there throughout the day so the best way to hear about them I usually tweet about them so if you follow me on Twitter you'll probably see the tweet or if you subscribe to my channel you'll get an alert but those are just like I said I don't schedule them it'll just happen and I'll do it until usually for like an hour or so until something comes up at work and I can't do it anymore alright so I'm gonna say hi to everyone in the live chat and I have some have some questions already a question have you ever had a female boss yeah I have so my my immediate supervisor is a male and then the director of my department and the executive director of my department are both women and I've worked for four women before so not not really a big deal to me okay also this video is going to be shorter than normal so I told you yesterday that I kept trying to go see this guy's computer and about an issue he's having with a website I made and it's it's on campus here and I I haven't been able to get a time it's the one that I thought possibly might be using Internet Explorer 9 so I got an email back from him saying that he'll be there around 4 p.m. so I'm not missing this opportunity I have to know what is really going on with this website he's saying he gets a blank screen and nothing happens at all which is crazy so I want to know so I definitely am gonna shoot for like being over around like 330 Eastern Time so maybe about an hour long stream I could probably go a little bit longer than that and still make it there but I don't want to take any chances alright so let me show you what's what's going on here I'm working on this error message right now so I have let's see this sidebar item J s is giving me an error no duplicate props allowed and I got this because if you notice these are now the same color which is awesome so that was a a pool request that I got from let me show you the pool request where do I have it okay so here's the pool request and alright so there's a one in the name so let me I think I I have a message on Twitter from this person as well so okay soul a late want I'm not I'm not really sure I pronounce it but sent this pool request so if you're watching let me know how to pronounce your name cuz I don't wanna get it wrong so basically as it says it customized the hover event okay so it just ended up using if you remember yesterday we were Sebastian was saying it's the the list item that needs to get the the hover but the list item was being created by the I think it was the menu item component yeah the menu item component so we couldn't access it directly so now let's just switch to using the menu item directly and it seems like everything works the same as it did before so that's not exactly how its said to do this side drawer and the documentation but it works so I think I'm gonna pull it in but before I pull it in I tested it and I got that error so I just want to work on that error first and then pull this in to the master branch and then we can continue on with our layout for everybody that's new joining I want to explain so if you're joining from Twitter I had said I'm using material UI and materialized CSS which may be a little bit confusing so we're using material UI and all the nice react components that it has but when there's a feature that it doesn't have that I like from materialized then I'm gonna pull that in so we've pulled in the column classes already and we're probably gonna pull in some other things like I like how they they do they're responsive font so we'll probably pull that in and we'll as we go along so we're gonna use a blend of the two and I have started the and rock server so let me I'm gonna paste that link in for you all so you can follow along and in case you can't see the live chat right now for some reason here is the link this one here I mean this one would work too I guess but this one's HTTPS which is better so I guess so why not alright so the links in the chat now so here we go you can see getting some activity there so let me know if anything goes wrong with that I won't be watching this as I code so if if it quits working please let me know and let's check out that error so it did say it was on line line 24 of the sidebar item which is right here so that's not actually before I let me open this back up if you remember I think yesterday we were having the problem where when I switch branches the code wasn't automatically changing which I'm almost positive that it did automatically change before but for some reason it's not so I'm gonna open that back up again just to see there we go now this makes a lot more sense okay so on line 24 we have this hover color okay so we see the hover colors here is red and the hover color down here is a different color so let's take out this hover color and that should fix the air because you know that that makes sense you shouldn't have to props that have the same name because that's confusing all right cool air is fixed there we go we still have these hairs which I don't wear these air is coming from it's where I get these errors all the time in production or in development but not in production so not worried about them right now so now that that works let's commit that and then merge this branch into the master branch so I am going to explain every time I do something on get our in the command line I'm gonna explain that for everyone who's not familiar with it so for those of you who are familiar with it if it's kind of annoying that I keep explaining this and you all know that I'm sorry but I'm gonna gonna keep doing it because I think it's better to explain it for the people that don't know it then than to not because otherwise they'll be really lost so we're gonna do git status just to doublecheck that we've only changed the component that we meant to change and we have in fact only changed that component and then we're gonna get commit a.m. and that the a means we're gonna add everything and we're going to include the message right in our command so it'll say remove remove duplicate props all right awesome and I'm going to merge this now so I've already merged master into that the other branch and I did the test there so maybe there's a better way to do it but I like to do it like that because that way if if something there's some weird errors and it breaks a lot of stuff when I merge it it's only broken that one branch and I haven't messed up master so then it's just easier to switch right back to master instead of having to worry about trying to roll back you know to a different version of it and then it's great because once you have it right and it's everything's fixed then you just switch over to master emerge and everything works so let's do that so we're gonna go get merge so when you merge you go to the branch that you want to merge the other branch into so I'm in master because I want to merge something into master I'm sure there's other ways to do it as well but this is the way I always do it and I'm gonna say what branch I want to merge into my current branch and in this case I want to merge what did I call that thinks the only Oberon all right awesome so you could see we had obviously no conflicts because that branch had already merged with master before or had master merge into it before so now we'll have double check make sure everything's working yes it is working and I'm gonna push this so we'll see if you've never seen how for requests works basically you you can see the merge completed right there pretty much realtime if I go get push origin master to push it out to get up now it's pushed there and I can't remember if it refreshes automatically or if I have to refresh the page I can't remember let me try a page refresh basically what should happen is it should say merged yep there we go it says merge so I guess you have not sure if you have to wait for the Refresh for some reason I thought I'd seen it just happen automatically before but maybe I didn't see that maybe I don't know what I'm talking about alright so that's another pull request so thank you for got a lot of pull requests for this project so far a lot of really good ones so I really appreciate that and let me show let me just throw up on the screen really quick the contributors so far so here we go here's our contributors so thank you to everyone who has contributed and actually yeah yeah that's everybody ok okay so let's continue on with our layout so I think I've decided the way I want to do this is just run through and get the base layout for every page and then I'll go in and work on just the details yeah I think it would be easier that way I'll get an idea for when we reuse things so when I go to handle changing the styles to make it work I'll have a better idea of you know if I change the style globally how it will affect another page and then otherwise if I go page by page I might decide to change so globally and then later on have to you know edit it and so it could end up being a bit more messy than it needs to be in the in the CSS so let's move on so this page is basically how we want it with the exception of I mean obviously this is still lorem ipsum text and everything but we'll fill that in logos I'm gonna skip logos for now because that's gonna be difficult I don't know it won't be that difficult it's not like we've never done anything like that before in react because we have but it's just gonna be a lot and since I want to keep it short today I'm not gonna get into that so the posters view we got to bring up our the project as it currently stands the current live version so we can see what we're but we need to to build out all right on my other screen I'm bringing it up and I'll just pull it over when it's ready also I am broadcasting on Instagram so it looks like that some people watching including my wife so hey thanks for watching actually I should I showed my kids one of the Instagram videos of me doing this and they were like the baby was just staring and smiling she was like a mace that I was in the phone and also sitting right there that was pretty fun alright so here's what we have currently live and this is behind a like a password password protected site so sorry you can't check this out right now it's not there's not really anything private in here that would require having a password but we just that's how it was set up so the new one won't require a password and we're looking at posters okay so we're just gonna need while this would be easy so basically the same thing that we did on the home page except a different little bit different organization of the cards so ready go to 2 columns and 3 rows so that's gonna be super easy we can copy and paste a lot of what we did for home so I'm gonna throw foam actually I already have it over there cool so we have home on this side so we can easily copy it and posters there we go let's bring up posters so I'm gonna copy all of this I'm just doublechecking okay all right I'm gonna copy that and we're just gonna have to change around the columns a little bit so right now we need to change all these m fours we need them to be M twos and I do want to change up these rows so we only had two rows before and now I want three rows so I'm gonna copy this and we need one two and then after this second column we're gonna put in this row we also need to close out the first row so we're gonna put a closing div tag all right so now we've started our row we don't have to close that because we'll just we're using the closing div that was in the other one so we can just delete this row right one two actually might have to add another one we can't keep it straight in my head so we have 1 2 in the first row and that is properly closed good Row two one let's get rid of that yeah okay row two one two and close it out and then finally one more one more row and that is oh that one is already closed out so this should work but save it and no error syntax error okay what do we do okay I probably just forgot to yeah I didn't copy this stuff at the bottom so we just need to close that return and our render now it should work no oh we didn't I didn't copy that either so we need to import our components that we're using so we need to import that from material UI but save it now now will it work yeah okay so it works it doesn't look exactly the one or two but we have the number of cards that we want so let me eat you see what's going on here so I'm even bring over a dev tools so you can all see what's going on and if you're checking out the site using the link that I shared to Endre you could inspect this as well if you want to all right so let's see we have a container the row the columns oh I I know what cuz I said M all right I'm sure you all caught that mistake and I just haven't looked at the live chat for a while but my mistake was I put M in my mind I was thinking like I wanted it to be half of the page and so for some reason it made sense to me that was somehow half but really the way it works is that you need to specify the number of call you wanted to take up out of 12 columns so 12 would be full width so I need to do 6 these are the materialized column classes so that should work now there we go now we have what we wanted and all right so that's it so we're good this page layout is fine like I said I'm I'm not gonna worry about this you we can already see having some sort of you know padding up here is gonna be necessary probably for every page so that's why I wasn't really worried about doing it at first until we get everything laid out and then I could see like okay well what element is gonna be the best to put that padding on that'll apply everywhere we need it and if there's somewhere where we don't need it then we want to make sure it won't apply there so let's move on posters letterhead see actually I just remembered I have my poem adora timer and I keep forgetting to use it so put that on there I don't think I mentioned this yesterday a day before but somebody made a Pomodoro timer in Java like a desktop Pomodoro timer and sent it to me to try out so I haven't gotten a chance to try it out yet but maybe I'll try it out and I think I want to try it out on my laptop and not on my work computer because well like the IT department gets a little bit upset about downloading things so not that I suspect anything from this app or the guy that sent me the app but just so that I don't possibly get in trouble I'm gonna try it out on my laptop see how it is and maybe maybe then install it here and show you all but let's check out what the letterhead view is supposed to look like and go back thank the letterhead oh okay so it seems like all right not too bad I have letterhead view is just some text and then each one of these is a card and so this is just an image alright so we'll just import the the cards will leave the media section of the card we need the title section and then we need the the action bar section of the card so there'll be a little bit different than the cards that we just used on the last page but the good news is I mean none of these are components that are foreign to material designs so they're all there they are all available for us to use so we would probably won't need to customize too much cool move that to the side and let's check out this leatherhead okay so within letterhead let's create actually let me bring in let me bring in what we just did for the posters because we're gonna we're gonna want rows of two and since we already have some rows of two then why not use them so we are gonna have to change the card significantly but at least we can keep all of the the column classes pretty much as is we'll just delete that last row so we'll take this row and get rid of it great and then let's import not only this will import that we will no longer need the card text so we'll get rid of that and then we'll check out the documentation for material UI and the cards and we need to add in card actions and card media Media and then we're gonna take out card text we don't need that or actually let's just do this put that we'll make that card actions get rid of all this lorem ipsum there we go and then let's check out the docs to see how we need to do this so within card actions we need to flat button so let's bring in that flat button let's see how that looks yeah that's that's pretty much what we want so let's bring in the flat button and then we'll also bring in this action and we only need one action some only gonna bring in one of these components there we go so we have our button the last thing we need to bring in is this card media so let's check out how it's done here so card media let's pull this and I don't really want the overlay though how do they do that not we're not gonna use the overlay but we are obviously going to have an image and this image is not gonna work all you know it's so we don't even have an images folder so we'll pull in we're pulling a photo from somewhere else but we want to place that above the title oops and I should have been doing this all along there we go paste that in and I'll copy this as soon as I remove this stuff so I don't want oh that's interesting I just want to want to show you all this because it's interesting so the props the overlay prop we're actually passing in a reactive component which is cool I don't think I've ever done that before so actually passing in another component with its own props as the props for the card media I don't know didn't know you could do that that's really cool okay so and our image all right let's see what did we try to use before that didn't work was it it was the Bill Murray stock photos didn't work right I think it was a course issue so we're not gonna be able to do that unfortunately I'd love to be able to use Bill Murray so I think I'm just gonna use unsplash so we can go to unsplash and I'm gonna check the proper dimensions here for that image so what dimensions are we using 509 by 659 is that really what dimensions I used 509 I mean I'm sure it's it's obviously responsive so it's gonna get bigger or smaller bucks 600 by 766 was the original like how do it I had to have gotten an image like premade like that cuz I can't I don't see how I would have made an image like that 600 by 776 okay yeah so let's get an image that's 600 by 776 so I want to get a random image because that's fun and then you don't get as bored looking at it and let's pop that in here and I can't ever remember which ones with and which ones height for this alright so this is a two by three so that must mean two is the height and three others with all right so the height was now I can't remember 600 by 770 okay so let's do alright let's let's try that let's see how this works oops we're yet no no it looks like I did some bad copy and pasting that let's check out what the problem is all right that should fix it I should be good I want to check to make sure our URL works before I copy it hmm looks like it didn't that's the problem that's odd I'm not even there we go cool you just took a little louder to come in alright so now that we know that works we're going to copy this as well and let's see I don't know it broke I didn't work last time and break this you know what I probably yeah I click the the button to add another one I still don't know why that would cause it to be broken but I did add another image when I need to ah now I'm getting a Corsair that's weird that I didn't get one before and now I'm getting one let me try let's see can you all see the images over n drop okay all right cool I'm saying it now no I don't like how the random image gives you the same random image since you're you know making a call for all of it if you have it I think if you have the components like loading in it at different times you can get them to have different images I've actually I've done it before where I'd have it pick a random number and then use that to grab an image so I just so that I could get random images all in the same load but in any case it doesn't really matter this is only what we needed to see was just to get the dimensions let's move it around just a bit cool all right it looks like yeah we definitely I'm just checking it again so we definitely have to do something about the padding in here but it'll be a little tricky because so we have proper padding between rows this is our row break so I'd like to have consistent padding so it may have to have some media queries there to make sure that you know if we're gonna add padding let's say to each column we want to make sure we take it away from the row right now I'm not worried about adjusting anything the last thing we need to do is add some text at the top so it looked like it looked here like we just had two paragraphs of text so let's just throw in two paragraphs inside we're gonna put it inside another row and then we're gonna have a column a full width column and then we'll put two paragraphs into that column and I'm gonna use I think it was Sarah that recommended the Bible if some site to use for lorem ipsum so I think we'd use Samuel Jackson if some I've used bacon ipsum before but since this is a Catholic University I think it would be better if I use Bible ipsum and I think the people that I work for would like it better if I use Bible ipsum as opposed to Samuel Jackson quotes so hi I just saw the the first quote that I saw in Bible if some of my other screen actually like spells out the one of the words for God that is to some groups of Jewish people as actually you're not really supposed to spell that out or say it so I'm gonna use a different verse out of respect for that and not not use that oh man I'm seeing it in so many places why is it giving me this is actually really weird the the Bible if some generator is giving me the the same so I would assume it would give me like random stuff but it's giving me the same stuff let's see if I put in two if it'll be different no it's the same thing fresh now I want a different quote am I missing something all right all right I'll try I will live some a different day because I don't want to spend a lot of time on that I mean you would you would assume that you would get different Bible clothes right I might I might have to make my own that sounds like a good side project oh I'll make my own because your says what is it freak out camp has the random quote generator project so I'm sure there's some API out there and that you can get bible quotes from or like scrape the site or something so let's add in let's just add in what we know we need and just generate some lorem ipsum oops we're gonna do a div with a class name I'm gonna see cool with the class name of oops Roe and we also want a div with the class name of column and then you wanna make that in s 12 and that means if you're using materialized that means on small screens is gonna take up 12 columns and I wanted always to take up 12 columns so I'm not gonna add anything else otherwise you would add like in this case we added on medium screens the N we want to only take up 6 out of the 12 columns so be 50% with now we're gonna add our P tag and eventually I guess said before I'll probably put in the float X class but I need to bring that in for materialized so I'm not gonna look for it right now but I like the flow text since I did this site originally I've read some articles on proper font size and I'm convinced now they larger font size is almost always better for readability so I currently on newer sites that I'm making I use a much larger font size than I had previously and the flow text is a nice response of font size and make sure that it's a decent size all right so I can generate lorem ipsum whoa that's long string let me I was hoping there'd be some setting that I could get to really easily to wrap that I might have to actually go into preferences hmm I thought there was a wrap setting I'm missing it why are you editor settings area all right so soft rap somebody had mentioned soft rap in a comment or something and I think it was I think it was Nathaniel so anyway yeah see how much nicer that is thanks to Daniel for bringing that up maybe I have it maybe it's on my laptop but I thought I had that enabled somewhere but I guess not so just we're gonna throw in the two paragraphs and all right cool so that looks looks like we have the layout that we want yep obviously we're gonna change change a little bit we don't need this card subtitle actually yeah let's take that out I didn't realize I have the card subtitle in there oh yeah actually the more I look at these components from material UI the more I like them a lot of these like options are really nice like things that I would build myself pretty much every time like adding a subtitle you know would just add a span and you know have to set all the properties to make it look like that it's really cool that that's built in but you don't want to subtitle right now so we're gonna take it out so I'm thinking that once I once I get the hang of material UI and really start to learn how it works I think I will like it all right cool so that page is done let's see that was letter at a share story next is that next dress here share story okay so currently for share story what we have is we actually have a card with a bunch of text and a four hmm I'm not exactly sure that I want to keep this in a card so I'm gonna go I haven't checked the live chat in a while so I am gonna check back here but I'm gonna ask a question first and hopefully you all can help me when it comes to material design generally you you don't use cards in this way right you would if you have pieces of content you know that that are gonna be separate and like it's okay to put those in cars but usually like in this case I'm essentially using the card as a container for everything that's on this page with the exception of the header so I don't really think this is the proper way to use it I think it may be better in this case to simply put this right on the screen kind of the paper in the background so I don't know what do you all think we could try to put this on the screen over here and see how it looks we'll have to bring in we haven't you worked with any form components yet so we'll have to bring that in so I think I think it's worth a try but let me check the time yeah actually at this point I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna go over to the live chat and that'll probably be all we get in today so we've done a couple of use the layout for it the next thing we'll probably do is bring in some of these components for forms and I'm at least gonna try out leaving out the card for this just to kind of more properly stick to the material design spec it's when I did this site I was I was just starting out with learning material design so I kind of used cars for everything okay so now if you were just here for the code part of it thanks for watching I'm gonna do a Q&A session now before I finish up so if you're not interested in sticking around for the questions and answers I'll see I'll be back tomorrow morning with another live stream so if you can join me then otherwise if you have a question put it in the live chat or you can ask me on any social media thing a lot of people ask me things on Twitter or you can put it in a comment on the video so let me scroll up to the top and I'm just going to get it on through actually I'm gonna see I'm just go back down to the bottom just to see if you all answered my question alright Rohan says an edgetoedge card okay all right John Hanson says I suggest a story card looks too much like a modal and so its function looks like a person would maybe want to dismiss it so yes resign okay cool I'd know I didn't think about that but now that you said it it does kind of look like it could be a modal cool okay Kevin says I think with a big enough font and responsive container it would look just fine on the paper on the back if you're not sure what we're talking about like when I say paper in material design language this background so behind the card is the paper right and certain things sit normally on the paper and this is what I didn't know when I made this site but like the print the copy the text here this font is considered ink okay so ink goes directly onto a paper it has no height to it right that's why we don't put box or we don't put shadows on on text in material design all right because it sits on the paper the same thing like with an image normally an image sits flat all right that's that's ink but then if certain things we can bring out all right look like a card but it would be better like we don't want to put everything on the card and it's weird so it makes it implies almost that we could move the card out or get rid of it or there's something behind it so anyway that I'm no expert on material design but at least that's my understanding so if you hear me say paper I basically just mean the background that you see I mean you can see the entire background here so this is we mean me the paper okay and Rohan says it feels like the description text is too large so are you talking about this text I'm not sure but anyway yeah this is this text that I have at the top of these pages might entirely go away it might end up uh I think I'd rather go with a really small header and then move these as to be like titles to each page so down here we'll see I'm I want to see how it looks kind of messed around with it okay so thanks for your your feedback those good feedback definitely agree with it so now I'm gonna go to the top and try to answer some questions and let's see also I do have people watching on the Instagram stream so if you're watching on Instagram and you're not sure what's going on I just was doing some live coding on the free code camp YouTube channel if you do have a question you can go join the live chat on there or you could put it in Instagram and I'll answer it from there as well okay so Zack asks what tech does free code can't challenges use wondering how hard it is to create your own challenges on your own site actually that's a good question I'm not really sure but there was an article on medium that I just read earlier today about a company that actually created their own version of free code camp so that they could host code challenges and have it be a little bit more fair because on free code camp basically you could you could look up all the answers they're available so they totally like clone it all and it's on github I wish I still had the article open I closed it out and I had to get hub repo open right before and I just closed it out so I don't have the link ready for you but if you check it out that the article was something like they introduced I think it was in was it Singapore I can't remember for sure but they'd introduced free code camp to like thousands of people during the Google i/o event that they had over there I think it's in the free code camp medium page so if you just scroll through there should be near the top but anyway that'll give you an idea cuz you can check out their repo and see what they did but I don't know a fan I I was not involved I guess you could just check out the free code camp repo I don't know what I was thinking yeah everything in free code camp is open source so you can check out the github repo for that as well but I hadn't I was not involved at all in the making of any of the free code camp challenges so I I haven't even submitted any pull request to help out with that so it would be cool to do so I've just been as you all know pretty busy with with the work that I'm doing right now roman asks so we are going with v1 alpha or the the zero times to the other version so i think i'm gonna stick with the older version of material UI just because like what is this day six i had hoped to be farther along by day six and i spent a lot more time just trying to figure out what version we're going to use and then trying to get the beta version to work so i don't want to deal with that anymore i think the other version is it's way more stable it's been used by more people there's a much higher chance of me being able to find answers to issues that i have and i don't really have that with a beta version so it'd be really cool to use the beta version in the future but i just i don't think i'm gonna be able to do it for this project so all the effort that's put into making the beta version work by you all by your pull requests is not going to go to waste because i really do want to try to use it on a future project so when that happens i'll go back and pull out a lot of the the stuff that was done on that beta branch that we have for this project now so that will be helpful in the future but i just want to kind of let it mature a little bit before i before i use it Isaiah says I'm having difficulty rendering a PDF in a react react component that's interesting I've never attempted to render a PDF in a react component so I'm not really sure that I could offer you any advice on that right now but I am really interested in seeing it so if you have some code on github where you're trying to do that please send me a link to that you know you send me a direct message in Twitter if you want and I'll try to get to it when I can the charity truth right now I'm a little bit behind on getting to the code and stuff that people want me to review on on Twitter so if you do send me something to review I will definitely do my best to get to it at some point but there's there's a little bit of a waiting list right now so don't be afraid to send it but just if you need something reviewed like immediately that's it's probably just not going to happen yeah in the the person in the chat with the with the handle lol lol says when I said that stream was gonna be sure they said is it because I'm watching the stream you make it shorter well not at all no no it has to be short and I explained earlier why it has to be short so I have to I have to get somewhere it's really important that I that I get somewhere at this point it's it's a matter of professional pride that I figure out what is going on what's going wrong with my the site that I built and fix it and I really hope that I can go there and say no it's the browser it wasn't me at all that would be the bestcase scenario because then it wouldn't have been my fault this entire time but even if it is my fault and there's some bug that I don't know about that would still be cool because then at least I figure it out and and be able to fix it okay about halfway through the live chat now okay so I see Sebastian saying some stuff about the the mouse over and stuff so yeah I'm not sure yes Sebastian sent me a message on Twitter or something about that because I'm not exactly sure what's going on in a live chat and I know I'm gonna have to stop so I really don't have time to talk about it right now because I'm gonna have to end the stream soon someone that just has the string so JH k k JH ka says what is card tag yeah so it's not a standard s it's not a standard tag right yeah it's no it's not a standard card it's a it's a react component it's a custom component so Sebastian answered that but in case anyone else was wondering the HTML yet it it has a lot of nonstandard tags so in my editor these tags are highlighted a different color than the regular tag so you'll be able to tell you know that these are special ones but they're definitely not not your normal tags they react components advanced says you're right it shows up automatically okay so maybe I just needed to be more patient and this is in regard I think to the merge whenever it displays that your pool request has actually been merged so I just didn't wait long enough maxima is asking what do you what do you use and and not just to meet everybody in the stream what do you use to uglify es6 Jess okay so John says John Simona says grunt can trigger glyph i Maxima is using gulp yeah there's a gulp uglify you'd probably want to use babel first so i don't know if anybody said that but yeah if you want to do es6 i mean if you want to keep es6 and just uglify your es6 and not trans pilot I'm not really sure what you would want to do but if you want to transpile yes 60s 5 for browser compatibility and then uglify it then maybe that's a step you need to put like in your in your workflow use like I think there's a gulp Babel so you want to use gulp babble first trans pilot and then uglify the code that's been transpiled so hopefully that makes sense yeah otherwise I don't really know I don't really know this babble have something like that built in I don't know I'm not sure but it would be somewhat convenient I guess if it was alright so the stream on Instagram just ended so thanks if you're if you wanted to see my face today you missed it now but yeah the Instagram stream will be available for 24 hours okay Isaiah's asked again about rendering the PDF in the react component I'm assuming those before I talked about how like I honestly really don't know how to do that but you sent me a link to your repo I could at least check it out okay Maxim a said that it was for a note app so es6 was supported so it didn't really have to worry about transpiling so okay patrick said react inception so I guess that was when we were I was talking about passing in a component which I think I got rid of that but yeah yeah it is like reacting session all right Patrick said there's odd shifting happening to toggle and on toggle to sidebar and watch the layout let me check this up okay I'm not seeing any shifting happen here maybe I don't know maybe you're talking with someone else about their site in the live chat or possibly it's a different browser and so I'm not seeing it here Blake asks what time the stream will be tomorrow I'm thinking let me think I have a meeting at 1130 so maybe around 1000 Eastern Time maybe it earlier depends on what time I get into work tomorrow so I'm not sure but probably at the latest I'll start the stream around 1000 so at least I can get in like about an hour before I gotta go to my meeting so that's that's what I'm thinking so I'll try to get in early schedule the stream so you all have a little bit of advance notice but I don't really have like a set start time where I have to be here by sowed it varies depending on like how many times I had to wake up with my kids in the middle of the night Alexander asked Jessie what would you recommend to improve react skills just started to use it I would say if you're like really really beginner at reacting just starting check out the react dog the official react documentation their tutorial some of it might be kind of too advanced but you know you'll get a rough idea of what's going on and then I would I would use codecademy x' that's like a browserbased course and that's kind of a nice introduction as well there's some YouTube videos that would be helpful so I think learn code Academy is the YouTube channel I think they have some some beginning react videos as well that can be kind of helpful they're a little bit dated though so just kind of keep that in mind like you get a good understanding of what react is but some of the syntax there might be better ways to do it now and then if you're willing to spend some money for a course so far the Udacity react nano degree that I'm taking currently has been really good so I recommend that rohan says we need no update tomorrow what's the issue browser bug it's a mystery yeah the issues completely a mystery to me as to why this isn't working so evidently from what I can gather just from a ton of emails and months of trying to figure out what's happening here is the way it works it's a password list login so I'm talking about this meeting that I'm about to have in a few minutes and it's not really a meeting it's me gonna I'm gonna go check out this person's computer I built a website that has a password list login system so you enter your email address and it has to be a Franciscan dot edu email address you enter that in and then it sends you an email with the link you click the link and you're logged in and it saves your login into local storage and your browser you stay logged in for a year unless somehow you delete the local storage when this person clicks the link to log in it takes them to a blank page at least that's that's what I've been told so I want to go check it out now they're the only reason I can think of that that's happening is the JavaScript error early on and so I'm guessing that it's either javascript is disabled on his browser for some reason which you would think would someone would know but I actually went to somebody else's office and checked there's their computer out because a similar thing was happening and that was the issue JavaScript was somehow disable they have no idea how it happened so it could be that or the issue could be they're using a really outdated browser so those are my best guesses right now but I would definitely fill you in tomorrow on on what I find out all right Patrick says react PDF component looks simple haven't used it but you might take a look at that so isaiah's was asking about PDFs and rendering PDFs and react so that's really cool I didn't even realize that there was a way to do that Johnson muda says install another browser to test that's also the problem so I don't have access to install anything on anyone's computers other than my own because all the computers are basically on lock my computer's not on lockdown because I'm a developer and that doesn't really make sense to lock my computer down but everybody else on campus can't install anything or update anything on their own without IT so I'm not really gonna even have a chance to do updates I have to call someone from the help desk here at the University and have them do it and I don't know it's kind of towards the end of the day so I'm not even sure if that's going to be reasonable to expect them to be able to you know update something or install something for me right away okay Umberto says check if it is Internet Explorer check compatibility mode to make sure they're not running in compatibility mode okay that's good to know I will definitely check that if I need to Roland says edge is actually good with standards unlike ie yeah I agree edge is way better than Internet Explorer Rowland also says Safari is worse nowadays yeah I agree probably my my least favorite browser that's like a modern browser and I don't include IE in that anymore since they came out with edge is definitely Safari so we had more issues with things not working in Safari than with pretty much any other browser okay so Patrick says I'm not seeing the issue with the layout on a Mac when it's strolling because the scrollbar doesn't change the width so I'll have to check that out I'll use browser stack to check it out probably tomorrow so thanks for that Patrick hopefully that's not gonna be like a really big issue okay all right I've gotten to the end of the live chat and definitely have to have to get ready and go now but thank you all for watching and helping out in the live chat and thank you for all the contributions and pull requests and everything I really appreciate that I'll be back tomorrow probably around 10 a.m. Eastern Time so different time than normal but I'll put out a tweet and I'll schedule it so you should get a notification through YouTube as well if you subscribe to this channel so I guess I'll see you soon else I'll see you in the morning and have a great day
