map is used to run a function upon each item in an iterable item like a list and create a new list with the same number of items but the values of each item can be changed so here's an example we have this list and then here's the function and then we are going to map through each item in the list and so here's the function we're going to run we're going to run this function on each item in the list and now we're going to get a new list so I can do print result so then we can always just pass it into the list function and then we can run the program again two four six so one two three became two for six so yeah whenever you want to do run a function on each item in a list you can use map
