hey everybody its Jessie and today I haven't even done anything yet and I already have one thumbs down on this video so I'm not mad about it I just wonder what what did I do I don't have a thumbs down it was already there like ten minutes ago so if you do dislike one of my videos let me know why I don't even care if you mean about it only cry a little bit but let me know why and if you don't want to call me out like in front of other people because you're afraid you know you people get mad about it or whatever just direct message me I won't call you out a few direct message me and are critical or whatever because I want to make this stream better so I really really appreciate all the positive feedback that I get and lately I've been getting a lot of positive feedback I've had some direct messages on Twitter and emails and you all been you know just really awesome and encouraging and I really appreciate that but if you don't like what I'm doing I you know if you have you know two minutes to explain why that would really help me out alright so I want to do two things today one thing obviously is make these custom post types like like the title of this the stream says the other thing though is I want to show you an error that I inadvertently caused when I set up the load balancer and that Sebastian caught so hey so Sebastian he's often in the live chat I don't even remember the last time he missed a live chat but last night Sebastian direct message me on Twitter and sent me a screenshot of some errors that he was seeing and I had not seen these errors before and once I did a little bit of research I found out what the problem is and so I think this is a problem that would be easy to have if you're doing load balancing I mean I've been working with next for a while now probably at least six months I've been working with next maybe longer what month is it yeah probably about six months and I've read through a lot of their documentation and I never saw this before so what's happening is this let me show you it's not gonna show up now I might have to show you on the yeah it's not going to show up here it'll show up on the server so let me bring in my oops actually I could have done it here yep let me bring this in and I'll go to one of these servers and let me let me change the color real quick because I know I had some I think it's there we go if you're using item and you press command I it will bring this up and you can change your colors but I just I haven't figured out how to get it to persist and change everything at once I haven't really taken that much time to try to figure it out the colors there we go maybe a week or two ago I had somebody that said that this black background was was just killing their eyes so I want to lighten it up a bit and so basically I'm going to go into one of the servers if you haven't seen the other videos where I set up load balancing right now this this site which I'll show you here in a second so this site that we've been working on for a while I'm doing this for anybody who's new is a react site and it's running next j/s which basically lets you scaffold your react app and it provides serverside rendering and routing right off the bat so it does a lot of cool stuff for you so you don't have to worry about that and you can just get started in you'll get to working on your app and I guess I had it right here too I didn't have to bring that one over so once I split it on to two different droplets on digitalocean so there's two instances of this app running and then I set up a load balancer I kind of use easy mode I set up the digitalocean load balancer it's like 20 bucks a month and it makes it really easy to do load balancing so at some point I would love to do like a live stream of setting up a load balancer maybe like from scratch and but for now that was a good first step for me into the world of load balancing but what happened that I didn't expect was this I should go so I'm going to open up this file okay so when you build your next app so when you run you know npm run build or yarn build or whatever you want to run it I think it's next build so however you run it it creates a unique ID well you need to build ID so my my deployment process for this is that I develop locally I push all the changes to a github repo and then I log on to the server I pull down the changes from github I build and then I start the app so on the server on one server there's one build ID and then you switch to the other one this is the other one not logged in right now with Logan the other one I have another build ID so there are two different IDs so then what would happen is I would I would come in here and I would click around and react would detect that the build ID was not the idea that it expected so this error wouldn't happen all the time it would only happen from what I could tell from what I read I think it was happening because sometimes part of the site was loading from one server and part from another server so like you know not every page has to load every resource right so you might get you know one request would get sent to one server one droplet and then a request you make a little bit later when you go to a different page might get sent to another one that's what seemed like was happening and then next detected like hey there's there's a difference in these I build ID numbers and it was giving me lots of errors okay so I wonder if I can show I'd like to show you what the errors look like in case you get them so you know let me let me look here at the screenshot that Sebastian sent let me bring this over it's kind of small try to zoom in okay so I can make this bigger so these are the areas that I was getting see invalid build ID basically there were actually two forms of this error there was it was displaying sometimes like this and sometimes it was displaying another way but basically both both times it was saying something about a build build err built idea okay so now we've got rid of those and here's how I fixed it so I was a little bit proud of myself when I thought about this so I didn't come up with it completely on my own I found I found this issue so somebody had had a similar issue and they reported it here in the github repo for next and then after some possible solutions and suggestions down here at some point I may be right around here okay so here's the suggestion to use a different build ID so make manually add a build ID that's the same ok the solution number one was well just build once and then copy that over and run that on two different servers but that's not that wasn't going to work with my deploy process so I didn't want to change my deployment process I want to find a different solution so the solution was just add something in add a step in to your build process that changes that ID to whatever you want it to be and make sure it's the same so the suggestion somewhere in the documentation for next it also suggested you could use the ID for the commit for the latest commit the like the head to the master branch and github I thought that's really cool so that's exactly what I did so check out my package.json here and here's what I added just this part so in the build process now I had this so this command get Rev parse head just gives you the ID and I know some of you probably know all this and this is old news for you but for there's a lot of people who are just starting out who might not be confident in their commandline skills so I'm going to just kind of explain what this does so I'm going to copy this come in in here and if you see this it just returns the ID of the latest commit so that's what we want we want this kind of unique ID but we want it to be different for each build but the same on both on both servers okay and then we're just automatically putting this into this file so if you're not familiar with this basically you know you put the sign in here what is this the greater than sign and then we specify the file and so whatever this returns becomes the contents of this file so it worked I now have those errors are gone the build IDs are now the same so anyway I thought that was a I mean it was a tricky problem for me when I first saw that last night I thought what is going on I have no idea you know what this is but not too bad after a little search so anyway I definitely wanted to point that out because I feel like if anybody had been following what I did with load balancing they probably got a similar error if they were using next as well and I didn't want to leave leave anyone hanging without you know bringing that up and explaining what I did so I mean this is all on github now you could check it out you know and add this to your project if you need to if you're having this error I'm going to check the live chat really quickly because I have some some comments in here before we get into the custom post types oh man Martin says two hours way too much it's a very good topic I liked the video before WordPress API but really two hours is way too much um yeah I kind of agree with you I don't I don't know let me know do you all like when I have the long streams like two hours or do you like it when I used to have a half hour streams so when I first started streaming I tried to set a half hour limit so I would code for like 25 minutes and then I would answer questions for five minutes and then I'd be done because I thought the same way like hey nobody is going to watch the recording of a two hour video but a half hours more doable so let me know what you think it's just some of the more like detailed things that I had to do the more complicated things there is no way I could get it done in 25 minutes so I just kind of kept going so that we could do the whole thing I didn't want to break it up and have you know one thing take like three or four days so let me know I can definitely change it up if if you all think it should be shorter fine otherwise they'll kind of keep it going now I am I am doing I would kind of like to cut it back so it's more like an hour not not the two hours because that is a lot and I found like honestly like after I I'm talking for two hours uh my voice starts to go so I think if I did that every day I would lose my voice by the end of the week so I mean it's not the end of the world if my throat hurts a little bit from this but I think would be better if I still had a voice by the end of the week all right a lot of people saying hi hey everybody thanks for watching okay you you get not sure how to pronounce that I hope I pronounced it right you can says please start the technology from scratch that would help begin increase up their level that everyone up the level that would help everyone thanks you rock awesome thank thank you for the for the positive feedback there I really would like to start from scratch and I probably will end up starting from scratch soon when I move to my next project so this stream in particular is just what I have to do at work anyway I try to pick the most interesting thing that I'm going to do each day and save it for this livestream time and I get a lot of them more boring like copy and paste type of things out of the way early on in the day so sometimes we're doing more complex stuff and sometimes we'll be doing beginner stuff it's just it depends on what I have to work on that day but I know I've been saying this in promising this for a while but I am going to do some tutorial videos that will be prerecorded and in those videos I will go over basic stuff and they'll be really targeted if someone will be targeted just that people who are really at the beginning stages so that is coming I have some outlines already ready for those videos I just need some quiet time to do the videos I've started to do one and then all my kids came home and it was just way too noisy and I don't have an office at home I need I need like to make a little office space where I could do this so anyway let me okay so Jordan says 30 to 60 minutes ok that's reasonable that's kind of the range that I think is probably best for me Rowan says I actually love these two 2.5 hours stream but some topics can certainly be half or one hour ok cool yeah I do I kind of agree with that it it does depend on what we're doing as to the length see best to make sure topics are covered completely but an hour max good okay so an hour max an hour one and a half hours break it up okay so it seems like right around the one hour range seems to be kind of like the median of what people are saying so I'm going to try to keep things like an hour or less I will say a lot of the time at the end does come like we kind of get into a discussion about things so the actual coding time sometimes isn't that much but maybe maybe we can break it up maybe there can actually be a scheduled like question and answer time so that we can split up and have videos that are just coding and then videos that are more Q&A I don't know I have to think about that and see you know when that would be good to do I do I do like the idea Jordan says break it up into different streams multiple streams per day so like instead of making one long stream that's two hours I could do for halfhour streams so yeah that would be a little bit more work just to set all this times up and to make like video thumbnails for that but I guess I could use the same thumbnail and just change part 1 part 2 part 3 so that's that's a good idea I'll think about that one as well sometimes I don't know ahead of time how long a certain thing will take Roland says spontaneous Q&A is better yeah that's what I was thinking the scheduled Q&A might not work out the you know if we do get questions they just kind of flow out of what we're doing Danny says we be doing WordPress development stream yeah so I'm doing I'm going to do that right now sometimes I I'm not going to do a dedicated stream for WordPress like every you know every so often but every day but occasionally I will need to do WordPress stuff because I work with WordPress websites sometimes so we'll be incorporating that so let me get to it it's already been I'm talking here about you know cutting down my stream time and I've already spent the first almost 20 minutes on you know kind of beside the topic I mean now we haven't it was important we were trying to break down and troubleshoot an error so you know that was valuable but I do want to get to it okay somebody's joining an expecting wordpress I don't want to be disappointed so here I have let me move this over and just to show you how we're going to do some of these so I already have some custom post types running and I'm going to bring over my wordpress site as well to show you what post types I have running and what it kind of looks like here so I don't know how familiar you all are with WordPress it's a content management system that's built on PHP and normally the way you use WordPress is you have a theme and that's you know rendered it's you know PHP templates and it's all tied in here with this admin panel and that's how normal WordPress website works you know normally like you know you click a link it's a page refresh and everything everything's rendered on the server using PHP what I'm using WordPress is I'm using the API so all the content still goes in here and basically it's still running PHP behind the scenes but I don't use PHP to render anything okay there the display portion of it what people see with what the client sees you know for instance this is built with react and it lives on a different server than this so when this page loads a request is sent to WordPress saying I want to certain data and then it comes back in JSON format and then I handle on this end sorting it out and rendering it all so WordPress now is in I think the term people use is headless so we're using it as a headless CMS so WordPress isn't usually a headless CMS but we're using it in that way here is that all we care about is content going in here and we don't care about display here we do all the display stuff here so that's just a quick overview in case you're wondering what you know how WordPress ties in with with react and what we're doing I will I'm not going to go into a lot of the why of doing it like this because I've covered it before in videos and in the comments to some of the videos early on but just to to say a little I've found that when I make sites like this they are much faster than traditional WordPress sites that I've done and I'm able to do different things like yesterday we set up it's not live yet but yesterday we set up a like a live search that just automatically gave us search results and it was really cool not that you that's not possible with a normal WordPress site but this gives me a lot of freedom to use the build tools that I want and be able to do everything in JavaScript you know using react instead of having to do a lot of the templating in PHP and now if someone was really good with PHP maybe they'd like to do in a different way but I'm not great with PHP but I know enough to do custom post types so let me show you that what a custom post type is in case you're not case you're not sure so this is one custom post type it's called nearby events so this isn't default in WordPress I just made this name up nearby events will go to add one okay and I've also added some custom fields and we'll probably add some of these today I did not code these custom fields in PHP so what we'll do is I'll show you how to code in PHP the custom post types but then I'll show you the plugin I use as well to do all these fields for me since I'm not really a PHP guy the custom post types are pretty easy to do but all the custom fields were just it was just too much work for me it made more sense to go with a plugin and also if you're not familiar with WordPress plugins will cover it you know in a little while so it'll make more sense but basically I can just set out here's what I want here's all the fields that I want this gets put in here and then the data I get the data basically like this this isn't the same this is data for different custom post type but it gives you the same idea is that this is how I get the data that gets put into here and then I can do whatever I want with this in react okay does that make sense I'll check the live stream if this is like completely confusing to you let me know in the live chat and I can let me know what's confusing and I can't explain it otherwise I'm going to keep keep going and show you how how we set up these post types so there's probably a little delay so I'm going to wait just you know a few more seconds here to see if anybody has a question at this point because if you lost at this point I'd rather like try to catch you up a little bit then then you stay lost let's see okay rowan says you you just request content on api's probably as may be overkill though but better than learning a new CMS she was funny I'm not sure if that was in response was that in response to Danny or what also yeah it probably is overkill but in this particular case I didn't just need to make a site I need to make a site that was very impressive is there because of the circumstances surrounding why I got this project and everything I needed to make it in a very impressive sight that did more than a normal site would so that's part of the reason why I went with this as opposed to just a normal WordPress site there are some other really good reasons why and I think I went over those a previous video so I'll not go over them again here but if you are thinking like like Rohan that maybe this is overkill for just a normal website I I don't completely disagree with that but if you can make something better and you have the time to do it and the ability well you know why not do it alright so I'm going to continue I didn't have anybody say ok so that Rowan said that wasn't response to Danny so that's what I thought I just wanted to Claire this clarification okay Jake says overkill maybe it depends on whether or not you're doing edits are passing the site off the clients yeah okay Jake I'm glad that you are I'm glad you said that Jordan also mentions building custom CMS is a lot of work definitely a lot of work and Jake says WordPress really easy to understand for non techie people good I'm glad that that you both brought up those points because this this is exactly why I chose WordPress as the CMS because it's so easy for non tech people to use I'm not going to be maintaining this site in terms of content which is great I don't I don't ever want to maintain content on a site I just want to build new sites and make them better so other people so grad students who are getting their degree here I work at the University who are getting their you know their master's degree here and are trying to make a little bit extra money you know while they're in school so I can pay their rent and everything they're going to be up updating the content so the people updating this are constantly going to change it's probably going to be a new person every year every two years they may or may not have any experience okay so they're not getting their degree in anything computer related so they need something that's as simple as possible so the idea is I make pretty much everything that makes sense edit able through WordPress and then I make some tutorial videos so that the new person would just be able to watch you know a playlist of tutorials and they would be able to go in here and make any edits so I'm trying to make it as easy as possible and make kind of restrictions so I have restrictions on some post types like if you upload an image that's you know a certain size if it's not at least let's say 600 pixels wide then it won't display because I don't want pixelated looking images on the site so even if somebody were to upload you know a really small image because they don't realize you know the quality of images and how that works on websites then there's some protection that that won't make the site look bad okay so some of the fields don't allow HTML strips it out so there's some protections in there like that so setting it up like this definitely makes it easier for people to enter content and then it also gives me a lot of control over how that contents displayed and it takes that control away from the WordPress editor which in this case we want because it would be very easy for someone who didn't didn't really know anything about websites to kind of make it look make it look bad I mean not that they would mean to but it would be easy you know if they could just go in and put a bunch HTML and change the theme and everything like you normally could do on a wordpress site that wouldn't be great so let's see there's some questions I'm going to come back to the questions in the live chat so I see there's some discussion going on there but I want to get to this I'll come back at the end and kind of join in the discussion a bit let me show you now now that we've seen the custom photo types what it's going to look like I'm going to show you how we make them I know I've briefly went through this maybe last week at some point I just kind of showed it now we're actually going to make some things with this and then we're going to add the fields to it and then we're going to see what it looks like when it comes in the API so right here I've just been making a list I've been going through the site and making a list of all the sections that right now you can't edit through WordPress that need to be added I have two ideas for how to do this some of the sections would probably work well if I just make them a page because if it's a section that won't be repeated so for instance like this section here is going to be an intro section I always want this section to just be about a paragraph okay so I can make this section just be a page and not even necessarily a custom post type it would just be a page with the name resources intro okay we could give it that name and then I could pull that page based on the the slug which is and I kind of like a string version of an ID WordPress gives every page and post an ID that's a number but then they also give it a slug which is always a string that is a unique identifier so in this case I would search for this name of this page okay so I'm going to do that I'm not going to do the pages that right now because I don't have to custom code those so that's not as nice a thing to do on on the video but for sections they're going to repeat so like in is it events now sorry courses okay so courses some of these sections will be static pretty much and so we could just make them a page but some of them like these are basically the same thing repeated over and over again right so it's just just text I did have a request to add some images in here but I'm not 100% sure how I'm going to change how this looks to fit with that so so that's that's coming but for now at least these are all just going to be repetitive sections so that's perfect candidate for a custom post site so that we can set okay I you know use we just need a title and then we need text just very simple now some of these like have a little bit of more custom formatting like this has you know this quote here so there are going to be some that if somebody knows what they're doing they could throw some HTML in here and it could work I'll have to make sure that I have the style set properly on on this end for it to work but you know that's so I want to leave this whatever we make as the input for this we want to make it so that hTML is able to be put in so we'll make that like a WYSIWYG editor so I think this is a good candidate to do first so let's do that and I've already had it to the list I think I'm just going to call it ministry tracks so I see I know there's some stuff going on in the live chat so I will get to it I just want to kind of push ahead with us now so that I can try to keep to keep this to about an hour total for the live stream so what I'm going to do basically this makes a new custom post type this this portion here is basically thing that you need to change there's one portion at the bottom which basically initializes everything okay so this you only need to add one time this section down here I'm just going to move down so we're very clear that this is a new section and these are custom taxonomies I'm not going to do custom taxonomies today I don't think I need these for anything on the site at this point so as long as you add this one time at the bottom here to admit everything you can just put you know all of your post types in one big one big object I guess that's what I'm not sure what this isn't PHP is okay so one big function so this is greater create new type function so yeah all right so it all has to go in that function sorry I'm just like trying to make sure that I know what's going on in the PHP and can explain it as best I can I am NOT a PHP developer so if you know more about PHP than I do which is likely just bear with me here I know enough PHP to make things change in WordPress and upload files on a small website that's about it so I'm going to take this I just copied this and I'm going to paste it below and I'm going to do some kind of best editing here so you see basically in this point I'll go through them all oops I don't wanna so some of these are going to be singular in some plural so what I found is it's easiest to just select the singular and then the S on the end will come in so if you shoot I don't have this in a repo maybe I'll make like a gist or something and make this available in case you want to add this to WordPress and make your own post type so I'll make a note of that right now and make that available if you want because I imagine you'd be super hard to try to like look at this on the video and type it all out as I'm moving it around okay I may already have this somewhere and get up and just to forgotten about it but in case I don't know add it and then I'll add a link in this video so basically at this point I'm just going to type in the name that I want for this ministry tracks whoops okay so now I'll go through this so we're giving it the official name right ministry tracks these names up here these are going to be the ones that what you usually see displayed in the admin panel that's why I like you know this this looks like normal text okay it's not you know we're not doing like camel casing or anything like that because we want this to display you know in a manner that's intelligible to people who don't know anything about code in the admin side so this is the singular name and this is let me bring this over here so I can it also be easier if I give you like a side by side to show you what these mean okay so the name I need to get this big enough there we go all right so your name is going to display here right your ad new all right it's gonna see like ad new whatever you want to say here so you could change this if you wanted you don't have to keep the defaults all right when you go to you know edit the item do this see you get the idea of all these are going to show up somewhere in the admin panel now down here these are going to be the names that like you'll use when you make a request to the API or if you are going to do other things like make another PHP plugin to do something else or even if you're making a traditional WordPress site and you're going to render these in PHP templates and things these are what you'll use to reference that so we just need to change ministry and do I do I don't remember if I usually do hyphens or underscores or camelcase let's see what I did here okay I did a great I'm not sure what's the convention in PHP is it usually underscores or said hyphens I see some underscores here at this point it's I've already done it differently so I don't really want to change it because then I'll have to change code in other places but just though this may not be the conventional way to do it in PHP just in terms of style so this is actually you know this is registering the post type we were giving it the options here okay so these options some of these it just depends on what you want to do so you might not need all of these but they're pretty some of them are pretty like self explanatory other ones so you might want to check out the documentation there's so much documentation for WordPress stuff so you'll be able to find exactly how to do this you know has archived true right this this means is this post type going to have that archive function if you see like on a lot of blogs you can go back the archive to like you know go back to the post from October 2016 right so do we want it to do that yes we want to do that I don't really know if I'll use that function but in case I do I'm just adding that is this public okay so you can have post types that aren't meant to be public they just you know you're tracking data in the admin panel you don't want people to see it you got to be logged in and stuff so we want this to be public and then we say supports and these are going to be the fields in here so I have actually taken these out for this post type but normally let me show you a post so by default this is kind of the fields that you have I actually added some up here but by default you'd have write your title so that's what this is talking about you have your editor here you have and decide I may have disabled excerpt so excerpt is just a smaller text input area where you could put in a custom excerpt for your post otherwise I think usually it's set to just take like the first so many characters and use that if you don't set it and then the the thumbnail so you can set you can add or take away these you know whatever you want it to have I think some of these have are probably like mandatory like I think every post has to have a title so you may not be able to take all of this out but you can certainly you know add things and but I have a kind of an easier way to add and take away things so I usually don't mess with this part in the PHP exclude from search false capability type so this is the type of supposed so we're going to rewrite the slug right so to ministry tracks and we're going to this is the important thing for the rest api do we want this to show up and be accessible from the rest api yes and do we want this to show in the menu yes I'm pretty sure that I it's been a long time since I mess with this to check it but I'm pretty sure this is like show in the in the admin menu so like here in the menu so yes we obviously want it to be here so that's that's it that's all it takes to do a custom post type so I'm going to save this unfortunately I am not able to get into the server right now so I was hoping that I could just kind of edit this like not that this would be a great idea but I was going to kind of just cowboy code this and edit it live since it's like it's really basic there's very little chance of me breaking anything since its it's just a really repetitive task copy and paste so normally you wouldn't want to edit things live but in any case I'm actually going to have to copy and paste this and then add this in so if you've never added a plugin to WordPress kind of the the weird way to do it is I actually go into the plugins section and I find my plugin which is here and you can edit it now I think you have to be an administrator so not every user can do this which is a good thing so all those people who I talked about that are going to be editing this then won't be able to do this so if you're making WordPress site for client definitely block stuff like this out for them so they can't come in and mess with these because they can definitely break your site so I'm just going to paste in everything that we did which this like I can't stand like having to copy and paste stuff when I'm working on a thing but Moe whoa we will check here and look now we have ministry tracks so if we go here we can add a ministry track right now I haven't set any of the stuff that we need I may not actually have to set anything custom here because we if you see the site what do we need here we need a title and we just need content here that's all we need for right now at some point later on we might need to add an image somewhere but by default this comes with a featured image so we can just use that but for right now I don't want there to be an excerpt and I don't want some of these other fields to show that that don't really make any sense in a headless CMS so there's going to be a field like if I were to put something here and save it there'd be a field to preview and it would show like what the URL is going to be I don't want that because if you click it it's not going to show this site it's going to show what it would look like if we're actually using a wordpress thing usually I don't even have a theme I I just block everything so if you try to go click that it will show you a blank page occasionally I have it redirect to the Rick Astley video for fun but but not on a important site not on client side so all right before I show you how to add custom fields and take them away I'm just going to check the live chat briefly just to make sure you that you all are with me let me scroll a little bit see what I've missed a few questions only answer a couple of them while I'm while I'm here there's not a lot and Ray I'm not sure I'm pronouncing that right it's a nd REI let me know how to pronounce that and I will make sure I pronounce it correctly it says why why would someone pay a developer to code on my website when he can make his own with WordPress that's a good point to be honest with you for some people in businesses it does make more sense for them to try to just do some type of simple site with WordPress or with you know there are there other things like what is it Squarespace or there are a lot of different services where you can go and just kind of drag and drop build a website honestly if you're just going to do a personal blog and you're not really making money off it then no don't pay a developer and I mean I'm I'm a developer so I mean I want I want people to pay me to make sites but realistically it doesn't make sense if you're very like a small business and you need something very simple let's say you're you're from an area where like for instance the area where I live is predominantly elderly so the population demographics here just like really really skewed in favor of people over 60 it's just the economy is really bad where I live so most of the people when they graduate from high school they leave because they can't find a job here so that's how it is so when I talk to people like a small local business and they want to know about a website my advice is sometimes you know you don't want me to do a website for you because you're not really going to make that money back that much you know your clients aren't your clients aren't going to be using your website that much if you have a presence on you know Google Maps that's what you need so I'm not Lee talking about really small clients they don't have a lot of money so I mean obviously bigger companies should have a website it should be a good website it should not just be you know regular defaults they should have somebody it's a professional working on it so that said for this site in particular it needed to be better I think I mentioned it earlier so this site needed to be more than just a normal WordPress site so that's why I did it like this and there's some other you know good answers as well that other people added to that uniqueness is one I mean yeah the if you have a unique site that's well done it definitely just adds at least in my mind if I go to somebody's site a company site if it's just basic WordPress site I don't think badly of them but if I go somewhere and they have a site that's like wow how did they do this site you know and I want to inspect the code and see this is really cool for me like it's just impressive I'm impressed with a company that takes the puts the thought into a site and has put the resources into doing something like that so not everybody's probably like that but it makes a big impact on me you know your site I mean consider your website like the online home of your business the online location so for some companies they could do with just a generic looking you know building to do their business in right but for some businesses they want to stand out they want to have nice architecture nice decorations right that that's kind of the difference is between you know I just have a little shop that looks like all the other little shops on the street or I have a place that people look at under like wow you know they walk in and it just attracts people because of how nice it is that's kind of the difference and if you want that you need to hire an architect that's you know that knows what they're doing and as you know some creative ability and an interior designer you know a decorator so hopefully that answered your question I probably spent too much time on that so sorry if I kind of over answered that let's see so I'm just I'm just getting through I'm almost to the end here of what's on the live chat all right so here's requested aft derp says is it better to have a main parent component and render that to the Dom or is it just the same to have many parents all separately rendered to the Dom competitor that's a nono 70 suppose I'm not like a hundred percent sure how to answer the question um let me just show you I haven't showed you any of the react stuff yet so let me just briefly kind of show you how a page works and it doesn't have to work like this this is kind of how things work in next when you're using next to build react stuff like this is my index so within this index file and I like that maybe I'm not really answering your question here but I'll give it a shot you know within my index this is actually it's not a good example because I'm not pulling in anything any other components really let's go to resources that's a better example so I'm importing all these other components these child components and I'm pulling them in so you know the sticky nav components here the title components here all these all the cards that I have on the page were just iterating over this data and then adding these cards to the page and that's a separate component so that's that's how I've been doing things I'm sure there are other ways to do things hopefully that clarified a little bit let me know if it didn't and I'll try later on maybe to give you a better explanation I had asked a few minutes ago about the different like using the or the underscore for PHP and it seems like the underscore was kind of the way I should have gone and Jake says the underscore is the way to go but then you have an underscore in the URL and you don't want that so actually now that you that I remember that is the reason that is the reason why I did it like this and not on this site but on like months ago when I first started working with this I had used underscore and then it I didn't like then I ended up having to use underscores later on in other places and I didn't want to use underscores everywhere so that's why I did go with the so thank you Thank You Jay reminded me of that and the Patrick says rickrolling clients priceless yeah it is pretty funny I actually got my I think I got my boss with that before um yeah it's funny but yeah I normally I don't do that for client sites but I think I may still have some WordPress installs where if you try to go to like the admin page you get rickrolled because I've changed the I change the URL for the login for the admin just to mess with somebody who might be trying to like get into my site and they're not supposed to be in there alright so let's get to I don't want to get completely off track here where we're going here we go let me show you how we're going to customize this for editing so I have a plugin called advanced custom fields and it gives me this extra menu item there's a pro version of advanced custom fields but there's a free version in this case the free version does everything that I needed to do so it's fine I have used the pro version in other sites and it has some functionality that if you need it it definitely saves you time it's worth the money I think it was like 25 dollars per site where you could pay $100 and use it on as many sites as you wanted I think it was in Australian dollars too so I'm not sure what that what that came out to and US dollars I think it ended up being cheaper in US dollars but at least at the time so let's go into we're going to add new and you get title let's go to ministry tracks info um I will say this you everything I'm about to do with this plugin you can do in PHP and just code it yourself I found that that was kind of would take too much time for me just because of my lack of experience with PHP if you're good with PHP give it a shot and that's one less plugin you have to worry about but I kind of this is nice this this works it's free it's well maintained plugin it consistently updated so I definitely recommend it and I get no I'm not sponsored by this plugin so this is an honest recommendation I get nothing for that so what we're going to do here is want to say when the post type equals alright so when it equals ministry track okay then all this stuff that we're about to do will apply okay so we're going to apply it to just that one and we have some options as to where this is going to display it's not really a big deal it's your preference usually if the field is like really important I don't want people to miss it I put it high right after the title but you can put anywhere you want this like display style is um totally up to you in terms of your preferences I found that this the seamless kind of looks cooler but the standard fits in better with WordPress so it's like it looks more like it's supposed to be there and then here's a place the place where we can actually hide a lot of stuff that we don't need so I'm just going to hide everything for now because we're only going to show a few things so we don't want the permalink as I said because that'll take you it'll take them to the wrong place it'll be misleading we do want the content editor this post I don't always add this and what we want that we don't want the excerpt we don't want any of the normal custom fields because we're going to add our own custom fields here we don't want discussion comments because we're not going to have people be commenting on this custom post type we do want revisions so that they could go back and see what's been changed we do want the slug in case I need to double check what the slug is you know if I'm trying to troubleshoot something we're going to keep the author and that way people can see who's worked on that post before we don't need format because that has to do with the layout of a WordPress theme and we're not using the WordPress theme we're going to keep featured image because at some point I think we're going to add images to that section so I'm just going to leave it in there for now even though right now if you put an image in there it wouldn't display at all on our site in fact we haven't linked this up to our site at all so it has it is actually not going to display depending on we're not going to have time in this stream but maybe in a future stream we can link this up I know I've already showed how to do that in a previous stream but maybe it would be cool to do have like the whole thing in order now we'll see let me know if you're interested in that we are not going to add any categories or tags at this point we could always add it in later but I don't really see any need for this because of what we're going to be using this for we don't need that if this were more like a blog style thing we would leave these and we don't need the Trackbacks so we've got rid of a lot of the stuff on the page if I wanted to do a custom field which I don't need for this one but let's just say I go here to add a field I can add a label so I'm just going to do some nonsense here it gives it this field name this is the name of the field that will show up in the in the JSON so let me show you a guy here so like anything that you put here will show up under this çf section in your JSON and this is the name so you'll need to use this name in your API call and then no not in the API code you'll need to use this name when you're rendering out the contents of this so you can choose a field type to a lot of different things you can choose from and then if you get the pro version there's even more you can have some instructions so this is really important if you're making it for clients you know really spell out exactly what you want in that field and how it how you want it to be formatted you can make it required or not you can give it a default value placeholder text right so you can even said okay where do I want this this text to go so it really kind of nitpicky things as to how you want to align this but you know might be important this I almost always choose no formatting unless there's some really good reason why I want people to be able to use HTML in in whatever text area that is okay so normally not I don't use that and occasionally you don't want to character limit so for these I don't need a character limit because if you remember on the page we're just showing and hiding them so it's really not going to be a big deal to have them be super long because they won't be immediately displayed to the user won't make the page really long so we're not going to have a character limit there but I would recommend this for for things that you don't want to make super long because it would look bad put the character limit in there and then usually people who don't know about websites have a tendency to write way too much text and in general on a website you want less text you know unless you're writing a blog post or something then that's understandable but you know if it's on like your home page you to you know just skip out people never read all the text in any way so try to keep it short and to the point so that's basically it I would add this field and I don't really want to keep it but I'll just add it just for demonstration purposes and I'm going to publish this now when I go back up here to ministry tracks and I go to add new we can see it looks a bit different we don't have the excerpt anymore actually there's no option to get rid of these sharing buttons I am this is not going to hurt anything but actually if I can figure out how to get rid of this I may as well because it's kind of pointless in them I just be distracting so basically we have our all we have is just what we wanted to include our title our content our main content editor and then here's our field so we added one field here and then we just added another one in dis left at blank but that's where they would go like if we wanted to we could have this display up here but that's it you can see it just it looks like it's meant to be there if blends in really well with everything and that's where it added so at this point what I would do to kind of complete this process for this post type is I would go in here and basically at this point I would probably copy and paste or I would probably have somebody else do it because that's a little bit of kind of a waste of my time to just copy and paste so if I had maybe like a student worker who needed to get some hours in and maybe I would have them copy and paste this into here fill out all the tracks once I have the data in there then I would go in and pull this in so just like I'm doing here with these resources where I get I can make a call to the API here with fetch and then I get that data back I showed you what the JSON looks like and then I use that data down here to populate the page so that's what I would do for the the page the courses page with the ministry checks exactly like that so you can go and get up right now and check out this code and just kind of see what the next step would be just by checking out one of the pages where I'm actually importing data where you see this get initial props at the top of the component so that's it so I've come in it just slightly over an hours so we kind of hit our goal today of being about an hour I am going to keep going for a couple more minutes just to answer your questions so if you were only here for the code you can stop watching now and thanks for watching but if you do have a few more minutes to stick around for some questions go ahead and put your questions in the live chat and I will try to answer as many as I can as best I can and if your if you don't want to put your question in the live chat if you're a little nervous about that you can put it in a direct message to me on Twitter my Twitter a link to my Twitter account is in the description for this video or if you can't stick around for the answer you can put the question in the comments to this video and I will get to it I do read all your comments and everything that everyone sends me I read it all sometimes it takes me a few days to get to it but I do read it all and I will respond alright so let me get to to some of this live chat let's see there's not a whole lot here so the question answer session might be pretty short today which that's fine because I so some of you evidently are like staying up really late to watch this because your time zones are a lot different than my time zone so I appreciate that that you know you you like the screen enough to to stay up like that but I don't want to keep you up too late every night so I'll try to be shorter than normal let's see I'm going through I'm trying to find a question here that I haven't already addressed so haven't found very much yet okay Sebastian asked can't you redirect WP cat attack etics com2 the real site yeah so I thought of that before so just for some context here I had said before that on the WordPress select normally when you do something in WordPress and you save a post there'll be a link here where you check out your post or preview so there's a preview button you preview it with the way I've set it up here if you click this preview it's going to take you not to the site that you should go to not to catechetical comm but it's going to try to take you to the site that would be there if we were using the wordpress template and I usually just completely disable the template so it'll basically take you to a blank page but you know at best it's just you know it's misleading for people try to click that and they think oh wow this isn't what it's supposed to look like or they think hey this site is broken what happened so I just take that out I mean I I can take out the preview button if I really wanted to get into it into editing but I'm not super worried about that right now Sebastian is saying couldn't you just make all that redirect to the right place on the on the actual catechetical home site and I think that's probably possible and I'd like to do that there's actually another site that I did I can't show you it's a it's like an internal web site and my my bosses want it to be they want it to stay private it's basically just an internal bulletin realistically like 90% or more of the content there's no reason why I couldn't be public and it probably is public elsewhere but I'm not allowed to show it but I will say that the person in my department who has two input content for that has requested before that that exact feature of either that she can preview what it's going to look like so I'm working on a way to do that I would like it to be able to for there to be a feature where she can upload things and be able to preview it and see it on a page on the site I didn't actually build it with react I made like a single page app but I did it in like jQuery which that's that site was kind of small enough that it wasn't too much of a mess but I wouldn't want to do that again that was before I was confident enough with react to build it so I'd like to make a set page the only she would be able to see that she would be able to preview because right now if she puts something in it you know it's live so like it may only be live for a second but she has to make it live to see what it's really going to look like which I mean that's not really a good option so I mean I I definitely should have in hindsight I should have made that so that you there was some type of preview feature built in but it generally works there's not really a lot of leeway with how you can enter the content for that site but I'm definitely working on that and if I get a solution to it maybe I'll show you like on a demo site since I can't show you the actual site because that seems like it would be valuable if you're trying to have a similar set up to this all right okay so daftar have said that data answers question see that that question was about I almost called you a he I'm not sure if you he or she is sorry about that so dafter asked a question about how you set up how you render the components and things and react so I'm glad that that they'd answer your question authority Thor is here is that he nearly missed it again sorry you're missing it is it I don't I don't know why you're missing it is it a weird like it's it's usually a 2 p.m. Eastern Time so for some reason it seems like you're coming in an hour late is that like you just can't make it earlier or what how to make one too many relationship between custom posts so Andrew asks how to make one of many relationship between custom posts Andrew I'm not exactly sure what you're asking if you're still watching could you explain a little bit more because I'd like to answer your question but I don't I don't think I understand it well enough right now to give you a good answer Thor says it's 900 p.m. here should not really a problem alright so this is 9 p.m. there tomorrow watch it start watching at 8 p.m. there and then you will be here on time if you can also for those of you who are watching really late all the time there may be some times where I have to do an earlier stream so that might be more convenient for you I'm thinking like they're definitely going to be some Monday's where I'll have meetings at 1 that will probably go really long so I'll probably have to switch it up so far I've been able to skip some of those meetings because it wasn't really relevant for me but I think I'm going to have to start going to a few of them so just heads up on that so there will be a little change in time but that might be good for some people maybe some some people that can't you only watch live may be able to Jake says nice job Jesse I think you cleared some concepts that took me quite some time to figure out on my own awesome I'm glad I could be of some assistance to you Jake Roland says today is stark contrast to yesterday's it's just 1235 a.m. we went to 210 a.m. yesterday yeah yesterday was super long I was I was actually super exhausted I remember yesterday I said I had to go to the store and pick up some stuff I was so exhausted after the livestream yesterday that I didn't I went home and just relaxed because I couldn't I couldn't even make it I was super hungry and tired and I thought I'm not going to try to go to the store now I'll probably buy everything and because I'm so hungry and tired let's see Thor asks why are you using WordPress oh ok sorry there's one before that so smilers asked what application is it I'm not sure what you're referring to I think I'm missing something so smile is a type of redactors you okay what type / is using for code you mean that code editor uh it's if you mean my code editor I'm using Adam if you mean like the framework I'm using react on the on the frontend side of things to render everything and then I'm using WordPress to manage the content but I'm not using the template system that WordPress has so hopefully that answers your question let me know if it didn't so Thor says why are you using WordPress for this purpose is there nothing better for this for example a simple Django application or something like this the two main reasons why I'm using WordPress for this is number one because a lot of people who have no experience at all with code are going to be editing this and there's going to be a high turnover rate for people who are editing this so they need to be able to be trained very quickly and use this so WordPress is very user friendly in that way the second reason is because this site was a really tough schedule I didn't really have time to learn anything and I don't know something like Django I do I have done this exact thing with WordPress in the past so I knew that I could get it done on time if I did it this way so that's generally not a great idea to use something just because hey I know how to do it I'm just going to keep doing it this way but in this case it actually did work out well for the project so if on future projects if I have more time and it would work out better I'm definitely open to using something other than WordPress for content management actually let me know in the live chat or in the comments what you would recommend using if I if we weren't using WordPress what should have been used what do you think and maybe if I get some time I'll check out your suggestions and see because I'm I'm certainly open WordPress is a little bit of a resource hog it can be on the server so something more lightweight as long as it's still user friendly for for people who don't know about code I would definitely be open to using the other thing is WordPress has a huge user base and there's a lot of great documentation on it so that's really helpful for me at times when I need to do some custom things with it hooligan soft says hey hey what's up thanks for watching door says testing and production is great yeah I don't have a copy of the WordPress install either locally or on another server I'm thinking about getting one it's probably a good idea to get one I probably should do it but I just don't have a setup right now to be honest with you I'm a little bit intimidating with the idea of like how do I sync up the database do I have two separate databases and try to keep them in sync do I pull from the same database but if I do that is that really like a decent development environment you know because so whatever I don't know how to do that there is somebody else Brian works with me here and he has worked more with stuff like this and using WordPress and databases so I'm gonna maybe talk to him a little bit about that and see what he recommends in terms of having a like a testing environment or test you know a testing development server and if you all have any input on that I would appreciate it as well because I probably should have it you know in general you should never be editing a site live if if you don't have to if it's not an emergency hooligan soft says can you make tutorials from making WordPress theme from scratch um that would be really cool unfortunately I don't think I could make a good tutorial on making a wordpress theme from scratch because to do a theme from scratch you have to have some knowledge of PHP at least enough to do the WordPress PHP thing and I'm not confident in my skills to do that so I do know how to do a lot of customization from scratch I have I have honestly I have built a really basic theme from scratch before but that was a long time ago so I don't think I could do it justice I wouldn't feel comfortable putting out a tutorial like that I mean you all know I mean I attempt a lot of things that where I don't really know what I'm doing so I'm not opposed to doing that but to actually do like a from beginning to end tutorial on something I would want to be more knowledge of also but if anyone else knows of a good tutorial to make a theme from scratch please you know let let us know in the live chat or in the comments so that it can be a nice resource for whoever needs to do that rohan says i don't know how WP handles content but you can have an internal temp entry and use preview to generate page from that ok that's interesting I will have to keep that in mind and maybe look look up some more on that I'm just thinking about that for a second ok thank you for that suggestion andrew says is front end served by wordpress or some node app it's a node it's a node app so Andrew I'm using on a set to WordPress lives on one digitalocean droplet and then on another droplet we're really to other droplets I have clones of a node app it's react that actually renders all the data that it's getting from WordPress through the WordPress API and there's there's a load balancer that your shifts traffic between those two copies of the the node app another thing that I didn't mention when I was talking about WordPress that I'll mention briefly I just remembered the cool thing about using the WordPress API for this is the same content that you put into WordPress you can use for your website you could potentially add a theme on to this and have a traditional WordPress site if you wanted to there's nothing stopping you from doing that as well you can pull the data into anything that can get anything that can use an API a REST API and get in can process JSON data so and any app probably some Internet of Things stuff I've actually had an idea to make an Alexa skill for the Amazon echo that would pull data from the WordPress API and like read you the blog posts so I don't know if somebody's already done that and you know about it let me know and then maybe I won't do it because it's been done already but if it hasn't been done I'd like to do it and or if you want to take my idea and do it first just let me know because I think be cool just to use I won't be mad if you steal my idea but that's kind of cool that you could use it in a lot of different places so they'd all lives in one place and it's all easily editable and like imagine like if you wanted to keep everything in your organization all sync together in terms of the you know let's say you have like a business and you wanted like your times that you're open or even like on let's say your restaurant you change your menu frequently well you change your menu here in one place and it automatically syncs to you know you're at let's say you had an app I know this would be weird for a restaurant to have an app to and an Alexa skill and all this and now all of a sudden all the data is updated instantly everywhere there's some definitely some value in that and can save whoever's editing your content it saves them a lot of time all right let me continue on I'm nearly at the end here the live chat so where the stream is getting longer and in spite of my my efforts to make it shorter today it keeps going longer so sorry about that I just you know I don't want to leave you all hanging if you have questions so I definitely let's say this I want to try to cut it off at an hour and a half so that'll be in ten minutes we'll cut it off even if I haven't gotten through everything and then maybe I'll just try to answer your questions like maybe at the beginning of the next stream like tomorrow stream if I don't get to them all let's see Thoris will try it's not a time problem where something is just probably remembering it she probably set up reminder event or something okay all right cool Thor that's the Souris talking that's we were talking about that the time that he was kind of late getting in here to watch it so it's just a remembering thing so cool if you um if you're not already subscribed to the free code can't channel I think though if you have your notifications turned on and you subscribe I think they will alert you so you'll get like if you have the YouTube app it will alert on your phone you're going to notification or it can do like desktop notifications as well so that might be helpful to you I also post on Twitter usually like beforehand so that could be another reminder Andrew says custom post author custom post book add books to author okay so Andrews clarified its earlier question about how to make relationships between custom posts so yeah this is possible let me think for a second because I'm I have worked with this sort of thing before it's been a long time so let me let me just think for a second to make sure I I remember what's going on okay so here's what you can do um I do I believe in WordPress you can make so you would have the two custom posts write author and book that books to author how did I do this before you know what I think I didn't solve it in the best way so I wanted to be able to add books to author and Link it but I think what I ended up doing instead was did I make a taxonomy I may have made a taxonomy or some so I don't think I solved it correctly but I think it's possible I just don't I don't know how I can't remember exactly how I did a similar thing so I don't want to give you an answer so sorry I can't give you a good answer on that but I can tell you that I'm I'm almost positive that it's possible because I did look into it before I just I either couldn't get it working or it didn't seem like I needed it that much that it was worth the time but I I mean that's that's definitely something that comes up so I'm sure the answers is out there Jake says luca node who's pulling data from workforce api ok awesome so jake had already answered the question so sorry I should have read ahead and then I wouldn't have had to answer that John says I'm late for any fix all right sorry John you can watch the replay the replay will be oh man so we had a couple people who were late so the replay will be available in like a minute after I end this stream so I mean if you want to participate in the questions and stuff just add them in the comments below the video andrew says we're press gives you fast bootstrapper backend and already has json api enabled with all endpoints yes excellent that's that's a great point yeah you you don't have to build any of that it just it comes it's just there and if you're using like managed hosting or you know like like GoDaddy or something like that they're like you know regular shared hosting account there's usually a oneclick install for WordPress and it takes five minutes so in five minutes you have a REST API you know that's that's really easy so I'm sure they're probably better ways to build an eight but if you don't know how to do that I don't have time to mess with that then I mean you can't beat that that's that's just simple really simple Thor says ok thanks for answering never heard people using WordPress for this purpose just wondering yeah it's actually it's kind of new or the WordPress API has been around for a couple of years but it's been in like beta stage for a while it's only within the last year I think that it's it's like officially part of WordPress core used to be you had to get a separate plugin and enable it and stuff so for a while there it was recommended not to use it on production sites I did still use it anyway because in my experience like it worked there were very few breaking changes that ever occurred and if it did happen it was well documented so I never had a problem with it but it's it's only recently that it's I think like at a stable enough point that a lot of people are starting to use it Andrew says yes is a good practice to keep staging in production even local in sync yeah that's the that's the goal that's what I should have set up so I pretty much have that for the node um a part of this but just not for the WordPress part Andrew says this is how WordPress that WordPress takes templates in theme I'm not sure what that was in response to Andrew so I don't remember I mean what I was talking about at that point so sorry Jordan says what size drop list ease actually so this is really cool um Oh Roland says the stream keeps dropping I haven't been watching the the stream stats oh I didn't see sorry about that actually when it goes that's weird okay sorry it was dropping right now it seems it's it's holding I'm like over 5,000 kilobits per second so it should be good right now so sorry about the drop I mean obviously I don't really have control over that can action but I usually have a really good connection at work so Jordan the droplet size I'm using fivedollar droplets for everything so the to clone like no droplets are both fivedollar droplets and then WordPress's on a five dollar droplet usually it's recommended not to go with the $5 for WordPress but because I'm using it in this way just the headless part of WordPress and it's not having to do any like rendering of templates at all I've found that I can get away with putting WordPress on a fivedollar droplet and it's still really fast and it holds up I definitely be a point where if I get too much traffic I would have to upgrade it but that's actually been really nice that I'm able to to run it on a fivedollar droplet I'm also going to take advantage of once once all the post types and everything really get bailed out I'm going to turn on caching for the API and that's going to decrease the load on WordPress even further and then I do have caching set within node at the server level and then there's also caching going on on the client side with the serviceworker so there are three levels of caching if I have time I may even route this through CloudFlare and so there will essentially be four levels of caching going on so once if a request even got all the way back to WordPress it would be somewhat rare so it'll allow me it will allow me to run these on very cheap droplets because I'm kind of protecting them from the brunt of all the traffic that you would normally have on a wordpress site so so for right now that works I think is pretty cool that I can run it on lower droplets I mean not that I need to I'm sure you know for this project there was there was a budget that was large enough that I could have done a larger droplet but there's really no reason to the site is running very quickly and at least for me from from my testing it's been running very quick and the API calls are coming back you know very very fast you know within milliseconds let's see Jonathan says there's a PHP myadmin on your host server where WordPress is hosted this gives you full capabilities to run sequel off the database on the backend as well yeah actually I don't have PHP myadmin installed when I run WordPress on digitalocean so I'm not sure I actually had my colleague Brian set up the WordPress instance so he may have installed PHP myadmin or something like that I'll have to ask him about it but um when I've done installs of WordPress on digital ocean I haven't installed anything and if I do need to mess with sequel I've just done it from the command line and that's worked for me if you use a host like for some sites I do have on GoDaddy and I use SiteGround for some sites too those usually come with like cPanel and PHP myadmin so that makes it a lot easier if you have access to PHP myadmin and can use it use that it's way easier than the command line for that normally I do like the command line but for for doing database stuff I don't like it as much all right last andrew says last question for me do you sync your containers databases when using load balancing thanks so so no actually so the containers so the node apps have no databases and those two containers are where the load gets balanced between the API calls all go to just one instance of WordPress so there doesn't need to be any load balancing to there because you know obviously there's just one and that's where the database sits so so no I don't have to deal with syncing that to any of the you know for load balancing purposes okay someone asks and I can't pronounce this because it's in Russian says who is from Russia or who is speaking on Russian let's study together so I don't speak Russian if anybody else speaks Russian then you know get together maybe you guys can study together and you says better use my sequel workbench app to connect to database instead of PHP myadmin which has load on your server all right good to know I'll have to check that up Andrew knows Russian awesome okay and that's the end of the live chat did I make it um two minutes over what I wanted to be so almost made it lost track of time there at the end so still have but we have 32 viewers still even after all that time so a little bit lower than normal but it's been a long stream okay somebody joining us just
