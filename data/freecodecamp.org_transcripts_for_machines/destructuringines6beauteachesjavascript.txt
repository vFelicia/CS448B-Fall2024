the structuring assignment is a JavaScript syntax that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects into distinct variables one thing you can do is assign variables from objects now here's the old way to do it if you have this voxel variable and it's assigned to this object where you have X Y and Z each assigned to a different variable you can say VAR x equals Vox of. X VAR y equal vx. Y and VAR Z equals Vox Z but here's how you would do it with destructuring and we're done that's all it is for destructuring so it's going to create these three variables from voxel so if we comment this out and then I'm going to put console. log X and you can see over on the console here so it's just a quicker and neater way to assign values directly from an object you can also do it like this let me copy this and paste and now we're going to make a slight change so this means that we're we're going to get the field X from voxel and copy the value into a we're going to get the field y from voxel and copy the value into B so I can do console. log B and you can see we have 3 6 from when we log the X and then 7.4 when we log the B 7.4 comes from up there so you can change the names right when you're when you're doing this you don't have to use the names from the original object okay you can also assign variables from nested objects okay here's a nested object here we have const a and inside a we have start that's assigned to this object and in that's assigned to this object and then here we're using the structuring and here using destructuring the variable start is assigned to the value of a. start which is also an object so we're going to go into the object start then we're going to take the x value and assign that to the variable start X which is going to be five then we're going to take the Y value from start and assign it to the value for start y so we can console.log there oh but let's just change this a to the word nest because a is already used previously in our program okay now you can see at the bottom five so the value of start X is five so we look into start look into X and then we have five here just like you can destructure objects you can destructure arrays so let's look at an example of that Okay so we've assigned q and R to this array but it's just going to take the first two elements from the array and assign it to Q andr so if I run that and you can see one two we've console.log one two here and you can also access the value of any index in an array with d structuring by using commas to re reach the desired index so if I just add a couple commas here and then run that again one four so it got this it got the one here it skipped two it skipped three and then it got the four here you can basely do the same thing with the rest operator so you can use the rest operator to reassign array elements so I'm going to make some quick Chang this to what I had above there so I just run ran that see would console. loged Q andr that's right here 1 and two and then I console. loged rest which is 34 4 five what we did there was that variables q and R got the first and second values of the array and then because of the rest operator's presence this is the rest operator these three dots the rest variable here gets the rest of the values in the form of the array so three four and five goes into this rest variable and then we can console. log it here the rest element only works correctly as the last variable in the list and then one more thing a bonus cuz I didn't have it written on there yet you can use destructuring to pass an object as a function's parameters so here is one way to do it you can pass in an object which would have all these properties here would have the name age nationality and location properties and then you use destructuring just like we saw before to destructure all these properties from the object into their own variables but there is a different way to do this instead of using the destruct string line right in this function we can take this section right here I'm going to copy that and we'll put it right in here I can take this out completely now we are still passing in a profile data object but right in the parameter we're D structuring that object into the different variables so again you're only passing in one object even though in the parameter there's all these variable names you're just passing in a single object that contains all these items as properties within the object and then um you can destructure out into the different variable names and let's say your object has all these properties has name age nationality location if you only want to use the name of the age in your function you don't have to pass in these other items so even though you pass in just the one profile data object it's only only going to take these two properties name and age and turn them into variables for your function and that's destructuring thanks for watching my name is Bo KS don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
