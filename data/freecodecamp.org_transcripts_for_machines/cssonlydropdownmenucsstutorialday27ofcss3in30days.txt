hey everybody what's up welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day number 20. what was it seven we're gonna be building a drop down menu but first i'm gonna be making some more modifications to my silly looking microphone here a student of mine actually suggested that i this has nothing to do with css by the way he said in the box it comes with a large pop filter as well as this small one i think i'm going to try out the big pop filters so give me one moment how do you take this off whoa that is so silly thanks student for suggesting this to me now i look even more foolish oh maybe it's cool back to coding here we go we're going to be making a css only drop down menu this is a super simple lesson and all we're going to be doing is building this simple little drop down so i got a button here that says drop down when i hover over it bam we just got three drop down items normally you'd build this uh you know in javascript jquery and also css but i wanted to show you a really simple and lightweight version of just creating a simple css3 drop down so up here in our sandbox we've got just a simple button right here and then three links so that if none of the styles are working then at least the links are visible which is important for accessibility reasons uh now let's go over to our code editor and open up the 27 drop down menu folder folder folder is what it's called go ahead and download that open it up in your favorite code editor and open up the index and sandbox.css as always final.css is there for your reference to make sure uh that you're on track and if you have any issues you can always refer to that so here we go in the index just to quickly show you the markup right here in the sandbox we've got a div with the class of drop down a button within that div with the class of drop down menu and then three links simple simple sally super simple sam super simple sally and sam sat on super simple sally and sam sat on the seawall super simple sally sam sat in the sandbox there we go open the sandbox and now what we're going to do is we're just going to give it so we're going to say drop down and we're going to go position relative and let's go display inline block it's going to be important and z index let's do 10. i always just use random numbers with that index i have no rhyme or reason to how i use z index all i know is that if i have if i want one element in front of the other or make sure it's in front of everything i'll put a really high number so there's your professional strategy right there okay now we want to do is we're going to say drop down double underscore hover what i'm selecting there is simply the button it has the class of drop down hover display inline block as well i want to give this a padding of 10 pixels so we're just making the button look a little bit nicer here um my fingers are typing a little slower and clunkier than usual it's a little chilly down here in the basement i mean in my super highend premium studio up in the skyscraper background color background we're going to go 323 b40 kind of reminds me of ub40 the popular british reiki band ooh baby i love your way everyday i wanna tell you i love your way every day yeah color white i'm gonna say cursor pointer save it let's check it out okay so we've got a button here looking a little bit better but i want that uh want that border gone buttons have weird borders by default in browsers so i'm going to say button no border none check it out yeah that's much better cool okay so now what we're going to do we're going to start zipping through this a bit more i've been spending a lot of time making really high quality jokes so let's get back to coding drop down hover hover that's interesting background we're gonna say two two two so a little bit of a dark gray and i'm going to also select the drop down double underscore menu and what we're going to do here is we're going to say position absolute we're going to go display none so this is the menu itself that's that div at the class of drop down under double underscore menu as a sibling to the button so display none by default top 100 left zero uh maybe what i should do is actually not display none for now so you can actually see it so i'm going to just comment that out and i'm going to show you what's going on over here so this is starting to take shape so top 100 let me just take that out to show you what happens okay nothing so far makes it seem like this isn't necessary top 100 left zero min width we're going to give it a 200 pixel min width background uh white as well and we're gonna say baby nope not that background color three two three ub4 no b40 box shadow just giggly today that's all zero three pixel two pixel and then rgba zero zero zero zero point three so a little bit transparent okay check it out so far we got a little bit of a menu here let me take this top 100 and left out let's see if it even really does anything okay it's not really mattering right now but i'm assuming the reason i just i did that was to override any browser specific defaults that might be messing with it so for example like top zero percent we'll be covering that button the parent uh which is the position relative if i do 100 it's at the it's 100 down that that height so it keeps it down there so that's good okay so now what i want to do is i want to fix those links there to make it look like a better list so i'm going to say drop down double underscore no drop down hover and then uh combine that with drop down double underscore menu okay display block when i hover it's going to be display block now remember keep in mind this is normally not displayed at all but i'm displaying it as none so the reason why i put that there is because i'm going to say display take away display none and put that back in and so now it's not there but when i hover boom it's display block so now it appears so now we're playing with an actual drop down menu okay we're going to say padding 10 pixels start making this look a little bit better text decoration none i don't want those links to have underlines border top solid one pixel one pixel e o e o e o e zero e zero e zero save it check it out so far looking better uh but those list items need to be oh you know what i didn't do this right drop down hover final drop down menu is display block but now this is going to be drop down menu a a there we go so now we're going to say those links do that that's better right there kind of things are looking a little silly we're going to say border none and also display block that's something that we need to do now this is looking much nicer in fact it's just about done so now what i want to do is say drop down double underscore menu a and then when you hover over the a elements background is going to be f o f o f o or f zero f zero f zero not f o because you can't put the letter o in there f zero color and then three two three be forty save that check it out boom boom look at that that is a nice tidy little css only drop down with only about 49 lines of css and very minimal markup just a few lines of html so there is your css only drop down menu thanks for spending some time with me today coding up the drop down menu can't wait to see you in day number 28 and don't forget good job buddy
