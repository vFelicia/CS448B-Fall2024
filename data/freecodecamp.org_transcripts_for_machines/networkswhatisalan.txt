Hi, in this video we are going to talk about what is a LAN? A LAN is a 'local area network.' So, what does it mean? Imagine you have your home and you have your own wireless router, you got your desktop connected, your laptop connected and a printer connected to this router. And your neighbor has a similar setup. He has home router, and desktop is connected, and he's got two laptops, and they're all in their own network. So now what happens is this network which is in your home is a LAN. It is local to your home and this particular network in your neighbor's house is a different LAN. So these two are two different local area networks.
