I'm sure you were starting to get like my kids doing a long drive and they're like Dad are we there yet actually that's a pretty good example for where a web hook works wonderfully my kids continually ask me that question over and over again are we there yet they keep making that request the same one over and over pulling me directly to see if we've arrived at our destination now typically my response is I'll tell you when we get there more or less what I'm promising is that when we get there I will broadcast our arrival status when that approach works like when my kids actually decide to subscribe to my status updates I can tell you that it makes things a lot easier on the whole car I don't get overloaded and they can relax they just sit there and wait for my update so much more efficient so I guess what I'm attempting to broadcast to you now is we're here we've arrived at the start of the course
