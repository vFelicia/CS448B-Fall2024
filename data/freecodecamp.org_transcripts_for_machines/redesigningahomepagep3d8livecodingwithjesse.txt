hey everybody and welcome to the live coding with Jessie and today we're gonna do something that I've never done on livestream so we're actually going to do some design work so we may do some some coding of things depending on how quickly we figure out this design but I was looking basically at you know a blank that blank area between the hero section and the footer that we have and thinking all right what are we gonna do here and I have some idea but I thought it might be good to you know kind of plan it out a little bit you know better than then I had been I think it'll save us time in the end because there's a lot of content so if I just start going in and coding I think we may end up having to change the code back and forth a lot so normally I'm ok with that and I actually preferred to just throw some code in there and see what what happens on the page but in this case there's just there's a lot of that was looking through the content there's there's so much content so at least the first part of the stream we're going to go through these are just some screenshots of the top of the site and we're gonna go through some of the things and figure out what we can cut out completely and where we want the rest of this information to go how we want to format it yeah so that's the plan I'm using sketch to do this so I know I I usually get someone who asks what what tool I'm using so this is just sketch and just took screenshots copied and pasted them into here and I'm just using the simple a pencil tool here and I'll just mark things up you know right on the screen normally I would sketch something on a notebook but you won't be able to see that so that's what I'm gonna try to do it here on the screen and let's let me check the lab chat before we get started hey everybody who's there harsh deep uh asking me to reply how's it going let's see okay everything looks good let's check and make sure I had my mic on because everybody would have saying hello there's people sent a lot with question marks and things so it is on it's registering that I'm talking so I think it think it's working all right so let's get started so just so we all are on the same page in case you haven't been watching we have this is our new version of the home page so I am a frontend developer for university working on a new homepage for the university so this is what we have so far this is just a placeholder image will get different image there's still some placeholder text here but we're probably going to end up having something here you know call to action some text and we just put this footer in a few days ago so now we need something to go here and this is the site it's Franciscan CDU so you know you could check out the site the live site if you want but I'm gonna be working with this you know this version here like I said it's just a screenshot so here's what you need to keep so we definitely need to keep I might need to change the the width let's change the thickness of this cuz that's too too fine that's good with the two of five looks like there yeah that's a little bit better alright so we have to keep this in some form we can want the thickness to stay it so I actually don't you sketch that much so that's why I'm I'm not sure how to set the thickness and make it stay like that so anyway so we can get rid of this we can I'm not sure about this I kind of I want to keep this in some form but I'm not sure what the best way to keep this is I have some ideas about this and I'll show you in a minute the events and news we need to keep these somehow this section could probably be some sort of banner like like that we deal with project one like some sort of quote quote banner like a fullwidth bar across the screen that's a solid color we could do this maybe you know just put the quote in here yeah that might work the videos I'm not sure about the videos we could potentially make them more prominent you know have them be larger and side by side you know make a whole section of it I want to I want to be careful that the site doesn't end up being longer than it already is now what we can get rid of that'll help with that is pencil I should use the shortcut well we can get rid of is this isn't that working out so good all right so we're gonna get rid of all these banner images so I've just brought in one but I mean that's every one of these sections is pretty much the same so the banner images will be gone these links on the side so I cut it off but there's a bunch of links here they're almost exactly the same links that we have in the side nav so I think we can get rid of these links we don't have to worry about that this middle section has content we'll keep that text content and then this sidebar has you can see so we have it here as well this information is almost I don't want to say we can completely get rid of it but I think it's secondary secondary information so we may want to do something like I don't know take take this and in something like this down here and put it together in its own section you know across so we can't get really get rid of a lot I mean we could sure I could try talking to my boss to see if we could get rid of even more but for now we have to deal with these sections this section for right now I'm gonna say let's get rid of this we may have to keep it while doing some weird stuff we may have to keep this section but for now I'm not gonna worry about it we'll work it in somehow later on if I if I have to keep it in so the first thing I think we should do is figure out what we're gonna do for these you know what kind of design we're gonna use they need this section needs to still be near the top of the page in the same way I think with the news and events I know my boss does not want the news and events tabbed he wants them you know both to be visible so here's what I'm thinking so we'll have our main hero section like we normally have and then the next section will be three probably three cards in those cards my first thought is this and I think maybe we ought to try it out and see how it looks because I'm not sure about it I've never done this exactly like I'm gonna well I'll tell you the idea and let let you off let me know what you think some idea is this I'm gonna take news events and then that top section that has some student profiles really the other two is to go back to this these other two here or really could fall under news and events right so same ones yeah these are both really events so I don't think we need an extra section for this so basically it'll be student highlights news events we're all gonna combine into one but since we'll have multiple ones I'm thinking that each one of these cards could basically be like a carousel that you could flip through I've never done a carousel with an entire card as the the carousel so I'd like to try it out it's not that hard to do a carousel in with materialised so I think we can get it working in a few minutes and at least get something on the page to see if it works on a small screen of course these would stack and they be swipeable you know with a touch gesture I think it's worth a shot the only thing that some details that I'm not sure about is what do we do about you know images we're gonna have images with text they want more like a traditional card like image up here text below do we want to try to an overlay I kind of think especially for the news that's going to be way too much text for just an overlay you know we also have other options like something that reveals right so you have the title here and it can slide up and reveal so I think we have a lot of leeway to try different things but let's just get something basic on the page for now so we'll probably end up going back and forth between sketch and between our code editor and just kind of putting the pieces on there and I don't want to spend too much time in sketch really because this drawing things not working out like I hoped it's hard to see and it's it's really hard to actually draw with with this touchpad I'd hope that be able to write notes and everything but it's just gonna look ugly all right so let's give this a shot so here we have let's see I don't want that let's see templates our homepage meet our homepage wireframe our testing page wireframe ok so we definitely need to make sure that we grab this data but for now we may not be able to use this data as is right because let me bring the the actual site over let's see I had it up here we go ok so sorry here we go just lost my train of thought okay now I remember so in the actual site you can see like the images are very different so if I put in the data right now as is I'm gonna get different size images and I'm gonna get this text content formatted differently in you know different tags so it's it's not even consistent you know throughout so even on here like these are not this is just regular text inside divs these are in h2 tags so there's not even really any consistency between these right now so we'll just use some some test data we'll hardcode some in there just to see what it looks looks like then what we'll have to do is go in and figure out where that data is coming from like is there another like sub template that is coming from or is a lot of this you know all in a WYSIWYG editor I'm not sure but we need to make sure that everything comes through in a more uniform way for the calendar I'm a little bit worried because we don't actually have images right unless we want to you know up here we have some images so we may need to start having images added in or to think about you know an entirely different set up I'm just I'm not sure I know that behind the scenes to manage the calendar content it's kind of a mess right now you can't just add in an event and tag it and have it show up in different places so there are several different calendars and you'd have to manually copy and paste event details into like four different places for it to get everywhere it needs to on the site so that's not ideal it might not be a bad idea to just come up with some different system I'm kind of even thinking you know pull that data in from somewhere else set up some their system so I don't know as long as its system as an API we could pull the data from it doesn't really matter what it is but anyway you know that's probably a question for later on right now we'll just get something on here and see what it looks like I'm gonna check the latch act quickly because I'm interested to see if anyone has any thoughts on this so far hmm John did make a comment here about the the idea to reveal text over images onmouseover so my thought was not to do mouse over if I was going to do it I had thought maybe to have just the title showing and then a little icon to indicate that you could click it and make the the rest of it slide up as an overlay or I mean I can show you some of the some of the options here that are already built in and materialized that we could work with or edit it if we needed to so I mean here's our basic we could do image title content and then obviously our link I mean that'll definitely work or we could do something like this where we have a reveal that slides up right so it's it's on click I I don't know I think that's that's a possibility as well it kind of depends on how much content I don't want these cards to be huge but I'd rather avoid making users click if they don't have to so although there's a benefit if we do something like this then more content could be right there on the home page users won't have to go to another page you know to get a lot of content so we'll see but those kind of decisions aren't gonna lie completely with with me that's gonna be something that you know other people here in my department will probably weigh in on but at first let's just grab if at first this simple card will get the cards laid out and then maybe we'll wrap it in a carousel and see see what we can do so I'm just gonna grab this since we're already importing everything from materialized the CSS the JavaScript this all should just work right off the bat if you remember a few days ago I completely removed all the other styles that were in this site so we shouldn't have any conflicts obviously the image is not going to work so we are going to need to replace that you know with some other image and actually we could probably grab the image URL from one of the images that are being used right now on on the site and just put that in that might not be a bad idea because it'll be you know more realistic for the type of image that we're actually going to use okay yeah okay here's our hero section I think that may remove all of this stuff right now and just start from scratch and then when we need to pull in some data you know we need to bring in something like this then we can just look at the live version and pull it in from there hmm sorry yawning I got it really earlier with with my youngest today she's almost 1 so a little bit tired it was fun though she was really cute and wanted to play all right so I think I think I can go from here and grab a bunch of this a fun I think it'll be much faster if we just start from scratch then trying to look through this I think it's just gonna be distracting okay actually we could have I think so touchy at the top here there we go okay so we probably want to keep this panel I imagine we're gonna get some errors turn if we take it out completely all right we'll probably get some errors thrown no matter what but we'll see we'll just need to remove some things from the csharp file and it should be okay alright so this already has a row I'll call them nice so let's paste that in and drop us down to two spaces there we go okay and I want to make let's make these columns exactly how we want so with materializes column class based on twelve if we want three columns across it has to be like twelve divided by three and so that's how we'll get our three columns so we can just well that was crazy and I apologize if you all can hear my stomach rumbling over here so I haven't eaten I said I'm not sure what I ate I had a blueberry muffin at like 700 a.m. so and I had a few almonds earlier so I'm really hungry hopefully you all can hear that but if you can I'm sorry see all right now we need to throw in an image so let's get let's see let's see if we can find this image copy image address okay and for now we'll just use this image and let's see what's going on yep okay all right a lot of stuff is probably gonna give us airs so the way this homepage is is built out you can actually so like you can edit it oops I want to go on I wanted to show how you can edit it right there in the page but you can somehow edit things right in the page switch to edit there we go so a lot of these sections let you do that like this so we have content blocks I I don't know that I that I care that much to leave these editable and I know I've said this before but the thing that I really want to redo this site completely from the ground up like not have it hosted on campus I want to use you know I basically set it up like we've been used setting up our other sites right so I want to have you know have cloud hosting so several you know either droplets or you know we may not go digital ocean but let's say we did we have you know a bunch of droplets all running this it would be built with react and so I'm not that worried about leaving this as you know editable in this way it's not gonna get edited frequently at least until you know let's say within the next year or so so some sections will in those sections then I'll worry about making sure that it can be edited by people who don't have access to all the files which basically it's only me right now and I think maybe two people in the IT department so I think it would just be a lot of work to try to make all these editable content blocks I don't I don't think it's really necessary right now so we are gonna hard code a lot of this stuff and then see see how it goes because we may be able to remove more stuff from the page anyway and then it would be kind of a waste to spend all the time trying to make these you know content blogs alright so let's get rid of these errors and I just remembered that I did not set my timer so let me check what time it is actually I've definitely been coding for 25 minutes let's take our five minutes to go through the live chat I'm actually really interested in what everybody's been saying while I've been going through this so I'm gonna do five minutes and I'm gonna answer questions then we're going to do another 25minute session for sure we're gonna get some stuff on the page see how it looks and then figure out what our next steps going to be all right okay Matt Grande asks if I'm working on a Mac yes I am Amit asked did you learn from free code Kim yes I learned from a lot of different places free code camp was one of them I actually have not made it all the way through free code camp so I hope to one day I've just I bounced around to a lot of different things and I frequently just get busy with work and side projects and don't I haven't had a chance to finish it yet but I think free code camp is definitely an amazing resource to start out learning web development okay Matt granddad asked on what servers is this site hosted so it's actually hosted on Windows Windows server here on campus in Steubenville Ohio so the IT department runs all the servers and it is dotnet framework so currently that's that's what we're doing Magnus says how do you break up the design of a web page are you following MVC so it's Model View controller um right now we're not really following anything because this is legacy code and we have to work with what was already there a lot so I don't have much of a strategy in terms of organization right now because there's so much there I don't know that I that I could without massive effort reorganize things into something like MVC so right now I'm just kind of checking out what's there and trying to work with it not really how I would do it if I had a chance to start this project from the beginning John Hanson says for the for the UI he said secondary things could be contained in some sort of some kind of accordion dropdown and when opened don't affect page content flow yet think I have used accordions before that's not a bad idea we can try that out as well let's get some of the cards up and we'll try out both I do want to see what it looks like with the carousel but the accordion could be it could work I think potentially see a mix working as well but accordion and carousel the accordion might work better for the events all right we'll see what it looks like i al a I'm not sure you pronounce that it's al e says what app are you using to draw the design it's called sketch it's a as far as I know it's Mac only and it's like it's a nice alternative to using Adobe products it's cheaper I think it's easier to learn at least for me it was easier to learn okay ma Mahmoud says can't the news look like a slideshow if photos in that frame but then you need to match the other frames near it yeah I definitely want to make sure that they match if we're gonna go all with the same design but I'm thinking we might be able to get away with doing something different for the middle one I think that would still look kind of balanced let's say we had cards on the two ends the end columns and then the middle column would have an accordion then we might be able to get away with let's say not even having images at all for one of those okay all right almost one are almost the end of the comments I think there's just one or two more so I'm just going to finish reading those and then I'll start the timer again so Emily says yes anything to remove those things from that beautiful building picture plus idea sounds good alright cool yeah we we happen to have really good photographers in our department so we end up getting some some great pictures sometimes and even I mean these ones on the main site I I don't think there are best pictures but it's really cool to have so much content in terms of images to choose from when I do the sites John says are you gonna remove the max width from the outer wrapper yeah definitely the max width is going to be done well I mean it's I think it's already done we can't see it right now exit to error but we definitely don't have a max width on this version of it so that is not going to be there let's see all right I'm gonna go back I'll come back so if if you have a question in there I didn't get to it I'll get to it after this next session okay so let's fix these errors so we have line 21 check it out line 21 oh yeah all this stuff has to go interesting oh alright I remember looking at this before there's some weird stuff going on give me a second interesting um I'm very interested so line 21 should have never even attempted actually maybe I'm thinking about this wrong so a csharp is compiled right is this I used to I'm obviously used to JavaScript and in JavaScript if I had an if statement the things inside the if statement wouldn't even get evaluated unless that was true so I could have errors inside my if statement and it wouldn't it wouldn't happen so what I'm having now is this if statement that should should never have run because these conditions aren't true but I'm still getting an error in here so I guess that means the C sharp is actually checking all these possibilities which I mean that kind of stinks no I I don't need I guess I'll take all these up we have panel top we don't have these so let's get rid of this for now actually I'm gonna take it out completely you know we have we have a backup and I am tracking all this in a private get repo so if I really mess it up I could always just revert back all right let's see what else we have ohho I expected more errors but all right not bad let's see it's to pull this out of it yes you can see right now it's definitely full with I probably want to have more margin than this so we'll fix that in a second but I don't know how big this image is originally but that doesn't look that bad and these are these are quite big so I imagine this image is probably larger than it needed needs to be okay all right let's let's give this marches on the side and we can do that by adding a container and I let me let me do this this let's see so I'm gonna do dot container yes all right I'm trying to learn how to do this this shortcut stuff with with Emmett dang it I copy and paste it like that because I thought that it would automatically indent it properly but it didn't anyway this should give us what we want and let me I'm gonna move this over here so I don't have to keep swiping past it let's see what this gives us whoa much smaller I don't really know that I want that much I mean this is quite a large screen so maybe when we get down lower there's less of a margin I may end up adjusting that margin that's a lot what is that settling right now oh wow so the width is 70% hmm yeah I mean that's that's small deeds oh oh oh adjust that later on I mean one good thing about setting that with like that is otherwise you have this huge range you have to cover with these images they get I mean they just get really big you could always set a max width on the cards themselves so I mean we have some options there all right so the next step is let's make at least one of these two carousel and we'll make one of these in accordion and we'll have to add in some extra data just to see you know how it would look you know if there was real data in there okay let's get the let's get the code from materialize so here so let's go down here let's grab this I don't want to carousel fool with all right let's let's initialize this carousel first we need to find our JavaScript okay so within our document dot ready function which this is shorthand for so we're using jQuery we're gonna put in this and this is just going to initialize our carousel and now I'm gonna bring in some of those cares let me see I may not need though all that I'm just trying to see what the difference is okay I am gonna need some of this so I needed to make the cards carousel items so let's make this first card I carousel item and I'll just copy this in here and then we'll grab this card we'll grab that card and we're gonna put it in here in place of each of these these panels actually what we need to do I think we should put the class carousel fixed item on the card itself so let's do that she goes that class cares so fixed item there we go and I will paste this you know maybe just two more times I'm not gonna worry about this indentation just killing me all right let's see if that's enough to make this work whoa no it's not what do we miss let's see I'm missing something do we need that HF you might need the HF hmm so let me switch up and use these cares so I don't oh I know what I did I made them all carousel fixed items and that's not what I should have done alright let's say that so in in the example the fixed item is this button so you can see the button stays there even though the background changes so that's not what you want let's see if that made a difference Wow still didn't make a difference hmm okay it just keeps getting worse I'm gonna take one more look at the demo stuff actually I should take a look at at the console see if we're getting some sort of error are we getting where are we talking about fancy bugs oh there I thought we got rid of that did we get rid of that that's really weird mine I'm not preserving the log all right so you all see this I'm getting an error for something that I had already removed unless this isn't a different part maybe have it twice now this may not be related to why the this other stuffs not working or though yeah because I mean we have this working so that's probably not a problem here but maybe it's maybe they have that in the and the header somewhere now it is here all right then let's get rid of that and obviously couldn't find it because we weren't using that okay so not probably not our problem for down here but still good to get rid of that that error okay that's going all right now let's see what's going on with these okay so we've got to care so I don't well I think something has is probably getting overridden in here because it looks like I mean you can see the JavaScript is taking effect or these are all added dynamically right so we have a display so this is supposed to display and which should happen okay oops haha okay this is what I did I am I copied this whole thing so I've actually made three different carousels so I'm sure one of you already pointed that out to me sorry I didn't check the live chat sooner but that's why that's why I were just playing it three times because I told it to display it three times okay whoops that last div no I think we're fine let's double check though okay so I need to remove this div and then add in a div down here okay all right now let's see I really need to get some sort of Auto formatting plugin okay so that's not exactly what I wanted to happen but I removed a bunch of stuff just to test it so that's how it's coming up this is the default carousel I actually kind of like this but not for a card obviously there's not enough space for that it would have to be I couldn't fit three in a row here but we can see carousels working so let's just add in our let's see what was that class name okay so slider and we may also have to add in full with true let's try this first yeah we need full with true let's go here and let's make sure okay let's see if this does the trick kind of almost let's see what's going on here I wonder if it would make more sense then mmm I was thinking about making the column leave the care so yeah but that's that's not gonna work that would then make this full width alright so this might not be so easy with materialised not to say we couldn't make it work the way we want it but at least for right now it's not it's not working out exactly as we want yeah let's let's check this let's see what we're getting the width from oh okay it's it's actually set to 200 pixels all right I don't want that we can get okay that's better okay not perfect but you can see basically this is this would be more of the behavior that we would get it's kind of a little weird flash there I don't like that was hmm for some reason this is getting cut off why is it it's an interesting okay the Charis Charis the carousel itself is too short that's the problem oK we've made it a bit bigger there we go let's take that light off it yeah whoa so I guess it needs some kind of fight this this may be more modification than it's really worth maybe we should think up a different different way to do this yeah it's not like we can really give it a fixed height because this should change based on the width I don't know let's let me take the last chat quickly cuz I see a lot of stuff in here okay I guess like I mean I could for now manually give it some a better height let's see you got an idea said why not just set max Heights we can see if that'll bring it back no I mean it's possible that if I refreshed it yeah actually when I got a knock at the door a thing gets my kids so they might be on the show hey you wanna be on YouTube look at this camera right there you see the little green light that's what they can see you say hi look at the green light and say hi this green it's that was my threeyearold Ambrose and my wife brought me some food so that was awesome Ambrose is a cute little man he's very ordinary now so they say they talk about terrible twos he was fine as a twoyearold but three is just like he's been crazy since he turned 3 so but he's so cute like it's hard to stay mad at him yesterday I got a text from my wife and it was a picture of him in the bathtub with all his clothes on so I get it and a bunch of toys like non bath toys so I guess he had just grabbed a bunch of stuff and got in so he does stuff like that and it's cute and he also took all the shampoo and dumped it out in the bathtub and it was pretty much full so but I mean that's a the little kids are so they do crazy stuff you'd be really mad at an adult for don't for doing but they're kids and they keep see let's get back let me check my timer and see where was that I haven't checked it in a while oh my timer is up yeah that makes sense okay let me do let me go back I'll do five more minutes in the live chat and I wanted I think we'll do another 25minute session after five minutes because I didn't even get to try out the accordion and obviously we have not figured out how to do this I have used this carousel with materialised on sites before but it's been probably six months since the last time I worked with it so I know it can work and I've got it working before just not working yet so I see there's some some suggestions in the live chat so after this 5minute break I'll try out some of your suggestions and and then give the accordion a shot let's see let me scroll up a bit Peter asks how to learn to code how to find motivation how to get advanced I really want to learn how to code but I haven't found any motivation to learn to code I have many reasons but I can't find motivation let's see and Blake asks well why do you want to learn to code Peter says for a job experience ethical hacking and being able to create my own programs and analyst says don't look for motivation because you can't look because you can't wait forever choose to be more disciplined Blake says so you want to be successful Peter said yeah okay and Pete Peters only in his teens so Jambi says don't try to learn everything at once take one step at a time Blake says you could try to Pomodoro Technique okay yeah so my advice for that is there could be a lot of different reasons for lack of motivation right I mean if you've got a lack of motivation for a really long time maybe maybe codings not really for you you know but occasionally lack of motivation could be died tied to you know exercise diet mental health just whatever other stuff you have going on relationships like there's so many other factors that have nothing to do with coding that could be causing a lack of motivation so I would say first off is think about what else is going on in your life that could possibly be causing that I mean I'm not like a counselor or anything like that but just from my own experience a lot of times my lack of motivation has nothing to do with the code it's other things so think about that if you can find where you think the problem is and fix it and do something to get rid of that problem or overcome it then great maybe you'll have more motivation but in the meantime I would try setting some goals some you can have your main goal but try to break it down into really short manageable goals so Blake had mentioned the Pomodoro Technique and let me just share with you you know if you haven't seen it already on the stream I'm going to share with you my Trello board my technique that I use here so I have broken up my tasks into small chunks into Pomodoro sessions which is a 25minute session I do 25 minutes that take a five minute break if I repeat that four times the fourth break is a ten minute break but you can see these little numbers here in in blue these are how many sessions I think something's gonna take and try to never assign eight or more sessions to thing because then that's that's too large of a chunk it's hard to estimate try to keep it as small as possible and then it's it's easier because you if you'll see that you're moving things over you know you're moving things to the done list your todo list gets smaller and your done list gets bigger and that's its it is kind of motivating to be able to see that and instead of thinking like I have to make this huge project you just know usually what I do what I try to do and I don't always do this consistently is at the beginning of the week I look at my schedule how many meetings are having things like that and I think about how many Pomodoro sessions can I reasonably do this week and I'm just throwing out a number let's say I decide I can only do 20 this week I look up here and I put over here and they're ready for dev I put in there 20 worth of of tasks right so I want this all to add up to 20 then for that week I know what I have to do and I just keep moving it over to in progress moving it over to done if I don't get through them all then maybe I need to you know be really more realistic with my estimates I adjust the next time if I flew through them all too fast then maybe I you know I need to adjust differently but that way I broke I have my big project my big picture is the whole Trello board then I have it broken down by week then I have it broken down by into small chunks so you know sometimes as small as a 25minute session or I can even go a half sometimes I have a half a session so that helps me sometimes especially when I'm not motivated if I can look over here and say all right this is super easy this will be an easy win for me to get some confidence and get started at add a favicon right great I'll move that over you know let's say this sounds too intimidating for me all right fine this is going over here I'm not gonna worry about it for now let's let's add this I know I can get this done so I do this and it moves to done and I think yes I have one one already that's done it just helps out so make something like this if you don't have a project to work on now you can make something like this for your studies right so look at an online course or something like that and break it down you know try to break it down if it's a really large course maybe each chapter could have its own Trello board and then within the chapter you might have sections I mean however whatever breakdown makes sense for you but the bottom line is you break it down into very very small manageable chunks and then you get little wins little and it just builds so that's my advice it's it works for me it's not like magic that I'm really efficient now and productive some days I am some days I'm not but this really helps me to be consistent get things done and I can always look back and be accountable and say man I did not do a lot of you know tasks today or this week or whatever like what's going on so there's other benefits as well but for your situation in terms of motivation you know I think this would you potentially be beneficial they move these back and my five minutes timer is up so I didn't get through very much but I want to try to implement some of these solutions for for this just going to spend a few minutes more on this what's supposed to be here this carousel and if I can't get it working then we'll just leave it and we'll move on and we'll throw an accordion here in the middle and see how that looks and depending on how much time we have after that left in the session we may you know just quickly throw in another section in here we'll see alright so here's a suggestion height hundred percent and I excite four hundred wheel quit okay alright good idea so oops I'm looking here let's try this out No let's see if I can just do lights oops yeah okay and I'll actually want more than 400 there huh okay so so basically something like this is what I was thinking now this is not exactly what I want so let's see where the dots at doubt lay down here I don't know that this will work out as it is now so I may have to if I really want to carousel here I may end up having to make find another plug in or just make our own carousel because evidently I need a fixed width I can't have a percentage with that's going to be kind of tough potentially what I could do is just get rid of these completely and then add in my own icons and then have those shift the cards that's an option I could do that I've done that before with this carousel so if I were going to use this what I would probably do is I mean I fixed the styling I don't want this centered anymore but I would probably have some sort of icons either in the middle maybe if the table some sort of arrow icons so that there'd be an indication that you could skip through the through the carousel so also though there's there's still the problem of that that height so we'll see I still am open to suggestions on how to display that content the only restrictions we have for that content in terms of the so will be featured student profiles news and events so the only restrict sorry I left because one of my coworkers was peeking in through the window and I don't know if they wanted me or they were just trying to get on YouTube so the only restrictions are that those three content types are visible at the top so let me zoom out so they're visible at least somewhat at the top that's it and we have to be able to play multiple pieces of that content so it doesn't have to be like this the only other restriction I would add is it has to fit in somewhat with material design style I don't care if we go if we go a little bit you know then in our more creative but it has to be that so let's see and the suggestion to set a height and a max height was from Alexander so thank you okay so let's let's do an accordion here and so we'll grab did I forget to set forget to set my timer okay well if we remember we'll end this at about five minutes left on the timer so somewhere between five and ten minutes left so let's checkout materialize for our accordion I think they call collapsible yeah there we go so you said they do the collapsible and we gotta initialize this so let's just copy over this initialize first and yeah I'll probably want it like this with a preselected section so we'll just need to put active on there okay we probably do want it like this okay all right I want to try the pop out I like how it looks the only problem is I have seen some like Jang keenest when the pop out is used on phones so I don't know if there's been any improvement since the last time I tried this it has been a while so if I notice when I'm testing like if we do use this and I notice when testing that it's kind of janky on some machines then I'll probably go with this oops so this section we have this card here this column is now going to be our accordion section let's check it out whoa so I guess I'm not importing any icons right now so that's definitely not gonna look like that where's that pop out actually let me move this on my other screen here for a second then I don't have to keep flipping back and forth as much pop out and we want to make this active see where that needs to go so we add the active class to the header and then that's going to make sure that it's open right off the bat okay now let me see so I think it was John Hansen that had the idea for an accordion is this like you're thinking I mean ignore the weirdness going on here because I'm not importing the icon font but is this what you were thinking or am I am I mistaken that so I guess I'm thinking this would end up being the events and at this top part would be the date and then date of event and brief title and then more info would be down here probably including a link as well and I'm wondering how small this actually would get yeah I'm not sure that I'm not sure the three columns is it's doable for this content and then when we get down you know even even at this screen with it's still kind of tight yeah I'm not sure hmm okay let's John says four columns are much easier to work with I mean I was kind of thinking that the these columns are too narrow so I was thinking the other way of you know this content maybe needs to be two columns or at least maybe I don't know I guess I could do something like this I think we actually think we'd have to do something like this you get to change the column classes so that it's medium is 12 and then large it goes to 4 so let's see it should be about 900 but see when we do that though these get huge like that yeah it's I don't know it's not really a simple a simple fix for for this section I think all right let's make one more section I think I just I would like to think about with this section here but let's do one more section and I want to try out that let's see image on the right drop down on left J says image on right drop down on left and then call them 6o hmm so basically we'd have two columns yeah knowing is we have three pieces of content so that third piece would just be hanging out yeah I I mean I can mess around with different calls and things but let's make let's let's do this so if we're gonna do I added this container class here but I'm not gonna put this next row inside that container class so let me make sure yeah it's so what I'm gonna do is outside that container class I'm gonna put in a div and I will need to make it and make it a row and then within that row we'll just have actually for now for now let's just give it an H tag it'll be more than an H tag though for now but or eventually so let's give it an h2 and we want this to be I'm gonna put these in line for now eventually they go in a CSS file color I'm gonna make the background color that for now I don't know that I would actually want that to be the real background color but I have that hex code memorized so we're gonna go with that and then the banner would be white text let's see now I didn't give it a height so we'll see what it there we go said it did something here maybe it's not I typed in white test white text and we could we could either give this a fixed height which actually that might not be a bad idea so what we can do is say let's give it a class of feline container and give this lets get 300 pixels or I'm sorry not a width a height 300 pixels let's see see what that gives us okay not bad actually this was supposed to be see where that's not working maybe it's not it maybe it's just supposed to be via line so materialise comes built in with some vertical alignment classes which evidently I'm not using properly I still have the materialized documentation feline Oh feline rapper that's it so it's not VLAN containers feeling rapper and then I'm also she's that centers the text as well I was waiting for the auto refresh again which does not happen okay let's put the center on here see if it works no I just not working all right let's go okay so when you do a margin0 auto so that's the top and bottom margin is 0 and then Auto means I mean basically you split the right and left margins equally so let's let's give that a shot no something must be why is it doing this that's interesting and this should see that soon now what did I do I missed I messed up the syntax did I know I didn't why is it then not being applied oh yeah I did mess it up there we go supposed to be equals there we go all right so that works so essentially I'm thinking of where is in the main site we had let me show you the main site again on the main site we have section breaks with you know these big images which that takes a lot to load those images I'm thinking no we don't need those huge images but it's still nice to break up all that white space so we have something like this a banner I don't know that I would make the banner this big normally unless we had content that warranted it being that big but usually I like I don't know let's say around 50 pixels of padding depending on what's what's in here so 50 above and 50 below whatever text is in there yeah so we would have it like this to break up sections I think I said earlier I was thinking that so like like maybe this quote would be a good thing to put in a banner to break things up and then between each section we could potentially have some sort of banner that might not be a bad place to put things like this that are in this column so you or you know down here we have things in this column so we'd have to see like and you have things like this where it's you know other calendars are also in here I don't I don't know that I want to have multiple calendars it might be better that one calendar and that calendar could be filtered instead of having lots of calendars so I'm not sure like this could definitely be you know one of those sections you know where we have you know a bunch of videos yeah all right so that's the idea oh that's the plan now the that's up for it is okay well I mean this section is probably going to be one of the toughest sections the rest of the sections are pretty straightforward I need a title and I need text content potentially I could do column select for this section I could have the text content taking up half this space and then right next to it taking the other half I could have this we've probably change this into a card but it could definitely do that other sections will be a little bit more complicated like this one also I'm gonna remove these images in these images to get rid of just to get rid of even more images that don't really need to be there but that's basically going to be the pattern so I think what I'll probably do is I'm still working on infinite putting the finishing touches on project two but then as soon as I'm done with that I'm gonna be doing more work on this during the day so I won't necessarily be doing all of this you know for the stream so some little get done and you know off stream but you know I'll give recaps of what was done so I think I'm probably almost out of time on a timer yeah because we started this late right so this is actually almost on the zero now so now that I've kind of shared as as best as I could try to explain what my vision is for this I'm definitely open to suggestions just keep in mind overall I want it to be clean I want to use as few images as possible and I want to try to keep as much of the content as possible although I'm like I am open to taking some out right so we are moving some of this we don't need to keep these menus so if there is content that happens to be repetitive it you know if it's the same as other content on the page I'm ok with maybe trying to take that out so anyway any suggestions you have I definitely appreciate that except I've said this before but I have to do design because we don't really have a web designer but I don't really consider my strong suit to be design so a lot of my design is trial and error and asking other people their opinions you know testing things out so anyway at this point I'm gonna go over to the live chat and finish up I did have oh I had one awesome announcement that I I don't want to forget so I'm gonna say it right now so some of you may remember that at one point I was submitting proposals for talks to conferences and one of them got accepted so I've gotten a few rejections but I did get accepted so I will be speaking at November November 27th and 28th in Nashville Tennessee so I don't know which day I'll be speaking or what time yet I just accepted the the invitation to speak and so get this my topic that I had given in is how live coding changed my life so I'm gonna be talking about all of you at the November conference so if you're in the area or or your like if your company pays to go to conferences or something or you just happen to be super rich and can fly wherever you want come check out November and yeah hopefully they put it on they put the talks on YouTube that would be cool and then everybody could see it before whenever I said I was submitting talks I think we had some talking a lot chat about how it would be nervewracking to give a talk in front of those people and I said oh I'm not I don't worry about that right well now that I actually got accepted I'm a little nervous the thought of it is is I don't know I've never been to this conference so I don't know what to expect I have no idea how big it is how many people will be there the others some of the other speakers that I know will be there I've seen them speak before they speak all over the world at the biggest conferences so I mean now those are the keynote speakers I'll just be giving I don't even know what it'll be called but you know it'll be probably at most 45 minutes maybe a half hour I don't know so anyway I'm super excited about that and I actually I applied to another con from confidence after this and I sent in a proposal for talk to another conference that'll be next year in Charleston South Carolina so anyway yeah I was actually just starting to think like you know what maybe talking to conferences isn't for me nobody's been interested in my proposals and then I woke up this morning and there it is I got an email I almost just deleted the email cuz every email I get has been we're sorry but you can come to the conference anyway if you pay for a ticket but luckily I didn't delete it I scrolled down and saw congratulations and was like this has to be a mistake right anyway cool enough enough about about that let me get to your questions I'm gonna try to get through all the questions and I wonder Patrick's I don't think Patrick's here today in the live chat but Patrick is from Tennessee so hopefully Patrick can either come to the conference or if he's close enough in Tennessee maybe it would be cool to meet up or something like that I actually I think that would be really cool that if I end up going to conferences you know elsewhere or if you all end up in the area I mean probably the only place would be a conference near me would be Pittsburgh but it would be cool to try to meet up you know in real life somewhere not in like a creepy sort of way but like at a public place or like a coffee shop kind of way you know and then maybe even I mean it'd be cool to even do like a little video or something if we got together and then show it on the livestream depending on the WiFi we could probably live stream from my phone but anyway let's let me scroll back up excited I tell you what my wife was super excited because immediately she was like are you gonna take me she always wants to travel and she actually has a lot of family in in Tennessee right around Nashville so that'll be cool for her she'll get to visit with some relatives trying to find trying to find where I left off at okay Sebastian says materialise has a class for large screens in my screen I guess it's a mediumsized that looks pretty good with that margin okay yeah the the smaller size margin looks okay it just looked like it was too big for the large screen sebastian asks why does the free code can't tag not popup when I start writing so anyway I'll show you Sebastian it pops up for me I don't know what was going on but pops up also I always say this I forgot to say it this time because I have a decent amount of viewers still the last part of this is all question and answer so I'm not going to be doing any more like coding work for this stream so if you're not interested in the question answer totally understand or you know if you gotta go that's that's cool too but I would like it if you can stay to stick around even if you don't have a question because I love to have your expertise in helping to answer these questions because I certainly you know have limited knowledge there's just way too many things going on in web development to have all the bases covered so so if you can stick around and help out wonderful if you have a question you know put that in the live chat and and we'll get through it I'll try to get through all the questions I don't have any meetings or anything to go to so other than being really hungry there's no reason for me to stop the stream right in the house see if Sebastian says that indentation I know it's driving me crazy I need to get some sort of weight shift alt f4 auto format okay so load Bojan says shift alt f4 auto format whoa cool nice is it really nested that deep I guess it is crazy all right so so far this dream the most useful comment goes to Bo Jan that's amazing shift old F Auto formats in Visual Studio code that you just you just made my day because that indentation was killing me Simon Says what language for backend if you mean what language am i using for this project it's csharp it's dotnet asp.net if you if it's more of a general question as to what language I prefer for backend it would be node no jazz Blake asks about how I did the carousel card effects John said builtin the material you I actually i'm using materialized I get them mixed up to note I'm using both of them materialized CSS has it built in it's a jQuery plugin that's that's built in to materialize Blake's asking if you can use material UI with just regular HTML as far as I know um no I don't think so I think yeah I mean it's maybe it's possible to change a few things and make it work but if you're using regular HTML I I go with materialize because it's made for that and then if I'm the one react I go with material UI so it's a little bit different you know switching back and forth in terms of what the code looks like in classes and things you have to remember but in terms of what users see that's very similar John Hanson said Jessie likes to square peg into a round hole yeah I guess that's accurate okay I got to the part of the live chat when when my son Ambrose was in there so hi everybody saying hi and so cute so so thanks John B says very awesome wife and kid thank you I appreciate that yeah that's fun my kids don't come often to my office but it's fun when they when they do come I think it's good for kids to see like maybe it's nice when my kids see me working right cuz when I'm home well I do work from home too but a lot of times when I'm home like I'm just relaxing you know I don't want my kids to grow up thinking like Oh dad's just that guy that lays around all day not that I laid around all day at home but I don't want my kids thinking that that's their concept of an adult male it's just some guy that comes home and eats dinner and just hangs out right I like for them to think of me also as being like working hard so I think it's cool for the for my kids to see me you know at work and at home anyway that's that's my parenting philosophy moment for the day okay so Blake says I'm doing the algorithms on free code camp and I feel like I just look it up and I'm not getting any help yeah some of the algorithms can be tough I mean I guess my thing with the algorithms is I'm pretty stubborn with it so it takes a long time for me to to look something up I'm more likely to be honest with you I'm more likely to just quit and do something else than I am to look it up which is probably part of the reason why it's taking me years to get through free code camp all the free code camp challenges but my thing is like if if it's taking a really really long time sometimes it is better to try to look it up I mean I try to look up as little as possible so that I can try to get as much of it as I can on my own but sometimes you just have to and then maybe the next ones you know sometimes it's just you know that we just don't see the answer and then once we see the answer it's like oh that's obvious you know so I guess it's just like just to try to keep on moving and just have momentum do your best without looking it up but if you have to don't worry about it you can always go back and try it again later once you give your brain a little while to kind of forget I found like a lot of the stuff I did on free code camp you know like two years ago I don't really remember at all so when I go back now and try to do it I look at what I did before and I can say like oh I would do it differently now and sometimes I do redo the problems differently like especially you know I use like es2015 syntax you know what it cleans things up a lot it's just I don't know I think as long as you keep trying and you're persistent you're still going to get something out of it the key is just to do a little bit every day even if you don't get the problem right at least you're thinking and you're working you're seeing you know JavaScript syntax like it's gonna stick in your brain eventually it may not seem like it's short term but longer term in a couple months you know you should be able to look back and say like man I'm so much farther along than I was then you know you'd be able to look at some of your code like look at some of the exercise you did on free code camp a few months back and say wow I would you know I'd be able to solve this so much faster now so I don't know I mean keep at it I've definitely had those moments where I'm like man I'm just stuck it just feels like I'm not getting anywhere but you know try to do your best to work through it all right so I don't know how easy that was to see on the screen but traphouse sent a note just put a racist comment in the live chat so I will have none of that in my live chat so that that person is is blocked and message is deleted so I'm sorry that I even had the live chat on the screen so that someone may have seen that so I apologize to anyone who saw that and was offended by that so yeah so I don't I guess there's not really an official code of conduct that I've ever posted for the live chat but we try to keep everything like polite you know and nice so you know we don't I don't there's no reason to be be mean or vulgar or offensive in a live chat about writing code right I don't mind if we have heated discussions about which code editor is the best but I don't want to get personal about any you know anything else so anyway so 99.9% of every comment that's ever been in the live chat has been entirely fine this is in fact the first time there's ever been any sort of racist comment on here although somebody get into a fight in some other language for someone else so there could have been crazy stuff but I just couldn't read it because it was in some language I don't know so anyway just just a reminder not that you all need that like I said everybody's pretty good so just something to keep in mind let's see speech direction I should be left alone a healthy standard says only love and only love positive people yeah that's it that's what we want here ha ha Bryant says Adam is obviously the best code editor that's a nonissue I don't want to start another debate we've had so many code editor discussions in here let's see Blake says thanks for the tips I just looked at my map and realized that it had skipped me far ahead I was wondering why I hadn't heard about some of the concepts all right maybe that was the whole problem and maybe if you go back I have you a lot easier for you that would definitely make things difficult Blake's in response to Brian's saying Adams the best code editor Blake says you meant Visual Studio code right Rowan says you mean which is the best editor and why not Emacs that would not I know you guys are just messing around but we're at the end of the question answer session I'm not going to get into editors again if you want to talk about editors go into the slack channel for for this stream you could you could start a whole channel and slack a whole discussion that could just be editors and it's fine with me Roman says hello from Russia hey how's it going thanks for watching hi John B says privyet the Roman marshal cool alright I got to the end of the last yet so thanks everyone for watching thank you for all your help didn't get quite as much done as I wanted to I definitely got tripped up by that carousel working like I wanted it to I'm sure it was probably user error on my part I will be on today's Friday right so I'll be back on Monday I have a great weekend everyone and I don't thing I have anything else for you right now anyway you are awesome today as always yeah I'll be back and trying to find the button to stop the stream here it is so I'll be back on Monday again have a great weekend and see you later
