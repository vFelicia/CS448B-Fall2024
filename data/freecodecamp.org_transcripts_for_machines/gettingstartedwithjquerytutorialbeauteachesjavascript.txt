jquery is a very popular lightweight javascript library the purpose of jquery is to make it much easier to use javascript on websites jquery simplifies a lot of the complicated things from javascript like ajax calls and dom manipulation to use it you can either download it and host it yourself or you can just link to a cdn a lot of people just use a cdn so to do that you just go into your html file and put this line so right within the head tag you can see we have the head tag here and inside that you're gonna put this line script and source equals and then you just link to the jquery here the jquery cdn if you can't remember what that is you can just go to google and type in jquery cdn and you can also download it from jquery.com and if you are creating something on codepen like i am right now there is an even easier way to add jquery you just go to settings and then on the javascript tab quick add you go down to jquery and you just click save and close and then you you don't even have to put the script here it adds it for you so down the javascript code here i'm going to show you the basic syntax of jquery you're always going to start with the a dollar sign and then in parentheses you're going to put a selector now this selector can be any css selector and then you're going to put dot and then you're going to put the action so whatever action you're going to have jquery perform with that css selector so to get rid of this i'm just about to copy and paste some code that has three jquery commands and we're going to talk about those okay so here are three jquery commands so this first jquery command is is kind of special you're usually going to want to put your entire code in a document.ready event so document.ready just means when the document is ready or when the document is completely loaded then you're going to run the rest of your code if you don't put your code in a document.ready event your code may try to access an element from the html that has not yet loaded so this just selects the document and when it's ready it runs this code so now let's look at the code inside the document.ready event again we start with the dollar sign and then with the css selector button is just going to select the the button tag right here and then we're going to add a click action or a click event so this is going to be the action click and when the button is clicked we're going to run the command that's inside that so inside we have another jquery command you know it's jquery because it starts with a dollar sign and then we're going to select the p tags and we're going to hide them so there's two p tags here you can see these two right here so if i click the belt button the p tags are hidden i'm just going to reset that and we're going to change the code a little bit so i'm just going to change this one right here i'm going to change this to serial with the hash sign or the pound sign right before this that's just the css selector for id so you can see up here id of serial so now it's going to select this whole thing right here so if we run that and then we click the button it just hid the paragraph element with the id of serial and you can see these two lines one of them is a has a paragraph tag one of them has a div tag but they both have the same class of unicycle so if we just use the css dot unicycle that's how you would show a class the dot if i click the button it hides everything that's unicycle and i'll show you one more way you can mix this up here we've been selecting the button to add the click event but we can also make this h3 so we can we can really add the click event to anything and now we're going to hide the button so let's see what happens there when i click the button now nothing happens but if i click the heading the button disappears okay that's just a quick introduction to jquery i'm going to be going over more information about jquery in future videos thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
