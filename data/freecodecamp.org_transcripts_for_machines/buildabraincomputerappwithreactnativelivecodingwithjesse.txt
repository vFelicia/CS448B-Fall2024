hey everybody it's jesse i know it's it's been a while it's been uh since new year's since i did a stream on free code camp uh so i'm happy to be back and uh i have a new mic so let me know how it sounds if anybody can hear me i actually got the uh i got a nice upgrade here so this is one of the uh yeti um microphones uh so i saw a lot of a lot of streamers using those had good reviews so i figured you know i've been doing this for a while maybe i better upgrade and i was doing some podcasts lately and the audio quality is obviously very important but today i want to program something that's going to work with with this little headset uh this is the let me see if i can get the logo and plug it to neurocity uh notion headset and so once we get it hooked up maybe i'll try putting it on and see what we can do with it but the uh i did a video on my channel kind of introducing what this thing could do and doing a little demo of it so if you're interested in learning more about that particular headset uh check out my my youtube channel links in the description and uh you can see it was one of like the last few videos i did you'll see that one in there but today i want to actually code a an app a react native app that will run on on mobile that will sync up with this headset and allow you to do some stuff so phase one of this app is gonna be uh just just sync the device up and track your focus and if you start to lose focus we're gonna do something on the phone so i haven't decided for sure yet maybe vibrate the phone or make a little noise something like that that's gonna be like the mvp phase one that i'd like to actually get out on the app store after that i think it'd be cool to maybe add more features uh see if you could make more things happen uh in terms of focus i'd love to be able to have it run on uh like android auto so you could track your focus while you're driving and get an alert if you start to lose focus so uh there's some some cool things you could do beyond just focus you can also train gestures so if like i said check out the video if you want to learn more about it but basically it's possible with this device to think about doing something like moving your arm something whatever whatever you want to think about and then trigger an action so any action you can think of uh for either something on the internet or an internet of things connected device so i'm hoping to do a lot of cool stuff with this but first step is we just need to get it hooked up and working with an app and so that's what we're going to start with so basically all i've done uh if you haven't seen my my live stream before the idea is i it's there's no prep work beforehand i don't rehearse or even do that much research beforehand because i wanted to be uh as authentic as possible in terms of uh what a developer would go through when they're approaching new problems uh and trying to solve things on the fly so uh i'm gonna set a little timer we're gonna code during the timer when the timer goes off i'm gonna check the live chat so there's a lot of activity in the live chat and i just wanna say hey to everybody in the chat now and let you know i'm not ignoring your questions i'm going to get to all your questions and comments but i'm just going to code a little bit first okay so i actually didn't get my timer up beforehand so let me let me do that now i'm going to do that on another screen hey let me show you my screen while i'm doing this there we go now you don't have to look at me as much my timer i've lost my timer app oh well um i just need a pomodoro timer i was using a pomodoro timer that somebody who used to watch the live streams made and i had it up on my screen but i close it and let's do let me just get give you the basics of what i've done here in the code first all i did was scaffold a project using expo uh so expo is a um a way to use react native uh that if you're not familiar with react native react native is using javascript to build android and ios and web apps right expo helps you to do that it makes react native easier to work with so i just used exo expo i'm on this is pretty much the latest version there might be some minor versions after this but uh we're pretty up to date if you hear noise in the background that's my kids i have four kids and they're all running around so uh you may hear that hey i'm i'm doing a live stream right now ambrose i'm sorry if nobody wants to go outside with you buddy can i eat your cookie go ahead upstairs you already had ice cream but i want to have your cookie dough no eat your ice cream and be good want cookie dough bites gemma you already had cooked up boys please take your sister upstairs here you want to stay with me yeah all right look why don't you sit over there and you can watch the live stream okay you want to do that all right buddy all right sorry about that my my fiveyearold's very upset gemma please go upstairs my father was very upset because no none of his siblings wanted to go outside with him so um so uh it's ambrose all right so the um where was i totally on track oh react native so we're using react native uh with expo and we were just going through the package json basically my my point of going through this was i'm pretty sure we're like pretty up to date on most of the packages so um we should be pretty good with that we are using typescript as well so typescript um is something you can use with javascript to help have uh be like a more strongly typed uh version of javascript uh there's a ton of info about typescript out there so i'm not going to take a ton of time to explain it but basically like the javascript you see might have a few things that are different than normal in there that's probably typescript otherwise it works just like normal javascript all right so let me slide this over and just show you what i have so far i just took the boilerplate that expo gives you that lets you run an app and i added in some of this authentication stuff now let me copy and paste in the starter um github repo into the chat so you all can check out the github repo that i'm going to be pulling some code from and i haven't put my code on github yet but i will and i'll include that link in the in the description so the the creators of the nerosity notion brain computer have already made a react kind of getting started repo so it's for react not for react native but i think we can use it and make it work to authenticate and be able to sync up our device with um with an app so that's where i pulled some of this code from the the only thing that i think won't work is so they're using this uh local storage stuff we don't have local storage on um an app right there's different storage so we're gonna probably not be able to use that uh otherwise i think we should be able to reuse a lot of this code okay so i got basically to the point where i needed to put in some text inputs and that's where i i kind of stop so we need the user to input a little bit of data from their device so everybody's going to have a different device id and that they're going to need to use everybody who uses the app so we need to provide them with some some inputs right and let's let's actually run a version of this app uh let's see if we can do so expo lets you run it i wonder if it's going to let me run as a web app i don't want to run it on my phone because i want you all to be able to see it so let's see if i can uh run this if i could do like w yep there we go so it didn't list it as an option but if you hit w you can open it as a a web app so let's see if it'll if it'll run i may have messed it up when i copied and pasted this stuff yeah and i did so let me pull this over and just show you so we're getting an error because of that local storage stuff so let's take that out uh we can keep this in so these are our react hooks right so um we can keep this in and just say use state and instead of device id let's go let's just give it an empty string for now and we have this what is this navigate thing here um let's comment this out for now and the innovation device id we don't have a device id so okay this is covered and we need to rid of this subscription set user we're set user okay all right let's see if we can at least get it to run all right cool so we got it to run so you can see let me make this bigger so that's the the text that we have so we actually have this app running now we're running it in kind of web mode so it's not exactly the same as running it on a mobile device but it's going to give us a good idea without having to go through everything about like running a mobile simulator it's going to give us a pretty good idea what our our app is doing at least to be able to say like does it even even work am i getting like crazy errors so that's a good start um but we need the user to be able to put in some data right so we need the device id that's probably the most important thing and set users to delay cities yeah so we definitely need a text input for device i id so you can see i've already pulled in text input from react native react native comes with um a bunch of components like by default so we're going to put in a text input down here so instead of this text that we just saw let's throw in a text input and we could change this text to say um make your notion the headset is called the notion headset and let's put in text input and i don't think we need like that let's look up what all the props are that go into a text input right so let's go back to our our chrome here and let's look look uh react native text input and uh in about about 15 minutes i'm gonna go back to the chat and read a bunch of stuff so if you're if you're in the chat commenting i will definitely get to those comments and i i don't intend to ignore the comments there we go this is the react native documentation and this will give us just a little example um yeah actually let's just copy and paste this example and that'll give us a good place to start hey ambrose can you uh don't dribble basketball while i'm doing this because i make a lot of noise okay buddy thank you all right so i'm not gonna mess with the style yet i'm not that worried about the style uh this at first we're just gonna try to get this working and then we can make it look nicer to be honest i'm going for kind of a really minimal interface anyway uh but we have unchanged text but in this case what i want to do here is uh add the device id so if we look at our hooks up here we have set device id as our hook so we're going to change this to set device id okay and now every time a user types in here it's going to give us it's going to change the state for this component the device id state and for the value we're going to put in device id okay so what this will do for us is this makes this input now what we call a controlled input or controlled component because the value is now controlled by our component state so the value is the state and when you change the value of the input it updates state let's save it and see if it see if it worked let's go back here yep and look we have we have that and if we check so let's let's inspect this and see if we can uh see the state updating i'll make this a lot bigger we should be able to see the state updating for our see if we could find our root component let's get rid of that maybe it's app yeah all right so here we go here's our state and we can see as the type the state changes so it's working at least that's that's working right now our uh let's go back to our code let's see what we need to send so we need a user all right so if we make a to create a new notion all we need is the device id so we may be able to test that out right away let's talk about our user set user so we're getting the user from subscribe here so we don't need to to input the user so we may be able to try it out to see if we can sync this device yeah let's give that a shot all right cool so we're gonna need to change the code just a bit though so if there's a user we set user i want some type of indication though that this is actually working so let's add in a little bit of text here and say if user then let's render a little text it says logged in okay that way we'll know it worked so what this is doing is it's checking that state for user which should be empty let's double check that so user is now is set to null at first but if we successfully log login with our device then we should be able to subscribe and get a user and then that will set the user then down here will detect that there is a user and we'll say okay now let's display the text logged in okay so if you're not familiar with react or react native this might be a little bit confusing to you feel free to ask some questions i'll try to explain as much as i can in about 10 minutes i'm gonna take a break and and look at the questions here but let's give this a shot now if i miss something i'm sure it'll throw an error and we can uh we can fix that uh but for now i think we have let me give it a save here just verify that that's working okay great oh i know what we need we need a button we need some sort of button to submit this right okay so let's add in a button and uh react native actually has a button well let me uh import it here so let's import button oops dude and so you have this button and uh i guess we could check let's check the documentation for this so we'll search for we're already in here buttons right there let's copy and paste the example for button there we go so it's going to say press me and then it's going to run this alert but we don't want the alert what we want is on press we want it to run this uh this use effect so um what we'll do is let's just grab this code yeah so i'm going to grab this code i'm going to comment this out because we're going to want it to behave like this at some point but for now we just want it to say let's see we'll just call it login oops we'll say login and we'll make this an arrow function and let's paste in this code oops it's not working let's get rid of that we'll get rid of that part okay notion oh let's do this let's do closed notion equals null and then that way we can set notion here how about that whoops let notion maybe are we declaring it oh okay oh what happened there okay so we already have notion as a state let's back up a little bit why is it giving me this because i got too many brackets that's what there we go okay so now we have a login function that should get us what we need here and we just need to call it on press there we go there we go all right so we're gonna we saved it let's try it out oh loading i messed something up all right where are we at why is it saying loading if loading that's why it's saying though all right let's let's just set loading to false for now there we go okay i need to get my device id so on another screen i'm going to grab my device id see if i can find it i thought i had it up already but there we go and actually let me move this over real quick i'm not really sure if i'm supposed to show my device id or not but i know how to fix that let's do this i'm gonna set the width to five so check this out look so the width of my text input is five so when i paste my device id in oh everybody saw it anyway oh well i'm not that worried about it i just want to see what error we're getting because we sh if this is not working we should get an error i'm getting nothing am i getting anything in the network what's going on nothing all right let's throw in some console logs so first thing i want to see is is our login function even being called at all so let's say console.log i'm just going to put in a little string there just to see what's happening all right hey there we go we got something this time oh nice so it did run and we got an error so we got illegal app name from firebase check our network here interesting yeah so it looks like it's trying to do something so that's a good that's good progress right all right good progress i'm also going to check my timer because it's got to be just about time for taking questions here yep about a minute i'll stop and answer some questions and at this point it looks like new notion device id set notion oh i know let's check our state let's see if we got anything back uh because i wonder if if we're getting an error on this part or if we're getting an error on this part so let's see if the state updated at all go to our components here and one of these hooks is the state that we're looking for so let's paste that in cool look at that all right awesome so we got our um we got our stuff here we got a response or at least we got something right uh so i believe then our error would be in the uh in that second part that we saw right so this is happening we're setting all the data we get back after we do this are being set here then this is running and we're trying to subscribe and get a user right but something's happening there so let's take a little break i'm answering some questions and then we're gonna come back and see if we can figure out what else we need to do here at this point it might not be a bad idea to go look at the uh the demo react code provided by neurocity the the people who make the headset and see what they did because i know i didn't copy and paste everything over uh and i bet that there's some other stuff happening that we need to do to make that work all right so i need to let me make the text on the chat a little bigger so i can see there we go okay all right for everybody who just joined uh as well uh i'm gonna use this brain computer interface i did a demo video kind of an intro to this brain computer interface device on my channel so check the link in the description to go to my channel uh and then you will be able to find that that video on the brain computer interface and get kind of an overview of what this thing is and what it can do and let's see i'm kind of just scrolling through the uh chat right now looking for questions a couple questions about what language you're using this is react native and the language is javascript uh with typescript um i have a question about for cyber security what is best um b tech in cs uh or it tell you the truth i don't i don't really know if anybody out there is in uh cyber security uh and can answer that question uh we're kind of wondering what type of degree is best for cyber security let's see hi i'm from the philippines it's a great feeling to see you code here thanks for sharing oh you're welcome thanks for saying that that's awesome uh michael wahl says ceh for ethical hacking is an option okay that's cool what is that certified ethical hacker i believe is the ceh lonnie said it was too close up so i had a video on my face at the beginning it's too close up i will remember that maybe i will back up a bit uh next time uh code dragon says learning a lot from your channel that's awesome that's awesome there's a lot of good content here on the free code camp channel a lot of a lot of really smart people contributing so i mean my live streams it is what it is right uh but there's some really even if you don't care for what i'm doing right now check out the other videos they're uh they're really good uh rod says it would be great to see more live coding videos on the free code camp channel i'm really going to try to do some more live coding i used to do it a lot more and i gotten away from it and uh had a lot of stuff happening uh with my job so i'm i'm not able to work from home as much as i used to be able to i had some health issues going on uh but i think i got that all worked out now and uh hopefully and so i'm gonna try to get on a better schedule so i can um uh live stream more jeff says thanks for coding live so we can all watch this is awesome you're welcome thanks for watching uh collins asks what do we use react for exactly okay so react is a library that helps you build web apps uh i think it's some of its strengths at least from my point of view are uh making state management uh easy it's once you kind of learn it it's it's it's pretty simple to kind of think through the flow of state so i like it for that and there's a lot more to react but basically it just helps you build web apps react native uses kind of the same concept the same logic but then let you apply that to mobile apps let's see uh not found says what will uh the back end be built in uh so neurosci the company that makes the uh the brain computer interface has their own kind of back end for handling like the the data that's coming from the headset so we're going to take advantage of what they're providing and then we won't at least in the stage one we won't need our own back end as we add later functionality that's something we might need to talk about and think about but i'm not 100 decided on what what exactly we would need and what we would use for that i see i'm getting to the point in the chat where all my kids came in and uh so thanks everybody you're saying the kids are cute yeah that's the real uh for a while i gotta tell you uh i wanted to stream more but i was a little bit embarrassed by my setup and i know it's silly because if you've watched me before you know i've done a ton of streams so my setups always been not that great but like i'm just i'm in a basement and the uh the quality in terms of like audio is probably not great because my kids and everything going on um but then it fi it hit me and it took me way too long to realize this but you know that's if i want my stream to be authentic in how it really is for me to code then i should just leave all that stuff in so i decided just to go for it and you know and stream uh with all the distractions and everything built in uh so hopefully uh everybody kind of understands that and you know this is not like a professional thing that i'm doing it's just a little side thing so um there will be distractions and noise uh carlos says this is the most authentic live stream i've ever seen subscribing now that's awesome all right uh our rv uh says where can we get that brain device uh so if you look up neurosci let me let me give you the link actually let me give you the link to their website and you are double checking i have the right link and then i'll paste it in let me paste that link in for you all this is the website for the neurocity headset i believe you can join i think there's like a wait list right now but you can join that and see about getting it getting the headset okay all right so i'm going to go back to the code now and do a little bit more code and uh let's see looks like someone in the chat using some uh some language so i'm gonna hide that users messages so uh see so anyway hopefully you all didn't see that i think i i think most of the messages were hidden by the filter but somebody was not being nice so uh i um let's see cool let's see i'm a double checking that i got everything all right cool um anyway sorry it took me a couple minutes to catch that i try to keep everything real uh uh positive let's see it might be somebody else all right i think i got all the the people causing trouble so anyway on my channel and on the free code camp channel i try to keep everything positive so uh if if you got if you want to be negative there's so many places on the internet you can just go and talk trash if you want to uh this is not the place for that so try to keep everything encouraging i'm i don't mind if you want to criticize what i'm doing uh in terms of my coding abilities or my ability to live stream that's fine i don't mind that but i don't want you calling anybody else names in the chat uh so if you do i'm i'm not gonna make a big deal uh i'm just gonna hide all your messages so um anyway uh hopefully that's that's through and we can get back to some code so yeah let me get back to some code here i probably let's see probably maybe go for like another half an hour or so and then i'm gonna i'll stop streaming so you know i don't want to it is the weekend i want to spend time with my family so i figured i'd just take about an hour to do some some code and then um you know we you know we won't finish today on this app but you know i'll uh i'll give it another shot uh later in the week and see if we can get it get it finished so what i'm gonna do now is we're gonna go to this uh this repo let me make it bigger so this is just on github uh so i already put a link to this in the in the chat if you weren't here i'm gonna link it again and there we go uh so if you want to check it yourself that links now in the uh in the live chat but i want to go in here and see this is like the react they call their react starter right so uh we do need to change some things though because this is react native so i'm gonna go in here to the source and let's check out there app.js and see if we're missing something important i assume that we're missing something important and that's why it's not working so i'm gonna make this a little bigger i just wanna make sure everybody can see a little bit bigger that's might be a bit too big but better to be too big than too small uh in terms of visibility uh so somebody may be watching this on their phone so uh now i know like so we have these right so we have this we're good uh we did comment this out uh i see so they're doing some navigation so they're navigating to uh some other components so that might be part of the piece that we're missing but let's see let's keep reading let's describe the user so we're trying to try to set the user okay okay so they're using react and they have this login which is basically what what we're doing is the login screen for the most part and they're passing the login screen this info okay so let's check out and see uh what kind of logic they have going on in their login screen to see if we're missing something so let's go back to our source we'll go into i guess pages login oh i see so they're they're saying they're getting the email password so it looks like we need a little bit more is uh we need to email the password so they need they're they're prompting people for the email and password so we're definitely gonna need to do that so here here's what i think is probably happening with their app and should happen is that the uh after they do the part that we did then the user is prompted for more info uh so that's the next part that we have to that we have to do so i guess let me make this a little smaller so i can get kind of a big picture of what's happening might be able to just copy and paste some of this stuff trying to find what we actually need here so we need so this is notion dot login okay all right i think we need to add an email and uh password field and we need to add in state for email and password as well so i'm just gonna grab this first and i'm gonna try to do it all in one in one page for now in one file just for like simplicity down the road we may end up like breaking it out into different files different components and let's grab this use effect and we'll put it down here and we're gonna have to get rid of some of it but that should work for now um let me see if i need something else all right i think we're good at least for now get us to the next step at least so we don't need that i don't need that and i don't need that and i'm not going to do this because i'm just gonna console log the air okay all right so this use effect will only run if some of this data changes right so here's your notion we may not we may actually not want it like this uh async function we may want to change let's change the name of our function let's just change it to init for like initialize so this button is now going to be initialize okay and we'll do it like this let's do let's let's um make more text boxes here that i don't know how we should do this yeah you know let's just make some more text inputs to get all the data we need so we're going to add two more text inputs and instead of device id it's going to be set email email and then we're gonna say set password and the value will be password so this is going to give us three text inputs now and they're going to be linked up with our new state so the first text input is going to be device id next one will be email and the next one will be password all right so we're going to have these in there now and let's save it just make sure we haven't broken anything yet nope we got all three of these and i got them real skinny like this just so that it's not too obvious what my password and stuff is uh this over okay now on press me we're not actually doing anything but let's let's change that we're going to change the logic a little bit here so currently on init we're getting this new notion right and we're setting notion and then this use effect works and we're trying to set the user so we're subscribing and we're trying to set the user here when we get the user actually what we could do there is email password wage oh do they have their their own their own version of it user i'm actually gonna i'm gonna comment this out for now because i think the login let's go back and look at our app.js again and see what we had uh so if user else navigate i see so we took some of this stuff out i believe this is what i believe is happening um so if you can't get a user it navigates you to the login page and then you have to log in so login needs to happen first so in so the set user is being passed down as a prop so we're we're good we're actually good in the way we're doing this in that we um the next step is this step here and so i just want to make sure this runs only when we we want it to run so uh these effects i guess i guess it works as long as we enter everything in properly i think this should work okay i think it should work at least to get us to the next step now what i want to do is figure out what my password is that i'm supposed to put in here so let me go back to i'm doing this off screen just to hide i guess what it what this is so oh i know i know now so the way this works is i put in my device id and my email and i should get an email with my password in it i think that's how it'll work let's double check you know we could do we could just clone this have i already forked this maybe i did let's fork this clone it run it then we'll know what the flow is supposed to be from a user perspective i'm going to clone it and we'll just go right in here and clone it from here i'm doing a git clone now i should have this available so let's look at my projects folder and see what is it notion react starter so let's cd into notion react starter i'm going to open up a new vs code window and then i'm gonna go back to the right folder here so i don't accidentally mess things up confuse them stay focused all right now let's go to our other vs code window and just run this really quick we'll do a new terminal let's run uh npe npmi so that'll install everything oh that's not i wonder why that package json was so long i accidentally clicked the package left json good so this is once this installs we'll just run it there we go uh npm run start cool oh i see all right so they have see we were we weren't really that far off this is kind of what our screen has on it it doesn't look like it but it it has this so device id email and password all in one go interesting but how am i supposed to get the password let's go back here and let's see our docs make it a little bigger all right web uh yeah let's see the web app all right device id email and password hmm maybe it wants the password that i use yeah i'll give it a shot i'm i'm thinking it wants the password that i use for um like to actually log in to the notion so let's try that see what we get so i'm going to grab the device id and i'm going to turn my device on and i'm gonna put in my email and then i'm gonna copy and paste my password or at least what i think the password would be uh um and let's see what happened wrong password hey cool like we got to get farther in the process all right let me try a new password then wait did that work did that really work i think it did all right that's cool let's check out yeah okay so this nice that worked sweet sweet sweet tweet all right cool all right so that worked um i didn't really expect that to work so quickly so what's the next step okay let's go back to the code here the next step is all right so now i guess we can say we need subscribe with the user or do we already have a user i think we do i think we've set yeah we've authenticated we've set the user yet because what's the second hook the second hook is user so we we saw that data we have that data now so this second hook here we have cool so since we have that we can look now at kind of like the next step uh so we have our code here let's see what we do next that's our calm stage so doing a subscription now the subscription that they're doing here is this notion.com subscribe to com we want to subscribe to focus so i think we can just let's grab some of this here yeah let's grab this and bring it in let's see all right so i'm gonna pull this in here so we should get then is everywhere we say calm i'm gonna change it to focus focus all right so we're gonna subscribe to the focus and for this i'm actually gonna let's see let me put this on okay so you can actually get some real brainwaves see if i can fit my headphones on top of it i actually can that's cool it's not very comfortable with these big headphones though uh all right cool so what i want to do i guess is um i don't want this to be actually yeah this could be a use effect so we'll just do it like that so this use effect will say yeah if there's no user or no notion then it's just going to return right but if we have both of these then we're actually going to run this we're going to get this this focus it's going to be a number and we want to display that so instead of this logged in i want to display focus all right uh in react if i put brackets in there then i can run javascript inside so this is gonna give me not the word focus but the value of focus in state so let's save that i'm gonna have to put in all my so like currently we're not saving any of the data uh so i'm gonna have to log in again but bear with me for a second while i get all this login stuff in again and uh what else password all right did that work uh did it did that not save oh didn't work this time what did i mess up first argument was invalid calm set sitcom what the heck i thought we'd get rid of all the calm stuff didn't we we did why is it still trying to set calm oh look at that all right so my column score right now is 0.51 cool let's see if i can yeah there we go so it's updating so i lost focus there do you see me i looked over there and lost focus so this is giving me a realtime focus score basically like how focused i am um right now that that is pretty cool so this is um let me do focus yeah cool so i want to show you let me show you the screen so like this is the developer kind of console thing so you can see this is focus right it's like tracking uh my focus levels so like a higher number means i'm more focused this is between zero and one so what we've done here let me see if i could split screen it there we go so like these focus numbers it's it's right now it's reading the same feed so i guess like we've we've succeeded now at successfully connecting this to a react native app so i'm getting data from this brain computer interface headset it's going out to the neurocity servers right and then they're providing this api that i could subscribe to in my app that's giving me this this data so now we're getting realtime data about my level of focus in my brain in this react native app so that's pretty sweet the next step then would be hey alex who who built he's the cofounder of uh neurocity is watching the stream so awesome glad to have you here so um so like right now essentially like it works right we can connect this into react native the next step would be it's kind of a pain to have to log in every time right so it'd be nice if we could save this data somewhere locally on a user's machine so that it'll auto log you in so i'd say that's probably the next step that i'd like to do because that would really help save time because it you know it just takes a while to keep copy and paste in that every time we do something new and make a change so that's probably the next step that i'll do in in the next stream because i think yeah so i'm over the hour mark and i only wanted to take an an hour uh i don't want to take too much time away from my family here on on a sunday so um on the next stream we'll work on saving this in whatever version of local storage we need so on the web it would be the browser's local storage but on an ios or android device that would be different so we need to make sure we code it so that it'll work on whatever platform we're running on so it'll save that information so we don't have to log in every time then we can try to figure out some thresholds and say like all right let's say if i drop below a point two then it's going to do something right vibrate make a noise flash the screen it's gonna do something to warn us that our attention is dropping below the threshold that we set so uh i see that's that's probably a good a good next step also i think i would kind of want to um uh use maybe uh like a simulator right to make sure we can simulate what's happening on a uh on a mobile device uh so i can run it on my mobile phone but it'd be harder for you to see it i guess i could hold it up to the camera but i'm gonna see if i can maybe get like an android simulator running for the next time so we could do this also so alex in the chat says you could use react native async storage library which uh that's a great a um that's a great suggestion i actually contributed to the late the new version of react native async storage so uh i don't think it's out yet so if you use the react native community async storage uh package the uh the latest like development version has um a bunch of contributions that i did to get it to work with local storage in the browser so i'm actually i'm kind of proud of that because that was a lot of work and um i did do some live streams about that too so i think i put that on my channel if anybody's interested in how that works but uh all right cool so i'm just gonna leave this up on the screen for now just to kind of see like all the all the data going here um i'll leave i'll leave this as well um and then let me go back to the chat i'm going to get through the chat kind of quickly because i want to i don't want to stream too much longer i want to get back to my kids here um but i do want to answer some of your questions so i'm going to try to stream to answer your questions if i don't get to something put it in the comments and i'll try to get to it you can definitely like shoot me a dm on twitter or or something if you want to uh if i don't get your question but i'm going to try to get to as many as i can the genius marketer says do you recommend w3schools or what to get some code um if you're if you're trying to learn how to code uh check out free code camp uh so it's freecodecamp.org they've got an awesome curriculum um people have gone through the free code camp curriculum and have gotten jobs and stuff so i would definitely definitely check that out i wonder why my my focus stops maybe i move too much i don't know what i did uh but this one's still working though but yeah definitely check out free code camp that's that's a great place uh to go uh tom williams says his react native normal javascript or typescript you can use react native with normal javascript or typescript i chose to do it with typescript but you definitely could do regular javascript i just kind of recently got into typescript i've been using it at work so i'm trying to trying to use it more just to kind of really learn it well but you definitely don't have to use it let's see i see some of you were trying to um uh share your email addresses and it got blocked by the filter so i just i showed that so if you scroll back up in the chat those are visible now so you should be able to get them get them now all right there's a lot of cool discussion about programming languages in the chat so i'm not going to read it all out but i love it whenever there's great discussion from from you on the chat no beer says i'm hearing footsteps on the floor yeah those are my kids playing upstairs i actually had a contractor come in and look and talk to me about maybe getting a like a soundproof office to do these videos in and they're supposed to get back with me with an estimate i kind of expected it sooner i don't know it's taking so long but hopefully i can get like a legitimate kind of recording studio at some point and then uh should be a little bit better audio quality for these videos hey christa mars is here how's it going chris uh chris demars has a cool podcast that i did an episode on recently it's called tales from the script so uh check that out on i think it's it's on spotify i listen to it through uh google podcasts um so yeah check that out i'm sure it's available in all the different podcast services but um yeah he does a he does a great job yeah chris i'm doing good i was just doing a little bit of coding i'm kind of um wrapping it up oh yeah that's true and uh alex um who was he he was on the chat he's the cofounder of neurocity uh was also on the podcast as well so you can learn more about nerosity and the brain computer interface what they're trying to do and learn a little bit more about me if you want if you check out the podcast um so yeah chris chris just put in the chat he's on spotify google podcast apple podcast stitcher so all the podcast things um yeah check check him out let's see all right we got a question from big dodd it says i i got an exam in six months high school level and c plus plus for entering a college do you think i stand a chance i started learning c plus like two months ago but is there enough time uh you definitely have a chance you know it's hard to say like how long it'll take anyone but you know kind of depends on how much time you have to study but i you know don't don't quit on it i think you have a chance you know if you study hard at it you know especially if it's high school level i don't i don't really know what they would expect a high school student to know but if you have six months left and you've already been studying for two months i think you you got a good chance of doing well on the test i don't know i'd like to hear other people's opinions on this i i haven't done any c plus plus code except i took one c plus plus course a long time ago maybe like early 2000s um but i don't remember that much from it uh so probably not the best to ask about c plus plus but i i definitely think you could do it uh omor says sir you are awesome uh thanks i appreciate that he says thank you for your wisdom and time i have no idea how to code but i respect people who share their knowledge thank you yeah you're welcome welcome i'm uh happy to share it and um yeah hopefully you all get something out of this uh no beer says what's up jesse it's been a while for streaming how are you uh i'm doing all right i um uh i know it's been it's been a while i um to tell you the truth like i've had uh i had some weird health issues recently that we're kind of just like keeping me from doing a lot i i had like some scans done on my lung and they found some like black uh like shading like in the scans and turns out i had like nodules on my lung and i kept doing all these tests i couldn't figure out what it was so i wasn't that worried about it but it got me thinking like hey if this is something serious i want to spend as much time with my kids as i can so i kind of stopped doing any side projects or streaming or stuff and uh but it turns out i just saw a lung specialist this last week i don't think it's anything threatening he thinks that i have like uh allergies and asthma and um i found out i have sleep apnea so like i got a lot of stuff figured out but the good news is none of it is lifethreatening right it's all it's all fine so um now i'm hoping like i'm hoping to be able to get back into streaming more because i really love doing this and uh i miss you know we we kind of had like a crew of people that would watch all the time and you know i missed that so anyway thanks for asking and uh you know i'm gonna try to i'm gonna try to do my i know i say this all the time but i'm gonna try to do my best to stream more either either through free code camp or maybe do some videos on my channel i think i'm gonna alternate a little bit uh but i definitely want to do this more and i'm having a lot of fun with this brain computer interface thing too this is kind of really cool and uh different than what like my daytoday uh work let's see uh dylan says i don't get what you're trying to do uh basically i'm linking up for right now for what we did in this in this show i'm linking up this brain computer interface that i'm wearing with a react native app so that we can get data from this device into the app we're going to do some cool stuff with it but for right now we've just succeeded at getting the data so this little number we see here is actual like score on a a scale of zero to one of how focused i am right now oh cool krista morris says if they did a blood test and everything came back good then you were good yeah i'm not like i said i'm not worried um pretty much get everything figured out i'm i got to do some more tests and um this week because there was some stuff with my my liver that the doctor was worried about but to be honest with you i've been trying to work out a lot lately and i'm taking all these supplements and i think that was throwing off my blood tests a little bit so this whole week i've been taking off and just basically not working out not taking any supplements and uh i'm gonna redo the tests and see if that helps i'm expecting it will and then at that point i think basically everything that that uh was wrong with me will be at least explained um but uh yeah i think uh should be good i feel good and um so i figure i i feel good i feel in good shape the only thing that was weird for me was i kept getting out of breath really easily but it makes sense if i have asthma that totally explains it so um i mean it all like that it all makes sense and and i feel good so i have like uh an inhaler now that i could take if i feel out of breath so i'm gonna test it out probably you know maybe next time in the in the gym i'm gonna take my inhaler with me and then see if i like get do my normal workout and then see if i feel a big difference i'm expecting i'll probably be able to breathe a lot better but uh anyway uh i know some of you probably care about that and some of you are just here for the code so i'm not going to talk about it anymore like you all can ask me on social media if you want but anyway yeah i'm going to wrap things up now and go hang out with the kids a little bit before before bedtime and uh yeah it was really good uh i'd love to keep going with this project in some future streams uh let me know what you all think in the comments if you have questions um you know shoot them in the comments to me or twitter or instagram or whatever social media you like my dms are open um i'll get back to you as soon as i can and yeah so until next time like have a great rest of your weekend great beginning to your week uh and uh i'll see y'all later
