hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're gonna gonna fix some some things that broke on this this main project project five that we've been working on so a lot of things broke whenever I updated to the latest version of material UI so it's version 1.2 point O so at first I had thought about just holding off on updating because we were so close to launch and then we ended up not launching whenever I wanted to so I based on some advice from I believe it was Christian that had suggested not to get too far behind which i think is good advice I decided to go ahead with the update I figure it's better to be on a stable release version before we go live anyway and since we have a little bit more time now before we launch it may as well get it over with now so that's what we're gonna be working on I'm gonna say what's up to everybody in the live chat here before we get started we may only end up doing like one Pomodoro session I'm gonna see we'll see how it goes Danny ki noticed the hacks over first tshirt so this is the if you participate in October fest which is it's an event where I believe you have to make three contributions to open source projects so if you make three contributions in the month of October then you get this shirt and some stickers yeah I think we got yeah we definitely got a sticker so that was fun so if you didn't get to do this past year definitely look out for that in in October I assume it's gonna happen again it's okay Siberian says what's the too long didn't watch of the new updates well the one new component they have but I'm really excited about is a swipeable drawer so that when you're on your phone you can swipe the drawer like in and out which which I've wanted for a long time for this project so that's really cool and I do want to transition over to that drawer but not until after we fix all the things that are broken right now but basically the name of the package I'll go through in a minute when I start my Pomodoro session first I'll go through some of the biggest changes that I've already dealt with today and then we'll just continue on with with what I left off but that should give you an idea of the new updates as well hi Jilly says I was just fixing my own material I project when I got the notification for this video great timing Oh awesome I'm glad well maybe maybe it'll help you out a bit alright sobre hard says say my name so there you are let's see the beginning sis I don't know programming that's cool uh you're welcome to watch and ask questions Briard also asks are you in Germany no I'm not in Germany I'm in the United States okay all right let's uh let's get started I'm gonna start my Pomodoro timer so for about twentyfive minutes I'm gonna you know maybe I'm not gonna look at the live chat too much then after that 25 minutes I'll come back and answer as many questions as I can in the chat let me switch over okay I'll make this a bit bigger so y'all can see the font and then I'll start to go over what we've done I just noticed Bray Bray Hart says never watch the free code camp livestream so show me what you got yeah so if you've never watched one before here's the deal with my live streams I mess up a lot live and then I try to fix it so if that's if that is the heart of this live stream you will definitely find it today because I have messed up a very important part of my project mainly what I'm working on right now is that side drawer that main menu that's on every single page doesn't work it will I click it the state actually changes and reacts so the state changes from true to false for whether or not it's open that works but there's two things that seem to have changed with the new version one on the the container itself for that side drawer there's a some CSS added that makes such a visibilityhidden and then on the body of the page it sets it to overflowhidden those things don't go away so when I click to open the visibilityhidden doesn't change so it stays hidden and when I click to close the overflow for the body stays hidden as well so you can't scroll so I don't know why those issues are affecting it I've been through my markup to try to see and it's exactly the same as what's in the demos on the site so it's it's a little frustrating but first let me show you some of what I've already fixed and what's already been changed Joey asked what version I was upgrading from I was at beta 38 so going from beta 38 we're skipping quite a few versions here to get up to the latest one okay so you can see here our dependencies now say you know at material UI core at material UI icons so before we didn't have this at symbol right we didn't have the core there either so the name of the package changed so if you're gonna upgrade you're gonna want to remove the previous packages and then add these packages as they're named here okay so that's a huge difference you know completely different packages you can't just update the existing ones all right they'd there is this code mod package that came through that's supposed to help update everything but I couldn't get it to work I follow the instructions I don't know what the problem is you can see some of the remnants of me attempting this in the terminal here so what I did was I manually went through because a lot of since the package changed the way we import things change as well so we import things from at material UI / core so I went through and just did a fine in replace for all those and then also the icons have changed as well so it's at material UI icons so I went through a control fine replaced all those not only that but there were a lot of times where you could lump together a bunch of things so like I could do list list item and list icon all together in one import right I just used brackets and bring it all in I'd import it all from list we can't do that any or now you have to import them separately so you import list item from list item list item icon from the side of my clone right and that happened in quite a few places so that script was supposed to help so that I wouldn't have to do that unfortunately I couldn't get it to work so what I did was with the help of the errors i was getting in my terminal i went through and found the places where i had to replace those things and I checked the material ID documentation Oh for the right for the right way to do that so those changes were kind of boring anyway so i'm i think it's it's okay we didn't do it on the stream because it was just a lot of copy and pasting reading error messages and then going to the right file so if you do want to do it again i recommend trying to get that script to work if you can't though the best thing is just trace where it's telling you it'll tell you the file where is happening in the line you scroll down you figure out what component was on that line and then you scroll up and change based on the documentation you you change the import and that that pretty much solved all those errors so not getting these errors anymore but still not everything's working so let's let's look around some more let's let's try to fix this let me pull over on this screen I don't think I need these we'll get rid of that save some say some RAM but I'm gonna pull over on the screen the drawer just to show you what's going on so there was one issue as well on these pages but that's was unrelated to the update so I I did fix that so I want to go to oops see it's the one that weird overflowhidden thing it's also annoying this so this is not so supposed to be an oval behind here so there there are some weird things happening also there was a change with the way the grid works the grid items automatically had some spacing between them but now that's all set to zero so you have to manually put in spacing so we'll have to go in here and put in spacing between these buttons now the site is not normally really slow like this it's just because I'm running the strain all right so you can see we click that and it opens here's why it opens in the drawer I have manually a manually added visibilityvisible in line so it overrides what was happening before all right I'd rather not manually override what's supposed to be happening but if that's how I have to fix this that's that's how I'll fix it what I'm tempted to do since I'm trying to figure out what's happening anyway is implement that that drawer the swipeable drawer implement that now and see if implementing that will solve any of our issues so I think that's probably a good thing to work on right now okay so let's bring over let me bring over the documentation for material UI as well so we can all check it out together there we are and that's just me material UI calm I'll paste it in so you can go exactly to where I'm at okay so there's this swipeable drawer so we're gonna check out the code first and see if there are any major changes on clothes on all right that's interesting we have this on clothes and on open I don't believe we needed that with the regular drawer but let's double check okay yeah definitely different okay it looks like there are some issues with lowend phones so we'll just we'll have to be careful that we'll have to just test that but otherwise you know I think we can we can use it and we'll make sure that we we add these in here that are gonna test let me zoom in a bit we'll add some of these in to make sure that we test for whether or not we're on iOS or not okay so first things first let's get the import in here so we're gonna import swipeable drawer yeah let me move some things around here so that we can have more more room there we go so we're gonna replace your drawer with swipeable drawer whoops there we go and then we'll go down here where we have drawer and replace that we'll swipeable drawer and let's make sure down the bottom we also replace this there we go all right so I'm gonna save that and see if that even works at all unexpected token expected where is that that's weird how did that happen why did we get oh now I remember we we installed a package that alphabetizes our imports or something it organizes them somehow somehow messed things up alright let's go back here and you see what's going on now with our code we're gonna refresh to get rid of anything I had done over here okay so that's it's still opening which was expected because of the little override that I did well we see that overflowhidden is not I mean make that bigger so the overflowhidden is still there so whatever's causing that is still still in play okay I guess we could try see what we have currently so you know we could do since we have that on open on clothes we could try to do the switch in the CSS with those it's like I don't really want to do it like that but I just I'm just not sure where the the problem is so let's see what's going on in these so on open climate on clothes it is calling toggle drawer and let's see what's toggle drawer is knowing all right well so toggle drawer is really it's it's just changing the state yeah so nothing in there it is doing anything with those classes I all we can do at least is within our style objects let's see how are we gonna do this alright let's just make this a I can't remember I've done this in line before so let's try it like this let's make this a template literal so we're gonna do it like this so template literal syntax allows us to just put in JavaScript right in the middle of strings we can also do things like have line breaks and things so it's pretty useful but for this case what I want to do is say open and I guess oops oh now I don't want to actually want it like that I wanted to say we're gonna do a ternary in here so if it's open we want it to be visible if not we want it to be hidden so we want that value to change and you know what I don't know I don't think I'll need that yeah it is gonna make me do that huh okay let's try it with the template literal there may be a better way to do that but if this works I'm gonna go with that so since everything's run slow I'm just gonna let that go for a second and I'll explain this so this is a backtick character so it's right below the Escape key and when you do that back to character everything inside is treated as a string unless you do a dollar sign and a curly bracket and then anything in here until the end of the curly bracket you treat just like normal JavaScript so in this case we're using a ternary which is kind of like a shorthand for an if statement so we're basically saying if open is true then we want the value that's returned out of here to be visible if it's not true so this is the else we wanted to say hidden so this should give us our visibility hidden or visible just like the behavior that it's supposed to happen which I can't figure out why it's not happening so we're just kind of adding it in ourselves it's it's a little over I'd rather not have to do it like this but if we can't find the real cause of the problem this this should work for us so let's check the page all right it popped out and we can see where's our element area so we have visibilityvisible which is overriding that visibilityhidden let me make it bigger you probably can't see there we go so this is our element that's that's popped out now visibilityvisible it's overriding the hidden that's in there now when we click out of here it should get rid of it yep and it does in reality what happens is the entire element goes off the page so we don't really need that but for some reason in material UI it seems like that's the way they want it to work so that's what we're gonna go with right now okay next problem in the body we're getting this overflowhidden definitely don't want that I mean I'm I don't want that let's let's try this out let's see what happens so we're getting overflowhidden right now let's get rid of it let's see okay that's why so we don't want this scroll to happen so to be honest like it's a bit annoying to have that scroll happen but to be honest with you if we can't get rid of it and all we do is override this overflowhidden I'm okay with this scroll happening I think it's unexpected but it's not it's not a bug right it's you know I can't can you think of any drawback to this actually happening other than just that's not it's unexpected because otherwise I mean it would stay still so let's try this again you know otherwise I'm trying to scroll right now with my cursor on this side nothing happens this still works I think I might be I might be okay we're just overriding this one now the trick is gonna be where do I override this and what do I set it as overflow should I just set it to let's see what I need to set it to for this to work properly so it should flow initial initial seems to work let's go with overflow initial and I'm probably gonna have to do it in in our global Styles yeah let's let's check our layout component because if there is any component that would give me access to everything it would definitely be the layout component so I don't let me get rid of a few of these we could check no that's not gonna do anything let's get rid of that for now and get rid of a few things that probably not gonna work with today all right we don't we're not worried about the index just yet we may come back to there though free up some time and let's go here then and we'll go to all right my timer just is up so as soon as I make this change I'm gonna come back into the live chat and answer some questions body there we go so we can't actually put it right here in the body for a document je s underscore document touch is so stir that in there and so we're gonna end up saying style equals we're gonna say I'm gonna copy that in but we definitely will need to put something around there and then we need our double brackets waiter sir Oh spacing and then let's try that out we may have to put important on there as well I don't like to use important if it if it's not absolutely necessary but it may be absolutely necessary I'm gonna give it a manual refresh to clear out what we've done in dev tools at least we're getting a circular kind of shadow or whatever that is behind there all right so we're gonna open that up we're gonna check out the body still has overflow initial which is great and it's actually not scrolling I don't know it did it changed overflowhidden all right so it did still change to overflowhidden yeah okay I don't think putting important on there is gonna change anything so what we'll need to do then is add the important to the CSS the reason being the JavaScript is just totally removing what we had in there before so it will remove the important see all right I need to find a spot where actually you know what this is gonna be a little bit weird to do it like this but let's try this out I have never attempted to do this but we already have this in the head here so let's say style and let's put in body whoops still thinking JavaScript and then we're gonna put that overflow initial in there they're not gonna let us do this I don't think it's gonna let us do this I'm just gonna try it the but I don't think it's gonna work since we're still in JSX land here yeah all right how can we make this happen the problem is I don't have a I don't have a style sheet that works everywhere that's like on every component but you know what I bet we can have one all right so let's check out on this side we're just gonna open up another page so let's check out the index page and let's see right now we're pulling in are we not pulling any of these styles we're pulling in anything on layout you know we really aren't okay there we go there's our global styles a new ad global style somewhere alright I can get rid of this then it's good to know that I can't do that I mean it if I'd have thought about it for a second I guess that would have made sense but sometimes it's faster just to just to try something the feedback loop is just so quick when you're developing locally like this that it almost it's it doesn't make sense to like overthink something just you know try it see what happens and then move on ok so here we can put overflow initial and we're also gonna see if it'll let us add important I'm not sure but I hope it will if it does this might solve a problem alright didn't get an error Suda looks like ok so we're on body right now see what we've got yep alright it does say overflow initial important its openness great alright check that out so it goes to overflowhidden is added to the element but we're overriding it with that important tag so that definitely has its uses its legitimate uses so this will not work we can close it that overflowhidden is gonna remain but it doesn't really matter right because we're overriding that so this works I would still love to know why I had to do this workaround and why it's not working as I want to but this is kind of cool we have this in here now and it's it's swipeable still need to test that out on a phone but I'm not gonna do that on the stream because y'all can't see my phone anyway so that wouldn't be very fun for anybody watching ok cool so I definitely went over my my time on my promo to our timer I'm gonna scroll up to the top and just go down through the live chat and answer any questions that you all have if you have any question put it in the chat there now sigh so si I says hi can you help me with a problem I'm facing well I will try since I'm trying to add asynchronous data and Java scripts I'm trying to find the sum of asynchronous data but I get some is 0 hmm I'm not sure sorry if you had a link to some code you were working on it would be a lot easier for me to I I'm not saying that I definitely can figure it out but it would be a lot easier for me to figure out that particular problem De Anza Borrego channeling your Destiny's Child sobre hard had said earlier say my name that's the it's the name of a Destiny's Child song from the 90's say my name so I definitely get it I'm pretty sure I could sing most of the songs off of that CD I'm not gonna to subject you all to that my singing though so don't worry okay John Hanson says is the best honest livestreams around thank you I can do that I may not be able to make anything you know that's out of my hands I'll try my best but what I can do is at least be honest when I mess up shree says did you change the font color from visual studio code extension I don't think so Siberian says Jessie under stress now because of you under stress because I what did I do to stress you out Matthew says hey Matthew how's it going thanks for watching Albert says this is one of the longest projects I've ever seen yeah yeah for sure I'm so ready for this to be launched it's going on much longer than I anticipated Brea said I cloned the project anyone know how to launch it no good info in the readme actually I thought the readme for this project had instructions let me double check because if it doesn't it definitely should so let's go to github by Microsoft and check out the readme for this alright so the readme is just really basic the contributing has some more stuff going on but yeah actually it's not you just get the repo yarn install or NPM install we are using yarn on the project so if you have your own use yarn and then run the dev server with just dev so NPM to have your yarn dev so it's really it's assuming that you have node and NPM installed on your machine already and get then you know you should should be able to who sorry should be able to just follow the instructions I mean potentially if you had an older version of node it might not work but I'm not I'm not sure about it very hard says Jessie you the man Thank You turtle says he has no sleep I think maybe you're talking about me yawning all the time I did sleep last night I'm not sure why I'm so tired let's see miss miss Arg asks if anyone knows about CSS grids should I learn CSS flexbox or CSS grid or both I would say it's it's good to learn both because you'll probably run into both and you can use them together so I don't really know which one to learn first but I plan on learning both Chris says learn grid first well it says Chris also says CSS grid kind of has a steep learning curve Dimitri says hey Jessie how you doing not too bad not too bad thanks for asking I actually had a good morning so some of you may have may remember me mentioning on the stream or if you follow me on Instagram that I've been trying to lose weight so I've been exercising and dieting so I officially hit my goal weight this morning at 175 pounds so I lost 15 pounds in the last I don't know a month or so so I'm pretty excited about that so that's been cool so how's everything going for you Dimitri hopefully well ein bisschen says is it necessary to use SSH keys for small digitalocean projects when you run something on digitalocean if you already have your key setup you just click a checkbox and it'll set up the keys for you like when you're setting up the droplet so it's it's really not hard it's not hard to do so I would always use SSH I don't think you have to you could use like login with a password but assuming you've already set them up once and all it takes is just a click of a checkbox then I'm not sure why you wouldn't want to Joey says couldn't you test the swipeable drawer with dev tools device toolbar hmm I didn't even think about that but let's check it out oh nice it works haha let's see if it works for us let's click this first mmm looks like it might not be working oh but you know what I did forget to put in some of that code let me go back here since I I totally forgot sister I was just checking out the other types of drawers quickly to see if they added any new types swipeable drawer let's add this stuff and and actually we don't have didn't make this constant yet let's do that jeff says isn't a swipeable temporary or did I mess it up now I think it's the name of it in the component is just swipeable all right let's check it out see okay all right it seems like it works like once I open it once then it works maybe it's just you know trying to do it on here that's kind of messing it up so I'll have to try it on my phone later and see if it's different but at least it's kind of working so it's doing something different anyway Joe it was a good idea using the dev tools Tessa Zhi Shan says any resources on how to create nodejs and react I don't know how to combine them we I mean you almost always run react with node trying to get resources I mean usually for most of our projects we end up doing a custom server and node so you could check some of those check out our server das files for some ideas and and maybe some of the live streams otherwise you know things like now the documentation for next Jas I believe has a section on doing your own custom server and that's you know any JavaScript stuff on the server side is if it's not all node then it's almost all node so off the top of my head I I don't really know a tutorial that would you know specifically look at that part of it okay Nikki was asking what's what's 175 pounds in kilograms and says around 79 kilograms so it's John says seventy nine point three seven nine kilograms thank you for that I always forget about the difference in you know in measurement system so apologies for that but I now weigh evidently I weigh seventy nine point three seven nine kilograms I'm Bishan says do you have any video on creating SSH I do not have a video on that but that's a great idea for a video so I will put that on my list phoenix says y no space between buttons you know what that was one of the things that that got changed when I upgraded so that's there's gonna be space between these I just don't have them right now so let me let me check just quickly to see how many pixels of space there should be okay so it is these dips these grid deuce and it's gonna end up being high one of my kids is coming in hi crew Delia good man you won't be on YouTube here put your head down she's trying to like climb back through all kind of stuff to get to me hey all right I'll be on YouTube you say hi say hi actually I'll work on this later basically what I need to do is just there's a spacing prop on the grid items and I just need to put in a value for spacing so I'm gonna switch over to my other screen and see if could you you'll realize that she's on that look are you on YouTube who is that ah yeah you say hello hey hi can you say YouTube no who is that is that dad on the screen yeah yeah yeah you won't listen do you help data on a computer yeah all right oh you pressing the buttons okay look there's lots of people that are talking to us on there see them type in all these words there we go my computer just froze for a second hopefully this dream was okay help dad down here let's put this over here I don't need help with this right now I need help looking at the screen see team yeah can we wave to the people yeah can you say free Oh code we say code camp ha yay free code camp mom is mom upstairs yeah yeah I'll come upstairs in a little bit Aniki says does that navigator phone cause problems on the server since that's not a browser to navigator might be undefined yeah I want to go upstairs okay see you later hi thanks for helping go ahead upstairs you see mama oh you can give me my water thank you you're so helpful yeah I'm gonna stay down here alright thank you okay so I thought about that at first but let's let's check this out I think it's it's already saying like basically if this is in the browser then let's check this if not don't worry about it so I don't think we'll have a problem with it alright John Hanson says Nicki's blog has great info on SSH keys for get home okay cool yeah Nicki's blog is super helpful Abdul says hi Heidi the kid John said cutie oh yeah thanks thanks yeah that's my baby yeah she wants me to be with me all the time and have me hold her so she frequently tries to sneak down here during the day when I'm working so if anybody leaves like the door open to the basement she just she sneaks down and climbs through the basements like partially unfinished so there's a little spot in the wall where there's actually like a hole that she can get through and so all the doors are shut to me but there's still a hole there so she sneaks through the hole climbs under my desk and threw all my cords and comes here to sit with me so I need to I need to fix that hole so she can't get in but uh okay so I've gotten through all the questions and we're already at about an hour for the stream so I think I'm just gonna I'm not gonna do another Pomodoro session basically you know but I've either explained or we work through the major issues when updating now of course this depends on what wood pieces you've used right any parts of material you I that I haven't used that you know if you have used that there might be other issues that I have no idea about so this is definitely not a comprehensive you know tutorial on upgrading but hopefully this will just kind of make you aware of some of the issues and some of the ways to get around them and you know we even did a little bit some overriding of things here to make it work but I should be I'm gonna check out a few other things before I commit this but I should be committing these changes you know before I finished for the day so pretty soon I'm probably gonna be finished in about a half hour or so so if you if you want to look at the code it will be available in about a 1/2 hour at the latest alright so I think I'll be back in the office tomorrow so I am a bit busy with meetings but I think I should be able to get a stream in so all I'll announce that stream on Instagram and Twitter you also get a notification if you've signed up if you subscribe to this channel and enabled notifications so hopefully I'll see y'all tomorrow and until then have a great day
