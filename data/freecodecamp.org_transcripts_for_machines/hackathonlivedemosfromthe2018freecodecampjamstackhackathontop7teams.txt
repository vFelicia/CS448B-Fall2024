hey everyone welcome to the top six i'm quincy larson with free code camp i am joined by matt billman ceo and cofounder of netlify cole crumport the ceo and cofounder of formsfree and chris anderson the lead developer evangelist for verfana the database so today we are going to be talking with a lot actually seven i said top six but actually we decided to extend it to a seventh one because we were so pulled over by the quality of the submissions we're going to be talking with seven teams of hackathon participants many of whom did not know one another 36 hours ago came together and built some amazing stuff and we're going to see that amazing stuff and we're going to get to the bottom of how they built it and who they are so first we're going to start with caption this and gentlemen perhaps we can start with you just a quick introduction who you are where you're from what you do my name is vijay i'm from new hampshire and i actually am a technician i work for ge aviation so as a technician and i just graduated from the granite state college so yeah that's what i do and i love coding great thank you vijay welcome and uh congratulations on recent graduations thank you great to see you i'm uh david carter um i just moved to san francisco in july and um originally from the antelope valley palmdale lancaster and um right now i work at a wordpress agency and so i'm looking to get more into reaction the jam stack great are you a broncos fan i am a drone how did you guess that hi my name is sumit i'm a qa engineer and i live in sunnyvale california i actually started learning frontend development at free code camp so this is a big day for me and yeah i'm continuing to learn more of frontend like react and other free bugs so yeah i'm really excited thank you so much well perhaps you could go ahead and give us a very quick demonstration of how caption this works all right so caption this is basically going to present you with a random gif so every time you load the page it's going to get a random gif so if you don't like it you can always press this next button and you can choose better gifts and see so you could enter in any caption you want submit it and it's going to add it to our list of submitted gifts and every user could whether or not you submit a gif you can um up vote and we're going to rank all these submissions by votes so the most popular will always be at the top and we've added authentication with netlify right on you've got some pretty cool gifts here too and very good captions for someone what's your favorite so far that you've what what what caption are you most proud of so far um it got deleted actually it got deleted when we added our where do you get the gifts from uh it's uh the api is called the api is called jiffy so yeah that's where you're getting the apps from so where do you stand on the gif versus gif pronunciation everybody who pronounces it gif say ready set everybody who pronounces it jiff say woo actually i like to call it gif so that is a true diplomat great well judges what do you all think so far it's great i really love this one um i think it's fun i think it's kind of a cool i like that you can upvote it and then everyone can see that um so it's it's participatory it's kind of uh it's cool it's a good scope a lot of times hack apps will overscope or underscope and it's hard to be impressive like that but it's impressive to bring it mostly to completion because you picked the right scope yeah yeah i would certainly uh share that opinion i've seen so many hackathon projects that are extremely ambitious and then they have to pair back all their ambitions right before the demo time but it looks like this is something that was definitely doable within the time frame and yeah and you all executed great did you have any sort of top things you would have liked to do that there wasn't time from that you had to scope back from or there is a um we wanted to tie voting to user authentication right now we're just storing that with local storage so tying that into the user would have been i think it was nice little good story it's just smart sort of gradual way of getting there you imagine you'll keep hacking on it um maybe i'm into it yeah i'm thinking about it right on and uh what kind of collaborative filtering method are you thinking about are you thinking about like a like reddit or hacker news or some of those other collaborative filtering algorithms and or how are you planning for things to gradually decay and fall off of the top we haven't thought of that actually yeah yeah maybe something like that well i mean there are plenty of models i just wanted to see if you all were thinking about it because you don't want the top loaded thing to always be on the top because it'll you know when it takes off should be fresh stuff yeah we should have some tabs on there so recent ones or pop most popular tabs that you can work on those how did you split up the work between you so he vijay did all the styling stuff yeah all the css and he did all the javascript part and i was there for like adding features sometimes and also for like running around and like we have problems with fauna tv or forms free which we had so talking to those two guys about how do we like go forward uh what should we do and all those things yeah we had great help so we'd like to thank all the judges and help us there during the hackathon process it was really great without them we couldn't even complete this for sure right what have you learned from this hackathon that you didn't know at the beginning about yourself uh for me like uh i was you know as i said i was um coding in a free code camp online thing so i had i never worked as a as a team i never quoted as team so it's really a different experience i believe and i really learned a lot of stuffs and how team you know goes up so i really learned a lot about the teaming thing first the first most thing and about the you know reading documentations that those things were very important and because the apis we used here and the databases we use they were completely new for us but uh you know the the judges they showed us where to go for the technical documentation so we just rate that and i think because of that so yeah we learned a lot actually probably the collaboration skills working with people in different skill sets and learning to divide the work so everyone works to their advantages we didn't know each other before these hackathons until yesterday we didn't know each other i'm from new hampshire all the way from new hampshire and yeah so we just made a team and boom are there other apps you almost built uh no we didn't even have an idea for this is gonna spur at the moment at what point did you start shift from like idea and conceptualization and building your team like at what hour of yesterday would you say you actually sat down and started coding probably after lunch yeah just after my chest right any other questions what was the hardest thing you had to solve while building this the login um because we just had limited time the last hour yeah and then incrementing the votes yeah incrementing the votes learning how to like we had to read and write and yeah yeah talk to hona devi like how would you do god yeah well great thank you so much for coming up here and for demoing pleasure meeting you through gentlemen and i'm very impressed with what you've done here yeah great girl thank you thank you nice to meet you just let me know when the audio is back it's back okay great yeah so while wall hacks piece coming up here go ahead and get situated i just want to take a moment to uh recognize some of you are going to need to stand be careful that white stuff and it's not like a skate park all right so i just want to take a moment to acknowledge uh one of the biggest sponsors of the event i guess uh maybe the biggest adventure but netlify is such a an amazing supporter of the developer community and they're really pushing forward with a lot of technology that's going to make the internet faster and safer and make it easier for organizations to scale their website so matt billman from netlify is a visionary and i'm very excited personally to see where where he goes and where netlify goes in the coming years so thanks again for your support thanks thanks for having me here and thanks for helping bring all of this on and driving it forward and for building free code camp i think everything we do is about helping developers build things so being at a place and seeing hundreds of developers building things with our thing is really exciting and on the note of people building things using netlify let's talk to haxby how are you great yeah yeah you're doing great yeah well i hope we started starting with this gentleman we'll just go uh i guess in clockwise order yeah we'll do it clockwise we're gonna go like this why not we got we've got two dimensions here yeah uh and just tell us your name where you're from and what what you're doing with your time these days all right well my name is robert wolf i'm originally from europe but i'm taking my extra semester here studying ux design but i also like the code and when i discovered jamstag about a year ago i saw one of the three first keynotes i was so excited was like telling all my friends stop doing what you're doing start doing the new way and i'm so happy to be here today where it actually kind of have grown and i feel like there's a lot of people around doing the same thing great yeah hi i'm anil i am working a software developer here in bay area and i have i'm really excited about the react stuff and all then i got to know about the gatsby stuff and i have built some kind of local projects with me and then i got to know more about the jam stack and it was really exciting so i want to know who out there is working on that and i got to know about this hackathon it's pretty good environment out here yeah hold on so my name is kyle smith and i'm a student at csu stanislaus a computer science student and uh yeah just started learning about web technologies when i was in high school and found out about jam stack about like a few months ago and it was just so easy to grasp and just been interested ever since great my name is manuel and i'm a computer science student in cabrillo based in santa cruz and honestly i don't remember how i came across free code camp but i came across it thankfully and i've been programming ever since great i'm ryan weimer i live here in oakland in the bay area i actually work as a project slash account manager so i like these kind of opportunities because i've never done a hackathon before but i thought it would be awesome to get my hands dirty in the code and i really like the jam stack i've built a number of you know personal websites with it and it's such a contrast from like the monolithic things that i'm used to in the enterprise world you know doing it for a big client it's really refreshing to do something like this for the jam stack yeah well uh ryan it looks like you're at the helm yeah let me know if we can uh get this display so is it plugged in it is plugged you have to unplug it and plug it in again okay that's how they fixed the hubble the other day classical yeah hdmi intel oh into the back of the usb dongle yeah oh that would probably help conspicuously sitting there [Laughter] all right here we go okay this is big screen here we go let's make that full screen nice awesome so robert as you already know our name is haxby we're on the hackathon using gatsby um this is the problem we're selling if you ever learn the language with a language app you know it's a terribly boring and kind of weird process usually let's stare at the pictures of people you've never seen before and try to attach your basic vocabulary to the pictures it doesn't really work i've tried to learn a language with many different apps i've never succeeded so when we came here together in the hackathon we thought we're gonna make something better we're gonna approach learning a language differently and what we realized is that it's all about you right what makes the learning language easier if is if you can relate if your brain can associate things with it so we wanted to make something relatable and also fun and that's why we created ulingual now what ulingual does is it takes your instagram images and teaches you new vocab based on them now this is how our app works so at first we authorized instagram then we take the pictures from the instagram and in real time we pass them through the clarified data to get image recognitions and get an idea about what is it in there now clarify api returns this word the tags of the images in different languages so we pull it out in a different language of the user that he selected and we play a quiz with them that's how we teach them the words now this is how the quiz looks like so you have the word frutto that's for example fruit and italian and you have four pictures from your instagram feed this is my own fear it's embarrassing and you have to select the one that it is and thanks to clarify api being available in 23 different languages we can offer this product in 23 languages very easily so that's exciting now we're going to show you a quick demo about how it actually works all right that's bigger all right so this is the demo that we had showed before so this is a little bit more limited in terms of we wanted to show spanish specifically and again with robert but just to kind of give you an idea and some of these words you know there's obviously room for improvement masculino masculinity could be a lot of these right okay time ran out so that was an example yeah select great one we have a response for a good job beach if i select the wrong one oh sorry incorrect and we're also totaling your score so we kind of have some logic involved with that fruto an example and then basically we give you a score that we total and we give you an ability to tweet out your results um you know i did great on you know my my test in spanish with my own selfies or something yeah we kind of leave it up to the user and how they want to promote it but that's kind of our way of crosspromoting it another cool idea we thought was like this is such a new thing and there's probably all sorts of bugs and ways to improve it we want to give an ability to add some feedback right so using formspree we're able to simply you know add a way to give your name email what's your feedback how can we make our app better so you can send it and and actually send it that's what some dummy data obviously but yeah you get the idea right fork stream makes it really easy um and something that we're really excited about is that's what we were showing before and already we were already kind of hacking away even in the short time we had like let's add some more languages right so we're already doing that let's add german um so we're already working on making that improved so it's just cool that we could do so much more with it so that's an example of german instead of spanish and with my instagram feed there you go very cool so you were able to get instagram integrated or did you see the data so that was the biggest challenge we had we had to say that our api experts can talk about this initially when we thought about the instagram thing right we thought the privacy process will be there and all and we couldn't get the data and all so then we figured out that there is a uh api there out there but the only constraint we faced is that there's a sandbox api which allows only 10 users initially and each user will have only 20 pictures from their feed so that's how we are developing right now but when we have a fullfledged app we can send for the instagram uh access so that uh it can be expanded to an n number of users so that's what we are working on yeah so that's one kind of problem we faced here well the product looks great you've done a good job of just keeping the number of elements to an absolute minimum and it's colorful and big elements so i definitely uh commend your design sensibilities which of you yeah robert and i collaborated this great kind of like pair programming split into the api group and front end it was awesome actually that's worked out pretty great actually the api group and the frontend group so that the task can be divided easily yeah and the integration had some hiccups but yeah yeah it's pretty good what was the planning like did you sit down and think about i mean how did you how did you choose the problem to solve and then how did you set about choosing instagram and machine learning to solve it well so we actually gathered on friday on a discord chat so we didn't have any idea and we started deciding on saturday morning um we were very fascinated with the clarify api we thought well this is such a powerful thing we can do so many things with it at first we thought about helping visually impaired people and then we had this uh idea of languages and it just seemed like a chiffon concept and a lot of things to do with that and by noon we know this is what we're going with how did you select sort of the scope for the app and and where there's some things you felt like ah we really wanted those in but you cut them out actually when we first thought about the app right we thought like many of the kids apps are like this like suppose when you go to school right you'll learn about a fruit or something by seeing to that and you learn the language like that but when we thought about instagram it came out out of the blue and uh then we got in about adults as well and new language as well and that's how yeah we thought this would be more personal to the user rather than using some random images so that's how it came up exactly using instagram was kind of the key idea that makes us excited because everyone loves themselves they love their own pictures they're just gonna be addicted to this game as we are we stop developing and start playing we definitely ran into items with scope right thinking about like project management right you know we ran into lots of cool features that we wanted to so we actually had a whiteboard and wrote down lists like these are problems these are some kind of features and we tried to address the problems before the future features we wanted to add sound that'd be really cool but that's probably lower priority than some of these other ones so it's good to work on it in that way are you all concerned that at some point after playing the game a little bit that you're going to kind of be seeing the same images i mean i have a uh somewhat active instagram feed but probably not more than like maybe like 50 images in there and i can imagine that i won't be able to learn all german actually to be frank unfortunately the instagram is not allowing other public uh users images to be seen so that's one kind of privacy policy they have but other thing is that it can i think it has an endpoint where we can get the data from a specific location by giving gratitude longitude so that might work so that's kind of one of the enhancements we thought about further yeah so you can't like get images from friends or anything exactly unfortunately due to privacy issues this would have been much easier three years ago but it's a little bit more difficult now on the other hand clarify gives us a list of 20 words per image so we could basically if you have three images you can still learn 60 a good words is that extensible can you add like can you teach clarify more more terms and stuff so right now we're just using their general model we haven't really explored in there i hope we could maybe develop our own model based on instagram pictures a lot of food a lot of selfies right yeah that's a good point have you considered maybe uh expanding the functionality by encouraging people to take more photos on instagram and graduate hey maybe you should take a picture of fruit yeah it could also teach you to be a good photographer that way yeah yeah photography projects and language projects yeah all sorts of applications yeah one more thing that's important say for us it's important it's a website not an app because this is something people will go and try out really quickly and that's where the power of gemstock is coming so it opens up instantly and with one click you can start and play yeah we also will save data in the local storage so when the user wizards again they will have their app already open yeah is it mobile friendly is this thing yeah i mean because the design is pretty basic we didn't have to do too much let's see on the quiz itself let's go back to this we did make it somewhat mobile friendly as much as we can you know with a simple design no that's good have you considered talking to language teachers to get feedback on how this could be used how this could be improved so none of us is actually we didn't have personal experience because robert has learned english and other languages so that was good but i'm sure other experts would be helpful yeah well is this something you all are considering pursuing beyond the hackathon i think so yeah yeah it could be fun we came it needs push notifications to remind me it's time to study yeah that's right and to remind you to take the instagram photos of this and when you go to your next country you can talk to your friends in different languages about your instagram feed yeah well i i would encourage you to continue pursuing it i'm not like an expert in human psychology or anything but the vanity angle and the way that the brain works and stuff it may actually be more compelling and form stronger relations if it's something personally related to you that you're associating that word with so um thank you gentlemen for coming in thanks for building this excellent uh application in such a short time it's very impressive and uh yeah we'll we'll look forward to um hearing more about what you do in the coming months and if if you do continue working on this let us know because we'd like to see how it comes along and maybe to go catch up and do a retrospective on it yeah awesome all right thank you thank you thank you for the support here everyone thank you thank you yeah nice meeting you great work all right and next team who's going to come in is going to be make squad i'm very excited about my squad i'm also very excited about what you're doing is thank you so much cole cole again uh ceo and cofounder of performance free cold chromhold and uh thanks for all the guidance you've provided to the many participants here you have truly created a a great developer experience as far as installing forms and forms are a big deal and pretty much every developer has to deal with forms and i'm really excited to hear that you're so rapidly expanding and you've got the api sounds like development is coming along swimming over there the team who couldn't make it here they were working really hard uh up up until like pretty much the last minute and yeah it was great um we got a lot of good stuff done at the end including an entire redesign of the site which uh yeah it was a great forcing function for us to get a lot of stuff done i think now we're going to probably do some cleanup all right well good luck paying down the technical debt here we are with our next very exciting team uh first of all before we get started i just want to say that this was incredibly well presented i think all of us agreed that your delivery was phenomenal so we're looking forward to hearing a little bit more of that donut delivery here but uh make squad let's start let's start with you faith and perhaps you can introduce yourself and then we can kind of go around and clockwise and uh introduce everybody else yeah definitely um so i'm faith um and um i'm a student at make school so hence the name make squad um and yeah so um we have some other people here on the team as well yeah well before before we do uh if you could just tell us like where you're from and aside from being a student at make school like just a little bit about your background sure um so i'm from atlanta um i moved out to san francisco to attend mcschool um right now i'm working on backend web development as my primary concentration um but i was interested in this hackathon because uh the opportunity to work kind of more in the front end and exercise that skill a little bit and i was excited by all of the apis um and i also have an interest in things that have to do with machine learning um and we did employ a little bit of the clarify api in here so that was really fun to work with and to see how that works yeah awesome and tachara yes i'm tashara boucher and i'm from southern california i've been in san francisco for about two years and i came here to do to be a chaplain in the hospital but after my residency year i i guess um wanted to do like a combination of both but tech and the social services so my ultimate goal is to try to have a nonprofit for young adults who've been mentally or physically abused in childhood and to help them with the trade like so the coding and to be able to like put um so that they can have a better lifestyle after having a slump i guess for the years um and so this hackathon is a great experience for me to get experience to network with different people and to meet these wonderful people who are from make school and graciously welcomed me into their team i'm excited awesome i'm edwin and i'm from uh georgia also in make school and i moved here about four months ago um and well i i i worked with coding off and on for like the last 10 years but nothing really serious until i i moved here um but it's always been a passion of mine and i had a lot of fun at this hackathon learning these new technologies great oh i'm jonathan and i'm a full stock developer at make school and i'm from houston texas awesome okay hi i'm stephanie um i'm a junior in med school so i just started a couple months ago in august and i'm from miami i just learned about the opportunity um um i've done also free coop camp like a couple of people here as well and it was great i've also done one hackathon before and it was it was great it was stressful too but there were the end product was great was lovely i i love building products yeah and since you all are from high school perhaps just a quick word about make school because it is a new educational model yeah so it's a new education model um and it is um product uh based learning um so basically instead of attending a lot of long boring lectures and writing stuff on the whiteboard for hours and kind of getting an entrenched in the theory of it we build products throughout the term you build a product at the end of every term we have like our own mini hackathon it's an intensive where you build a product in a week we work on teams we work individually so throughout the time that you attend the program you're building up a portfolio um and so that's why a lot of us were interested in doing this hackathon because we wanted to have another opportunity to build something to yeah to ship it get our idea out there yeah and how long is the program mixed school is two years um and it is a bachelor's program so it's an accelerated bachelor's we have some people who attend for about a year and then they get hired out of the program but it's a two year long program great so at the end of the program you all have a bachelor's degree yeah now it's pretty remarkable so if you're looking for novel higher education models it sounds like this might be worth investigating so um without further ado let's let's jump to the demo you ready yes let's do it yeah so um our app is called network you can leave your business card at home because your face is your business card and so we thought a lot about you know what it feels like sometimes when you're at these networking events especially because the world is full of a lot of emerging technologies sometimes you forget those business cards or it's clunky to kind of like you know waffle with those um and so our idea was to build an app where you can simply take a photo of somebody or you can take a video of them and you can use that video or that photo to retrieve their virtual business card to get back their information so we built kind of a minimum viable product here that demonstrates that idea and we're hoping to have a chance to develop it further in the future but for now we do want to start with the app and so this is the um the business card info you would go ahead and fill in your name your email address your phone number um your state city and state um and then you can fill in your linkedin we would also have twitter which would be an optional field and then another field where you could fill in uh additional information and then you could submit that but before we go to the submission page we also connected a contact form here so for people who for people who have questions for people who have id uh you know ideas for new features or for people who have problems using the app they can um ping us we used forms free to connect the contact form and this form actually does work it does submit and we get the email from that so we could get updated information there yeah you can go ahead and submit it if you want to and then of course we have to put it that we're not a robot i'm not a room full of robots i don't like y'all but i'm kind of a robot just a little bit just a little bit so that went through a couple of submissions from this ip address over there yeah um and then for um you can go ahead and yeah there you go so we got two sides or two ways to um to go ahead and check check out the database you can go to camera um first and you want to go to video first camera okay um and so then you just select the image um so for now we're using the celebrity um model of the api um because it was already hooked up to like a trading model but ideally we would be able to use user photos in the future and it goes to the database we used fauna db for the database and we used clarify for the api that's the celebrity model that we're using here and then it would bring back the person's information we have leonardo dicaprio and we got kanye as our tests great and earlier you you were able to use a phone to demo this could you do that just to show that the image recognition will work from like a another device and then our third celebrity all right do it again one more time all right it worked the demo worked and so there's our app yeah great demo thanks for going through it um questions how did you know that this was the app you wanted to make how did you kind of settle into the idea well we're kind of talking about it right while we're coming into the building on the first day and we like bounce ideas around and we talked more about the ideas once we got in and then decided that this would be a good idea to do at this hackathon how at what point did you start working in this specific idea so when we first started out we um we had been taught that um you actually have to plan first before you start even coding so we didn't start coding until like the middle of the day and so we started with um user stories to try to make sure we we had the app do what it's supposed to do and we had we even used parts of github like on the projects page where you have a kanban board and you can move the um the the cards over once you've been it's been completed so i think that's a good way to plan so that way you can know whether what you're you want to do is actually done yeah and i can testify that we use github projects all the time it's very powerful isn't it satisfying when you can move the cards over it's like crossing it off your list yeah i like that how did y'all organize your work how did you decide like team which teams did that or you know front end back in that kind of thing okay i think we all played um on our streams i know that's like one of the first things that we ask is like what are you good at and we divided it up that way and um we had some very strong and beckons like she said um the make school focuses on back end but they also i guess focus on full stack so really wonderful frontend specialists right here and so just and really everybody just chipping in where you know whether they're slack given or if someone was struggling they moved the top out in any of the areas you all did a great job with the the design yeah um you know it's like you know pink and blue i think they're complimentary colors like if you look at like a color wheel and uh very minimalist design you can see like the little element that kind of flourish up there with the rounded raindrop shapes who did the design well [Laughter] helped me with a lot of the things just making sure it worked and it was cohesive on every single page as well so yeah um yeah we had we had some some ideas about what what we wanted and the way we wanted it to look we did want it to be minimalist so i'm glad you said that but we also wanted i i was really a fan of a lot of color in the background like um so we can market to people who are are networking and starting off in their careers yeah for the modern uh kind of professional yeah it definitely like looks like something that would get acquired by linkedin they had like a card app where you just like took a photo of the card and then it you know yeah and now you can take a picture on that note are you are you all planning to continue working on this after the weekend's over oh if linkedin buys it even if it doesn't take an offer tomorrow morning i think we have a great um kind of i said minimum viable product before and i think it would be good for us to continue development on it so that we can get it hooked up and get users actually in there to make sure that this is something that people would use that people would enjoy using yeah actually we haven't done any user testing so we don't even know if this is this could be good for them you know it could just be a product and it doesn't go anywhere so we have to check our market as well yeah that's very that's a sage observation and uh i can tell you i don't carry business cards and people often ask for them and i just say i don't know your phone i'll email you people being able to go now you'll be able to say my face is my business card all right well thank you again so much uh for coming in and demoing this and building it and it sounds like you all are from all over the u.s congratulations on converging and and forming a team and you know jiving so cohesively yeah it's amazing so yeah thanks again and uh we're looking forward to hearing about how things go at future hacking lawns as well thank you thank you all right cheers thanks hey thank you congratulations thank you thanks for having us okay thank you all right thank you so much for the opportunity yeah all right well uh we're three demos in into our six or seven teams that we're going to talk to four more lifts and at this time i want to talk about chris anderson he is the director of developer evangelism at fauna and i interviewed this guy yesterday and i don't know that i've ever talked to somebody who's worked with so many different types of databases that still looks so young he's definitely got an encyclopedic knowledge of nosql databases and also knows a lot about real world implementation issues and and the tradeoffs associated with different types of databases chris um thank you so much for coming here and inspiring everybody and sharing your knowledge and also uh thanks to to you and fauna for sponsoring this event oh yeah i really enjoy like the little bits of ways to help people get unstuck when they're hacking like to me that's the fun part yeah well um our next team is i'm gonna have to look up your name i'm sorry phoebe and jam yeah that's right all right so uh you all have these nice pasta stickers on what do you think of the household i forgot for a mascot i think it's nice it's got a little uh little character to it yeah you think it's the octacat tier oh it's up there i don't know we need to have like a you know how like uh i think it's like game effect he's has like the character face off and last year like tetris l block one because it's the ultimate hero it saves the day yeah so we should have something like that with mascots and put pit uh octopad versus hospital oh yeah sure absolutely so uh starting with you vince why don't you tell us a little about yourself and we're gonna move in a clockwise since we got two rows here okay yeah okay so my name is vince uh i'm a native san franciscan born and raised and i guess i don't know i'm an aspiring developer you know currently looking for work and uh yeah that's pretty much it hi my name is jin i like gin and tonic like the alcohol i'm also a native san franciscan like vince i'm also kind of using free code camp to learn and try and learn how to program i kind of have backgrounds as this admin but i want to make that leap into the development space and so this is my first hackathon and trying to learn as much as possible all right next my name is brandon stinson i am not a developer i'm currently in the air force i hit 13 years this month just uh trying to learn something new for when i get out so i've got a couple years left and i want to be a developer so i've been learning with free code camp and a couple of the resources and it's my first hackathon awesome yeah my name is reuben um i'm a native san franciscan but i moved when i was four yeah i'm not developer either i'm a mechanical engineer and then i transitioned over to electrical and now i'm trying to transition over to software and so yeah i used uh i still gotta start with free code camp so thank you quincy um but yeah i've just been working on react and it's also my first hackathon it's been just a ton of fun like getting to talk with the sponsors it's cool yeah and uh i'm austin and i yeah i got a degree in chemical engineering decided i wanted to switch to software engineering and so yeah i relied heavily on free codecamp for that and and now i work at human api which is a startup in san mateo and um so i have a open source project you don't know javascript exercises and run a meetup a react meetup in berkeley so wow prolific punch and uh yeah from from varied backgrounds although disproportionately from san francisco yeah from san francisco well tell us a little bit why don't we plug in so we can demo yeah so we'll be able to are we going to use your phone yeah oh there you go wow look at those hands we need to get you a cryogenic freak oh yeah or whatever they're called so yeah so you can go ahead and click on the app so it's uh sick pics we have this little uh so yeah what sick pics is is it's a game for anyone who can anyone can play um so right now so we have this create a game button where you can click and create a game right now there's a button below that says no games available but if there's a game available then anyone can join join a random game that someone else has created and what the game is is once it starts you could have any number of people that have joined that game and you need to take a picture of whatever it tells you to take a picture of and whoever takes that the picture of that thing first wins and it will notify everyone that you won or lost and then it will take you back to the home page so it's kind of like um blazing fast machine learning uh image recognition scavenger hunt um that uh you can play with your friends or anyone throughout the world so um if any of you would like to play yeah all right let's do it all right all right phone's up okay so yeah let's go ahead and create the game elegant uh so it's sicc dash piccs sick dash picks dot netlify.com sig fix on netflix.com and so you can once you get there you can click join a random game no sorry sick picks it's just plc you might consider an easier spelling [Laughter] all right so it looks like we have six players in this game all right are you guys in good to go yeah i'm gonna go ahead and start all right we gotta take a picture of ketchup oh oh that's some high speed turning there i'm not sure why but you have a chance someone could get you in the events this is the fastest iphone [Laughter] big oh who won i lost two maybe i i didn't win i did something wrong [Laughter] hey out there they're in the kitchen they're ready yeah i might have ended up in a oh okay all right let's do it again you guys ready all right let's create that game whoa yeah i think you may have a good game on your hands all right pretty quick there's definitely less phones in here than there are players all right let's do this [Laughter] this is not a picture of ketchup you have to take one that is probably going to surpass the advances all right so yeah um yeah so right now anyone can create a game and when you join a game you just join any kind of random game um so yeah what we tried to do was uh make sure to clear out for the demo and get the game going so but yeah anyone with the the url can just go ahead and create a game and anyone can join and then whoever creates the game has the control to start and so right now what we have in our database as the options are ketchup in a coffee so that we know that we have it um but yeah with the clarify api uh we could add all kinds of things with all kinds of different models so um yeah all right worried that you might uh if you know if you open it up you might end up with you know requests for images in there that might put people in harm's way you know like for example images yeah so the images don't the images are all local so we're not doing anything with the images we're not sending them and the ones in the in our database are just a coffee and a ketchup not like a pickup truck on fire yeah what other kinds of images do you think you'd load in there to kind of expand the scope of the game what other kind of images yeah do you have an example or a thought or so dog dog oh you mean yeah so really it's we're kind of just limit all we're limited by is the clarify api so right now our model we have a model of the food model and we just have ketchup and coffee but yeah we could yeah we could we would control like what's available to be ended yeah for the scavenger hunt yeah and then right now so like all the whole game is is client based in terms of like determining whether you won or not so um which is it's kind of fun with um just the fact that we can have like almost the whole game client side which is kind of a lot of fun yeah what's the obviously it has like a realtime component and certainly what did you use for that um does anyone else wanna answer yeah so we used hasura um so asura is i mean for everyone listening who doesn't know yet uh real time uh it's a graphql api or a backend database that has uh realtime capabilities so that's that's exactly why we chose to build the game you know because that's like one of the primary applications for it um yeah so one of the examples we would sub for example showing the number of people that are in the game you subscribe to uh the users that have a game id of the game that you you just created or the game that you're a part of and so um yeah any time that the postgres database changes you automatically get those those changes yeah whenever someone wins we're just like we said the game is completely client based so whenever someone updates the state you know and reacts that they won we just update that in the database so none of like no one's going to take a picture some weird and put and push toward database yeah right yeah so and then we also subscribe to the status of the game so if when it's pending and someone pushes start the game then it will update for everyone the fact that it's um started in progress and then when someone wins it updates to say that the game is finished and who the the winner was so um yeah we could we could expand to you know have user names or or names or also like you can choose which game that you want to join perhaps um yeah a lot of different ways we could expand up that way how was the development process like i guess how did you decide what you're going to build so we started yeah we started i think we i think we had um the apis in mind already like clarify and asura like they had like we just kind of thought about the possibilities and so um we decided again because i mean it's fun to make games right and like also um when you make something that's like something no one here has ever done something exactly like this before right and so we're all thinking creatively and everything and so it helped us i mean it pushed us you know what i mean so that's like one of the reasons we picked it and um but as far as the development process we started off with we initially started off with the gatsby um because um the graphql implementation there is relatively easy to use and the development screen is pretty fast but we ran into several problems um one being that graspy does get gatsby doesn't handle mutations subscriptions anything that's not a query very well and so we switched over to cray racked up and then we're using apollo as clarify api cloud and cloud narrative yeah we're sending our pictures to cloud number and then we're gonna image the url back and then sending that to clarify cool yeah all right well gentlemen thank you for the wonderful demo thanks for answering our many questions very exhaustive answers by the way it's clearly you put a lot of thought into the tools that you chose yeah cool thank you thank you very much thank you thank you thanks awesome pleasures thank you very much thank you you all have fun thanks again i'll see you downstairs this way unless you want to go i'm pretty impressed how are you all feeling yeah it's gonna be a hard decision that's true yeah i think it's really interesting to hear sort of what the process is that people are using and how some teams are really going hard at the beginning at the planning process and kind of making sure that they're building something up front that's going to be useful i think that's cool to i see maybe like society has advanced enough where like you know when i was when i was in getting into the industry i would have done that right yeah a it's a much more mature process that people seem to be undertaking as opposed to just like i think it would be cool to you know have three databases and then try and put them all together using an api that's strictly based on images i don't have any idea what i just said no no we probably don't we didn't even have an api right let's just talk to it we're all just were there days like that i mean i remember getting like floppy disks with shareware too play around with right like because when i was a kid you had to build your own computer where you could start writing code welcome hey colin right got it thanks for watching yes yeah i'm trying to be good with names okay well thank you so much for building this amazing project that vaulted you to what floor are we on like right above us all there is is a roof deck wow yeah it was a catapult right we heard that if we lose you're going to catapult this off the roof we would use it try in keeping with our double dare theme if you bolt it into jello just don't say i don't know all right well welcome it's it's so wonderful to have you both up here uh perhaps you could just tell us a little bit about yourself your background how you all met what brought you here okay so my name is faye yang i flew in from houston on friday houston texas um i started free cocamp about two years ago and because i wanted to learn a little bit more my day job's actually in corporate finance but i see the potential for the future and i would like to be able to work it more into my career my name is colin i live here in oakland currently i maintain a php app for a construction company that's working on the bart extension to san jose on a contract basis i would like to be doing a javascript javascript thing on more of a fulltime basis we met um the day before friday yeah on discord um in the channel to do to me great and i think that's the second team that made it all the way here that had actually met and talked friday night so preparation planning definitely seems to work right yeah okay great well perhaps you could uh go ahead and tell us a little bit about smartypants and uh give us a demo so we're team smartypants tea like the teapot song in final jeopardy um we built this app because every year there's more than 300 000 people who'd like to qualify for the show but only 400 people actually bank it now this means that it's actually harder to get on jeopardy than into harvard i decided on monday that i would like to audition for jeopardy but in looking online i couldn't find any user friendly or modern resources so when we came here this is what we decided to build so when you look at it you're presented with a question the category and the value of the question so in the city of yuma in this state has a record of record average of four thousand fiftyfive hours of sunshine each year any guesses arizona arizona oh sorry what is arizona you don't have to use the what is okay cool so when you type in the correct answer it increases your bank to 200 which was the worth of the i think it's 100 for the worth of the question 200 yeah so then it automatically advances you to the next question now for this one let's say we don't know we don't want to be docked we just hit enter to move on so no change now in this third one we're feeling confident we're going to take a guess any guess we'll take a guess and what we'll find is when it's wrong the answer will show up below but you also lose money in your bank well now that you have the answer you say okay let me type in the answer maybe it'll take it and we can't cheat on this what happens is when you hit enter no points no docking move on we found that this app will solve the real life problem of we can take it on the go it will be mobile friendly and it has the capability to be a pwa powered by gatsby we built smartypants using gatsby so that's react material ui netlify and fauna our first challenge was loading up the fauna database we used the fauna importer command line tool right away this gate was an issue that seems to have something to do with file format even though our json data validated just fine deba at fauna was super helpful he was kind enough to actually go on their internal slack channel and follow up seek help and follow up with me in an email it turned out what we needed was just a single flag on the command line i was just missing an option once we had that option it worked fine we loaded up 610 sample questions that's 10 shows worth out of our total set of 200 000 real world historic jeopardy questions that we've downloaded the next step was to wire up that fauna database to netlify using netlify's lambda function service this gave us three issues first of all in terms of development production parity we had to run a server to run the functions in development whereas in production they're on the same domain so then proxying to that server in gatsby it eluded us at first the second thing the toml file format gave us some issues we were putting sensitive data in there we were putting api keys in there and so we didn't want to version control it so then we were like how do we get that on netlify remove the api keys and use netlify's interface for environment variables like heroku um and the third thing was that gatsby and building on the back end didn't have access to window.fetch so we eventually figured out that we needed a fetch polyfill um in all of these i have to get a give a huge shout out to sean at netlify who was super generous and super patient he basically sat with us and paired with us through all of these problems he seems to like share our stoke at every success point on all of these in resolving all of these issues and a couple more really it was about simplified the simplest possible use case and console log that's something that i would say to other free code camp learners especially people who are just starting out simplify simplify simplify and then get some output as soon as possible console log it overall our biggest sticking point was wiring up all these apis together i spent all day yesterday and an hour of this morning just getting these various apis to work together and to get a build that would deploy um so that took away a lot of time from actually building ui from actually building react components now that i've done it once though i would definitely go back i would definitely use netlify and this host of services again so for future applications for the jeopardy specific we want to add more gameplay options but i think we have an opportunity to also use this as a framework so i used to teach english to um elderly iranian immigrants who were trying to qualify for citizenship so you could take this this framework all you need is your own fauna key and an appropriately formatted set of questions in json format and you could upload those to your own fauna database and then you could make something like a citizenship quiz app that you could take on the go use at home at work on the bus etc great first of all it sounds like you all learned quite a bit for sure do you have um like ideas about i don't know um opening it up to be a multiplayer contest or uh end users can submit new questions or that kind of thing um for end users submitting questions if we're connecting to the jeopardy historic database i think maybe not but for their expansion uh with using different frameworks yes in terms of other players we toured with the idea of doing user authentication with profile with stats to strengthen categories a leaderboard but with the limited amount of time that we had this weekend we've opened up an own issue in our repo to work on it in the future i would definitely say that user identities and persisting data would be one of our next steps so it was i mean i think one of the things everybody here loved like liked about this app was that you scoped it very well so you can easily see adding that in the future right but starting out with building something that in itself works and gives the idea before worrying about that it's a really good approach thank you thanks yeah the core gameplay is there are some other things that you did early on to kind of try and scope the project or divide up the work or do the planning before you actually started writing code drew it out about how we want the basic ui to look at potential gameplay formats that we would pick a couple and then how we would maybe do users and how we'd split it up so ui ux react and then more of the back end linking up the different apis and from our very first contact i would say we immediately started talking about what mvp looked like what our literal minimal scope looked like and then actually we have a teammate who can't be here because he's at work he so i said it took away time from working on the ui he actually was working on like basic ui without being wired up to any back end yesterday while we were doing the api wire up stuff so so you were able to work in tandem and not block one another totally yeah synchronously all right do you have any other questions for colin faye straight up would you keep uh working on it afterwards or did we already hit that like are you thinking about experience sure yeah we have like at least two or three issues that aren't very far off for us that i think we could get to really quickly and i would say um when people look for jobs after free code camp they say build your portfolio don't just build what's on the coursework build what's your passion project and i think i found mine in this one nice great and uh just one last question when are you planning to apply to uh to be on jeopardy i don't know i have a lot of studying but first i need to build this app then i'll study with the app all right great well thank you so much it's been a pleasure thanks good to see you again wow a lot of games tonight yeah yeah yeah it seems like a popular way to uh make something cool for a hackathon absolutely and pretty exciting to again like if you're doing a game that single player experience the first thing you feel when you pick the game up matters so much to the success of the game yeah so like they did you can scope your app and leave out like so much of the hard heavy lift and still get your gameplay done yeah yeah and what's the first game that any of you created did you ever i mean everyone's had to create a game at some point like the first has always been like the tutorial doing the kissing kiss and number games yeah that has to be like the first one i created like a star trek next generation quiz game i don't know about first but like high pressure was like uh somehow i didn't know that i was gonna have like a whole bunch of people who were you know from overseas in my office like learning the technology and that morning so i woke up and got to work and here's all these people and they don't really speak english and they need to learn nosql and so i i've got the monitor up with my editor and i was like let's make a game nice nice yeah i also ended up making a game yesterday oh yeah and live stream all right well next up uh we have the this jam fizzy jam yeah thank you busy jam and uh so so thrilled to have you all here very impressed with your application we can't wait to see it but we can wait because first we want to learn a little bit about you all we'll start here with zubin and then we'll go in clockwise order can i answer real quick what was it about a project that impressed you first so many things so many things yeah but several things yes it's a very impressive application and uh you know just you know the animation but i won't i won't i'll wait i'll restrain myself so before i wax poetically about your app i'll let the rest of the world see it zoom in take it away hey um my name is zubin um i'm actually from melbourne australia i was here at work and um i reached out to quincy got a ticket because i really wanted to be part of this i'm a free curriculum student in fact free code camps that have rescued me from from deep depression because i couldn't figure out how to code before if we could get like i'd given up twice and then thanks for please go camp um i really got back on and it's been upwards since so really excited to use my skills here awesome welcome welcome to the states i love it here great i'm sean i was born and raised in the bay um i was originally in i.t and i since left my job to pursue learning code full time and i've been doing it about a year now and this is my first hackathon so excited to learn hi my name is ilan i'm originally from colombia i've been in the bay area for about five years and i'm a frontend developer and i love the idea of jumpstart so i'm very thrilled to be here until the end my name is juan i'm from massachusetts and i'm currently a student at rhythm school yeah let's go to school my name is sarah i just moved to san francisco a couple months ago to also attend rhythm school and this was my first hackathon so it's great to be here i learned a lot great yeah my name is david lau and i'm a free cocamp student and i just i've been going through the curriculum the full stack the new full stack web development curriculum and uh i learned so much going through this project uh that you wouldn't learn by yourself because it's just a completely different setting i mean you think you know everything already but once you work with other people you don't know is my language but no it's great to work with other people with different backgrounds and you need to like just work with other people you think like you think you know it all but you don't you can always work with more people and yeah i love these guys great well word to the audience come to hackathons put yourself out there get experience working with a team all right so let's see it all right you ready cool yeah all right so i'll quickly introduce busy jam so um we like to think of easy jam as it's time to do to forget about pokemon capture data instead you know when you when you come to a hackathon there's a real problem with invisible data you know who's who's there what level of experience do they have do they need to team members or not how do they find team members and then there's a problem for actual organizers and the uh you know the product managers and others who run the sponsorship side of things right so the api and things like that all the apis available who's using it whether they had an easy time or not such an easy time using why did they choose to use it this is all really valuable information from the organizational point of view so eventually what we're going to make busy jam do is also be a matchmaking service for attendees and at the same time provide really high quality data to organizers and the and the sponsors um when we got together we realized um it was such a pain because none of us actually knew each other it was hard to find team members and that right away was an immediate you know problem that we wanted to try and solve that's where this started and then we said before we start building or writing and code let's actually validate this so we went and had a whole bunch of interviews spoke to a bunch of people interviewed each other and others who had attended identified the basic problem statement then started prioritizing what we wanted to build researched the apis built it you know it was a great experience uh and so what visijam does now as you can see it's it's a pretty straightforward dashboard we've got all that is realtime data and so we've used gatsby and netlify of course we also use formspree so that's actually real data from attendees at this um at this hackathon so david if you want to go to the entry form um so that's actually we can actually start bunching in data right now and david will do that as i speak but it asks a bunch of questions um and you can see that it'll update so when we go back to the dashboard you will see for example if david were to say that he's now very experienced in java it'll show that there was another person who's increased his you know level of experience and let's say java um we can add stuff fairly quickly to this that also talks about what uh what apis they use right now we're using form spree for the actual form um and we're also using phone streams backend with an api endpoint from where we can retrieve the data we're using um netlify to actually run the continuous deployment um and you know the netlife login page is also possible but that makes sense only once we have a proper user data model and stuff like that um right now you can see that when he's when he submits it it'll say okay um what i want is i don't want i want the viewer to be able to see that i made a change in the data so what i'm going to do is i need to make another tab and because i don't want it like dummy data so so so that when i do something actually the change is reflected so right now the percentage of mail you can see is gender 6624 so once i enter my form data it should theoretically increase 66.2 by whatever one of whatever is the total so as long as larger than that so we will know it's different 66 point yeah so go to this actually doesn't work it goes to the yeah you can go back to the video yes go back to that yeah i'll go back to the bookmark so mail was 66.2 it's 66.7 so there was a difference so we can see that there's a change in the data yeah and what we did was we had members of our team walk up to other attendees and personally deliver this kind of survey conduct the kind of survey ask them these questions some of us ask them questions i just gave them the links like hey can you could you do this for us and you know yeah you're nice yeah they'll say yeah of course why not it's just a couple minutes just fill out a simple form but yeah the root problem as zubin uh mentioned was when we all came in we didn't know who who each other are and we could use this data to if we had this data beforehand we would know better about our other attendees oh you work with javascript i work with javascript too it's just easier way to know who each other are it would have been helpful if we had this before but we made it now we can use this for future hackathons anything we can expand it to wherever we want but we can do that all in two days so we just did what we could the basic one of our users actually had a really cool suggestion they're like you know we've done two or three of the attack accounts before but we don't have a profile that says that um with the link to the hackathon then i actually thought that's actually a fantastic idea let's talk about you know user generated product development right somebody actually okay so you know if um david's done three hackathons these are the dates this you know this is the link it's a great platform for hackathons to advertise their hack accounts as well yeah and the products that could be like there's so much stuff we could use and unlike other you know we wanted to be careful not to make it a trivial custodial application we want to make it something that could prove that the apis were also capable of supporting a b2b use case which i think is really important from a monetization point of view for the api certainly so we said okay if this was a serious product could it actually you know could the apis actually support it and they absolutely can so that's great excellent thank you for the demo it's questions have you thought about how to get the word out to me this is like tailor made for uh press releases and having magazines right here i'm enough to get on a live stream i don't know if you have any ideas on how you can do that but that would be awesome um but yeah we can always make it we can always make it better i know it looks kind of uh it looks simple right now but we can make it like more interactive uh so that once you enter like once you enter your data you can know exactly like you'll animate so you can see the change in difference of the data so it doesn't look like i have to refresh the page uh but yeah let's we can look over the data and this kind of data could be interesting to a data scientist who studies data i don't think any we none of us had kind of background data scientists but i've heard of what they do i mean i know what their role is it's different than us we're doing development we make the structure we use the structure and build up the product but to this a data scientist they could see oh you know this uh this event had many attendees who had program who had experience with javascript right like 20 beginners 18 38 intermediate and 5 advanced and not many not many ruby developers so probably not many too many who develop on ruby most kicks just jumping actually because that's an interesting question do you guys how would you guys want to use this because you know we've asked a lot of the participants we haven't had a chance to ask people who actually produce the apis and the management how would you like to use something like this so how would you see this be useful well you mentioned a little bit matchmaking which would you know you need to go deeper so you'd model the individual correct there's an individual uh you know who fills out the survey yeah yeah that was a feature that we talked about in our planning process um but you know we were thinking about what's our minimum viable product in a twoday period it was kind of on the wish list yeah yeah we had to be really strict about prioritizing but you know that's the perfect sort of thing for a graph you are kind of you know back in it would be awesome yeah any other ideas at what point did you guys all decide like this is what we're going to build instead of building i think we had like this basic concept um pretty quickly like within five minutes of discussing our plan yeah um and then we kind of had a sort of like spider web conversation of like what about these features we made a list um and then probably took another 20 minutes to really narrow down like this is our minimum viable product and i think one of the big challenges we faced is um even when we were starting out we started out with a static json file that we were loading the data from and then we wanted to transition to the live update that hits the api so a lot of us are really new to git and so um having kind of different branches where we were experimenting with different things um created submerged conflicts so it was actually great to have the opportunity to kind of work through that together no you you asked how it the idea started right it it actually uh started uh when we all sat down and we had the brainstorming idea and uh elon he just threw it out there say you know we should we should start asking people around i mean he had he had the initiative to just bring it up and we were all listening we were thinking if it's a good idea we thought about it and we said yeah let's just let's do it yeah i have to definitely commend your execution because it takes i can speak from experience having built projects where you go around and you ask everybody back upon do something it takes a lot of uh work and a lot of courage to approach your peers and stick an ipad in their hand or however you were going about doing it so yeah it's really impressive you might scroll down just a little bit to the years of coding so according to typeform which is what we use to collect uh data for advent giving up the tickets the tickets were free but you had to go through this tutorial this jam stack tutorial i created uh and one of the questions was how long you've been coding and uh the median number of months was 16 16 months coding which is right there yeah so this is where yeah so it's between one and two years so yeah that's exactly right that's the representation that's distribution just between 12 and 20. yeah yeah so it's pretty cool that uh your data is so representative as my data which was like a thousand data points yeah that's great yeah it shows like yeah there's a wide range of experience and uh yeah there's something that works less than six months so you know if you're attending someone maybe your experience and you want to group up with someone uh experience as well so you know you know you guys can get started real quick right away maybe you know you want to grow up with someone with less experience so you can mentor them that's a possibility too if you knew if people who signed up had less experience you could link them up with the people who are looking for people looking for and i think also like in just promoting you know future hackathons you know for me this was my first hackathon and i was kind of wondering whether i should sign up or not am i going to be ready um and so seeing you know that oh in the last hackathon there were people who had less than six months of coding experience um could be a way to make you know more people feel comfortable in the future were there questions you wanted to put in but left out because you didn't have too many questions absolutely i mean we wanted to actually talk about stuff like we'll you know hopefully we were thinking if we could collect the data fairly close to the end but we knew that's a high pressure time everyone's going to just tell us to take a hike right but the idea was you know which of the apis you use and actually just have a chat but like we've got the form widget i just haven't productionized that that bit because you know we didn't want to add that um there were a couple of questions like that how many have you done before and stuff like that so we just wanted to prioritize what we know people would be happy to share very quickly it takes less than 30 seconds to collect the data when we went out but ahead um that kind of stuff yeah yeah and as part of the ideation process we talked about if we wanted to be more individual contributor like a member or someone attending uh focused or uh like uh sponsor focus right so with once we decide on that we were also able to kind of parse through the questions and be like okay this is something more that like netlify would want to know right this is more something someone like me sarah or elon would want to know so we did that as well well i'm very impressed with this and i could definitely see this as being kind of like one of the major components of essentially a larger open source hackathon toolkit that hackathon organizers could use and one of the things we built over the weekend at freecodecamp was that leaderboard we called it the project index because it wasn't actually a leaderboard but it you know this plus that which is open source i think they put the mit license on it um and all these other uh tools that we could potentially come up with you know we could potentially have like a whole suite when you want to have a hackathon clone this repo yeah get started right license as well yeah quincy actually i want to bring this up we did was actually something you did earlier earlier simpler uh uh before like this year which was like a uh every time you sign up to sign into freecodecampage there's a survey a link with the header it says click here we're we're doing a mass survey of all the uh developers please spend give us five minutes that's that's exactly what we did we asked people you know their background just demographic information that's just what you did and then we we just brought alive to the to the to the tendons the locationality of it uh and the temporality of it are definitely an interesting uh aspect and what uh what dave is referencing is the 2018 new coder survey which we interviewed 30 000 people uh we had them all fill out a survey we're currently crunching those numbers but we're gonna release that as a giant public data set hopefully in a month or so and you know people are interested in that data right we're going to get it out there yeah hey oh thank you so much thank you thanks everybody david thank you sarah juan elon sean you all are great you've done some amazing work here and uh thanks again i hope you'll stick around and eat some food get some drinks you guys talk downstairs thank you thanks very much thank you thank you all right and i think we have anybody need to go to the bathroom hang in there four five six seven team number seven where in the world they should be coming in that's my resume if you didn't hear me yeah it's a shame you have got some uh yeah there you go yeah i respect it all right welcome thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for waiting in the hall it is uh thrilling to introduce you all we were very impressed with your application we can't wait to see it before we do let's go around and talk about each of you and your background and what drew you to this hackathon we'll start with you sure my name is tatis i i've been a full stack develop web developer for a few years but recently uh left my company to go to work on a jam stack app a business built around a jam stag app of my own so that's what i'm doing right now and i'm here because jamstack drew me the the conference jimmy to to san francisco and wanted to stick around for the hackathon as well so i'm jeff i am a freelance web developer i've been working for about seven eight years at various contracts and i've been really uh into the jam stack because i love working on the front end part of things and i like working on the interface and what you see and you know if i can have apis take care of the back end it's great so i i wanted to meet more people that are all about that kind of stack and see where i can go with it so yeah great my name is gabe greenfield i'm a frontend developer i work at frontier airlines in denver colorado um and yeah i'm drawn to the jams tech as another you know front end developer looking to outsource some of that back end work so that i can do what i love and make apps really quick that are fun cool exciting and really powerful so uh yeah my name is tyler vick i live in columbus ohio i am an aerospace engineer turned data scientist turned web developer and i've been using netlify in my freelance work and i couldn't miss the chance to come to a sponsored jam stack conference and hackathon sounds like you all have a lot of jam stack experience between the four of you it's awesome uh jeff you want to take it away with the demo yeah so um well i guess yeah we're team where in the world and we are going to be doing a live game show with everybody watching so if you're watching please join in check there's a link on the discord before you can go to uh whitworld.live yes we bought a domain don't worry it's hosted on netlify please join that link and so we're going to get started here but uh and you and if you know if it's taking you a minute you can join in the middle it's fine so you just go here um put in your your name it's gonna show up on the leaderboard so pick a name that you'll recognize yeah so we'll give them a minute to join now we're in the lobby if you look in the top left there you can see the the player count increasing um live no no need to refresh it'll keep up updating as more players join looks like we've got you might want to drag the window just a little bit yeah is it not yeah hopefully it's right on the screen 18. wow yeah great all right so now we can full team i think we're about ready let's kick it off we're gonna we're gonna kick it we're using a little netify function with our we might play a couple back again there's gonna be an image and then there's a map okay you wanna pick like point a pin on the map where you think that image is that's basically it where in the world the image is all right are you ready kick it off here okay let's do it so now everyone sees this and if it you know the mobile should see uh the images the map below the image and if you're on a desktop you'll see you can see where i'm guessing so now [Laughter] now jeff has guessed he's submitted everyone else is getting their submissions in and as everyone else is guessing we're going to see them pop up live here uh wherever everyone thinks it is and then you also if you make the screen a little smaller we can see the scores on the right as well oh yeah don't forget to hit submit because if you don't hit submit you just won't get uh you just won't get the uh we won't record your submit your your yes what happened there but uh don't worry we run it again we can run another game in a second here but you can see the scores are popping up there on the right um as as everyone's done and the game is over right yeah the game is over it's you get 30 seconds and uh that was that's the game so we can play let's do another one do another one for those of you who missed might have had anything unclear with the instructions so play again pops up you should have a button up here yeah or in your mobile app somewhere click play again on top to play again so now we'll be in the waiting room oh man we got 21 now getting up there yeah just gonna feel the pressure random all right ready to play another one let's do it all right here we go we're live where in the world jeff middle of the united states i don't think there's any water there jeff colorado maybe oh maybe [Laughter] we've got oh everyone's so far away what's we're all over the place here what's going on oh someone's in idaho lots of california san francisco is that the yeah could that be the golden gate bridge it looks like a golden gate bridge is it oh but i don't know some people are all right and i was very far off but now later on all right good job right on the mark all right yeah so that that's our demo and we'll pull up our little acknowledgement slide here we jammed a lot together into this little app here but uh we can run through this asura was very instrumental in that we were making use of graphql subscriptions and it made it really easy to set those up like the websocket endpoint that they automatically generated for us and i made that really easy netlify we obviously deployed on netlife and then also used a lot of netlife functions so that's uh when when we're when we're waiting to get the game started we have a little like on our github readme we set up a little admin panel that makes it easy to just start a game with different uh with different images that we have lined up uh curated to go and then on the bottom we have all the little pieces the little moving pieces that uh help make it happen so it's a it's a react app we're using apollo on the client side to do the graphql integration with asura heroku is hosting our asura instance then the google maps api provided the map and the some of the slack and github tooling we used for start development process essentially yeah great good demo how'd you all get together as a team and how did you choose what you were going to build well we all kind of met each other at the conference we were all at the conference and sort of we're mutually connected there and we formed our team yesterday morning at breakfast and threw out some ideas and we just chose one shortly after the keynote and went with it yeah we were we kind of the way we described what we honed in on is uh that we wanted to do two things we wanted to show the power show the show the power of the jam stack and also show people the world that was the kind of nice how uh what was kind of the develop i guess the like product development process like did you uh you know did you do any drawings did you kind of like do any i don't know case uh user study kind of thing or anything like that or did you just dive right into write code we did some uh like data modeling we had i brought in a little mini white board with this guy uh so we did some data modeling so that way we could have like some sample data in our database um and it was really good for just kind of driving a discussion of like oh like we didn't think about this concept the same way so then we were able to kind of bridge those gaps before we started writing a single line of code or thinking of a single mock yeah and then we split up like someone working on the data setting up the database and then working on the front end we decided to do a pair programming because we didn't want to like too much confusion and we could just put two minds in onto one computer and that worked really well i think that was yeah yeah because especially like there were moments where like oh like somebody was really honed in on something needed to get something done maybe we were you know a few like an hour before or some deadline and then but because we programmed most of it we were always able to rely on some other person who knew each piece of the like all these different pieces that were working together so we could always have like kind of like a fallback plan in case like the person who had actually been doing the driving wasn't available at the moment yeah what features um are you know just outside of scope that you would add if you had more time the two big ones that we had had in mind were the ability for users to kind of like facilitate these games in the sense that like uploading the photos um you know we think we one of our inspirations was trivia hq so we like the concept of having one game going on but it'd be nice if kind of with our show the world kind of mission uh if users could like say like i you know i really i think this place is really cool and i want more people to know about it let me submit a photo of that place and let's play a game about it and then the other one is kind of have like a different uh potentially like different localizations for the games so like everyone can play a world game but if we were to like say let's play like a san francisco kind of game then there would be like the like level of granularity at which the photos would come in and that people could play would be only relevant to people who like really know the area so then just kind of like different levels of localization would be interesting as well yeah yeah that's i could see this being really popular my parents love that trivia hq game and they always play together and i could definitely see this being like a community thing like san francisco has so many distinctive landmarks and even little benches that people might be able to recognize you know yeah for sure we thought long term maybe we could introduce training of machine learning on some of these images um maybe do like a what in the world app where you could look at certain things and see what those things are but yeah that's kind of a far goal yeah all right well thank you so much for coming in and giving this awesome demo thanks for coming out yeah i'm building this it's you've used a lot of different tools yeah i'm just uh i think it's always awesome when something is is scoped just right so you can actually like really end up with it with a working demo and a live domain and launch something to the world in the weekend yeah i think to be honest like with all the tools it makes that easier like i'm surprised that in two days we could do this but i think like all of these tools number five sort of react i mean it's like yeah pretty cool i think i would have spent a half a hackathon just putting up a website when i was a full stack web developer and now i was like not the fight buy domain deploy oh we're live on our new domain yeah it was amazing it's a brave new world yeah cool thank you thanks yeah yeah yeah pleasure gentlemen i'll see you downstairs all right sounds good thank you yeah all right well we've had very indepth talks with seven different teams and uh we are going to discuss among ourselves uh the judging team i just want to give a final shout out netlify for everything they're doing for providing the fundamental technology that this entire hackathon has run on uh thank you so much matt for your sponsorship and for being on the judging panel thanks thank you chris and everything you all are doing over at fauna we're very excited about it we're interested in exploring it ourselves and free cooking thank you so much cole you're an incredible interviewee we're going to post that interview with coal later thanks to forms for you for sponsoring and uh everybody who's watching have a beautiful evening and keep jamming
