hey everybody its Jesse and today I'm sick so I apologize if I'm a little bit harder to hear today or a little out of it but I don't have time to be sick because we got to launch this site so the site's going to launch tomorrow we need to do some testing I'm going to test using browser stack and also with the device so I have the pixel XL and I'm just I have it connected directly to my iMac and we're going to use dev tools and test on the device I did want to show you how to test simulate an iPhone with Xcode but I tried to start it two minutes ago and it wanted me to download extra stuff for it to work that's not going to happen so sorry about that ideally for it it's better if you actually have a fun and iPhone to test it on if you can get a hold of one I found the simulator isn't always accurate you get the Xcode simulator so some other people that I work with have fun so I'm just going to borrow one of their funds later on and test because based on the analytics for some of our other sites a lot of users are going to be on an iPhone so the browsers that we need to worry about most based on the analytics are chrome which we should be fine in chrome we've been developing it in from the whole way so I'm not as worried about that and Safari specifically Mobile Safari which I always have problems with on my list of least favorite browsers Mobile Safari might be worse than edited Explorer for me so I mean at least worse than Internet Explorer 11 we will try out internet explorer 11 I don't think I'm going to bother with edge because our analytics show it's such a small percentage of our users are using edge it's probably not a good use of our time at this point if I had more time I'd maybe give it a try so let's get started with some testing oh hey everybody I just looked at the live chat some people saying hello I've a question for it for all of you if I'm having an issue with one of my other site so I'm going to throw this out there and y'all can think about it and comment or direct message me or something if you have a good answer I'm using I have an app where users have to log in I'm using auth0 for authentication it's one of the magic link logins so they get an email with a link when they click the link they're logged in and it saves everything in the browser's local storage and they're supposed to stay logged in unless they actually log themselves out with the log out button so I'm having two problems one users keep getting logged out and they're saying that they haven't tried to log out they can't remember what they can't remember ever like running some type of program that would have logged them out like cleared out all their local storage so basically they're getting logged out for no apparent reason and I haven't been able to recreate the issue I've tried probably dozens of times have gone to the you know different computers that the actual computers where it's happening for the users and I can't get it to happen again and then the other issue is when they try to log back in and have that that magic link sent to them again they're not seeing the emails I'm using SendGrid for emails and the SendGrid analytics it says that the emails are actually delivered but they're not they're not showing up in their inbox or in the junk mail folders for these people so just just one of anyone using either SendGrid or r0 or both of them together if you've had any issues like that especially issues with local storage being cleared out randomly from the browser or with emails some some people just not getting emails on the same system I'm on the same email system and I tested it earlier I got the email within a minute so I don't the issues so sorry for the little sidebar there let's get back to the testing so basically the first thing I want to do is show you how to set up the a mobile device for testing so there's not a lot you have to do actually on the phone so I'm not going to show you the phone part of it but you can look it up it's usually it's pretty easy you'd have to go into your settings under your advanced settings and there's like a developer mode I think you have to click on the version number in settings like seven times it's really weird I'm this is for Android by the way so I you can hook up an iPhone and do debugging as well but it's a different since I don't have an iPhone right now I'm not going to go over that maybe we'll do it in a different video so basically you have to enable developer options and you do that by I can't remember exactly what you clicked I've already done it but I think it's like the Android version number when you go into settings and about and you have to click it I think seven times and then will ask you do want to enable developer options yes and then you have this extra thing in your menu this extra item so you can go into there and enable USB debugging so that's what you want you want to be able to enable USB debugging so if you haven't Android you want to do this Google enable USB debugging on and and it will let you know exactly what the steps are since I camera I'm almost positive that the way I described it is how it went but it's been so long since I've done it I can't be sure so you probably want to doublecheck I don't have a link right now so sorry if I if I have time and I remember which I probably want I'll throw the link in the description normally I would throw the link in but I'm just really pressed for time to get this site launched so now I'm going to show you how to link up your device so if you open up dev tools okay which you can just click on inspect anywhere and that will open up dev tools for you let me how's the font on dev tools do I need to make it bigger let me know alright somebody in a live chat said it's not the Android version number it's the compilation number or something like that I think you're right I can't remember it was some some number in there I know that's not great information but I'm you'll be able to find it the information is really easy to find if you want like a step by step if you go to Udacity they actually show you this in in one of their courses they have like a link to a video it's their course on my like mobile is a responsive images something like that sorry that's not good advice I think so let me make this bigger and move this up here so you can see what's going on okay so we have some of the live chat saying we do need it bigger okay that's probably as big as I can make it without blocking out stuff that we need to see so all I've done is I've connected my my phone to the computer so I have for this phone it's one of the USBC so I have a connector that's just a regular USB on one end and then a new USBC on the other end going into my phone so that's plugged in I've enabled USB debugging on my phone now I just open dev tools and I go I click on this it probably will be clicked on by default discover USB devices when I do that then it brings up this pixel so I can see it over here and I'll actually if you click it it will show you open windows that you have I've done one other steps since we're developing this locally if you're not testing a site locally if you're testing a site that's available you know online from a normal URL you can skip this step but since we have a local server running we want to match up the ports so I just used localhost 8080 this first number is for my phone the second one is what port we're running it on so I'm actually running this local server on port 3000 so I just I added a rule when I entered these two numbers in now when I go on my phone to localhost 8080 I can actually see the development side I know you guys can't see it I was trying to I have a program there let me share my phone screen but for some reason it wasn't working I kind of think that because I'm using the ports it's like one of the ports that that was also using and so I messed it up but I didn't really have time to troubleshoot so now that you're linked up you can go I can go into my pixel and see I have been saying the port forwarding is working and I want to inspect let's enter URL so you can I can enter this localhost 8080 and click open and this should work okay I guess not there we go it just took a second but see it on my phone it just opened it and now I can see that tab here that localhost8080 and now I can it inspect okay and now my inspector it's taking a second to load but now this section once it loads this section will actually correspond to what's on my phone so the cool thing is now if I go over and change some Styles here it'll show up on my phone in real time so I can test it out it's a little bit nicer than just kind of shrinking your window because you get to you'll really see like how if you have let's say some type of scroll tracking or click function or something you can see how it is with the touch I know you can simulate some of this with dev tools but if you have a device you don't have to have every device if you just get one device and try things out on it it's really worthwhile so in general I just you know click around and see see what's working what's not working so there's definitely some delay so just a headsup on that every time I go to click on a link it doesn't refresh right away there's this a delay so alright so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that I just wanted to show you how to set that up because I didn't get the screen sharing working so it'd be really boring for you all to have me describe to you what I'm saying on my mobile the next way I'm going to test is with browser stacks I have this somewhere where did I put it okay here it is okay so we have thanks for the ports it sorry I'm just checking the live chat for a second make sure okay it looks like there's we don't have any questions or anything everybody's still following alright so I'm going to go in here in a browser stack now I can I normally just use Xcode since I'm on a Mac and I test directly on my Mac instead of going in to a browser stack but since I have have to install updates before that'll work let's go in we'll just try this iPhone 6's I don't have a lot of like really good analytics data on the actual type of iPhone devices exercise I don't know my screen is maybe 27 I sorry I just lost my train of thought if you're just joining in you missed at the beginning I apologize in advance I'm really not feeling well so the the streams going to be a little bit a little bit off I'm just not going to be as as on top of things as I normally would be so you have to wait this is browser stack is it's pretty good hey this is it actually saved the last site I looked at on here probably not me this is a somebody we share an account me and another developer so that's probably it's like he was testing so basically I I have a phone here I don't know if I can make this bigger so I'm sorry if this is small it looks small for me so I'll just give you kind of an idea of how to do this now some things on browserstack allow you to do port forwarding last time I use this which is within the last few months you could not do it with the iPhones so I'm not going to try to do it right now you can do it I think with Windows based things windowsbased browsers so you might want to check that out that would also be cool so in this case I'm just going to go to our test you are out and it's it's pretty much up to date there's a couple of things I did that I didn't push to the to the server yet but for the most part test code catechins calm let's see okay it's not it's not working let me go back here and see if it's working on on my brother okay wow it is working let me refresh one more son good thing we're testing let's try to go to maybe one of the interior pages see if we have a better look No all right now we can't open dev tools here so let's open dev tools and see what we're getting can't find variable and it's unexpected NFR this card hmm all right let's see where this is that it's possible it's not showing me hmm let's see I want to go and shovel it looks like it's not even loading I want to check to make sure okay it is loading our our app all right dodge it is okay okay it's linked two of them all right so what did it say 121 this this card team card clickhandler okay yeah the lab says somebody asks is browserstack free there is a free trial it doesn't let you do a lot though so yeah this is not a free tool yeah you can use Xcode to simulate an iPhone on your computer for free if you have a Mac so I would normally I like to use that better than trying to simulate iPhones and browserstack and then if you have a device the actual physical device of course you can test with that but I think probably what's happening with the iPhone and I'll need to I'm going to test this with an actual device just so it's a little bit faster for me after I update Xcode probably what's happening and I don't know why this just slipped my mind before is I'm using a lot of things from es6 I don't know what the coverage is on mobile safari for es6 it's possible that that's messing some of this this up I don't know we'll see yeah because the first the first time I use something that's es6 is at line 21 and I'm using let instead of their and that's the first error we got so I'm guessing Mobile Safari does not support let so I'll have to use Babel and transpile that into es5 code and then try again on an iPhone but what we can do is try to go I don't think I have a page that isn't using some type of es6 we can transpile real quick and do it I mean we have that might be worthwhile worthwhile to do so if you've never used es6 or babel before let's try it out okay so you need to let's see let me grab all of my app touches so basically this JavaScript that you're writing in your components you're fine with it's going to be automatically transpired but since we imported this a tas file from our previous static site then we just brought it in and have it in the static folder i next doesn't automatically transpile that for you that's something I'd have to set up probably as an NPM script in the package.json file so I have not set that up yet I've set it up in a previous project at some point I'm probably just going to copy that code into there but I haven't done it yet so what we can do now is just kind of manually transpile this just so that we can do some testing so I just copy this in on this side and you can see using let me make this bigger I'll make this whole thing bigger okay so on this side we have some es6 stuffs we have let what else we have I'm probably using cost in some places too I'm using template literal syntax so we go over to this side we can see that let has been changed into two there and I'm not going to look for the template literal syntax but if you basically what it would do is just use regular quotation marks and you know your plus signs mix in with your variables so your file is going to be a little bit bigger after you do this but older browsers will be able to use it so I'm just going to copy this for now and let's see what the best way to do this I I'm just going to I'm just going to go and paste this all in and overwrite this file for now because we have this this saves the lemming let me just throw this in another file just to say that okay just in case we need to go back okay so let's save and we're going to go over I'm going to put this on the server really quick it should take probably two minutes I'll let you guys see this I showed everybody yesterday but just in case you don't know how I'm putting things on the server right now this is the tooth let's make this a bit bigger okay so this is my local machine I'm just going to do a git commit so we're just going to transpile we're going to push that to github and then let's go back here I've just used SSH to go into the server on digital ocean and now I'm in to see them it looks different a username Jessie now we're going to go into our folder and we're going to stop stop our our app for just a minute we'll do a get pool and we'll do we'll do a build as soon as this builds over we'll just start up our server again and then we're good to go with our testing we go right back in now we shouldn't get the errors from the ESX stuff so so I didn't think of that beforehand just working on a lot of other stuff today and I did not think about it okay so Patrick and a live chat says can I use as mobile safari should support let since late last year okay well I'm not sure what the problem was then I mean we're definitely getting an error on the the line that I first used let with so I'm not actually I don't remember what version of Safari I was testing with browser stack it's possible that I was testing an older version we'll go back in and see what the version is all right so now our build is ready let me start everything up and we should be good to go so let's go back over here and let's try oops let's try to go back all right and it works so I'm not sure what what the problem was for sure I think it was let and this is probably just an older version of Safari but now at least we can scroll down let me see if I can make this bigger hmm all right since device is already to actual size so I guess it's not okay so this is browsers iOS 9 so this is Safari in an iOS version 9 what's the newest one is it is 10 okay so nice you gather you already uncovered in the live chat support for 4 let which is an es6 thing starts in version 10.2 ok and somebody mentions something about the auth0 stuff I don't want to interrupt right now so towards the end I'm going to come back to that thanks for for mentioning that I'll just say for now I'm not using an iframe to log out on the log out is basically I just clear local storage when they click the button but people are saying that they're not clicking the button and the local storage is still being cleared when I go to check their their browsers there's nothing in local storage but I can't get it to clear on you know just on its own again I can't recreate the problem ok so I'm going to scroll down a little bit I realize this is super small yeah and I don't I don't know how to to make this bigger except to I can zoom into the site itself let's see if I can zoom in here all right okay so the uh you know just the zoom from the touchpad on an eye and I like the iMac magic touch pad works okay so we got a little bigger here so I'm just going to scroll you don't get like the real feeling of scrolling I'm you know I'm using my touchpad to scroll but we can do some some clicking around okay so that works yeah it's a little bit weird to try to get the touch the touch stuff down I keep like accidentally clicking where I don't want to click or like double clicking when I don't want to see you Keith maybe it's maybe it's because I zoomed in let me zoom out again and see if I if it's better that's it yeah I can't win if we zoom in the the clicking doesn't work so I love it I'm going to scroll just quickly see if I can find something that looks weird and then if I do I'll scroll in on that I want to try out the side knife and the links so we'll try out this link okay that worked that was cool that was actually really fast okay I'm going to take I'm actually going to take the images out on mobile and just have the title up here because they won't look as good on mobile anyway and I don't I don't want to kill people's data plans by having them load images when they're not necessary all right so this these sections are actually going to change so I'm not that worried about it now I'm just I have some different content I need to put in okay so these cards look good on mobile everything works these are still need to edit these images to make them all square and the same so right now I'm looking for items that I I don't already know about the neat change alright so I am interested in this Oh so that does work if let me zoom in here and show you what's going on with this so this gave me some problems this morning some people have super long titles and they won't fit on the card so if they were rapping below and adding another line or sometimes two lines and then of course the text was spilling out of the bottom of this card so that the solution would have been okay well let's just make the card bigger but the problem is I don't have great quality images to work with so some of the images I have are already less than 100 pixels by 100 pixels and so that's what I have here these are 100 by hundred pixels so I wanted to keep this and keep this 100 pixels in height so I settled on this which I don't really like this solution but I just don't have time to mess with it more right now so I decided actually on a horizontal scroll so you can scroll over and see the rest of the title so on larger screens this isn't an issue if you think of another solution somebody said truncate in the live chat yeah I could possibly truncate it and then when you click it let me show what happens when you click when you click it it comes up with a modal and gives you a lot more information on the person so I could possibly truncate and then have the full title in the modal I've thought about that I'll have to I don't know if I'll have time to do that before we launch but I'm going to put that on my list I have a Trello board that's keeping track of everything since I'm zoomed in it's not letting me click out there we go so yeah that probably is going to be the best thing just truncate this limited to a certain number of characters and then have the full one be in the in the modal so I like that advise yeah actually that's that's what I did overflow wise scroll somebody mentioned change the font size I don't know the fonts already small I could probably make it smaller and get away with it at least on on mobile there's there's just a lot of overflow yeah I just I wish some of these titles weren't quite so long and it's not just one or two I mean they're like quite a few of these that have the super long titles so I am eventually going to change this for now this is probably how it's going to look for launch since we're launching tomorrow let me check to make sure this works oops maybe it's not working let's see am I getting an error okay when I click this it should open and it's not opening on this phone let me refresh really quick Wow oh that's not refresh that's wish it looked like the refresh button but it's really not okay so let me there we go let me find I've DS the refresh button on the device just to see what's going on okay that did work let's go back I've put in like clientside routing now I'm going to go back into teams to see if it works so the thing with clientside running if you watch yesterday we went over problems that you might have with jQuery ok and I think this is an issue so normally like I would initialize this this click Handler to open these and the document.ready function for jQuery but it's not going to fire like if we're just doing clientside routing and there's no page refresh that function is never going to fire again so the first time it fires it'll be honest different page it won't actually see those sections so it won't have anything to grab onto to to watch so what we have to do is instead use like component component did mount and then call it in there so we pull it out of the document already we put in a separate function that's available globally and then we call it from within our component when it mounts so for some reason either I forgot to do that for this or I didn't it's not working so I need to add that to the list so I'll show you how I keep track of all these things so go over here I have my Trello board so I'll just put it over here and say um fix uh section and look for routines or teams with clientside routing and I'm going to estimate that's going to take one Pomodoro cycle that's what this one is one 25minute cycle okay somebody else Humberto in the live chat says they like the overflow ellipsis option yeah I think that'll look that'll look ok we'll probably end up going with that at some point and all right so now that that bug is it's tracked I'll get to it let's let's move on I'm actually doing a similar thing in another page so I really want to see if it's working on the other page and did I do it differently on two different pages so we're going to go over to courses and let's see if it works here all right it doesn't so I'm having the same issue on both these pages so let's just go back and add four teams and sort and courses look good all right so good thing this is a small site we're already halfway through it let's check out the events page see what's going on here and not a lot we have that's not bad maybe you could use some padding changes but it it doesn't look too bad that's excellent or to read on that background doesn't it this let me zoom in maybe it's just the zoom so I will try to zoom that was that what's broken I been here for like the frame of the word in YouTube okay oh the YouTube has the YouTube embed messed this up see if we can well it looks like a frozen my my test here so maybe if I can't get this to work again we'll switch and test something else and then come back to this one hmm okay so that's frozen so let's let's switch over now just for a minute and I'll show you what let's check out we'll do Windows 10 and let's check out Internet Explorer 11 hopefully I won't have to worry about supporting this for very much longer but you can see I always have issues with in an explorer 11 and mobile safari a lot of the issues I know about beforehand so I can I can edit my my code to make sure that I fix them but you can see like I was using flexbox to vertical line things see it's not working in an explorer 11 so you have to set up alternate styles for internet explorer 11 some padding or something as we scroll down at least this works and let's go go to the home page see how this is gone we have here okay so for some reason the images aren't loading off to check that out we can also we can inspect but the inspector is not is not great for this so you can't have to have a lot of patience to inspect things when you're working with older browsers it said it may take a few minutes to start I don't think I want to wait a few minutes let's just this is good a team now we're also using oh man look at that Wow so that scrollbar shows up because even though we're not actually there's no overflow that scrollbar so show them that's no good all right I'm gonna have to figure out if there's a way to hide the scrollbar and in and explore 11 and I don't want to spend too much time I'm going to give myself one Pomodoro session so one 25 minute period because I if I can't find answer quickly I'll probably it'll be a waste of time I don't have all that time right now so I kind of think that you can't hide these but we'll see maybe maybe there's a way I know you could do more with scroll bars and like earlier versions of Internet Explorer I remember making like neon green colored scroll bars made like 15 years ago or so I think but I haven't done that for a while and I don't know if you can still do it let's go to the news page and I just want to see if ok so that's that routing that parameterised routing that we had set up it's definitely working and that's good check our resources ok let's see I want to see if these tabs will all the scrolls like not great on this okay so to see now this isn't working so our our tabs are not working so let's put this oops so as expected Internet Explorer 11 is giving us some some issues it doesn't matter what you do it's your site's never going to look as good and Explorer 11 as it will in more in modern browsers I mean unless your site's really simple it might look exactly the same but you just can't take advantage of all the same things that you normally would would be able to in a modern browser so we're not going to try to make this site exactly the same the percentage of our users that are on Internet Explorer 11 is really small if the issues were like a really a big deal like major functionality and menu is use then you can just put a message I hate to do this sometimes you have to you can just pop a message up that detects the browser and says you know hey if you're using Internet Explorer you're not going to have a great experience and then provide a link to download you know some newer browsers you don't even have to write that code yourself there's already some plugins that will just do it for you so I'm going to check the live chat real quick because I just wanted to show you how I'm doing my testing I think it's probably a little bit boring to watch me go through here and just find the errors and log them I'm not actually fixing anything right now so I don't want to spend a ton of time on it I'm going to check the live chat quickly and then I have a video another video from syntax con with some advice for new programmers and this this video is from Kim Creighton shoes and excellent speakers she was one of like the keynote speakers at the conference and she's actually not a coder but she speaks at a ton of coding conferences and it was great if you ever have a chance to see her speak or watch one her videos I recommend it it's like she is nice like perspective on like mentoring and company culture so it's really really kind of cool stuff you don't usually hear at tech conferences okay let me check okay so I was getting some people talking about the question I asked at the beginning about auth0 and in the emails and stuff somebody says could there be a problem with SMTP it's possible okay so I did mention how to do the Android testing and someone a live chat said it's the tutorial on how to do that isn't the responsive design for images course on Udacity that's a free course I did go through that course I recommend it I learned a lot of stuff and a lot of the things in there are still very relevant even though the courses on a probably a couple years old at this point I can't remember when it came out officially but the things that I learned in that course are still still relevant someone mentioned that they don't devote for edge but it can be surprisingly compatible yeah I had a lot of hope for edge but it's just not a lot of people aren't using it based on my analytics for my sites it's there a small percentage of people so that's why I don't usually test things on edge it's just not worth the time you know for like 1% of the users okay okay someone mentioned materialized does have the truncate class that's right I forgot about that so there is a truncate class the only I'll have to see how they do it on with materialized I know there was actually some like CSS truncation that can go on but I don't know what the browser support is but that's a good that's a good point I'm definitely going to going to check that out if someone said that a slow connection they couldn't see the title bar sorry about that oh nice okay John Hanson thank you very much he threw in some of the CSS to be able to hide the scroll bar so that definitely saves you some time and I need some time savers here so I really appreciate that Patrick asked since you're estimating pomodoro cycles to use a Pomodoro clock while you work I do so I use a Pomodoro clock oh let me show you the one I use I use just a super simple webbased one since this tomato timer so it's really barebones I can do formula recession of 25 minutes your short break of five minutes or long break of 10 I usually go five minutes between cycles every four cycles I do 10minute break and I just use this I like it you know runs right in the browser so it's easy I tried out some apps before that have more features but usually I don't use any of the other features so it just kind of clutters things so using this right now at some point I'd like to actually build my own and customize it to exactly what I need but I don't have time for that right now maybe one day okay Paul asks how is he sliding the full screen then right I'm on a Mac so yes so if you're using the touchpad for your Mac on a laptop or on a desktop and you use three fingers and swipe it then that'll that will change it so this is just a threefinger swipe so it's super helpful there is a way to make that work on Windows it's you have to download a program and set it up but I'm pretty sure you can get a similar thing on Windows I mean I don't know what you obviously wouldn't probably would be using a touchpad on Windows desktop but there would be probably some type of key I think there's a key combination like control some there's some like key combo that can do this on a Mac as well if you don't want to use the the swipes okay so get through the live chat if you have anything else to ask go ahead I'll check it one more time after I play this video but let me get with the video going this one's a little bit longer Kim had a lot of good advice so this will be a few minutes most of the other videos have been like a minute or less so let me bring in I'll bring this in and let's make it fullscreen and let me let me play this uh hopefully the audio is is works there's at one point at the end of this I think there's some background noise so I hope you'll be able to hear this and once again this is this is Kim Creighton from syntax con hello everyone I'm Tim Creighton and you can find my Twitter it Khem creative board in this ki elements are elección in one I am here at six hack conference and one of the things that I'm supposed to say what's knowledge now exciting first first of all Benton right I'm a community engineer which means I help community efforts I help people in the technology space embrace change the convoy elusive and diversity diverse when it comes to people there is backgrounds become a welcomed use like a lot of writing podcasting or blogging and speaking all those things are community efforts so that's where I excel um I also one aim a website and select channel you find it on Twitter edge J bar de vie mentoring and that's a judoka Turing website so please join there a lot of mentors on select I'll be looking for people to help out and so the what knowledge we had really interesting I'm really interested in eight and you are just really find it very exciting a friend they I went to their house and they had set it up in their house and I spent two hours plan is free of your system and by the time I was done I was four ounce with but I've had so much fun so I'm really interested in seeing how that technology is that advanced where it will be less about the gear and more accessible to other people how are you using it in just in everyday life it will be very interesting to how they I and a mini reality I mean a are augmented reality and virtual reality are going to be used in just everyday lives and so the one thing I would tell newbies one of the pieces of Isis that's become is all time is about mentoring so everybody to become creative reading it's virtually impossible for most people who come to you they're very live without on the mentor just for the simple fact that this is like the Wild West there is no there is no defined path winners if you want to be a doctor there's a divine path if you want to be a dentist there's a defined path if you want to be educated in SIA pet if you want to be a developer you go taxi garbage gets to me and wake up today dislike one of your developer and can learn everything you need to learn to be a developer so there's no more fun iPad and without somebody more similar to help guy what you're doing you often find yourself and you've down this rabbit holes or feeling really discouraged and so mentors really help but I'll give you some advice on how to get an intern mentoring it's all the mouth relationships so if one image don't go to some lesson hey I need a mentor this is what I want to learn that's not how that works oh you want somebody who's going to invest in you and your success and that only happens in the care that they care about you know where they're going to care about you is if they have a relationship with you so five ways to volunteer in your community a lot of ways to ask my ways to ask how can I help for you ask them to help you and what happens is you'll find that they'll go to you they'll see this or asking you hey what are you working on how can I help and then it becomes like them you're advocating that's what you want they want your first job to come from your network you don't want to get your first job because it was posted on the website you want to be there so badly about you before they of a full set job you want to be the candidate before their jobs even post it so the best way to do that is to build your relationships and get you over time thank you all right so hopefully that was helpful to some of you I know I am I think a mentor would be really helpful I didn't really have I kind of had a mentor uh but it was more in like in general like digital marketing so search engine optimization and SUV by copywriting and things so I never really had like a programmer mentor and even now I you know I already have a fulltime job doing this I can still see the value and having a mentor and I've been able to be somewhat of a mentor to to some some of the students here who are interested in programming and it's it's awesome I mean you know I can see whenever I help people out make it they get through things a lot faster than I get through things because I can point them to a resource that I know is good I know the problems that they'll probably run into before they do so whereas it would take me a long time and I would work through some resources that weren't very helpful before I found the right ones you know if if you're mentoring someone you can help them get through that faster or if you're seeking out a mentor they can help you get through that faster so you just don't waste your time going down deadend paths people that have been doing this for longer have a much better idea of of the big picture and I can can direct you to where you need to go and what you need to learn so good advice from from Kim and I don't see all right we don't have any other questions in the live chat so I'm going to get to work tomorrow we're going to launch this site so the video that might already be launched by the time I do the video tomorrow I'm hoping it is maybe I'll have to just stay up late tonight and tomorrow and get it launched tomorrow night but hopefully it'll be ready enough to launch thanks for all your help I know you all put in some some really good advice too you know I asked a lot of questions of you this time around and I really really appreciate that hopefully when I do these live streams we can learn from each other and your projects will get better and so will mine thanks so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow
