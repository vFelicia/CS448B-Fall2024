hello everyone so super nervous super excited though to present on recording presentations using obs and youtube it's a cool way to put yourself on youtube it's cool way to educate others and uh kind of gonna do that now to show everyone from start to finish to install to youtube how to do obs and uh take that recording and put it on youtube i'm getting ahead of myself that's for later go ahead and exit out of that so i have instructions actually on how to get started i want to go over some system requirements for obs this is obs setup and settings and so obs is available on windows mac and linux it's amazing it's on all three it works well in all three it does require directx 10 compatible integrated graphics and so it's a it's a more modern cpu type thing and so like that basically is like intel i5 2000 series or higher it uses open gpl on linux and so i had an old laptop i actually couldn't use because uh it was a core 2 duo laptop and it's just too old and so it's almost kind of it's not really a i use it for open source development so i'll still use it but uh this laptop does obs quite well new like a little joe system recommendations it's hard to find hard specific requirements for obs online but basically news better than old kind of a given gaming or business laptop is generally better because of the heatsinks than ultrabook and so this is an ultrabook so if i were to play you know battlefield 1 and do obs at the same time this one's going to be screaming just it's like as it tries to cool it down which is really kind of distracting for the microphone so if you have a gaming laptop or business laptops better but for what i'm doing it's going to be fine because i'm just doing a presentation and so mo ram mo better and so i got a little picture of a ram there if you can see it it is optimized for windows and so if you're on windows you're in luck there's a lot of streamers online a lot of people recording content online that are on windows and you get quite a bit less cpu usage on windows and linux is getting better every day and it's developed for all of them so presetup you want to change your resolution in 1920x1080 or 1280x720 basically the hd resolutions and the reason i say that i'm currently on 720. this is a 4k monitor on this laptop and for obs to have to scale from 4 4k to 1080 or 720 on the fly is a little bit too intensive for it and so um the the cpu unless you're on a gaming laptop or a business laptop that has a you know like a good heat sink then um it's it's going to struggle a little bit so i like 720 because if you're doing a presentation if you're if you're showing windows like i'm going to be showing you they're going to be easier to see so the first thing we need to do is download obs we're going to do this live guys uh done done done click on windows um and so here's this is a 64bit installer which is what you want to do most of the time here's 32bit we're going to do the 64. it's going to download it oh that's not too bad but i'm going to cancel on my cheat i already have obs downloaded should right there yes all right so a missing component so what those components are talking about real quick is it once you have the visual studio c c plus plus library included and so if you don't already have that installed i uninstalled it before the presentation then it will trigger that message um so let's go ahead and install them so that should be pretty quick oh did that work oh yeah so i need to click here there we go that's a lot faster it's much smaller open that bad boy up if you've already been using obs this might sound a little bit uh too involved but i do want to have basically a presentation that covers the whole aspect of it so set up successful all right and so i'm to i think i'm going to run the exe again there we go i agree we're going to install it to program files obs studio um browser source that's a good one to have all right let's just go and install it so basically it's next next next all right we're going to launch obs studio okay and we're in oh i kept all my settings okay hold on give me one second and i'm going to actually go to projects joe uh app data roaming i'm gonna actually start completely fresh here for the benefit of learning it's gonna take one second so quit out of obs uh delete my this isn't joe app data roaming uh my name is joe by the way i think we covered that all right and so open up obs studio again all right now we're starting fresh and so here's a license agreement saying it has the gnu general public license which is a very good thing i'll go over that a little later that means it's open source anyone can uh contribute to it all right and then it pops up would you like to run the auto configuration wizard yes i would um it's kind of a sanity check hit yes and so it says optimize for streaming recording and secondary that's a if you are going to be streaming that's a good way to do that if you do do this option see if i go next next again yeah it's going to want you to enter your stream key you can change your streaming service here we're not going to go into that we're just going to do optimize for recording i will not be streaming you can always run the wizard again all right and so the base canvas resolution if i was on 1080p i'd want to select 1080p from here since i am on 720p then i want to use 720 as my canvas the canvas is basically where you're going to put all of your webcam and twitter information for example so frames per second i go with 30. 30 is plenty for a demonstration 30 is plenty for twitch if you want to stream to twitch 60 is kind of a little extreme it requires a lot more processing also requires a lot more bandwidth if you're streaming i do 30. hit next apply settings and we're almost good to go so we did we installed visual studio um basically obs redirected us to their site we downloaded the file we installed it we restarted the installation that worked all right one thing i do want to point out is uh so once you start working with obs you may notice things are not working correctly this is a quick uh this is a quick kind of like gotcha if you have nvidia graphics on your card you might need to check your settings and we're going to go through that real quick so i'm going to hit the windows key do control panel i'm going to go to hardware and sound and then nvidia control panel and so once this pops up it's going to allow me to go over to program settings over here and it should automatically pull it up since i'm using it yep and so where the open broadcaster software is open and sometimes it's set to a high performance nvidia processor we want to make sure it's on integrated graphics and that's all you got to do it was already set to integrated graphics i'll go ahead and apply i don't know if that's going to mess anything up all right we're good and that'll make sure everything runs smoothly all right so let's see what's next we did the auto configuration wizard by the way to get back to that you just go to tools auto configuration wizard you can set up streaming later they do have auto configuration wizard and thankfully they do because obs settings can get intense very intense all right so we set the canvas we set 30 frames per second we need to set the record path i do recommend that to do that you go to file settings and we go down to uh outputs and then we do recording path and it's set to joe or c users joe videos that's a good spot so i'm going to leave it but it's good to do that just make sure the videos are going to where you expect hello hello just getting started we basically installed obs at this point and uh doing very basic settings all right and so let's add a background i add a background just so you have a good contrast and so here we have a scene the default scene name is scene and we want to start adding sources so i need to resize this so we can see it better all right and so uh here are the sources we want to add a new source and that new source is going to be image let's go and name it oh let's go it's good to name things so we're going to name this background and that way the source has a name that makes sense i'm going to browse for background go to obs i have this cool little circuit board background i'm going to click ok and oh you can see that it's not scaled well and so the simple way to get that because this is a 1080p image or grader i think is you can actually just move it like that a little laborious but uh that's what i'm basically going to do right there and so that's the new background all right and so we want to add a webcam get into the juicy juice and so this is what the advantage of obs over over over other screen recording software you actually do the webcam it's going to do video capture device and we're going to call this internal webcam awesome there we go hello how'd it do add that in there that's huge i'm going to scale it down and do it the same way i did that pop it over here and bam uh this works in a pinch i don't recommend it i do recommend getting a dedicated webcam that's what this is here i don't know if i can show it here i might show it better but there you go i can do this all in so this is a uh so this is a logitech uh webcam i don't remember the model number but basically it's like a transformer you can like unfold it turn it around and it has like a little hook here it's kind of like the playstation camera if you've ever seen those and then it just basically hooks onto the monitor like that i'm going to cover the existing webcam because we're no longer going to use it what i really like about these is kind of all in one streaming booster and the main advantage for me is that it puts the microphone further away from the fan on the computer further away from the keyboard on the computer and it makes it makes for clearer audio the picture i think is a little bit better but it depends on your computer but if you have an older computer it definitely can help plug it in and so i've already plugged it in but windows would normally be like installing drivers and once that's done we're gonna remove this webcam and that and the webcam disappeared just because i put the other webcam on top of it so we're gonna do a video capture device again we're gonna call this a logitech webcam there we go bam it bam there i am adjust the camera a bit my handsome double all right click ok and this looks kind of boring honestly the square has been done square has been done and so i'm going to guess this is a 4x3 ratio and we're going to create our first mask guys obs is all about masks and so i think that's the next step create and add a mask so here's better use better to use a dedicated webcam i might let's let's make a mask and so i'm just going to jump right into it it's kind of hard to explain but masking is basically setting up an image to allow you to crop another image to almost any shape and so we're going to go straight to paint you better use photoshop krita anything like that over paint but i love paint you know goes back to the windows 95 or was it 98 i don't remember all right so let's go and resize it i'm going to do pixels i'm going to do 640 by 480 oh oh yeah maintain aspect ratio let's get out of there get out of there 640 or 480. all right and then i'm going to click back on maintain aspect ratio nope god i had to click ok live demonstration click ok i recommend going bigger and the reason so now set back to percent i'm going to go 200 percent make it bigger that's because the pixels are going to be sharper here in a second let me make it a lot smaller by going down to the zoom over here all right and so we're going to do something cute we're going to do a little uh played around with this i really like paint because you have these free shapes here say free everything should be free but so here we got this shape and i am going to set it to solid fill outline no outline we don't want to outline and then we're going to take uh the shape we're going to drag it it should be white yeah it's white and then i'm just going to go ahead and fill the screen with it okay and make sure it's centered i also want to make sure it's kind of a circle okay good enough definition of done right there to save as it's going to be a png spoil alert another mask up there all right so png and we're going to call it oh bubble mask obvious no what is that what is this thought bubble be more specific thought bubble i'm in the weeds let's get out of the weeds all right save okay and so uh got the logitech webcam here uh and we want to apply that mask and so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna right click on this i'm gonna go to filters and uh and add us at these resolutions you're fighting with obs a little bit on what the windows are doing so i'm going to move this down you'll see me do this a lot so that gives me access to edit filters i'm going to add a filter and we want to do image mask blend we're going to call this thought bubble just so we know what it is okay we're there all right we want to select the path of the mask browse i already have it set up it's in this obs folder right here that i set up click it and bada bing bada boom webcam is a thought bubble now all right so uh also it's pretty good right now i wanted to show you a little trick and this i think i did mark this down so you can uh crop and pad which is another filter you can apply to zoom the webcam image so when you do a webcam sometimes it'll appear far away especially on ones built into the computer so we're going to do that right now we're going to crop pad pretty easy i'm gonna call this zoom instead of crop pad so we know what it's doing all right and this is just simply adding numbers to all of them and so i'm gonna do 15 15 15 15. oh no we got some clipping up here that's not great so the more numbers you do the more it zooms so all we have to do is move zoom above this and then we have a perfectly zoomed uh webcam image oh it doesn't look like we need zoom we're gonna get rid of it close that all right and so i'm a big fan of uh making sure contrasts are great uh the contrast around the rim is not very good we're gonna make a border and we're gonna make a border using the same mask we just used uh so we're gonna add an image we're going to call this a webcam border and this is kind of a hacky way to do it but we'll do it real quick put the thought bubble back in there awesome click okay all right and then we need to apply some filters to this to make it just a solid white circle so uh filters oh yeah scroll down cache move it back up and then we're going to apply the color key filter so do this color key there we go um i could have named that better but anyways do a custom color i'm gonna do black alright now we just have a basically a white box in the same shape i'm going to change the color just a little bit wrong color forgot about that okay i want to change the color of it just a little bit because there's going to be a white presentation so it's just going to disappear so i'm going to do color correction i think i want to do that afterwards so i've moved it up select color gray all right and then is it brightness what's going on here oh yeah okay brightness yeah so it color correction needs to be below so we're making a little bit more gray i'm actually using saturation here i think it'll get it closer to the color it says anyways now all we're gonna do is not that not that at all so that'll happen a lot and how i get around that uh is i will lock it down you're locked down now you can't move all right and this is just kind of a cheeky way to do a border but it allows you to uh kind of someone put the webcam above it and and then i want to link these together so click this click this move this up move it there i'm going to lock these together by right clicking and then hit where is it at group selected items and now we have a webcam and a border hooray i think it makes it look more professional for sure all right moving on so the next step i know it's a little bit laborious guys but it does help add a little professionalism and it kind of shows you how to use masks and some other key elements we're going to create some twitter art let's add that we're going to do an image first we're going to call it twitter logo i got this logo off to twitter site you can download assets from them this is the round social media icon open that all right pretty big we're gonna make it smaller a lot smaller oh that big is good put it down here all right and then we're going to make a uh my twitter tag is at joe matthews okc we're going to do that now and this is this next step so we're gonna we're gonna add text we're gonna change the font size to be huge and that way we get sharper uh edges and then we'll scale it down and then we're gonna add a outline which is really only available in windows i try testing it and it might work in on mac but it doesn't work on linux yet you might need to add something to it to make it work to explain what's going on there i'm just going to call this at joe matthews okc i think i spelled that right i'm also going to copy that i'm about to type it again we've got text select font i'm just going to do 72 so it makes it sharper all right i think ariel's fine go fancy if you want and so uh don't need to change anything here i think the color is fine for right now the background color i think that's fine it's it's just clear and so what we want is oop alignment go back is it left okay outline we're going to click that and then we're going to change the color i need to kind of find the twitter logo so we're going to change the outline color and we're going to make it the same as the twitter logo so how i did that again is i select color on outline so outline all in color select color pick color and then i just uh do it again let's hover over the twitter kind of like right in the middle bada bing bada boom and then so here it is it doesn't look that great so let's increase the outline let's do let's do five nope let's do more let's go more 30 oh 30. well not let me do 30. rip off 20 is the highest 20 is enough though that looks good kind of looks like a red bubble sticker if you ever bought those i gave that analogy earlier crickets i like red bubble all right so we're going to resize this boom this will look a lot sharper on youtube it's scaling down the image and then i'm hitting control so it's wanted to snap this thing so it'll snap it a snap everywhere but i want it to be in the middle of the twitter logo so i'm going to hold ctrl and kind of just wing it and then i'm going to join these two together so how i do that is you can either do it here or on the screen itself hit control on both of them so like control click control click right click and then i already lost it can i not put these together group let's try it over here twitter logo group selected items okay i guess you have to do it rare now these are together now you can scale them they'll scale together uh it's your own personal logo you could make this in uh in in and photoshop and krita and have a transparent background have the same effect this is just kind of a way to do it in text and also to show you how text works anyways so i think we're about done we need to add one more source which is the big one which is the record the screen and so we don't need to hide the background it's going to be in memory anyway so we're just going to do plus and then we're going to do display capture i did want to point out one one other capture which is a good one windows capture let's go over that first we're not going to use it so windows capture i'm going to call it chrome only and this is a good way to kind of keep your privacy you know i like i think i closed everything before i came up here but if you're all tabbing and there's like messaging conversations up or whatever then they're gonna see it but this can be the window only that you're looking at so do chrome only and then that looks like a lot of gobbledygook so we need to find chrome eventually found it here and sometimes you'll see more than one dot exe look for the one that has the title you want oh no why is that not working oh i know why it's not working god i don't know why that's not working i'm going to have to troubleshoot that later oh let me check let me check the setting settings i don't think this will have anything to do with it oh okay so this sorry i'll show you where i went with the file settings i went to output and here you have an encoder setting so this is under recording an encoder this actually needs to be software it actually can be a hardware in e v e nc not a lot of gamers use that it's probably 10 20 faster on your computer but i got an error that i needed to update the drivers and so i'm just going to use software and i don't have an ok button so i'm going to scroll it down click apply click ok i don't know if that's why i'm not saying that so let me try getting a little nervous get rid of chrome only i'm going to just do straight to display capture but that's how you would capture just one window hopefully this works every window oh no it's the inception inception and so um this is kind of the most awful thing to see and you'll see it a lot in almost every almost every uh obs like if someone switches back to obs while they're streaming you'll see this it's kind of disorienting but it's just showing a mirror effect because it is recording within recording so uh we just click ok really annoying want to get out of here as soon as we can but what happened to all our stuff uh it's actually this floated the window to the top and so we need to on the sources list move this down so click the down arrow and stuff starts popping back up oh too far all right is that exciting guys so far so good all right so uh we'll get into the meat and potatoes a little bit and so the presentation itself is to go full on we're going to set up obs which we just just did we're going to record a presentation which is going to be pretty short and then we're going to upload that to youtube and i might do another talk later where i go advanced obs stuff as i learn more um but we do have some bonus things at the end to keep in mind um not gonna do the browser one but basically we're gonna do we are gonna add spotify so we're going to add album art to obs and i'll show you how to do that using masks getting back to the good stuff and so i'm going to start the recording and no errors which is good and so it shows stop recording now and so we're going to go back to chrome did not mean to close it all the way down i don't think go back to my slides here's the presentation you saw before it's a little bit tongueincheek this is kind of meant to be fast and the main content of what you're learning is supposed to be in the actual demonstration itself and so here we go recording presentations using obs and youtube and so what is obs obs stands for open broadcaster software it's created by hugh jim bailey and many contributors a lot of people have helped out on this the first release was in september 2012. there's presets for streaming to twitch youtube instagram facebook and others it's open source software so that means anyone can contribute to it anyone can make it better it's probably going to be free forever and it's uh licensed to gnu gpl v2 that's a general public license and that means that if anyone improves it they have to contribute the code back to the the main repository and make that code available or they don't have to contribute back they have to make it available so it's a really good thing it's community driven software and it is the number one software for streaming uh it's also very popular for recording screens because the ability to add webcams and control audio and just the amount of settings you can do you can control everything on it i was telling other people if you can see it on your computer you can put it on your stream so that alternatives to obs a little troll move here they probably have 99 market share and they don't charge a dime and so um i wouldn't recommend using anything else i'm not going to tell you to use anything else i'm not going to mention names that's because that's how much i love obs i showed you a little bit with masks you can do a lot with masks and you can do a lot with browser integration too that's how you get the magical pop pop up on the screens when you're watching twitch well we'll get to that but i will show you how to use mask to get spotify on there using uh noncopyrighted music of course right kimberly right all right and so the actual the like this is going on youtube uh but this is going on youtube after what we're actually recording right now so it's a little bit of recording inception um so my detailed obs setup presentation for obs oh man i've repeated obs yes it's embarrassing it's coming soon to youtube the presentation is actually created right now during that presentation from the future that's a little hard to explain but everything you're seeing me doing right now is going to be the second video in the series we're about to upload the first which is this presentation that i hit start recording on i created a logo for part two because like back to the future marty mcfly is visiting himself at the the dance it's pretty cool so what is youtube i know what youtube is everyone's saying why is youtube important you know but why record presentations why add content for me personally it's kind of a personal thing youtube has been very powerful for me i've learned excel i've learned programming learned a lot of things that you'd expect me to learn in my profession but also i learned how to stain concrete in my new house i learned how to repair a leaky bathtub i didn't think i could do that i learned how to paint a house the right way you actually have to clean it with soap that way the paint doesn't peel off it's on there like it's on there hardcore now and etc i've learned a lot of things i don't necessarily think i could do better videos than that what i can do is do programming videos i can do obs videos and this is kind of my first video to youtube promote yourself you know show what you've what you're good at what you've made um you know uh show your communication skills to your new employer um show uh show what you're worth to a little bit give back that's the kind of thing it's like i can i can do i can't do a lot of videos but i can do an obs video um and also learn better so this is kind of like the last minute ad here but it but it's important me me doing this like i would consider myself like you know like a midtier you know wizard as far as obs goes i think i could figure out a lot of things using masks and using web to get almost anything to work but just making this presentation i had to kind of reclarify some conceptions i had some misconceptions things didn't work as i expected them to so putting this all together i learned obs better and so putting a presentation together alone may help you learn it better and of course since this is being seen on youtube like comment and subscribe please all right that's the last slide from there i'm gonna go and click back off hit stop recording all right and so what's next so we recorded we click the the start recording button do the presentation click the stop recording button i wanted to add one more thing because i'm all about being transparent about hang ups here let's get rid of this inception thing going on here it's really trippy all right so if we go to settings and so if you try to do start present or start recording and you get an error the error might be caused by what i checked earlier so if you go to out output go to encoder uh you might try software encoder because the error might be about ndv what does that say nvenc all right so what's the next step all right let's upload it to youtube sounds reasonable all right let me close this out i'm going to go to youtube and i did a teaser video before i actually did a lot of teaser videos only one got chosen i'm going to my channel i'm very new to youtube and uploading videos so i just did youtube studio over here on the right there's probably people in here that are masters at youtube and let's talk let's connect and then uh dashboard no videos plus uploads oh man so before i just had a big fat upload new video if anyone wants to bail me out how do i upload a new video right here let's do it yes the icon was obvious all right and so i'm just gonna go nope i'm gonna do uh private that's because we need to trim it and so i set it to go to videos oh so many videos i'm going to sort by date real quick 237 it's about right open all right title oh so recording presentations with obs and i'll do a regular hand youtube part one all right here i give an introduction to youtube or to obs and youtube uh part two will give the details on how i created this presentation oh i think it's done oh processing 95. okay i'm gonna go ahead and click click done all right so return to youtube studio beta okay i want to go to click on one of my videos here we go click on this there we go editor so editor allow you to trim the beginning and the end of a video and we're going to do that to make this a little bit more professional here you can zoom to uh to get more of a timeline so you can fine tune it a little bit better so right oh we have to hit trim so it's hit trim right about here i think okay and then uh did it automatically trim it what happened here do i need to scroll oh let's zoom out okay okay there we go all right trim split cancel i would expect me to do a preview oh from there i'm gonna go click back off stop recording okay why is this not working anyone know any professionals oh because i didn't do any trimming oh okay i swear i did okay i think that's about good right there okay preview and we're going to listen to this i'm joking so what is does that really just happen what happened so what is so that's going to cook and that is basically how to do all of what i promised to do on that presentation and so with that you can uh record almost anything you could play a video in the background record yourself commentating on that a lot of stuff you can do um including uh gaming and so if you want to do gaming the only real difference is you plug in a twitch key into uh obs settings go through that uh go through that uh the the getting started it's not tutorial but a section at the twitch key um that's almost concludes my presentation i wanted to show you spotify i'll need to show you uh using browser stuff later so browser stuff is the real powerful stuff but uh one thing i ran into i was telling some as i walked into the uh walked into the presentation here i wanted to be a counterstrike star you know i wanted to kill nubs uh on the internets um and do it on twitch so i learned a lot of obs uh to to do good production value for that and one of the things i really wanted was to add a spotify like album art and song playing to the stream i'm sure there's ways to do that are very hacky using apis and stuff like that but i did find a way to use you know along the principles if you can see it you can add it and so i created a mask for spotify and so whoa not that mask so if i open up spotify here all right and uh one thing i did to try to find good music to play because if you play music just as a normal user they will mute your entire um broadcast that's recorded and and also i think you're held to a higher standard if you're educational source they might send you a message be like don't do that and so they're basically looking for copyrighted music i think it's very much a slap on a wrist now but it's always good to just not mess with it and so i type in twitch fm here and that brings up this profile i don't know if it's official or not but it does have i've seen this before the the no copyright sounds which is a group that puts out music for people uh and anyone can play it and so um most of the album art's the same which is unfortunate so you can find one that's different i don't think it's actually changing anyway so let's try starbound wait a minute i think they're all the same oh there's one yay okay and so i wanted to show you the changing of artwork so i wanted to basically get this out of spotify and put it into my uh into my twitch or into my obs you can do this during a presentation if you wanted to uh that you just record and not stream and so i'll leave this chill music play in the background turn it down a little bit all right and so what we're gonna do is we're actually going to use a mask and so hopefully this will work it was a little finicky earlier we're gonna do window capture again uh we're gonna name this spotify okay and then we're gonna go down and choose spotify so here we go lars them over i think that's the song that's playing choose that yeah it popped up so i'm gonna grab this and so what i actually did is gonna add that that's just going to pop over it is 720p so it takes a full screen and so uh it's up here at the top i'm going to do filters and so uh we're gonna add a filter add a mask again just like we did for the webcam all right let's show you what this mask is i made this in paint as well to make sure i can do it but basically i took a screenshot i'll just do it right now screenshot and then paint i'm not gonna actually do the mask because it's gonna be a little challenging paste this in here and basically i added a white box i said i'm not gonna do it but here it goes and then i just uh went over it with the white box all right and then uh uh i colored all this black to show you real quick how that happened but i did i zoomed in to try to make it pixel perfect as i can get them kind of like that i colored everything black around it so just double click make sure it's like that's not really black that sort of thing and then you just take this black thing and i said i wasn't gonna do it but i'm actually doing it all right uh all right so oh my gosh i clicked you why won't that work it doesn't select it anyways you change it to black as the uh the box and you just highlight it all to get it all out of there you do you also have to remove this bottom bar because it does not include an obs so all i did was do is drag that out there you go look at all this black and that turns into this is a 720p basically uh obs mask for spotify drags on me and so we go browse click that and then all it gets the album artwork for close i'm gonna go drag that to the side over here and just to show you i'm going to use my keyboard to change album and so if i do uh for me i have to function the next song it changes the album and it shows who's playing below that'll look a lot sharper on stream all right so did i close my presentation and so that i think concludes my presentation on how to use obs to record your presentation and upload it to youtube um i'd like to go more in depth on certain topics it gets pretty technical at some point um but i'd be very curious to hear what you all think you can do joe matthews okc on twitter let me know what you what you'd like to try and i can maybe figure it out with you other than that any questions any hey can people share filters so you're talking about taking like that spotify and kind of exporting that and so one way to do that and this is new i believe it's new or else i missed it the first time is if i wanted to extract all this i'm kind of doing this live with you because i just found out about it if you do tools okay hey calm down but if you do tools and then you do tools scene there we go scene collection and then uh we have a untitled can i do save as i can't do save as why is it untitled if you can't save it um i guess you can do new and then you name it anyway so i'm on untitled right now i do export and then i put that anywhere i want to put an obs i already did it right here i can call this presentation scenes okay save let's go see what that looks like though uh presentation scenes open with code all right and so that's what this looks like it looks very editable which is amazing and so i'm pretty sure if you were to send this to a friend uh all they would have to do is have uh all the files that are in the same folder it might need to i don't know you'd have to you'd have to check it out yeah so it's hard coding this and so you'd have to go through and kind of change it but it's more of a backup for yourself and these and these obs profiles are kind of what makes streamers money so there's not much sharing going on in general but uh as far as i've seen but i guess that is an awesome new feature because that wasn't possible it might have been in settings like deep buried in i just didn't know where it was but that export option's there and you can back that up because you can spend hours days doing that and obs might crap out on you one day but it's nice to have that backup it's never ever deleted a config file on me though unlike other broadcasting software i've heard about and so any any was that did i answer your question all right anyone else oh tough question um the best i understand it and if anyone is uh like an engineer raise your hand hurry hurry damn it and so video bitrate um i know that is 3 000 recommended by twitch for 1080p i think it's 2000 or 2200 for 720p and uh so it's currently set at 25 which would be a great 720p stream the best i know it uses flv but i did not look that up let's look up what that means it's flash live video f lv format and what this allows what this allows is twitch to get your content and also it's we recorded it it's the same format we recorded and uploaded youtube it allows twitch to get your contact uh content without letting it finish recording and so it's getting it at a 2500 bit rate and uh and it's allowing everyone to view that at the same the moment it hits twitch servers everyone can access your content it's a very kind of efficient way to to get that out there um and so i do know the recommended what does it say what it stands for flash flash video all right fl okay yeah the l is the f l on flash but uh twitch recommended bitrate um i will speak from personal experience do not cheap out on a router don't do it get the i got the the best of the best i don't know like it's like advertisement i think it's 3200 uh acm yeah um this boy is mean it is i would consider it the best they have one that's set up just for xbox but i would consider this one the best router you can buy i got it for 150 refurbished from uh walmart you can put open source software on it to make it do whatever you want and i wouldn't recommend that because uh well i would recommend it you just might not have a router for a while uh but it's really it's uh but yeah so uses open wrt for that and this will help your stream the most it handles the bit rate and make sure you don't do packet losses during that bit rate um when you're transferring it i've had a lot of issues on twitch i traced the cable back and it was the router and um i hate to say just buy more money but spend more money but as long as we're in our current standard ac standard i guess for wifi this is going to be the best router until we move to something new um question oh yeah yeah that's for sure uh but even if you do that that's a good point repeat the question oh man thank you austin the question was the question before that was i i think just general questions about explaining bitrate i'm not engineer i don't know the second question was could you not just connect directly in the router and that is correct and and so i got a little bit off on a tangent right there i love i love open wrt i kind of sprung off on that um some routers have 100 megabyte connections and some have gigabit connections and even if you have gigabit it's still being processed and so the more memory that that router has the more processing power that has like this is a lan party router for probably like 10 people you could i think on most any router you're right just connect directly and stream while uh everyone else because it's mainly about upload but you can stream while everyone else is doing normal stuff on the internet so that's a very good question wifi though uh the bigger the router the better the router the better but it you should be connected directly i didn't mean for this to be a stream to twitch talk teklahoma does stream to twitch too so it is very relevant to obs this is mainly about the recording the presentation part any other questions no i can always talk afterwards i really like this because i'll use this youtube video to show my son so he can get jump in and get started with obs and twitch pretty soon and i meant to kind of do this for him just i think kim really is really good at making me collect my thoughts and learn so kind of learn you know walk the walk the walk type of thing and that's kind of what i did for here all right thank you all and uh i'll be here for a little bit to answer questions thank you
