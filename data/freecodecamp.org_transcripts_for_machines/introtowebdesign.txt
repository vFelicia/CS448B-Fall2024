my name is doji and i am going to go ahead and be giving you a talk on just some basics for web design some ways that you can get into it and some things that you can do so that it doesn't feel like this foreign thing so that design doesn't feel like something that is unapproachable except for the best of all the best designers really quick um my name is doji my parents are from ghana and that's why my name is the way it is the d z is a j i was born in oklahoma though which is kind of cool i am i work as a volunteer for an organization called the interaction design foundation and what they do is their goal is to really promote design education especially ux design and human computer interaction and i work as the local leader in the oklahoma area i'm just trying to gather people together regularly to talk about design topics and to really tell them it's not this thing that cannot be approached that everyone can actually do it and you just need to learn about the basics and you can slowly work your way up from there i use zurb foundation as a framework for doing web design and web pages i like it a lot so if i lean towards pushing zurb that's the reason why it isn't because it's the best it's just i like it that's about it find what you like use it and i'm also a teclahoma volunteer as well so from here on out i'll be helping with some other organizations here at teclahoma where we're going to be getting together and once again trying to bridge between tech the development and then the design part as well there'll be announcements about that later on so keep posted on the teclahoma website for that today what we're going to go through is first design and design thinking and this is really what you want to do to get into solving a problem so we're going to talk about what design is then i'm going to get you some tools and some basic knowledge so that you have something to base everything off of and you're not just in the wild like what's this design thing what's going on and then a workflow having a workflow makes it easier for you to go from start to finish i'll just show you one there are lots of them and as soon as you get comfortable you can adopt your own with no problems and we're going to do some small case studies they're not really case study level but i'm taking some elements live from the web and then i'm going to be using those and then finally some resources to get you started i have some books over here at the end of the talk you can look through those are my recommendations with books and i really think they can help get you on your way the slides will be online as well and any links that i have are on those slides so don't worry about those either so now let's go ahead and talk about design and design thinking these are the basics this is where we're starting from and what is design i would like to say i have the ultimate answer to that but i don't they're greater minds than me who still have difficulty talking about it so i'm just going to give you the basic basic it's solving problems for humans in a way that can be approached by humans that's basically it you design lots of different things design can mean lots of different things for example if i say this podium is well designed am i talking about the aesthetic does it look really good or am i talking about how it's really easy to stand behind is it a balance between the two and those are all things that you need to consider whenever you're going through design as well it's problem solving and problem solving is really difficult i wish that i were the strongest being in the world and i had a magical gauntlet that could solve all design problems because snap my fingers and everything's good but usually this is what it looks like that's what you got so thanos i got you um let's go ahead with some design thinking so this is the pattern for design thinking and basically what you're doing is it looks like a straight line you empathize with the user and what empathy and empathizing is is understanding the problems of the user from the user's perspective you really want to know what the user is dealing with what the issue is why they're dealing with something i've had up till now lots of problems with math i'm a fulltime software developer and i do lots of things but math is one of those things that i still can't really break the barrier on my dad is amazing at math i don't know why i didn't get any of those genes oh well but when i talk to him about math and i say i'm having this issue can you teach me he says to me that's easy oh it's just this this this this and it's done and i'm like okay and we have this disconnect and i can't talk to him about math because he isn't able to empathize with me at my point in time with where i'm at right however there are other people who i've talked to about math who say oh yeah i remember i had difficulties with that and that's how i dealt with it for example i had difficulties with programming i'm like how come i can't make a equal to x and now it's not an issue but i remember that and i empathize with people who are in that situation so i understand the problem and i know how to talk about it when it comes to design you want to do the same thing you want to understand what the user is dealing with i don't like the page okay why don't they like the page the buttons are all over the place i understand what the issue is it's hard to navigate this page that's where the empathy comes in so we've empathize with the user we understand that the buttons all over the page that's why they're having difficulty so now we need to define the problem the problem is the buttons need to be centrally located so we go to our next step ideation where you go through and you find different ways to solve the problem and after you've done your ideation you say these are number of ways that i can solve my problem you make a prototype this is the thing this is how we're going to solve it you test it and then you're done yay we designed something we're good to go except it doesn't quite work that way maybe you get to testing and you realize at your testing stage that you didn't really understand what the problem was so you go back because you now empathize with the user you understand what was going on you go back and you say this is what the real problem is let's start all the steps again or maybe you're testing and you're like this this is good but i have a better idea of how to make things better or you made a prototype or like wait this prototype inspired me to do more things i have more ideas of how i can solve this and you can keep going that way basically it's not a linear process don't think of it as a linear process you can probably start in the middle you can start at ideation and then work your way backwards it's very organic so don't worry about that so now we understand design thinking now we're going to go to solving the problem i have concept cars up here and the cool thing about concept cars is a car can be pretty much anything they all solve our problem our problem number one problem is how did you get here most likely you had some form of transportation to get right here and the car solved that problem we could go back to horses you could totally get here that solved the problem for a little bit but the problem was we wanted to get there faster safer with less poop on the streets so we had invented the car and the cars have issues too no we don't have poop in the streets but we have stuff in the air now so there are electric cars so whenever you're solving your problems you have a lot of ways you can do it we have for example the concept car this one right over here and that's amazing concept cars are awesome because it's like i can do anything look at this this is the coolest car and i totally wouldn't want to ride in it because i totally look like a dweeb or something it's just crazy but it is a form of design it's saying how far can we push the boundaries when you look at web design you can say the same thing how far can i push the boundaries you're making a portfolio site for yourself you might want to push those boundaries they can show that i know the technology i know what's behind the design and i know how to push it so that's one way to solve a problem we also have over here the luxury car that is pretty cool it's precise it has all the features you need but it's also unattainable for most of us i drive a forward i'm probably never going to afford a bmw unfortunately so it's not quite attainable it's those services that companies pay 2 000 a month for subscriptions right they have a lot of different features they're really elegant that's also a way to solve a problem right finally we have the consumer model right over here it checks all the boxes i can get from a to b it's safe enough it has enough features for my daytoday and it's approachable i can say okay i can buy one of these cars and that's how you want to look at your designs as well who's going to be approaching it speaking of which we really want to think about the user's context what context who is the user what are we trying to do and what is the context are they is this for work is this personal is it business is it casual that's something you want to think about are they on their mobile phones are they on their tablets or are they working on a desktop now it's very important to think about that because i have an example over here in the wild you might want to take a look at this i like to download sounds and mess with sounds so i use a program and i'm not calling this company out okay but it's just it works for this presentation i use something called splice and i can download my sounds and i'm like well i have an ipad i'm going to get the splice app for my ipad and a ipad's pretty big i hold it like this i want to be at my desk i want the extra screen real estate that's why i got one of these big things and this is what i get very cumbersome for me to use because it was designed to be used on an iphone so now i have to use my tablet like an iphone that it doesn't really work no so you want to think about context a lot that's very very very important next we will actually want to think about a approach to our content so you're going to be presenting content to the user in some shape or form there are lots of ways to do it i'm just going to show you some examples these are what i've distilled it down to but there's more they're hybrids and there are other applications as well but first we might have email you might make an email message i'm sure you've all gotten those marketing email messages in your inbox the responsive emails they're really well designed you can apply your web design and html skills there you can also go with the webpage we've all seen them this is google way back in the day before they went and did their design overhaul there's a dashboard where you're presenting metrics to lots of different people and they want to see everything on one screen in as concise as possible next we also have an app a fullblown app and these get really complicated but it is a way to present content so we've gone through we've looked at design we know what's going on with design how to start our problem how to solve it now i'm going to give you the basic tools and knowledge so that you know where to go from here because you can't build something without the tools you can't build a house without nails wood and a lot of other things now so here are the tools of the trade we need pen and paper i recommend graph paper and you might be wondering if we're doing digital design why are we doing everything on paper well the biggest reason we're doing things on paper is because that's the fastest way to get your ideas down analog is much faster for so much than digital is i love tech i have a ton of computers at home my wife has to deal with my girlfriend which are computers so i just i love tech and the analog way is just faster than dealing with tech a lot of the time so you want to get comfortable with pen and paper and sketching if you're not comfortable with sketching i do have a book that i recommend and i'll talk about that later you also want some mockup and prototyping tools and the reason that you need these tools are after you have your sketches down you want to make them presentable to somebody else if you can't present them as an idea if you can't pitch them to somebody if you can't walk them through this is how i'm going to build up your website this is how i'm going to redo your app this is how we're going to run your marketing campaign then you can't communicate so this is a way to start communicating you want a few web browsers you want the default on your computer but you probably also want firefox and chrome because people access websites and web media different ways and a website on one computer might show up slightly different on another so you want to make sure you have a few to test with and finally you want a text editor and you want to find one that you love i like sublime text three i don't recommend it for everybody because there's an upfront cost of like seventy dollars it's really good there are others that are free as well like visual studio code atom those are great ones and they all support the industry very well you can do web development across all of them i recommend ones that are crossplatform you can use them on mac or windows because maybe you have a mac and you're working and you go to a company that only has windows well if it's crossplatform you can still use your tools so try and look for crossplatform solutions when possible now we have our tools to make our wireframes mockups and our prototypes like i said start lofi because drawing in analog is much faster and easier to change the cost of changing a drawing is a new piece of paper writing things down really quickly wifi hifi whenever you go a little bit higher it takes a little bit more time to go through that because you have to go through and manipulate your elements change how they are resize things and it just takes a little bit more time and then whenever you're dealing with a full blown prototype and somebody says can we shift this to the left 10 pixels that's when your world is over because changing it at that point in time is really expensive so try and get everything out in the drawing stage communicate lots of sticky notes there are ways to do this and some of the books that i have to actually go through the methodology for how to go through and do your lofi drawing up to your prototypes next if you're doing web design you have to know css and how to work with css selectors i had difficulties with this for a little bit but then i found a plugin for a text editor called emmett and what emmett does is it allows you to write html using css selectors and i have an example i'm going to go ahead and pop that up over here i just have some text and let's see if i can see where my cursor is and you can see right over here it says table dot information and the dot would be a class in my table and i have a table row and then table cells over here and i have times three down here and with met if you have it installed and it can be installed in any one of those editors i talked about before you are writing these css selectors and you hit the tab button and then you get html so it saves you in writing html it saves you in missing closed tags and it also teaches you css selectors at the same time because that's the way to use the tool so you're getting three birds with one stone instead of just two or even one which is pretty cool next we're going to go to the next slide design patterns so you might be thinking well design is amazing but i've never done it i don't know how to do it well there are these things called design patterns and it's common ways to address problems there are lots of components so you don't have to start from complete scratch basically going through with these for example this is a carousel that you're seeing up on the screen and they're just ways for you to organize content manage data input work with search boxes autocomplete drop down boxes etc those are all called design patterns and i have a list over here there's more as well and i have links to where you can see more about design patterns but it's just an easier way to approach it so you know oh if i'm going to make that webpage i need a tab navigation i'm going to need a few drop down boxes some text input and a search field and by doing that you simplify the design process because you're not doing everything from scratch from the beginning next you want to understand the basics of responsive design and with that example with splice that wasn't a responsive app it was made for cell phone and then they just stretched it so if i had a tablet that was this big i would have to hold it like this it's very cumbersome it just it doesn't make sense but with responsive design what you're doing is saying people are going to approach content from different devices in different ways i need to make sure that my content adapts to their device and i don't need to force them to adapt to my content this has been around for a while it's a very good approach to design for the web and for apps and software as well jumping into it straight off is difficult so i recommend that you jump into a frontend framework of some sort i recommend foundation i've used it it's really great they've been around for a long time it's very simple easy to read bootstrap is also very good bulma and skeleton are good as well and you might wonder like in the day and age that we have the css grid why would i need a frontend framework well it's a more approachable way to get your design up and running from the beginning and you don't have to fight with it as much and the css grid is really good if you're in a company that's working from scratch on a new system i would recommend using the css grid because the company owns all of that and you can tailor it to your needs however if you're making your own web page or you're working on a web page for somebody else and it's just needs to be up there and you want it to be responsive and you don't want to have to put in all the work of customizing all the different controls i most definitely recommend a front end framework next let's take a look at a workflow so we need to figure out how we're going to work through things to get from start to finish and this is usually how you go through it you do a rough pass you do a prototyping pass and then you do a finishing pass so your rough pass is basically doing all your sketches and these are some sketches i did they're not good they're just i sketched on paper i used the graph paper to help me draw straight lines otherwise i can't draw straight lines so that's why i recommend graph paper lots of notes arrows like this is where i want it to go this is if you click here this is where it goes to that's what you're thinking about whenever you're in the paper prototyping stage that's really what you want to do sketch a lot just keep sketching as soon as you're like i'm done sketching for today that's about when you should stop but keep sketching until you hit that after you've hit that point take a break take a breather go someplace listen to some music play some video games do something else whatever floats your boat come back with a fresh mind and then start transitioning your sketches over to using digital tools so like a mockup tool balsamic mockups is really good it looks very 1990s but that's perfect because you don't want your mockups to be too hifi there's also adobe xd and i would recommend that for prototyping not as much for mockups because when you're in xd you start talking colors and fonts and everything and it's too early for that you really want to state lofi everything rough so that you have the freedom to change things around next we go into prototyping this is where you would jump into adobe xd and what are my colors and what do i do so you'd have a hifi a hifi sketch like i have over here i did that in balsamiq and i just click a button and it becomes hifi and then you might want to start looking at colors what am i going to do with colors you might make a mood board and a mood board can be a collection it's an eclectic collection of lots of things together that says this is the mood we're going for this is kind of what we want our finished product to look like feel like and be and at the beginning starting off and jumping into a mood board mood board can seem very daunting but there are easy ways to get there and i'm going to show you one first you can see that this one has five colors i have five color swatches and there's an easy way to get here we can go ahead and on this screen i have adobe color cc and what it does is it allows you to get colors from a picture or start with your own color palettes so you can go in and if i navigate over there make sure i'm there you can move these colors around and it's going to try and based on a color you choose it gives you complementary colors or other colors that might match now what i like to do is with your mood board you might be looking on the internet for pictures like i had in mind so you get a picture and you tell kohler that you're going to start from an image i have avengers images over here apparently i like the avengers let's go ahead and take a look at what happens if we toss tony stark iron man in here awesome and it goes through and it makes a color palette for us it's that easy and obviously as you go into doing more design they're going to be intricacies that you're going to have to deal with but starting out for just a fivetone color theme you can do something like this i got iron man over here these colors look pretty okay i might need to use white as the text color if i'm going to use black as the background and then the other colors as trim or buttons over there that works sometimes you might toss a picture in and it just doesn't work let's see what else we have i have spiderman from the 10th anniversary let's go ahead and yeah that really doesn't work it's no and it happens but you can go through and there are other ways to navigate around you can i might not be able to see it over here this is back to the wheel and that is back to my image let's try the hulk that's okay you could go ahead and choose styles and that changes it so you can change it like oh that's better i could probably work with that and do something with it so that's a good way to go ahead and start choosing your colors so back to prototyping we also want to talk about fonts just a little bit so you see i have some fonts that i just decided to mess with i'm like okay how can i match these fonts i have a really bold slab style font and then i have a sans sarah style font over here that i tossed in as well and we can work with that there are tools to work with that as well my goal is to get you the tools to start working with them instead of being afraid of them and one way you can do that is we can do a web search and this is a web page i just typed in font pairings 20 perfect font pairing so other people who are really really into typography went through and said if you pair these fonts depending on what you're doing you should be pretty okay and you can just scroll through and see some font pairings and say oh these are some fonts that i want to go through and it's good to know what a sans serif font is and what a serif font is at the beginning and as you go over time you'll get more in depth and understanding what's going on but yeah we'll scroll down and i think over here at number nine is what i wanted to use there's the liberation serif and sans serif and as you can see the serif font has little flares at the ends and the serif the sansserif font is very flat and straight that's pretty much the difference and they said that you can pair these so we might want to use the serif font as a header and then the sensor for our body and one way you can do that is we're going to go on to google fonts and you can choose some fonts we i typed in lib ahead of time so they don't exactly have the fonts that were there but they have some things that are pretty close these two right over here they are fairly close let's go ahead and see if i can add them so you would add it like this and then it gives you the css and the link for actually tossing that into some place now there's one more tool on top of that that i would want to use after we've had our font selected and i have some other things going on on my screen right now so that i can show you what's going on there is a tool called grid lover and in grid lover you can experiment with fonts so it has the font here and you can use the little buttons up at the top to navigate between the different panels here's the link panel where you'd put your link text let me get my link text so that it will talk to the google font provider and you'll get those two fonts that we looked at over there so i can paste them in and i paste them in here that's awesome and i said that i would use one for the body and one for the header so for the body where you uh for the header we're using the serif font i have that over here and i've copied the code for that and i'm going to try and paste this in here there we go and paste that there we can see it changes so you can start working with fonts that way that's another header and we can just see how it works with our headers that's a little too big we might want to reduce that but just to show you for example so that is an example of what we did with these serif headers and then we can also toss in our sansserif body as well to see how that changes things and i would encourage you to use this tool and experiment with it so that you can see what's going on with your designs so let's go with the body this is what we have over here and i'm going to change it with the code from google fonts and that's how it changes it so you can experiment this way you don't have to set up a web page you can just go to this webpage toss on font combinations see what you think and see how you like them very very handy awesome next we're going to go to polishing up your work so we've already talked about deciding on some fonts and thinking about font pairings and how to work with the fonts you also want to reduce image sizes you're working with somebody who has a cell phone they're downloading a webpage i'm sure we've all had it how many of you have had a web page that just takes forever to load on your phone everyone okay a lot of times what's happening is they gave you the desktop version of the image and your phone is trying to download all of that it wastes your bandwidth on your phone it takes up your packets or whatever you use per month and it's also slow so you want to find ways to reduce it it's called responsive images and there are lots of ways that you can deal with it i recommend you go and search for using responsive images and responsive designs to get started with that you also want to leverage an icon pack and the reason that you want to go with an icon pack is instead of going through and designing each and every one of these icons right here that takes a long time they're icon designers out there that that's all they do they make icons so that you can use them get one of those toss them in your design you can color them using css it's very handy and it saves you time so once again the whole design thing is you don't have to do everything with design you just need to know how to combobulate if that's a word discombobulates a word the different parts of design so that you can get what you want to work with okay let's go ahead and take a look at some case studies we have all the information that i've given you so far and i'm going to give you some more information whenever it comes to design like where do i put something how should i color it what do i want it to be how would the user perceive it there are lots of ways to find out how to analyze that one way is gestalt principles it's a really big word for principles of good figure or how to make something look good i've put four of them up here i think they're close to 15 thereabouts and sometimes they're called laws otherwise other times they're called principles really they're just good rules of thumb because there's always ways to break them but basically we have the law of proximity that means if things are close together they feel like a group two people are walking down the street and there's a huge gap between them you're like oh there are two people walking down the street there's a guy and a girl walking down the street in their shoulder to shoulder like oh okay maybe they're together or something law of proximity how close things are together the law of similarity things that look the same act the same and this works for buttons links anytime we see a web page we're like links are blue usually and when you hover over them that gives you the little hand icon and we've learned that so anytime we see something similar we're like i can click it clicky thing i can click it there's also figure ground distinction where the figure like me right now is what you want to focus on and the ground is what's behind this is what's behind me if i wanted to blend in so that you guys couldn't see me i would probably wear a suit that looks like this and then i'd stand back here and then you'd see a floating head but you wouldn't see the rest of me and that's how we can kind of talk about figure to ground distinction right you can see me really well because i'm wearing a black shirt against a white background there's also law of common region where things that are share the same border feel like a group so if they're in the same boundary the same border they feel like a group that's law of common region let's go ahead and take a look at these in the wild first one over here this is a an email that i got from century i use sentry for logging what's going on on my web servers it sends me messages about all the people from foreign countries trying to hack into my computer do bad stuff about it that's why there's the failed password invalid user thing over there and it sends it to me and you can see that we can see some of these laws so the law of proximity these info messages are close together they kind of seem like they are together we see the law of common region there's a line dividing this this area is for the logo this area is for the type of alert and down here is for just a few action buttons and because of that horizon line that's what we see we also see the law of similarity the blue things they look clicky so i think i can click on them which is awesome and you can click on those as well also it's a little bit hard to see on the projector but the background for this email is light gray on gray which is back over here and it's a subdued color which doesn't draw attention to itself and because the white is so s steady and stable you're drawn to the white so that's a way to group it there's also a border around the whole message saying this is the content the background is just the background here's another one we have a dashboard and we can see the laws that play over here we have the law of proximity all the metrics are close together the foreground is really bright the background is dark you're not you're not really drawn to the um background it's a bluish slate blue navy blue thereabouts and you're not really drawn to it because everything on the front is really bright it jumps out at you the bright blues you're seeing that the red when the numbers and the metrics cards cards are a design pattern and you're seeing cards over here cards really encompass the law of common region it's a region around what you're looking at that says this data together is all together that's a way to group it i want to group these things so that you see that this is a group this is how it works using cards as well is a really great way to get into responsive design because cards move around they're really easy to move around next let's take a look at a page so this is typekit kind of like google fonts and typekit over here we can see law of proximity they give you lots of generous space between the different elements and then the elements that are together they put them really close so they really exaggerate the extremes over there that's what they're doing that's what they're trying to do to go through that and the law of similarity well we have clicky things once again the green looks clicky the buttons you can click on them anything that's rounded square looks like an action button i can action it i can click on that and do something with that that's really cool and finally we have an app instagram the law of common uh the law of figure ground distinction is really prominent here because the picture jumps out at you and the rest of instagram is kind of not really there that's the point they want you to scroll they want you to see more pictures so the pictures vivid everything else yeah you can pass it over the action buttons are wireframe and once again they probably went with wireframe because they don't want to draw attention to it as much and that's one thing that you can do but they're wireframed but you can tell their action buttons because all of the actiony buttons are very similar so that's it i think i should talk about white space but instead i'm going to talk about japanese bento boxes i love japanese food i was in japan for a long time i was there eight years and you see bento boxes everywhere this is a bento box i love it it has my fish stuff where fish stuff should be it's separated from the sour sweet tasting stuff and my wasabi stuff because i don't want that on my rice and they're all separated we got the sushi stuff up here they're all separate compartments i know where everything goes it goes in this place they're awesome oh we got a super packed bento box over here we got separators in there that's a separator sushi stuff fish stuff they're all separated the juices from the different types of food aren't going to flow into each other so when i eat my shrimp it tastes like shrimp it doesn't taste like pickles i don't like pickles pretty good stuff there's another bento box four squares very geometric and you got your food stuff and your rice stuff and then over here we got stuff in stuff and stuff man you can really put regions around these things and finally high class bento box i got containers for your containers for your containers for your containers you've seen web pages like this they're doing it to help separate things put things in boundaries i guess what i'm saying is if you take a look at design web design well done web design you might see some bento boxes this morning i was fortunate to make a bento box for my wife this is it i took a picture i'm like i'm tossing that on my slide this morning that's it got the rice stuff and the cheesy stuff and the cold stuff to the side and then you pack that up and you got your avengers again there we go awesome so if you go ahead and take a look at design bam that's a bento box i should have changed the colors that's terrible design you could scold me red on black on a projector that is terrible on the computer you can see it over here you can't but yeah you see that that's a bento box we got another bento box over here we got the red and the things and the things and we got ourselves another bento box and yet one more bento box they're all bento boxes good design good spacing good white space bento boxes awesome so now let's go ahead and i'm going to give you some resources and some ideas for you to go ahead and start moving forward first if you have a chance i think you should go through and look through some grid systems grid systems are really good especially if you're going to be working with the css grid directly you need to understand grid systems and how they work if you're working with a frontend framework not so much you can just start going but eventually you're going to travel to grid systems so take a look at that there are lots of different ones you want to browse through a design system if you want to go to sleep at night you're having trouble sleeping actually look through a design system i know i'm not that's not good pr for design systems but they're like 300 page documents of how you should make your application fit the standards of apple or microsoft or google they have tidbits and gems in there go through take a look skim find the gems the rest you can leave it unless you actually have to conform to all of the standards for that platform also take a look at dark themed trends right now we're seeing a lot of dark themes all over the place because people don't want to get their retinas burnt out looking at white screens all the time for today's talk i used a bright screen on my text editor but usually it's really dark you come into where i work it's really dark my coworkers are like you're so dark like i'm a black man i'm dark i got a black shirt on dark i wear black so dark threatened and then we have jennifer dewalt 180 page pages in 180 days project you should check her project out she spent one day making a webpage each day getting progressively more difficult it is awesome and she made lots of mistakes she left them out in the wild in the open for you to see it's a very good attitude to have to say i'm going to try something and even if i fail i don't care if other people see it she got 180 pages and you could see her skill increasing as she went on she started with this is text on a page to this is how you upload an image to my webpage people did bad stuff with the images so be careful uh then it went from that to this is a random text generator to lots of things and she just kept going please check out her project it's on github and you can also see her blog and her webpage finally some books these are some of the books i recommend steve krugs don't make me think is a great way to get into usability ux design user research and just the whole process that i talked about here if you're looking at learning how to sketch i'm not going to say learning how to draw because as soon as you say draw you start thinking amazing art and we don't need to go that far you just need to have have enough to get it done this shows you how to get it done it gives you some exercises and practice that you can do every day to improve your sketching look at stick figures a different way she made some awesome stick figures in it i have these books here by the way so that after the talk you can come see me look through them if it's something you're interested you can go online and get the books next is design for hackers if you're really into programming or like i'm a programmer programmer and i'm not going to do design because i don't understand design it doesn't make sense you can go through read this book have some good information for you it goes into depth on a lot of the things that i've already talked about but in ways that make sense to people who came from a programming perspective and then finally thinking with type this is a dead book if you're like i want to know everything about typography this is where to start if you want to read a book cover to cover and then find good references about how to use typography this is a good book it is really dense though just a word of warning we also have some online resources a lot of the talk came from these resources that you can get at the interaction design foundation the design process they go into depth on that the glossary of human computer interaction that's a glossary of things that you need to know when talking with other industry professionals about how to talk about how users interact with your pages they also have the link to the gestalt principles that i talked about next travesty travesty media and they have a video on emmett how to use emmet as a way to start learning css and how to speed up writing html and finally the zurb foundation grid you can go and check out that video it shows you how to use a frontend framework bootstrap you just do a search for bootstrap you can find bootstrap up there as well and you'd be good to go that's it i'm going to open it up for any questions if anybody has any yes okay so the question was a good place to go to find information about how to design for usability using your product and how to make things usable for users for example people who might have problems seeing with like colorblind green red green issues hearing impairments where you'd be using the aria tags in your html a good place to start would probably be the nelson norman website by don norman he wrote a book called the design of everyday things it is a really good book he talked about his struggles with everything he went to europe and things were backwards and kept on running into doors he tried to open doors that wouldn't work and his group does research on usability he also helps with the interaction design foundation because that's all what they do so i would go to nissan norman first because don norman did a lot of work there and then you can start going out from there good question anyone have anything else and there are a bunch of resources i don't have them here on my computer right now but if afterwards you give me your information i can send them your direction as well because there are checkers that can check to make sure that the contrast on your web pages is enough that you can see them so that you don't run into that mistake that i had on the projector with red on black it's good to make mistakes because you can teach people anything else okay well thank you very much
