hi in this video we are going to talk a little bit more about routers and how they relate to networking routers are the things that connect different small area networks uh i want to give kind of a metaphor for this so i'm a teacher i work at a school let's say i have a package that i need to get to somebody that works in the district offices i don't know where her office is exactly but i know her name i go to my secretary that would be this is me this is my secretary i go to my secretary i say hey i need to get this to soandso at the district office can you please help me out here she'll say oh sure i don't know exactly where her office is either but i know how to get there i know the next step so even though i didn't know the next step she does so she goes on and sends it on to the secretary of the district office now that district office secretary has no idea who i am or where i am but she knows the end location what i'm trying to get across here is each router only has to know its own little network only the stops right next to it it doesn't have to know the whole internet just has to know its own connections and it can take information and say all right i don't know exactly where that's going but i'll pass it on to the right direction and that's really all it takes routers can be different sizes different capacities but what they do is just know their own neighborhood take the information and pass it on in the right direction another really powerful thing that we're going to get into a little bit later is they don't have to have the full package of information either if this computer is trying to send information all the way up here it might get split up and go to two different routers and that's okay the computers are still going to know how to put that information back together now the little pieces of information that are sent are called packets packets are actually little pieces of binary code which i'm going to draw up here for you all right so this is an example of what a packet might look like it's just this line that goes up and then down and up and down and it's either up or it's down that is an electrical current so a computer gets that and can translate that into ones and zeros which we all know is binary code the way it does that is it draws lines a certain distance apart basically and if it's a pi it's a one if it's down low it's a zero as we discussed in previous videos this one and zero business can really mean a whole lot more in fact it means everything everything can be translated into ones and zeros so this is really powerful now these little packets are sent across through these routers and sometimes if there's a file that's too large for one packet it can be broken up into frames or smaller little packets these packets don't have to go the same route they go whichever routes available whichever is fastest and since they have the nip address encoded into them all the routers know where to send them when they get to the end destination that computer knows how to put it all together
