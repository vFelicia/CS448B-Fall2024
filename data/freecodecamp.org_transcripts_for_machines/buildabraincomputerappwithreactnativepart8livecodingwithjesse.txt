hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and uh today we're gonna do two things number one we're going to put in some sort of desktop notification whenever you lose focus for this app and number two we're gonna deploy this react native project as a web app and there's a couple different ways we could deploy it i think we're going to go with github pages that way anybody that checks out the github repo can also easily get to the uh the demo uh of this so there's a ton of stuff in the live chat now i tried to uh glance through as much as possible uh just to see what people are asking it seems like uh a lot of you are just kind of talking in the chat that's awesome a lot of people saying hi so hey what's up uh but i did have um somebody asking about part two of this series part two is has been deleted it is definitely uh i believe it's my fault that is deleted i'm sorry about that i'm gonna redo part two so that will be available at some point uh but for now just skip to part three uh and hopefully there's not too much that you missed uh from part two but i'm definitely going to try to go back look at the uh what i did between part one and part three and then redo that probably as a live stream to try to make it this like as similar to the original as possible but um just as a quick intro for anybody that's joining for the first time or you know maybe hasn't seen all the videos in this series this is live coding with jesse so i code mostly react native projects now i've done other things in the past and i don't rehearse beforehand the goal is just to see a software engineer coding without rehearsing anything all the mistakes included try to debug as we go and try to be as realistic as possible with what my normal coding experiences is like i do have a little bit of a structure to this so i'm going to set a 25 minute pomodoro timer soon and then i'm going to code for 25 minutes and then i'm going to take a little break and answer questions so if you're asking a question in the chat and it seems like i'm ignoring you just hang on for a little bit longer and once my timer goes off i'm going to try to get to all the questions now for this particular app if you want to know like what we're doing probably go back to the first uh in this series so this is part eight of the series on uh building a brain computer app i do a an overview in part one so the summary is basically i'm taking this brain computer device which i'm going to put on in a second this is the neurocity notion it's it's a pretty new uh and this has the parts inside of it like you would normally see on a cell phone and basically what it does is it reads your brain waves and sends some data in this case to a web app that we've created well actually it's a mobile and web app that we've created with react native now you can get a lot of different data but in particular the data that i'm using for this app is data on focus so the goal of the app is just to let you know when you've lost focus so i'm gonna put this on and you can see on the screen that it's measuring my focus so it probably needs a second to get get ready there we go so i got a little bit a little bit of focus going on here you see sometimes i'm losing it um which i imagine while i'm trying to talk and live stream i probably won't be super focused but right now if we were on a phone we would get a vibration and the color of the screen would change when i lose focus but we can't vibrate on the web right so we need to add something into the web and i'm thinking maybe some sort of notification potentially a sound uh that's that's the plan right now so let's check out in our app here and you can see this the link to the github repo is in the description of the video so if you want to check out the code and follow along everyone you know feel free to do that i've kept everything pretty simple in one file app.tsx is where everything's going to be happening a little bit later on we're going to go into the package.json file as well and add a few things but for right now we're just going to step in the stick in this app.tsx file and we need to find out where we're setting the the current notifications at for mobile which is the the vibration so let's go through here and just check out some of our functions there we go here's where we're doing the vibration so this is where we want to do this as well for our notification so we're going to need to get some code to do this so figure we'll uh we'll look that up there is a there is an app already that i use it's my pomodoro timer app and it's called pompom and it was built by someone that used to watch the live stream all the time his name is harshit so let's go to his github repo and see how he's done it in his app and see if we can borrow a little bit from his app for our app so let me see if let's see if that's the name of his repo looks like there's a lot of repos like that so let's just go to a harsh it's repo then we'll just get a good hub and he's pretty active so he should actually be right in my activity there we go and let's check out his repositories and type oops let's do language we're going to pick javascript it looks like all this stuff is javascript so let's see if we can find it palm does he not have a repo for it um oh no maybe he doesn't have it uh timer no i was hoping he'd have the code for it but maybe he doesn't have the code for it all right then i guess we'll just have to look it up and go through quickly just to see if he has it and it's just named something else but all yeah that's going back kind of far i don't see it so let's just look it up then uh so show notification from web so mdn is a great resource mozilla developer network and we're going to use the notifications api so let's see how we do it we definitely need permission uh and so i guess we're gonna have to request permission and then let's see oh cool there's a little code yeah let's grab let's just grab this code for now and then modify it for what we need so let's throw it in here and we can kind of read through this and see what's happening here all right so we need to check that's a good check see if browser supports notifications and oh see if i don't really want to alert so let's get rid of the alert what we're going to do is instead move all of this into the if statement so we're only even going to attempt this if the browser supports notifications let's get rid of this else so we're gonna say if there are notifications so now we're going to say so if the browser does support notifications we're going to check to see if permission has already been granted okay so if it has been granted then we'll do something here otherwise we need to ask cool and then not only that but we also need to check to see if the window object even exists right because if we're not on web this window object doesn't exist that's going to throw an error so react native gives us an easy way to check for this which we're going to do in just a minute but i'm going to change this up to an arrow function just to match the rest of the app and i'm going to say this notification init is what i'm going to call it and we're gonna run this only if we are uh in in the web so let's go up here to where we import react native and we're going to import platform so platform is going to let us know if we're on the web or not so we're gonna use let's see one of these use effects would be a good place to check and maybe down here actually let's just search if we have a use effect that i'm currently using as there we go this particular use effect right so react has these life cycle hooks right and basically does things at different points in the component life cycle a use effect hook with the second argument passed in is an empty array so the first argument is a function the second argument is an array if it's an empty array this happens when the component mounts so this should only happen basically for our app when the app loads so we're already doing a check here for async storage okay but let's do another check here and let's say if platform dot os equals web then we want to call notification and knit okay all right so now if we have if we're calling notification init would be down here right now we're going to check to see if the browser supports notifications if it does and permissions granted now we can do notifications so i'm not going to immediately show a new notification i'm going to leave that code there for a second but what we're going to do is we're probably going to set set notification and we're going to set notifications to true so we're going to we're going to set our state here and let's see otherwise we need to request permission so we already have our code here to request permission so the browser is going to ask that uh if permission is granted then we're also going to do set notifications to true all right um now if for some reason it's not granted let's set our notifications to false if you're a little bit lost it should make a lot more sense once we actually demo this all right and we haven't even created this part of state yet so let's let's do that now otherwise nothing's gonna work so we can say cons notification set notification oops notifications use state and we're going to set it by default to false okay all right so now let's go back down here and right here was the use effect where we set the vibration right and let's say let's go here now and first we're going to check to see if notification is true right so at this point if notification is true that means that we've already checked to see whether or not or on web so we won't have to recheck that and we've already done the check to see if notifications are available in that browser like if it's a new enough browser that it has notifications so we've done those checks and we've also checked to see whether the user has enabled notifications whether they need to enable or whether they've rejected them so at this point we should just need to say notifications so if notifications are true i'm going to use a turn area here so it's actually kind of a shortcut right so if notifications are true we're going to do something and this is what we're going to do so we're going to do a notification i'm going to say new notification and let's see if this could work like this if i don't actually have to create the variable if this will just throw it i'm not sure because i haven't really worked with notifications before in code so let's see how this works and let's just say stay focused all right now i'm not sure if there's the equivalent of a cancel notification we'll see we'll see how it goes well we may have to come back here and and check out the documentation a little bit more all right so now it once it's asking me uh if it uh i want to allow notification so i'm going to allow now let's see if we get get one look we got notified oh you can't see it because of my my face let me change this all right so way down in the corner it's small i don't know how to make it bigger but stay focused came it says stay focused right so we are getting in the notification to stay focused so that's awesome that works um actually cool we just got um a like a donation or a sign up or something i'm not sure what it is uh but dion uh dimucci um just donated a free code camp so thank you very much for that uh i'm a little i'm a little new with the whole um being able to have donations and stuff in the chat so i'll try to look for those and uh give you all a shout out when i see it um i think it's really cool and it's going to be very helpful for uh for code camp though so that's awesome and quincy's in the chat too uh so if you don't know quincy is uh the the founder and head of free code camp uh so thank you so much for being in the chat quincy um that's it's always cool when quincy's here um all right so we we have the notifications here and it's actually giving me like a tiny little um noise like a notification noise which is cool because i had thought about adding in our own noise but i don't think we need to i think that notification is fine uh i don't want to be like extra annoying to the user because i'm trying to keep them focused not not have them lose their focus right so if we're too intrusive like well the giant red flashing screen might already be kind of intrusive but if we're too intrusive with noise and everything it might just be too much but i think that's that's pretty awesome the only thing i want to look up is like can we manually take away the notification like let's say they get focused again i don't want them to have to come down here and clear that notification out let's see if we can cancel it so we got all our methods here uh event handlers let's see so let me make that bigger sorry that was probably way too small for everybody uh but let's let's go here and see so notification actions interesting buddy this looks like all the stuff we can put in our notification well while i didn't realize there was so much to these notifications this is really cool and we can actually do a vibration which i suppose that would work like if you were running this in the browser on your phone that's kind of cool i don't think i'm going to implement that today but it's good to know on close on air on show notification close cool all right let's click this and see how we would do notification close this feature is available in webworkers in secure context uh oh my gosh i must be like uh losing focus pretty frequently here so all right so i think we do need to give our notification a name and so then we can actually call close on it and then let's let's see see how we do that so i'm going to change this because i don't know that we can do this inside of our little shortcut ternary here so let's change this to an actual if i hate to do so many nested is but in this case we'll just go with it well this project has never it's never been refactored or anything this is still pretty uh pretty new so don't take what i'm doing is like the best way to do anything uh in this live stream a lot of times what we're trying to do is just get stuff working and you know sometimes we go back and and do a little refactoring but for the most part let's see const there we go const n is a notification and actually this can't be i gotta define this out here so let's say this let's did i call okay no i called state notifications so we're good i let notification it's gonna be mad that i didn't has any type i didn't give it a type i'm not really sure what the notification type is in typescript so we're going to just leave it at that for now notification equals now we should be able to do is say notification dots close all right so let's see if that works whoa did not work cannot read close of undefined okay maybe we need this let's see let's see if this helps us uh nope cannot read property close of undefined checking the uh chat really quick just to see if anybody has any uh comments about what i'm doing right now occasionally you all figure out how to do the thing that i'm trying to do and uh tell me about it in the chat all right so that didn't work why did that not work looks like the only different thing that we did that they did they added these options i mean this is def this is inside of an event listener oh okay i see um anthony's saying the initialization is in the if statement i'm closing in the elf state else statement is only being defined in the sk all right did i mess up the scope let's check that out so if all right so basically what potentially could be happening here is that since this is an else all right how about this if notifications let's see if there is a notification then we close the notification let's see if that works it doesn't look like it's actually closing it though i look at my my action center has all these notifications i wonder if it can actually close the like i don't usually when i get a notification it stays in my action center and it's not um like it's it's it doesn't get close right is that a thing that happens like that websites can close them let's see got some some of you are helping out in the chat so let's check out what you're saying all right so i'm getting a bunch of different suggestions here let me try to keep them straight let me check it i got about four minutes left before i'm gonna go back to the chat and answer a few questions and then after you answer some questions then we'll actually deploy this i wonder i'm not really seeing much of a difference between when i actually put this in and when i didn't let me yeah you know what i think i'm going to leave this out for now because i i don't actually see any difference on my screen oh you know what i forgot that i y'all can't see the notification um basically what's happening is the notifications are going on and off um whether i have this code in here or not now this might be dependent on browser and operating system but in terms of being on chrome on a windows 10 computer it seems like the notifications only stay on the screen for a second and then go off anyway so i don't really see that we need to like manually close the notification even if this was working which i'm not even sure if it was if it's working because it didn't seem like anything was different but what was different is we did get a few errors whenever we were we're doing this so let's get rid of that now and let's just do this let's get rid of this for now you know at some point maybe you will add something else into the notifications might not be a bad idea if we ever like actually get a real logo for this maybe we can throw that in there uh you know make it look a little bit nicer but for right now i think that that basically gives us something else you know mainly what i wanted is if i'm on a desktop and i'm using this i'm probably not going to be staring at this screen all the time right so the change that i see is not going to help me it was different whenever i you could have the phone right the phone app one from previous episodes you could potentially just set your phone out and see the color change and feel the vibration and that would warn you to stay focused but on a desktop the color change isn't going to do anything you're probably working on something else and you don't have it up on your screen you need something else you can't have vibrations so this notification should come up on top of whatever you're working on so i think we have kind of mission accomplished in terms of what the point was for that so i'm gonna go back back in here let me put this down here and um let's create a pull request or i'm not gonna do a pull request i'm just to merge this straight into master because it's just a small project at this point so let's do a git status just to see what's changed which only app.tsx has which is what we should expect we'll do get commits am and we'll add this as a new feature and we'll say show desktop notification on web i don't need to do that i just do get push when i'm at work i always have to do a git push origin and then whatever branch i want to push to and do like a legitimate pull request on a separate branch so i'm used to doing it like that when it's just my own private project here i don't worry about that so you can just do get get push and it'll go right to your origin by default whatever your branch on all right cool i don't know if i'm messing up it's possible that all my my headphones or something is messing up the focus on here but i feel like it's going up and down really fast we may have to let's try to figure out if it's just me or if there's something up with how this is going up and down so much like something in terms of code or anything but i guess when i try to focus i can keep the focus uh a little bit higher so maybe it's just hard to focus talking and coding at the same time all right so that's cool for the first part of the live stream i'm gonna set let's say a five minute timer go to live chat answer a few questions and then we're going to come back we're going to build this for the web and we're going to deploy it to github pages so i'm scrolling up and i'm just going to start off at the top and answer as many questions as i can all right so see the questions about part two in the series which i explained that at the beginning so if anybody's interested in the missing part two of this series uh then go back to the beginning of this stream uh when it's done and i gave an explanation for that uh andre says i recently started learning javascript and i noticed that everyone talks about react what is it uh there's a lot of good discussion in the chat about that so if you're interested in hearing all that discussion scroll back in the chat to the beginning of the chat and you can see that but basically react is a javascript library that helps you build out like the front end of of your app it has some different components to it a certain way of doing styling and one of the biggest things in my mind is the way it handles state management and updates like updates as your users clicking around things change right it's it's very nice i like how it handles that so i don't want to go into like a big discussion of react right now because i don't think i have time for it anyway uh but basically the short answer is it's a react live it's a javascript library that helps you build uis user interfaces let's see oh there's a lot of discussion about this i'm kind of i'm scrolling through a lot of people saying hi i see all the hellos hey everybody people from all over the world here we have people from uh tanzania um let's see india nepal somalia pakistan palestine vietnam lithuania chicago very cool very cool everybody's watching from all around the world uh shoe bomb asks should i watch previous videos or directly watch this suggestions please um i i think you're you're fine to watch this right now like just to see what's going on if you want to get a better understanding of what we're doing then you might want to watch the previous ones but you know you don't have to uh just you know ask any questions if you're not sure what's what's going on at some point sajid asks what do you mean by brain app uh i mean this this app the main data that this app is working with is coming from your brain through this brain computer interface so that's what i mean when i say brain app we're working with data live data from from the brain swahan says i'm a beginner in programming can you tell me where to start i definitely recommend starting with freecodecamp.org check out the lessons there go through them it'll give you a great uh introduction to some types of programming and then you can decide from there whether you want to keep going with it and what type of programming that you want to do it's totally free i did it when i was a beginner and a lot of people have used it and it's it's helped them go from not knowing anything in programming to being professional programmers all right raphael from brazil was here my oldest son's name is raphael so uh what's up great name learn tech says it's night at my town would be available tomorrow this will definitely be available as soon as i'm done with the live stream usually give it a minute or two and it'll be available to watch the recording um you know almost immediately when i'm done with the stream let's see all right i'm gonna my timer went off so let's go back and let's launch this thing and i have the expo documentation up on my screen right here it's i'm kind of glad that my face is now covering up the notifications because every time i lose focus it keeps popping up now i think this app is definitely going to work well on desktop because the desktop notifications are becoming so annoying it is making me really want to learn how to stay focused so i think this is going to be a great thing all right but here's what we're going to do we're going to look at this building step and then we're going to skip down to the github pages step so first thing we're gonna do this build it says we can actually optimize for speed i've never run this before so let's try it out we do npx expo optimize let's try it out and see what happens i don't know if we need to close down our server or keep it open or what in terms of our local server so let's just try it and see if it works all right let's see what happened optima cannot optimize images without sharp cli run this command again after successfully installing sharp all right oh for those of you who watched the last couple episodes where we were working on getting this app into the apple app store i'm still working on that evidently that demo mode we put in it worked fine on android but for some reason the testers said they couldn't get it to work so i don't know if we need to like do another build and submit it but that's what i'm going to try to do so i'm not going to do that on a stream since we just we we did a stream where we did a build and submitted it so i'm probably just going to rewatch that stream and follow along with what i did before and do the same steps to build it and rerelease and see if that works but when this is done for web at least those of you who want to try this app and don't have an android phone now you'll be able to try it on the web so hopefully that'll be open it up to more users all right so it looks like this worked now let's see if this npx expo optimize works now cool all right it looks like basically all we had was our icon and our splash uh which oh yeah we did create those because we did that for the other stuff cool um by other stuff i mean the android and ios apps we created an icon and a splash screen and we saved 148 bytes not really sure that it was worth it in a bigger project that might actually be worth it but since we have no we really don't have anything in terms of assets we have the bare minimum right the icon and the splash screen so now we can move on and do expo build web all right and let's get that going not sure how long this will take i'm guessing not that long since there's not a whole lot to the project but this is going to create a new web directory so we have this build web directory here that we didn't have before and that's where our build falls are gonna be let's open that up and see oh where'd it go we lost it where'd he go there it is now let's see what's in here so now we have a bunch of files in here and this is where it's going to get hosted let's go all kind of stuff progressive web app stuff which is sweet very cool that that's actually cool so we have i'm gonna see what icon they have for this oh sweet so it actually took our icon that was in our assets and it made an apple touch icon chrome icon very cool i didn't know i did all that that's that's very useful see what it did i don't think we'll be able to see that oh it even made a little favicon that's very cool i i like that whoever um probably evan bacon so shout out to evan bacon who i don't think he's watching the stream right now he has before but he works at expo and he's he's been doing a lot of work for the expo web stuff so if i had to guess i'd say it was him that did all this stuff and that that's really a nice touch to automatically create all the icons and everything like that because doing that manually always it's not a lot of work but it always seems like a pain once you get to this part where you actually want to launch it and you know now you gotta go like into an image editor it just feels weird and it's something that is easy to forget uh forget to do and then when you realize you have to do it it's just like i gotta go in here and do this now so i don't know that's just how i feel i'm not really into image editing so that's not my thing so that's very cool and now we can deploy so let's go to github pages and we've already we already have a git repo the remote is already our github repo so we can skip that but we do need to do our yarn add d which means add as a development dependency uh gh pages so let's do that if you have a small like project that you're working on and you need to host it somewhere i definitely recommend gh pages it's very easy to do and let's open our package json now it's pretty easy to do and it keeps everything central to github and it doesn't cost anything so it's a great place to start if you're not to the point in your project yet where you really want to put a lot of money into it it's you know i have a lot of just kind of fun projects that i don't know if i'll ever do anything more with but it's really cool to be able to to try them out or when when people like i tell people about them and say oh yeah let's check this out and i can just click a link in github and and do a little demo so we have our scripts already out so we can't really copy and paste this entire thing since we already have other things in our package json so now we have a deploy and a predeploy the predeploy is just the expo build web that we did already and then their deploy uses github pages to deploy this uh to github which we are going to run that in a minute and we're going to have to put in our home page which we don't have at all so let's do our home page we're gonna have to change it obviously this is not the this is not our home page so yeah oh there we go so the documentation uses evan bacon's github so now i'm i'm really sure that he's the one that built this so we need to change that to the github for this project so we're going to go to github now and get that url stay focused so now we can see this is linked to the github repo that we're using so let's save that and we'll go back here to the documentation and see finally we can just do yarn deploy so let's try it out see if it's working cool let's run in webpack we're exceeding the size limit that's interesting i wonder why we're exceeding the size limit oh well very cool it's deployed it's published so we may need to work on our file sizes here at some point but it should be published so let's go to github now and let's see what would i do i accidentally did that let's see what we have here we have a gh pages branch now which let's just see what which gets deployed so you see all that stuff in our static web our web build directory that we just checked out that's all now push here and we should be able to go to i'm trying to think what the i don't remember what the default urls are so we're gonna have to figure that out for a minute uh let's go to our settings though and options there we go so we go down here to github pages here's the options for that so if if you do this on your own on a different project and you don't follow these steps like let's say you're not using expo this is where you would go to use github pages so there's a couple things you could do it's actually it's very cool you can use a custom domain you can if you want to do like jekyll you can do a theme here but otherwise you can take any branch right so we're using the github pages branch and that was set like by default through expo but i could choose any branch i wanted to or any folder like if i had a docs folder in my master branch insert it from that branch of that folder so there's a lot of flexibility here but anyway the the url is here and this is standard so like anything that i have on github pages if if i were to go to jesserrygold.github.io slash the name of the project then that would take me to the the site so let's see focus uhoh is it not working all right let's inspect it and see what's happening failed to load resource fail to load resource i don't know looks like looks like it's not working what happened all right stay focused favicon say focus manifest all right so it looks like it's not finding what it wants to find let's check this out so it should be finding this stuff all right so static that's interesting that it's not finding this stuff let's double check our documentation oops this one isn't working now either why is that oh no it literally broke let's run this again let's start our local server again just see if we can get it to run okay all right that's running now all right so we're running locally again but for some reason this one is not working and it looks like it can't find any other resources which is kind of leading me to believe that maybe it's a path issue let's see if it's finding anything yeah it looks like nothing basically so wondering if there's something else we need to change in the project something we need to do differently let's see so let's go back to our we can get rid of that let's go here all right so maybe we um need to do our build with the package.json this is scripts predefined bill trying to deploy all right looks like they're are more detailed instructions under that so let's follow this we did that that's the player app let's make sure you're sure it's good you did that configure your package json we've done that predeploy is automatically run to before deploy generate a production bill to your app with yarn deploy yep there's nobody about the url you set as your home page in package.json oh maybe you know what i set the wrong home page that's the problem if somebody's trying to tell me that apologies but i set the wrong home page so uh this is actually the home page that we want right this is the page of the repo and that's why i can't find anything so let's save that so at that point make sure you use the page the github pages url the one that your demo will be at not the the url for your your github repo so that is a different uh a different url so that that makes sense actually uh so let's do yarn deploy now which it's it's oh no what'd i do focus directory not empty okay it needs it to be empty that's weird i mean we can definitely delete that so i'm removing that so um web build rm rf is a very powerful command it'll delete everything recursively so we just did that in web build we're going to run this again because the error that we got was saying hey this directory has something in it which it didn't like so uh you would think that that you'd be able to keep running deploy and it wouldn't you wouldn't need to manually delete that so maybe we set it up wrong maybe something wrong with the project but either way like if you get that error then you just need to delete that you don't have to do it with the command line if you don't want to you could just go in and through the ui and delete it all right let's try this again whoops stay focused let's make sure the latest commit yeah 34 seconds ago yeah that seems like that should have worked by now there we go i had to empty the the cash and look now we we have it so let me get rid of what i was doing here all right close that out i'm just in fact i'm just going to close out our local server completely there we go and we're going to link up the notion let me grab my device id from my other screen put that in there put in my email and i'll grab my password nice sure what then cool so now on github i'm running this it's working i'm getting i should be getting notifications let's see if i'm getting it from let me there we go allow notifications cool so now i'm getting notifications from my github page which you can see down in the corner there i know it's really small i i really don't know how to make notifications bigger but it's working so now anybody can go there like even right now you could go there and you could run this now if you if you don't have a notion headset which most of you probably don't um because it's still kind of i don't know if it's like officially you can buy it like anybody can buy it right now or if it's still kind of like in development but uh still i don't think there are that many of them out there yet so if you want to just kind of like play around with it and see if it works you can type in test as your device id and like leave email and password blank and hit submit and it'll just have random numbers come up so like at least you can you can try it out uh otherwise you can try whoa oh that's weird an error invalid path oh that's that error that came up before i think we have a uh we have something for that so i believe what happened is my password manager put in the email address for device id and that at symbol was not you can't put that in there so it didn't like that but otherwise i would need to put in like my device id email password again i could sign in and it should work cool so mission accomplished for today i want to see if there's anything else i need to commit whoa all right splash package json oh yeah of course our package json i'm just gonna add everything and we'll do uh git commits i didn't have to put the a flag there it's just habit uh let's go there we go cool all right so we now have our app deployed successfully on the web we previously deployed it to the android app store what do you call that the google google play store and we have unsuccessfully attempted to deploy at the uh the apple app store uh but i'm gonna retry that so we've tried twice and it hasn't worked so i'm gonna try it again and see if we can get that in there uh but yeah at that point i don't know what we'll do next with this i don't know if we'll we'll upgrade this or we'll move to a different project or or what so let me know what you think like in the comments or uh on twitter or whatever and let me know like would you like to keep working on this brain computer interface project and add in some more features would you like to move to some type of different project if so what would you like to see for now though i'm going to answer some more questions and try to get through all your questions here before before i uh end the stream let me find where i left off okay all right i guess i don't need this on anymore all right so we have a question is there any way to set the state in a big object with you state rather than all those individual use state calls yeah that's a great question so let's uh let's look at this in the app here so we do have quite a few set state calls here what we could do we could have an object that does use state but what i found is that if i have an object for you state especially if there's nested values in that object for some reason like things just don't get updated like i want them to get updated so what we could use instead is something called use reducer and then we could pass in we can have an object for all the state using use reducer have it set up similar to redux and that has worked for me that might be a better way to go about what we're doing with this app since we have so much state here it's starting to get a little bit crazy but yeah that's definitely um that's a great question and i i think used reducer is probably the way to go if you start to get a lot of state that you're trying to handle danielle says love your viz thanks i appreciate that ace of spades says 135 repos what a mad was that when we were checking out uh harshit's repos he's a great programmer so although you should when you see someone's github and they have a lot of repos that like total repo count includes things that have been forked so that doesn't necessarily mean that they're like maintaining 135 repos so uh just kind of take that for what it's worth there you know somebody could potentially have none of their own repos and just like to fork other people's repost i see some thanks pretty much so i'm just i'm looking for for questions at this point uh brother philip says i have a question what if you're trying to build with an sdk but the documentation is trash that's a tough one um you know what this is actually something that i do if i can't find answers with the documentation is i'll go into github and i'll try to find other people that are using what i'm using so i'll go into the github and i'll go to a search right and what i do is i would search for something uh that is particular to that sdk like for instance notion right so i'd go in and i'd say notion.focus i'd copy that and i put it in here because i figure like what are the odds that somebody's gonna have notion.focus and not be using notion right so i'd go in here i'd go into the code i'd select it and i'd say probably want to try like javascript right i'm looking for some javascript and i'm going to try to see like if somebody else have does somebody else have notion.focus actually it looks like a lot of them have notion it's not i don't know if i could do it like this see if i could do like an exact match okay there we go that's a lot less so now i can see all right i want only the repos that are exactly using since i put those double quotes around it notion.focus right now i can see okay here we go these are the repo's that are using that so i can go in and say all right let's say i only want javascript oops didn't we just see that showing two available code results that's really weird that is isn't that weird like obviously this is javascript that's interesting um anyway like i can go in here and say like all right well here's an example of somebody using notion.focus right this is exactly what we're trying to do i can click into this and i can see all right this is how they used it sometimes that helps me because if the documentation is really bad or the documentation is wrong or outdated at least if you can find somebody else that's using what you're trying to use and see how they implemented it it gives you something to try so that's that's kind of my goto obviously if you could find it on stack overflow or something like that that's that's awesome too uh but this is nice because you get to see the code in context of a real project and you could see and you get to see like exactly like how old is this like all right this code was in here on october 12 2019 it's pretty new um yeah so you can judge like all right this code maybe it's 10 years old i don't i don't want to use it versus something that's way newer but it gives you a nice i think it's kind of a nice way to see like real world examples of stuff uh ace of spades says any books you can recommend on optimizing your code really having a hard time not making it a messy wall of text i don't really have any books that come to mind um in terms of optimizing code um i don't know if anybody knows of any books for like optimizing your code uh put them in the in the chat to be honest with you like i don't really read a lot of coding books i'm i'm more like i like kind of tutorials and videos i actually read probably a lot of documentation now for the different like tools that i'm using so i i'm not great with the book recommendations in terms of coding uh thomas jaeger says why not use context api or redux to set notifications at the global state level won't you be using notification state in any other components actually normally that's a great idea but it turns out that in this project i don't have any other components yet so everything's in app.tsx i just did i decided to leave everything in there just for simplicity um for for the live streaming uh because i i figured instead of trying to click around to different components i put it all in one i normally like to have a lot more components but i thought i'd try it try it like this just to see how it goes um i'm not exactly sure whether i like it or not to be honest with you i am i don't know this this length of component seems a little long to me like i could definitely do it uh but in terms of like ui it is very simple so like i don't think it would make that much sense to split the ui out into its own components at this point because it's so simple but the logic is has gotten quite large so it's possible that i could split out some of the logic into their own files maybe i like to keep like a utils like a utilities folder and you know break up some stuff into there so that's that's a good point like if you do want are going to be sharing state then potentially you would want to use context api or redux to share state if your app was larger and more complex emanuel census says you should erase the set notification false in notification init let's see where that's at erase that you saying that's probably not needed i agree that that's probably not needed i was just thinking if there was some way that i don't know if this is possible that someone who maybe had previously granted permission would somehow not grant permission i don't know uh but you're right like it seems like if they even got to this point then the permission is obviously not denied i don't know what the other states could be is it just denied or granted is there some other state anyway you're right dude this is probably unnecessary when i get the notifications working quincy in the chat says toasty and then he said get it because it's a toast notification i did get it uh did someone ask what language this was uh it is uh it's typescript so it's basically it's javascript and with react native uh and i am using typescript although this is not like fully typed so i'm using typescript very lightly quincy says thanks for sharing your wisdom here with everyone jesse you're welcome thanks thank you so much for the opportunity and for being here in the chat uh no or noel says what can i do with a brain computer uh you could do a lot of cool stuff with it so you know you could do like we're doing with our app and monitor your focus you could help monitor your level of calm like if you're trying to meditate or something try to get your calmness to a certain level you can actually link it up to other actions so on screen actions like clicking a button or something like that or with internet of things you could link it up so if you if you think a certain thing it may turn a light on or off right but it does is very basic but potentially like if you linked it up in certain ways you could do pretty complex things just with your thoughts uh so i'd like to do more with that on like future streams this is kind of like my first idea i do have other ideas of what to do with this so we might get to some of that you know later on um glorious says is there a selenium tutorial on this channel i don't know for sure i don't remember seeing a selenium tutorial but there is a ton of content on this channel so it's entirely possible it's there um dion dimucci asks what hardware will you use for the interface so um i think i explained this already but i'm just gonna throw it out there again this is the neurocity notion headset um there are other brain computer interface headsets that you could get um probably so one that's pretty inexpensive is the muse headset muse i haven't worked with it personally but i've seen other people work with it one that's a bit more complex is uh open i believe it's open bci that one may require you to like 3d print some stuff i believe you can buy a kit to build it without 3d printing it's been a while since i checked on that so there are a few other options but i i'm using the neurocity notion which comes with a very kind of easy to use javascript api i've gotten to the point in the chat where we were kind of going back and forth about the code so i'm trying to skip around and make sure uh or skim through and make sure i don't miss another question that i didn't see already all right we have seen a few questions about what is this app what is the purpose of this app i go over it a little bit at the very beginning of this stream so you could check that out if you want a more indepth explanation of it go all the way back to part one of this series and at the beginning of part one i i think i explained a in depth what this app is all about uh fuad sorry if i mispronounce your name says do you recommend using bootstrap for for layout um bootstrap is nice i prefer material design based frameworks i just i kind of like material design i've done a lot of projects with it so i'm i can implement material design stuff very quickly now since i've had so much practice with it so that's what i like but bootstrap is is certainly a good way to go very popular uh love overflow says why are you using typescript versus something like python or js uh i i use typescript at work so i thought why not use type typescript for this project it'll give me a little bit more practice i don't really know much about python i've done some basic python stuff but that was years ago and so i i'm a javascript developer primarily so that's why i kind of stick with javascript i figure i have a lot more knowledge to share about javascript and typescript than i do about anything else so i might as well stick with that from my live streams i don't have anything against you know any other languages that's just what i'm more talented at kristoff asks if i'm married yes i'm married and i have four kids all right everybody's shouting out where they're from let me go through so we got nigeria germany belgium brazil netherlands uh chile morocco colombia netherlands serbia india brazil morocco asgard nice russia egypt kenya saudi arabia morocco nice we got people from everywhere that is awesome tanmay says i made a brain controlled android game i use the emotive headset oh very cool i i'm not familiar with the emotive headset but that's pretty sweet uh i kind of i'd like to do a game with this as well uh edward wants to know how long it takes to become a good programmer and react uh it's hard to say for sure really that just depends on so many other factors so um i i couldn't say how long it would take any one person because it really depends on their previous experience and how much time they have to dedicate to to learning and practice pseudocrypto says best coding channel i'm gonna assume that's a statement and not a question and say that uh thank you for saying free codecamp is the best coding channel uh curious souls says freecodecamp.org is awesome i agree thank you pseudocrypto asks if anybody is into cryptocurrencies i do have some investments in cryptocurrencies i'm not like all about it uh but i just have a little bit of money in a couple different cryptocurrencies uh him once you ask what browser i'm using it's google chrome okay uh andre romanov mentioned that the homepage name was wrong thank you for that andre i uh i wish i would have seen that because you definitely caught that before i did so shout out for uh for catching my mistake before i did whoa sorry my uh the scroll bar just jumped on me in the live chat i lost my place there we go preach says rmrf which is the command i used uh is the path to getting fired yeah but he added the uh an asterisk after the rf which is basically delete everything recursively yeah don't do that unless for some reason you want to wipe everything off of your your computer says i'm 14 years old how to start learning this skill definitely check out freecodecam.org and start with the free lessons there and that's that should be a great place to start uh pre prefee says does the notion work as expected uh yeah it definitely does work as expected i i when i first tried it out i was surprised at like how accurately it it picked up brain patterns and stuff so i'm very impressed with it abdullah asks what's the right pathway to teach myself coding i'd definitely start out with some free resources so you're in a great place right now the free code camp youtube channel check out the freecodecamp.org lessons and um yeah i would definitely start with some of the free resources first if you decide that there's something you really want to learn and you want to pay for a course or something that's fine but i would you know start out with a free code camp stuff first before you commit you know money money to your learning oh uh rory says can you put a link for the app please yeah i'll link it let me throw this in the chat grab this link i'm gonna throw this in the chat and then i'm also gonna put it in the github repo so if you go to the github repo you'll see it right there where's this at there you go so now if you go to the github repo which the link is in the description you can just click the link and that should take you right to the the demo all right somebody asked a question i i cannot read their name it's in different characters than i'm used to reading it says how to how do you focus on programming for a long time for example during the month or half year what do you usually force do to force yourself well getting paid to program is a good way to force myself to do it like i have a boss i have teammates that'll check up on what i'm doing so that's a good way to force myself you know doing these these coding live streams and coding videos helps as well because i have people that you know they can see how much progress i've made they're expecting me to do the streams and things like that so that helps setting goals does help but yeah i'd say like whenever like whenever i have to code to make money to pay the bills and take care of my family like that's that's a good way to it's a good motivation right i can't i can't not work right i i have to do my work now i do like to code so that's also a good motivation but sometimes even things you like to do you don't want to do all the time right so like i like to work out but i don't like to work out all the time right so um yeah for those times when i don't feel as motivated or coding doesn't seem as fun as it normally does then what does help is just the responsibility of you know people are counting on me my family's counting on me my teammates are counting on me you know my company is counting on me so uh kind of that feeling of responsibility helps as well and if it's just in terms of like feeling like i can do it i to be honest with you i probably drink too much caffeine so that's also another uh another way i get motivated good question though i am skipping over a few questions because there are repeat questions that i've already answered so um apologies if it seems like i'm not answering your question but i have i've had a couple questions that i've answered multiple times so i'm just kind of skipping over uh lock lock raj says is this good for any kind of mobile application i'd say yeah definitely you can use react native for android ios or web and actually other things as well so there's there are ways to use react native to build for instance like smart tv apps i'm showing some of the other stuff i've seen i've seen some weird stuff like building a word document out of react native code but in terms of actual useful things i don't know maybe there is some use case for that but i kind of thought it was just a uh a project just to say like hey look what we can do so yeah but definitely react native i think is a great way to build apps from multiple platforms um so soterios says have you had any other ideas for applications with notion yeah for sure so i've had ideas for like a game i really would love to do a a game for children with to help them learn how to calm themselves down and i think it would be very helpful for children who maybe have uh have issues with like um obsessivecompulsive disorder issues with anger issues with anxiety that way like they can in in some type of like video game type of way that would be very um like they would really get into like something fun that they would want to do but in reality it's teaching them to calm themselves down so the the things in the game are changing based on their brain patterns and success in the game can only be achieved through making their brain show like calm patterns right so that's the high level goal of the game i would like to make i'm not exactly sure the best way to go about that i'm not a game designer right and i'm i'm not like a scientist that studies brainwaves either so i just had had the idea uh and i imagine it's gonna take a lot of trial and error for me to make something useful but that's one of my ideas another idea i have is trying to just link this up with something that can help with like internet of things so some product like if this than that or zapier so i would those would basically open up to somebody who's a noncoder the ability to use the notion headset with a variety of other tools that they would just be able to basically do some like drag and drop coding i guess with those if this and that and tapir so those are my two like main ideas for it i also have like just a few other updates to this app we've been working on that might make it a little bit more useful uh and i mean let's face it to you hi it's not great looking right now so there's some some basic stuff that could probably help all right i've got somebody was like spamming the channel it did get automatically hidden so that's good but i'm trying to make my way through it wow a lot of stuff in there yeah please don't don't try to spam the the channel all right okay a few more people shouting out where they're from someone from amsterdam angola netherlands detroit brazil kenya awesome pakistan more from brazil um have a question how long have you been programming uh i guess it's been a long time now um let me think so been like a couple years at one two five i'm gonna say like eightish years something like that i'm not i don't remember for sure but i'm gonna say around eight years of programming like actually programming for money right like i i messed around with some stuff before that but like really programming like as a job probably around eight years at this point oh my goodness i gotta find i need to just hide this user all right i'm gonna hide one there's a user that kept spamming the channel luckily the messages were getting hidden but it's just making it hard to see the questions on here okay uh umair says which project do you suggest for react js beginner to make them take them to the next level um i don't know for sure uh you probably want to do a project that's a bit more complex that like you need to make api calls maybe do some more advanced state management something that would require like the context api or redux that's probably going to help you get more to the next level just i guess the the complexity of it will will help you kind of think through better like ways of programming and organizing things so in terms of exactly what that would be i don't know um it could be a lot of different types of projects i'm not sure but if it incorporates those like for instance maybe like a message board some sort of forum with the ability to make posts uh the ability to comment on posts things like that that would require require a little bit of thought right so um maybe something like that would be a good place to a good thing to work on but i mean to be honest if you find like open source projects that are react based that may be even better because you'll get exposure to some to react available i'd say you could jump whenever you want just whenever the opportunity arises that you need to build a native app then you jump right into react native uh cash app asks what's the difference between xml and json uh i find json to be cleaner to look at to be honest with you xml has a lot of angle brackets that i don't know i don't really they basically serve the same purpose though it's just a matter of the syntax uh sandu says what's the difference between react js and react native i actually just did a video explaining the difference so if you check the description to this this live stream uh there's a link to my youtube channel in the description click on that and one of the latest videos on that channel is going to be the difference between react and react native so check that out i give some examples and and do more like a thorough answer to that yeah definitely if any of you enjoyed the the live stream and want to see more stuff by me i did a lot of previous live streams on free code camp and then i did some live streams and tutorial videos on my own youtube channel so please you know check it out if you like it like you know subscribe watch some of the videos you know the more the more people that watch and say they get something out of it you know the more videos and streams i'll try to do i really i like doing it but um really like only if people feel like it's useful why keep doing it you know what i'm saying like i i want it i'm not making any money off it or anything but if i'm helping people i want to keep doing it uh lewis wants to know more about the second argument of use effect so yeah the use effect argument so let's see where we're using it so for instance on this use effect the first argument is this whole thing right this function the second one is this array now the array everything we put in this array anytime this updates so these are two pieces of state focus and user are two pieces of state if focus changes or if user changes this is going to run if nothing else if something else changes that's not inside this array this will not run okay so that's what that's that second argument does if we left this empty then it would only run when the app first mounts and it would never run again unless the app unmounted and remounted if we didn't pass in a second argument at all this would run every time anything changed any piece of state that changed if we're using redux like any piece of redux door change this would this would change every single time or it would run every single time that's that's what that second second thing does it may there may be more to it so you know check out the documentation for react but in terms of like my coding experience those are basically like the three cases that come up most often uh dola soul says what's your schedule will you be live tomorrow probably not tomorrow uh i gotta work tomorrow um i would say the soonest that i would live stream again maybe like tuesday at some point i do have to work tuesday but i might be able to squeeze a live stream in we'll just we'll see how it goes uh let's see tung trung says uh excuse me may i ask how do i learn html and css well check out freecodecamp.org the first lessons are all on html and css that's a great place to start beside beyond that practice is just keep practicing look at projects that are they're good see how they do things uh but freecodecam.org is is a way to start uh garvit is asking about how to learn react uh freecodecamp.org actually has react lessons and they're pretty good in fact when i um at work i when i first got hired one of the things that i needed to do was teach my the rest of my team react they didn't really have very much experience with it and one of the first things i did is showed them the free codecamp.org lessons i had them go through all the lessons asked me any questions they had and then after that we would pair program together for a week at a time until i went through everybody on the team and that's how i went about you know getting them more knowledgeable about react so i would definitely check out those lessons thomas yeager says why did you not use redux in this application a lot of your state you used in multiple components redux or context api would have been beneficial here um actually thomas so like i i don't have multiple components i just have one big component for this project so um actually i think you you had asked about this a little bit earlier in the video so uh just kind of reiterate that i normally do use redux or context api when i have a larger application so that is a good call for a larger app ams what certificate is worth the most on uh workforce i don't really know much about what certificates i for what i do i don't need certificates so i don't worry about that if anybody else knows about like computer type certificates you know let us know in the chat kerry says hi just started learning to code wanted to say thanks for taking the time to explain every detail oh you're welcome i'm i try to explain as much as i can so you know but if i missed something feel free to ask a question but thank you for saying that uh charis says hi awesome stream awesome chat by the way ah thank you so much cashyapp says what is the purpose and then quickly followed up with the purpose of xml and json files i'm glad because i was about to go into a big talk about the purpose of life but the purpose of xml and json files usually is some type of configuration so it's just a bunch of key value pairs to let a some type of program know like some information that you wanted to know it's like it's a standard so if you make an api call you're probably going to get back json maybe xml if it's a little older or something like that but it's it's a standard way to provide information to an application all right sorry if that froze things for a second that was weird uh my computer just kind of like uh stalled for a second there but let's see i atendra says can i follow the brain computer app series to learn react native if i only know react um you'll definitely learn about react native i don't know if you'll if it would be like the best tutorial but uh it's you will definitely learn something about react native for sure all right oh that's pretty much it hopefully i got to all the questions and um yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna log off now and uh and finish up the stream and take the rest of the sunday to hang out with my family uh we're probably gonna have uh watch a movie here soon or something so uh thank you all so much for watching uh it was this was cool it was hey we we accomplished what we wanted to accomplish today and i'm definitely going to redo that part two of the stream so look out for that coming up i'll probably do it as a live stream and we'll just kind of go back over what we did in part two that got deleted um beyond that i'm i'm kind of wondering what to stream about next so maybe more of uh more of this project maybe a different project let me know what you think and and what might be beneficial to you um and if you like this you know please subscribe to this channel check out our other videos check out my youtube channel links in the description feel free to reach out to me on social media i'm on twitter i'm on instagram linkedin i'm i'm on like all this stuff so just find me and uh if you send me a question i'll do my best to get back to you as soon as i can so have a great a great week i don't know when the next time i'll stream is uh you know i'll try to stream at some point in the week if i can uh but uh if i don't have a great week and i hope to see y'all next time thanks for watching
