hey everybody its Jessie and welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're gonna go back to project two and we're gonna work on that probably just for today and then we'll go back to the other project I think we can we can finish up with what we need to UM project to today so let me let me just explain just for a minute what we're gonna try to do today and then we'll go through it so SendGrid is what we've been using to send mail so I think I I'm pretty sure that I had some streams at least one stream dedicated solely to setting up send grid and sending mail I I was trying to make the emails a little bit nicer looking so I was gonna add some introductory text and before I sent the the form data through email and I wanted to look up with the send grid with the same grid package like what could I do and as I was looking it up I realized this was completely different than the code that I have and so I went back and looked through the changelog and there were a ton of breaking changes so many breaking changes that they actually just completely changed the name of the package the NPM package and everything so we're going to install a new NPM package that's gonna have the new SendGrid API I put a link to the github repo for this in the description for this video so if you want to read more about it you can go there at some point I'll probably be bringing over onto the screen that you all can see at least part of the documentation let's see I think that's pretty much it for for introduction that that sums up what we're gonna try to do let me bring over I had my live chat kind of buried here hey everybody okay Sebastian was in here and said he's submitted a pull request I did see that but then it looks like he had to go he's gonna go to dinner all right so anyway probably later on during the question answer session I'm gonna go over a few pull requests there were at least at least two pull requests that I want to go over so probably the one that Sebastian just submitted this not emerged yet and then we had another one that I emerged earlier today but I'm gonna wait and go over those at the beginning of the questionandanswer session so probably in about an hour okay let's get started so first thing is let's just install this NPM package so if you're not familiar with how to install things let's start our timer if you're not familiar with how to install things with NPM this will be a good introduction so to do this you you need note installed on your machine and NPM assuming that you have that set up then this would be your next step you find so I'm gonna I'll bring this over to show you you find your NPM package so this is NPM j/s calm normally at least for me what it usually happens is I find what I want to use on github and then they'll have instructions to download it on github it just so happened that the SendGrid the home page for the SendGrid node client repo on github doesn't have the instructions so I had to find it on NPM so either way you can find the package on NPM or usually there's github instructions but anyway you want to look for something like this and we're using your so normally but you know you most people have npm install it if they're using node but optionally you can use yarn they do the same thing so I'm gonna just copy and paste this so we're gonna do yarn add to add the package and this is a new package then the old name was just send grid so of wool will remove the the old package let's paste that in and you see it's going through and it's installing everything okay we get warnings warnings are okay so if you get errors then it didn't work but warnings are are fine okay so we had success so you can notice it actually installs a bunch of different things that are kind of separated out we don't really need to worry about that but it's kind of interesting to know they do make note of it in the documentation at some point I don't remember if it's in here or on github but we'll go over we don't need this anymore and let me show you what happened in our just sit over here so and our pack is JSON we now have our send read package with the version number I so here is our old package here's our new one and we'll go ahead and remove this right now I think it's I think it's yarn remove maybe I'll double check just to be sure I'm pretty sure it's you know yeah okay so we're gonna go yarn remove SendGrid okay and now look we can double check make sure it was removed yep and it's not here it was there and now it's gone okay so now we've we've removed the old version of SendGrid and now we have the new the new one so let's see we'll check out our survey j/s file and see what we need to change now so obviously we're going to need to change let's see probably where we're requiring and how we're requiring this stuff I would imagine that that changed so all the I'm gonna have the documentation up on my other screen and I'll bring it over if I think you know maybe there's something that would be better to see but a lot of this stuff it would probably be hard to read the documentation anyway I'd have to make it really big let's okay yeah so there is gonna be a little bit of a difference so let's go with ya this is gonna be really different now that I look at it okay so let's just let's get right into it also if you're asking questions right now on the live chat I'm glancing at it occasionally but after this 25minute session so my timer here I'll go back and take five minutes and answer some questions and then at the end of the stream I'll answer all the questions so I don't I don't mean to give the impression that I'm annoying the live chat I just have it kind of partitioned out that I switch back and forth so I guess if you wanted to follow along right now I'm just on that SendGrid NPM page and I'm just checking out just the very basic use case to you know import this and then we'll try to adapt what we have to match this new this new way of doing things it's it's really different I think we'll have to change pretty much everything from what we did before and I don't know that I mentioned this before but the the reason I wanted to do this and I switched back from project 3 here not a project to is that I definitely want people who watch who are watching this project to know that there's a new way of doing it since we already did a stream with the old way I kind of felt like I I really should show the newer way because I know there's some people that follow along with these projects and they base some of their projects on that so I almost felt an obligation to to show the update since it changed so much alright so let's bring in oops switch to my code here let's bring this in so you know we're changing the names of our constants so a lots going to have to change and when we bring in our API key it's also different so I actually not sure that we even want to do it up here probably down you know what maybe I'll do it right here after this is kind of messing up my organization now but until I think of a different place to put this here's what I'm gonna do you'll see in a second one I'm talking about so before we actually set the API key here when we were you know making this this constant anyway the rainout like we don't have to that's not the way it's done anymore so okay cool that's the the same name so we can just delete this now let's scroll down to where we're actually using this so the first place that we're using anything with SendGrid is for that suggest a story form so of the two forms that we have this one is by far the simpler of the two so this will be a good place to start so you can see right now what we're doing is you know we're using this helper dot email and helper dot you know other things to kind of build up all the elements that we need and then we're combining them all here in this mail constant and at some point we're finally you know passing this so there's a request let's see where we actually end up there we go finally after we combine all of these we go SJP I and then you know we pass in the request so it's it's different it's a lot different now so now I'm gonna copy and paste over what it's going to look like I I think this way is actually it's pretty simple so we just have one constant now and we're calling it message and then it's an object and then we have all the you know everything that we need right here that seems a lot more readable to me so I think that's a good change and then when we're ready to send that message we used two s gmail dot send and we pass in that message so really really easy now if you notice right there there's no like error coming through so I need to look at the documentation you know as we go go forward to see like shouldn't we have some error handling so but like I said the example that I was using right now was just for like basic how to get it working so there there is a lot more in terms of use cases and the documentation so so this is what I'll be looking at so there's a lot of use cases here the URL is more complicated but you know basically the nodejs SendGrid that's linked in the description package is mail use cases MD that's that's how you get to it if you wanted to follow along so I'm hoping at some point let's go to the kitchen sink example here that way we'll get everything all at once so let's go through this just so that you and I both have kind of an idea of what's possible see I haven't even gone through this yet I didn't get this far in the documentation yet all right so we're good there we're doing all this you know we have we can do to see this is good these are things I definitely wanted to do this is interesting I've never used anything with the SendGrid templates unless sure if I want to look into this right now for this stream but I'm interested in that mmm interesting we can we can add attachments as well we're gonna have to think about this I didn't realize that this was possible you know we already have not for this form but for the next form that we're gonna work on you we are getting you know we're getting files we're sending them but we weren't sending them in the email now it will be possible to send these as an attachment I don't know I'm asked to think about that that might not be a bad thing a bad thing to do it would be almost like another backup you know already saving them and we're sending them to project management system but I mean the email might be nice as well okay I see okay I like this I like that we can use then this is definitely more in line with what we're doing elsewhere throughout in survey j/s but really throughout you know you're using then we're using a lot of arrow functions so I like that but this is good this is what I was hoping that would be in the the kitchen sink example so let's put that in now okay so you have this okay so let's put in for now let's just copy and paste all these values probably will want to change some of these values but I want something that I can you know test out right now so we're gonna copy and paste these and I'm just gonna have it be sent just to myself right now that is gonna change but just I can't believe I just copy and paste at the exact same email address so that's how it is that I'm trying to talk and do this at the same time sometimes I make silly mistakes okay so now we have text where's our text email body actually our email body is HTML so let's put it in the HTML and that is not a string that is a variable okay I'm interested to see if text is necessary I don't think it's a bad idea to have a text version of the email let's check out I wonder if it says anywhere which fields are required interesting yeah this template looks this looks interesting all right you know it for now I I think I'm just gonna put in a message let's see see okay and that'll be alright on the off chance that someone has an email client that doesn't allow HTML which I've actually seen it on campus some people on campus have their email clients set by default to not show any HTML and only show the plain text so in case that happens though at least get a nice message they won't get all the same data but they'll get this message and that should be enough just to reassure because this would go to the user and we'll also have one that goes to our project manager or someone else in my department I'll probably have myself bcc'd on everything as well at least at first to make sure things are going through properly okay so for now I wonder I do want to check to see if this is necessary now or if if we include HTML then it's just automatic but let's let's go back to that example that have everything yeah I don't see an equivalent feeling so let's just give it a shot let's get rid of all of this let's make sure yeah we want to keep that bracket but everything else we can get rid of and we're gonna save that and what do I have I have this open somewhere I don't know where now oh well I'll just open it again so we have this the the localhost port 9000 is the one where the forms actually work so if you're running this locally 3,000 works fine for most things but not for the forms 9000 is what you want for the forms I've already went in and I've I've set my environment variables for sending emails to true by default everything is false so that that way if you if you're kind of playing around with this on your own on your local machine I don't get spammed with emails but this should send the email so you suggest the story that's interesting okay that's why that makes sense I hit enter expecting it to submit but I was in a multi line input so it's good that it didn't submit know what happened all right let's see what the error is let's see if it comes up here oops it looks like I forgot a closing friend well you guys say if it's a singular for parenthesis is it a paren I've heard that before but not very often so I'm not a hundred percent sure on that I should ask my wife she's an English professor so she should know things like that and that was up at the top there we go it was funny when I when I finished this the one this earlier I looked at the end of it and I thought that looks really weird and then I just kept scrolling down I didn't take the time to think about it it's somewhere in my brain it registered that that was wrong I suppose okay now let's give it a shot awesome okay so it says it was successful and I just got a notification on my phone and the email says thank you for your submission actually I want to see this if if this is visible I've never tried to show this before on the screen no it's not it's way too small but anyway I got the email it came through so great so that works now now what we need to do is let's put in some extra options so this is great right now but this is not what we want you know ideally so let's go through and let's do what what we should do and so what I mean by that is we need to actually send two different emails and we can't just have hardcoded email addresses in here we need to take the user email we need to put a proper from email and probably a from name I'm not that worried about it for the email that's gonna go to someone in my department but for the email that goes to the user I want it to look you know as professional as possible right emails that look kind of shady might not get open it might get reported as hey I think somebody's like trying to fish you know or something like that so let's we actually did have that happen before not it wasn't one of my emails but someone else on the department was sending out emails and someone from IT said like hey did you send this because it looks like you know it looks kind of shady so now I'm careful to make sure that my emails look legit all right so let's add we want to add a BCC field so let's do that now I'm gonna BCC me but I don't want my my personal email let's do my work email okay so that's good and we want to do let's take a look at that documentation again great so here's my check my time okay I'm almost up so I'm gonna ask a question and then see what would you all think it's possible to send two completely different emails or I could just send one email and send it to more than one person or BCC more than one person or you know anything so do you think it's better to send two completely different emails or just have the person in my department get the email that the the user would get and just be copied on it or you know blind copied on it which would be the simpler option at this point I at this point there's no reason to show different data to both of those people yeah so anyway let me know what you think that I was thinking I'd like to send two different emails but now that I think about it maybe the simpler approach is better later on I can always switch it up if I find that I do need to send different data so let's see okay cool I already got some answers and it looks like we're there's at least right now some agreement on sending you know just copying on one email yeah after I kind of said it out loud the answer became somewhat obvious to me earlier when I was thinking about it for some reason I thought that I would need two different emails all right let me set my fiveminute timer and I'm gonna scroll up a bit and the live chat and see what what questions you all have no bears no beer says what's up how you doing oh not bad not bad same same stuff same lack of motivation today but I did manage on my lunch break to get a lot of stuff done on my my Redux project so I'm excited about that because I haven't worked on it since Saturday and I was afraid like I'm gonna forget what I was doing and but I didn't I mean it took me a while to get my mind back into things but I was able to work really quickly and get some tasks out of the way faster than I even thought that I would be able to so that was cool hey everybody see like a lot of people saying hi spar wheel says can I ask an off topic question the Q&A yeah definitely yeah don't worry about it questions are good you know any any kind of questions are good I mean coding related questions obviously you know or are allowed but even other offtopic questions I mean if for some reason anybody would ever ask a question that I did not want to answer I would just say that so that's never happened yet but I mean maybe it could happen so the only questions I could think of not wanting to answer would be things that I thought were like not not like pgrated stuff right because we do have like kids watch this you know we've had how young did we have I think somebody was 8 years old watching this at some point we've definitely had somebody who's 11 but so anyway those kind of questions would be the only thing that I could think of that I wouldn't answer if you ask me like you know what's the password in my alarm system on my house I'll probably want to answer that but anyway that's Oh Patrick Patrick caught the closing perennially used parens so that answers my question so it is paren and thanks for catching that Patrick it took me quite a while to realize my mistake hey Sebastian's back I wrote one said that Android Oreo goodness did you notice I'm running Oreo on my phone so yeah I have the pixel XL and I'm on Google Phi so I got the Oreo update like immediately so cool so far I like it it's not really that different but the differences are improvements in my opinion so so far so good on the Android Oreo update okay so John Hanson says the singular form is parentheses so it ends with sis but the plural is parentheses s es okay that's cool I'm wondering where that where that endings from where does the word prevent parentheses come from is that Latin in origin or is that Greek in origin if it's Latin I could probably understand a little bit more why that's the singular and plural I'm not really up as much on my my agent Greek as I am on the Latin okay so Kade says that I should copy on a normal email so just do the CC rohan says BCC yeah oh you'll see what I'll go with I probably should ask I needed to check to see actually on I gotta check the old code for this and see who I'm sending this to now because I I think I know who it's being sent to but I need to double check so I'll make sure I do that I know where the the other forum is going for sure John Hanson says is this server sent email or will it go through an authenticated outbound email SMTP it's it's all being routed so it's not being sent straight from the server it's being routed to send grid so I don't I don't really know what I have set up with and good to be honest with you I'm not I don't mess with the email that much to even know what what different all I know is that sangra does a good job of getting the emails where they need to go right now so I'm sticking with that let's see root Reuven I think that's how you'd say that so Reuben says just joined what's up working on updating the how we're sending emails through SendGrid so the send grid node package got some big updates and breaking changes and we're going to try to send well we've just successfully switched over to it for one of our forms and sent an email so now we're just going to try to add some extra things on some extra options here okay all right cool so I actually did get to the bottom of the live chat and this well I went over the five minutes a bit but not that much over so I'm gonna start up another 25minute session the way things are going now I think we'll probably just do one more 25minute session because I mean we're gonna get at least this forum we'll probably get to the point where it's it's pretty much finished and then the other forum won't be you know won't really be different I'll just copy and paste from this first forum and it should be about the same I don't think I'm gonna mess with sending the files today okay so let's hmm okay for now I'm just gonna BCC my work email because I don't I don't know for sure who's supposed to be getting these emails I'll have to look that up and the current version of this Resource Center also I don't want to put their emails right now I guess I could make them an environment variable so I'll probably end up doing that but I don't want to I don't want to look them up during the stream because that would be boring you always see this while I was on my other screen looking it up so basically let's just assume that I'm going to add some extra emails on here now when I do that I think I need to make them an array yeah so what I need to do assuming I'm gonna be CC and not CC I'll just make an array like that so just in case you're gonna do something similar that's how it needs to be done the reply to let's see off to think about based on who that emails going to off to think about the reply to as well from I thought somewhere that I had seen I guess she can't do that anyway basically like to add something else for the from not just the email okay not bad we might just move on to the other form because I think this is all we need for this one like I said this one's really basic form I do want to check quickly what that email look like in my browser just to make sure it looked all right okay it's not bad it's really really basic so I'll show you it's it's just super basic but that's pretty much what users are getting now it's it's it looks a little bit better than this but it's still it's pretty basic okay I'm okay with that for now like I said later on I think I want to look into the templating thing and see I think it would be a lot easier to set up a template through SendGrid than to try to just piece together HTML and here kind of like what I'm doing now template literals definitely make it a lot easier but it would still probably be better oh that's why I wondered why I didn't get two lines there I forgot to close that tag so anyway template literals make it a lot easier but I think it would still be nicer to not clutter up this already very cluttered server j/s file with a giant amount of HTML okay cool so let's let's grab let's see let's check out our other forum for now see what we have and then see if we could just grab most of this and reuse it so we do have a lot more going on here so we're doing some checking right we have to handle files so all this stuff is for our files and but then at some point we get to the emails that's down here okay so it looks like that's the same this is different our field string should include at some point yeah so it does include the the file names doesn't it no no that's just the the field still okay the filenames will be included already too because because the way we built the the form so okay so it looks like I can basically copy and paste everything we did from up here all we need to do is change this and this and it should be fine yeah so let's do that so far this is easier than than I anticipated which is awesome I'm not sure that I oh no I'm good with this I thought maybe this was left over I mean doublecheck that okay No I'm gonna take all that and I'm gonna copy it up here and we'll just take this subject choose that and then we need field string and I'll probably want to do something like we had done up here so that we're not just putting in the field string we'll have some text at the top so let's get rid of its get rid of all this and let's bring in here we go let's bring this in Qwest and now we can change this back to email body okay and no I just let me check I think I have my environment variables open on my other screen and okay I don't I thought I had the project managers email saved already but I don't but I think that will end up being the email that's here and maybe I'll I'll probably doublecheck as well to see what the from email is currently and try to match that okay not bad well let's test this out make sure we didn't mess anything up so right off the bat no errors in the console so that's good and let's go to our service request form and I can't remember what fields we ended up making required actually before I test this we may as well try to use the user email for the two so let's grab it should be we've made in objects of the fields right okay so we have this constant fields which is an object and then we add the fields and the keys are the names of the field so I'm pretty sure email is just the the name of that field so we should be able to go fields dot email and that'll be the the users email all right so let's test that out and it's gonna end up being the same email okay and I think yeah I think that was required as well okay great do you notice I don't know if you saw that there's a slight flash at first when this happens I think what's happening is we have two different modal's so the first modal that pops up says like sending your process a or something like that it's basically just you know loader then then it comes up with done but there's a slight flash when it when it happens really fast so I think what I'll probably end up doing is make it so that two different modal's don't appear but that the text inside the modal changes that way that'll just be one modal we shouldn't get the flash or at least it shouldn't be as big of a flash because instead of the entire modal changing it will just be the text inside okay so let me check and check my email okay just got the email great okay so it came through that's gonna need cleaned up a bit so let me show you what it looks like this one definitely needs cleaned up more so I don't really want to use her seeing all this so I think it would be better if and now I just realized that why are they I thought that I had put in oh you know what I had I had put in the right ones let me see okay I just didn't build yet so anyway alright so that should be better but it's still gonna be I don't want them to see all these falses so we'll have to make it so that if it is false it doesn't get sent with the email because that's that's not really great to see also I don't like the order of these I think it would be better if it was in a different order so I need to clean that up a little bit again though I'd like to check out what can be done with templates from but I'm probably it's somewhere in the SendGrid dashboard that I'll be creating the templates but the cool thing is it did grab the users email which in this case was me and it sent it to the correct email so that's what we wanted so I want to take that sip what we did there and I mean not really that much I guess I didn't really have to copy copy it but we're gonna put that up here oops I'm gonna save that and I mean actually I don't know that there's that much more that really needs done you know other than the few things that I said we would maybe do let me check the timer and see how much time we have left all right ten minutes let's see sorry oh she's checking the live chat quickly but yeah I kind of think I I'm not gonna try to add a new feature you know within ten minutes I don't think I can the next thing that I would probably want to do is check out those templates and see if that would be an easy solution to clean this up a little bit make it look nicer but there's no way that I can get that done in ten minutes so I think what we'll end up doing is I'm gonna go now take the rest of this time to go over the pool request we've got so you know anytime any of you submit a pull request I definitely want to give you credit for it and bring everybody up to date on you know any changes in the project so I'm gonna do that and then we'll do our question answer to finish out so if you have questions now please put them in the live chat and as I said earlier don't you know know almost no question is really off topic here so don't worry about you know whether or not your question is relevant any questions are fine with me let's see you bring over all right so we did just get a pull request so I am going to open that up if then I'm also going to show you this lady's pull request that I just merged okay and actually I don't think I ever talked about this one to the last two I don't think I talked about all right so these two are related so so we've had so cuckoo Kieran it's that has added I mean I was reading this to double check make sure I get it right okay so added the link so we had a readme for people who want to contribute to the project but they're really new they don't understand get so Sebastian had opened an issue and suggested that we put in information about how to use git and github so we had some information in there but now we have a lot so with these two pull requests they have a lot of info so I added some suggestions Sebastian added some suggestions so between the three of us we've got quite a few resources so I can show you now we have a lot of good resources for beginners on you know how to fork the project and just general get help so I know I have done this course that was good and I did this course on Udacity as well so I personally can recommend those two courses the Udacity course was I found was really thorough and it had some other beneficial things like teaching you how to get different colors and you're in your command line which not necessary but kind of cool so anyway so thanks for that and if there's anybody that's kind of new to get you know check that out and you know if you go through some of these you definitely you know what's going on when it comes to get and and this other pull request we just got right before I started this dream so I wanted to go over this and talk about this because I think there's a really good observation about the UI and a good pool request but I did want to ask you out what you thought so I really like the idea but I think I want to implement it in a slightly different way so let me show you what what I'm talking about I'll go to this one so on the logos so right now there's no indication of where where we're at I guess I should have went to this one so that we could actually see the logos so anyway there's no indication of which one you're you're on currently and you know Sebastian saw this and said yeah we definitely need that and I completely agree so Sebastian I think it just changed the font weight of it which definitely works and I'll I'll probably just pull that in and use that but at some point I think what I'd like to do is make these change how these are right now and make them tabs like material design tabs I don't know why I didn't do that right off the bat but I think the way this is you know currently I think it really makes sense to be tabs you know we have it one across the top here and let me show you what I mean by tabs I'm gonna go on materialized normally I go right to the documentation for material design Google's documentation but this way I think will be a little bit more interactive we can see with the with the tabs are here JavaScript yeah tabs okay so you can see like the tabs we'll go across the top and basically the indicator would be this little underlined let me see if they have any other example so the indicator would be a little underlined and then it would you know flip around you know based on that so I'm thinking that would be the best way to go now we aren't we aren't using materialized for the tabs right we're using material UI so I probably should check the terior UI and see how how its implemented there okay so here we go same same thing you click the tag or the tab and you get the underline so that's what I'm thinking that will end up will end up doing that I'm not I'm not really worried about it but since we're going with the material design thing I think that would be the more consistent way to handle that I'm trying to find it again I keep flipping around everywhere so I think that would be a more consistent way to handle that to use the tabs and then we would still though once it got small go to something like this so the the only thing that I'm you know kind of slightly not sure about is I vaguely remember something about the tabs like you shouldn't have a million tabs with material design so this is quite a lot of tabs so I don't know so that might be I'm not I'm not worried about going against material design specs if we need to for this use case and I think it would be fine I think it'd be okay to drop drop down to this like we have here which oh man I never fixed that maybe did I fix it I did I just okay so this this version is a bit out of date so I did fix it I thought I fixed it okay so anyway that's the that's the pool request so thank you Sebastian like I said I'll probably pull that in because I think it's important to have but longerterm I'm thinking that maybe I would want to change that to tabs so I don't know if anybody really wants to try that out you know feel free that would be awesome I don't know how soon I'll get to it I don't think that's something that I really need before we launch so I'd really rather work on project three as much as I possibly can because then I have to switch projects again in October I just kind of want to get this one done and launch it and then I can always come back and change things when I get a chance later on alright so that's that's the end of that FOMA Torres session so it's good timing and now I will go back to the live chat and I'm gonna answer all the questions in the live chat unless for some reason we get lots and lots of questions but should be able to get to everything it doesn't look to look like there's too many questions right now so if you if you can't stick around for the question/answer session then thanks for watching and I'll be back tomorrow so hopefully you can come back and catch the live stream again but if you have a few extra minutes and can stick around even if you don't have a question I'd really appreciate if you could help answer questions in the live chat your expertise is definitely a big benefit to everybody I think that that watches the stream and to me as well so let me find where stuff okay so here's a good comment so Rohan is talking about emails and said I tried setting up my own email as experiment and says it looks so simple in theory but with modern addons you will miss something it's better to just use something like SendGrid i mean that's basically what i the conclusion that I came to as well and why I was using SendGrid initially I had so there were several reasons that went into my choice for SendGrid but that was one of the reasons so I won't say that it's the only reason I used it but yeah but that's definitely you know if you really want to get into you know how to send emails and things is something you're interested in then I it would certainly be you know beneficial to you to try to do it you know from scratch on your own but if that's not something that really interests you then you know using something like SendGrid is the best way to go in my opinion John Hanson says so jonad asked earlier about what I was using so if it was a server if the email sent from the server is SMTP I think I got that right that I mix up that acronym yeah SMTP that's right so John says that's a prayer type answer to the email sending protocol I've used PHP mailer and even then I was shocked at how controlled email security and spam detection effects form submitted email yeah I I said I I haven't had any issues with SendGrid so far so we've been using it for a year over a year with this so I think in this particular case I'll be I'll be fine if the audience wasn't in turn so I mean right now I know the audience and I know what has words if the audience was external I might put a lot more thought into and do more testing for this John Hanson also said if SendGrid has some type of nicely formatted email template I'd go for that too yeah I think I mean I want to check it out and see see how easy it is to use and what it looks like but I mean right now my emails look pretty basic so it would be it would be nice if they look better Sebastian says tabs are a good idea so on this logo page but how will they work on small screens okay Sebastian I'm sorry I didn't so Sebastian says there's a bit more to the pool request and I just I didn't check it out so I'm sorry I didn't check this pull request like I said it came in right before the stream started so I'm sorry Sebastian so let's see point two oh okay so I mean obviously you all can read but in case somebody's just listening and can't see the and it's not actually looking at the video Sebastian also removed the the a tags that were inside the allies for all the the tabs that we have now basically what it was doing because they were a tags it was changing the hash in the URL and you're saying that's kind of annoying also unnecessary it's not like we're grabbing that and doing anything with it like automatically bringing you to that category so I agree that that was definitely a good move so now there's no a tags it's just a lies you know the Allies are the ones that have the the on click handler anyway so yeah so sorry I missed that again and thank you for that okay so che asks what are some other favorite design guides / languages besides material design trying to think what is so Microsoft has their design what do they call it I cannot remember what Microsoft's they're basically their latest design thing is what they use for like office 365 and I'm sorry I can't remember so like basically Microsoft has their version of design Sebastian says fluent or something that yeah I can't I can't remember and then Apple has their version so with iOS what do they call it now I can't remember I just I just heard this I was just watching a video earlier on react native and and they mentioned in the video what the name of the design is for iOS Wow I I'm doing a terrible job answering this question so although I can't remember the names of it okay cool so chases Microsoft is fluent so Apple Google and Microsoft all have their own distinct design languages fluent for Microsoft interior design for Google and something that I can't remember for for now that's it okay human I knew it was interface something so Apple is called human interface Thank You Shea okay so in terms of like your big tech companies those are your design things but then there's also like I mean there's bootstrap right so bootstrap is I don't think it when you think of design if it would come up that like all bootstraps are design philosophy like in the same way that material design is but if you look at the web bootstrap is influenced design a lot right you can you can't always tell if someone use bootstrap because you can certainly cost a lot and it won't look like bootstrap but there are a lot of sites out there that are just basic bootstrap you go to the site and you don't even have to check you know they use bootstrap for that all right it's just used so so many places so just for the influence alone I would definitely say that it's it should be lumped in with some of the big design things now there was so there is design that it's falling out of favor now but I think it's called skeuomorphic design it's spelled really it's like sk ii you mor ph i see something like that so but it's um from what i understand at least and i'm not i don't think i'm at all an expert in design but from what I understand it was more like you take like realworld things and have them in the design so I guess an example would be I don't know if anybody remembers the old music player for windows that when amp and you can get different skins for when amp and some of them actually looked like a stereo like a reallife stereo with buttons you know and switches and stuff and you could press them like I said from my understanding of skeuomorphic design that would be an example that the interface actually looks like what the equivalent thing would look like in real life so someone please correct me if I'm getting that wrong but I think that's it so I also Sebastian mentions foundation so foundation is basically does the same thing as bootstrap and that's also that's also been influential so I don't know the statistics offhand I'm pretty sure that bootstrap is used on more sites right now but I hear a lot of good things about foundation I've looked through through their Docs remember if I ever used it on a project certainly not on any you know projects for clients or anything I may have used it just on some some side projects though okay so anyway Shay I hope I answered your question somewhat sorry I can't like I said I'm just not I'm not that wellversed and all the different you know design philosophies for for web design okay good so Shay says you're right about secure morphic Apple was also really into it for a while think the notes up yeah actually I was I was thinking that too the Notes app is a great example because it looks like a actual piece of paper like notepad paper so yeah I'm actually um I think ASCII morphic design is interesting and cool to look at sometimes but I'm I'm not a fan of it for actual like ease of use so I'm kind of glad that we got away from that I think for its I don't know my view on website design is like the sites that win like the design awards so what is it like the aaww I can't remember what it what the website is called but the sites that we design awards aren't always the most userfriendly sites sometimes you go to these sites and you have no idea how to navigate or what's going on but it looks really cool so I to me scheme Orphic design fits more into that category in terms of sometimes it can look really cool but it's not necessarily the most userfriendly right like to go back to the old winamp example I'm pretty sure like there were some elements in the UI of some of those skins that looks cool and it looked like a real stereo or something but it didn't actually do anything when you clicked it right so there there are elements like that now could you do it so that that didn't happen I'm sure you could but then would it look less realistic I don't know so now on the other side of things I think like material design is probably not gonna win any Design Awards like you you're I don't know that I've ever seen a sight when a design award and I'm talking about let me just bring the site up so that we all know we're talking about also let me know if there's anybody mine that I have the live set up on the screen because I mean I guess your name would be on on the video I know I already say your names but let me know I just brought it over to this screen because this screen has the camera on it right now and I just wanted to be kind of looking more at the camera instead of to the side so let me bring this up there we go yeah aw it's a few words so let me show I was trying to go to the home page we can see so this is what I'm talking about I'm talking about awards is mostly this is what I go to to see like you know whit's which sites so I'm sure there are other other awards but this tends to have like some really out there designs and things so like I said so I don't think you're ever gonna find just a straightup bythebook material design site on here but a material design site seems to be really user friendly so so my take on on design it's somewhat just depends on what you're going for with that that particular site and it would depend I mean if it's for a client you know if your clients a fashion designer I think you could get away with doing something that's really more like artistic even if it's less user friendly because the goal of a site like that might not be like hey we want a bunch of users here to be able to do something in particular the goal is we want to make an impression we make an impact right so it just it just depends you know on what you're going for and sometimes it's hard to keep that in mind I know like with project one which was the catechetical Institute website it was definitely a struggle there were some people involved in the project that I think they had in their minds that they really wanted this to make an impact they wanted it to be like visually stunning which is awesome but you know I just kept asking well like what is the point of this site what do you want people to do what do you know what do you want to get from this site so eventually I think we've reached a nice compromise where we had some elements that were there that were somewhat striking you know visually but we were able to work in a lot of very functional things so I you know that's I think it's kind of it's always a struggle depending on who you're working with as to where you go you know in terms of design let's see if some more things okay John Hanson says flat design started in 2012 not so long ago so yeah yeah there's definitely forgotten about that but there's the the flat design oh cool so Sebastian likes to chat on the screen awesome let me let me scroll up a bit because I think I skipped over some things okay so let me go said dead zombie says I just got into frontend development and I'm trying to learn a responsive design is bootstrap a good starting point or what's your opinion where should I start from let's see yeah I mean bootstrap is bootstrap is good I guess it it kind of depends too on what you what you want to do like if you I guess you're saying front end it's a friend development sponsor design yeah so I would say you can focus a lot on CSS and get really good at making these custom layouts and things or there's a lot of people to focus on javascript and they do a lot with javascript and don't worry so much about the customs layouts and they're happy to just use some premade system I've that's kind of where I'm at I do enjoy customizing things with CSS but I I rely you know I kind of fall back on either materialized or material UI you know so and I fall back on the material design guidelines so I guess it's kind of what you want if your goal is to be able to like make things from scratch in CSS and get really good at CSS then maybe you don't want to use bootstrap right away if your goal is just to start making websites and you know build up and get better with JavaScript and yeah definitely use bootstrap because it's going to take care of a lot of little detail things that could slow you up and would be unnecessary if you're not really trying to get your deep into CSS so I mean there's no I I don't think there's any problem at all with was starting out using bootstrap so even like in the free code camp courses or you know there exercises it starts out I mean you do some basic CSS but it really starts out with bootstrap and and allows you to use bootstrap for some of those projects so I think it's a good way to just move forward and get some confidence using sites and and then even beyond that you know if that works and you're making sites you're making good sites that people can use and get things done and your clients are happy with I don't really see a problem in using bootstrap and and never going on anything else if that's not really what you're into and then again as well you don't have to go with bootstrap certainly you could go with foundation you could go with materialized you could go with trying to things with some of the other one there are some that are lighter lighter frameworks so you don't want it's not like you have to go with a framework or nothing you can kind of go in between so there's some really lightweight frameworks that just will give you like you know some barebones things maybe like some column classes and and then you take care of a lot of the rest so you could compromise with that so that a lot of them or I don't know kind of mundane things are taken care of and then you add on top of that some of the more like creative visual elements so anyway so I mean I know you have a lot of choices sometimes it makes it harder to choose with more choices but you know at first like choose a system that you like how it looks because you want to like what you're building so if you really like how bootstrap looks then go with that otherwise you know find something that you really like Sebastian says I used to love when amp old times yeah for sure when F was awesome back in the day with all the custom skins you can have those those really cool gah Nitish says I I feel front end is hard but I enjoy developing backend stuff what should I learn to become a decent web developer if you like backend stuff and you want to learn some frontend so essentially like you're gonna be in full static right so if you like that the idea of being able to do everything and you like backend now when you go into frontend I recommend like using things like a CSS framework like we just talked about bootstrap materialized foundation something like that or even something like react with material UI so that a lot of the HTML CSS stuff is taken care of for you you can you know learn some JavaScript so that you can make things work but you know realistically when you're dealing with something like react and if you use a component library you're not writing very much HTML at all or CSS instead you're thinking about the logic of it of state management and things like that which I think may be easier to go into because you know you're still using a programming language instead of like HTML or CSS so that might be a way to build out things on the frontend without having to worry too much about design and and essentially you you would be able to build complete complete apps you know front and back so if at some point it starts to get easier for you and you find you like it you can dig deeper in the frontend but until then you know I would I definitely recommend going with something that's that's built out as much as possible already like so something like you know create react app with a UI frame work you know already there and you just put the pieces together pop in some data you have an app right you won't be able to customise it too much if you don't really want to get into that but at least you'll have something that's functional I think that's important once you have some function you can always mess with it and you know adapt it as your skills get better see okay so in response to what we were talking about earlier two dead zombies question the dead zombie says never try to framework before use a lot of custom CSS for my school projects also yeah I'm learning through a free code cam thanks for your opinion you're welcome no problem hopefully it's helpful to you okay so so GS nity says well if I want to be a just a backend guy what should I start with which would be easier if I'm completely new to web dev okay so you're saying you want to be in web development but you're not worried about frontend now what if you just wanted to do back in I don't know I mean I'm probably not the best person to answer this question because I am I'm more of a frontend person but in terms of backend like you know date just the basics of databases you know either you know sequel or no sequel it doesn't really matter you know learn how to interact with a database build api's so I would I mean for sure you REST API is right everybody uses those but I would even check out something like graph QL that seems to be like the new thing that in my opinion graph QL seems superior to REST API and I'm I'm excited for the day whenever you know most of the REST API czar instead graph QL API but yeah I would so I think what other backend things yeah I mean I would definitely at least learn some JavaScript so it's not going to be as foreign to you as HTML and CSS would be you don't need to go fullon JavaScript if you're just gonna stick with backend but you know that would help bridge the gap a bit so you can understand like what you know some of what's going on client side and then if you wanted to handle some things in nodejs on the backend you know you could you could pick that up but you know PHP is still really popular back and language for for the web so I mean you have things like WordPress which is built in PHP Drupal you know those are your big PHP ones what else I'm pretty sure Jun loves PHP C I mean you have those and then you also have the whole realm of like you know dotnet stuff right so if you're familiar with C++ it might not be that big of a jump to get into csharp you know get into some dotnet framework things so any I mean you have a lot of options really at this point I think your best bet would be to read up on some of your different language options so for backend you know php.net framework nodejs read them up on them maybe do some like basic tutorial things on them just to get a feel for it and then you know if you have up at that point if you really like one over the other then go for that my other advice in this kind of thing is always if you have a certain company you would love to work for or a few companies find out what stack they use and learn that right because if you have no idea how to use their stack or whatever language they're using the odds of you getting a job there are probably pretty low so if you let's say you don't really care what language you use but you do care about you know where you work then that's another you know another way to go about it anyway hopefully that that helps you out a little bit it can be really tough at the beginning when you're when you're trying to figure out what do I learn once you start to get an idea for what you really like and can start to specialize I think that's when it gets really fun it's tough because once you specialize in one thing you're saying no to everything else but then you start to really feel like you know what you're doing and that you're building cool things at least that's been my experience okay Sebastian says I have Windows 10 with their fluent design and as many things borrowed from material design yeah I agree I don't use Windows 10 often but I have been checking out office 365 so recently well I get within the last year I was on a committee to choose between switching over or my university to office 365 or G suite so we had to test out both systems and I thought the same thing I thought that Microsoft designed definitely at times felt a little bit like material design which was cool I they said I really think diversity of design is great for making really awesome things that look nice but uniformity is great for user experience so I'm not against it John Henson says bootstrap is a great way to understand the first steps into the whole NPM and node setup and using an editor the documentation is amazing for it no beer recommends even if you want to just be a backend developer you should probably know a little bit of HTML CSS and JavaScript so yeah yeah I mean that's I think that's good advice and really HTML and CSS are not they're not that hard to learn and I always shy away from saying oh it's easy because everything seems easy once you've been doing it for years right but in this case I really do believe that in terms of every you know the the entire computer science realm right if we want to talk about which things are hard to learn which things are easy HTML CSS are definitely on the easy side of things to learn so if you've been able to comprehend other concepts like in C++ and Java if you just took some time and really worked on CSS and HTML just to get some basic understanding I think you'll be fine john hanson still has winamp installed and uses it that's awesome I didn't even realize when amp was like still still a thing that's really cool yeah I actually I use Spotify all the time now so I don't have any like any player any media player that I use other than that let's see Sumanth s kindly suggest me a few important interview questions where node is used as a back end hmm so basically what questions should a backend developer prepare for would be my question I don't really know that I that I would know that especially if you wanted to be a backend developer I mean I guess if you wanted to be a frontend developer and they just wanted to know like do you know some basic stuff I don't know maybe I'd be more helpful there yeah I don't know I don't want to try to guess and give you silly questions so I'm not going to pretend like I'm qualified for that but I will say there are definitely some resources out there so I mean I don't want to just give you the answer you would but really recently I was involved in an interview process for a web developer and I googled a lot of questions to ask during the interviews and there's there's a lot out there a lot of good stuff out there so I don't think it'll be very hard for you to find some questions should I think Stack Overflow jobs I think has some resources where they they have on their blog or something like that they have interview questions for different types of developers so I would check there I know there are lists on github of interview questions just off the top of my head those are two resources that that I had used and and we actually took some of those questions and use them for the for the interviews that zombie says yeah I love watching your streams awesome I appreciate that let me say I just got a slack message I want to check and make sure it's nothing I need to handle right now all right yeah nothing it's I don't know about you all but it for me for my department slack is I would say like I don't know 70% used maybe 75% used for just kind of casual talking and joking and 25% for actual workrelated stuff so but I still like to check if I get something that might be important let's see Mandela effect conference ass is laravel good or not honestly I I have no knowledge at all of laravel so hopefully somebody in the live chat knows let's see Oh actually shinobi er says larva is a popular one and a powerful one of the PHP frameworks nowadays that's it okay now that you say that I did know that it was associated with PHP so but that's about the extent of my knowledge no beer asked what's the software you're using for live video on YouTube Sebastian said OBS yeah it's it's OBS so actually oh man I'm sorry I forgot I just put this on the screen and it's probably like yeah it is I can't believe I didn't notice that let me flip this over I just wanted to make sure that the camera was like basically centered on me I was worried I was out of the frame so anyway sorry about that GS the T says what what is dotnet and if it how is it different from no jazz okay so I'm just going to read off some of the answers to that because I think there's already some good answers in here Mandela effect conference says dotnet asp.net csharp are all Microsoft stuff access there's a bootcamp in Ohio for csharp yes so GSN to teach I have select my last two streams any of my streams that are from like it says Project three I'm using dotnet stuff so basically it's just another kind of way of building backends for for a website so I don't know if you're familiar at all with WordPress but WordPress uses PHP to put together little snippets of HTML and make these basically templates for pages that grab the data from a database insert it into these templates put it all together and then send to the client to the you know to the browser from the server HTML right so with dotnet you're using csharp and asp.net to do the same thing to piece together pieces of HTML that then get populated with data from a database right so it's that's all it does right and so it I guess it's just what it comes down to they all do the same thing right so most of your your back in web languages we're doing to do the same thing right it's it's all just piecing together HTML and combining it with data so it's just a matter of what language do you like like I said what language do you like working with or what language does the company use that you really want to work Blake asks what is the general consensus on Ruby Ruby on Rails I don't know I've never used it from what I've heard though I've heard it's it's simply simple to learn and use but I can't verify that personally that's just what what I've heard from articles people on YouTube akshay says where can we get the Microsoft patches for Windows 10.1 I don't really know like I said so I don't hopefully somebody in the live chat can give a better answer here but I don't like I said I rarely use Windows 10 so I'm not really up on when the when the updates are coming out okay so rich Rishabh says I work as fullstack developer with meteor and react native oh that's cool I've seen some demos with meteor and it seems it seems really cool I want to learn more about it shroo John says hi I have created my own portfolio website on github pages using bootstrap and there's some Python a JavaScript I wish to make augmented reality apps that's really cool that's that's cool too I think that's a really cool area to get into you know cuz it's just it's so new it's awesome to be part of something that's new and changing so fast but true John asks what can I learn next I don't really know I mean with augmented reality like I'm I'm not sure it seems these days there's a way to do everything with JavaScript so I'm sure she'd learn more JavaScript there's probably some library out there that lets you do augmented reality with it I just am not familiar with it right now other than that I don't really know does anyone know what's what's the commonly used thing for augmented reality right now I'm just I really haven't even checked into it so sorry I can't be more more more help to you I'm just not really I think it's really cool what I'm excited about more augmented reality stuff but I don't really have very much knowledge about what's being used right now for it okay Umberto's says Visual Studio has hololens development stuff if you don't like mine learning dotnet okay cool that that makes sense you know hololens being Microsoft's products see sumon says you are so wonderful that you take time to read everyone's comments I'm watching all your live streams just for this Oh awesome that's cool I appreciate that sometimes I worry because occasionally I get comments from people that say like you talk too much and they I mean that's that's fine I I don't deny that I talk a lot sometimes I go off on tangents but sometimes I wonder like should should I have more coding and not do so much question answer stuff at the end but it's good to know that that you like the questionandanswer stuff so that's what I think I think there's a few unique things about this stream and one of the unique things I think is the the live chat the interaction the questionandanswer stuff I mean I'm not saying the only person that does it certainly I haven't watched everybody else's streams to know but I I think it's kind of a cool feature okay Umberto also says Google has a our core for augmented reality iPhone has a art kit okay cool this is cool info okay and Umberto's said that he did just hear about a javascript framework for AR meaning augmented reality but can't remember what it is okay cool I mean there's like I said there's got to be something for jobs I just read an article yesterday about doing machine learning with JavaScript it was actually like a mess in the comments though there are people saying you definitely shouldn't do it something about the way that math is done in JavaScript but anyway I had to quit reading it because I was realized like hey this has nothing to do with anything I'm working on so it's probably a waste but anyway it does just seems like you can do everything in JavaScript these days oh cool Americo says a rjs that makes sense and that's easy to remember awesome on bears up Oh shrew John says Google's a our core is limited to only pixels and si oh wow that's cool so I have a pixel maybe I should check it out since I can since I can develop with that no beer says yeah you talk too much but I like it ha ha all right that's cool I'm one of those people that I'm really quiet at first but once I get started up I talk a lot alright there sometimes I'm in meetings and I say nothing like literally literally I was in a meeting a few days ago and one of my bosses said are you gonna say anything at the end and I just shook my head I had enough I felt like I had nothing valuable to add to the conversation so I just I wasn't going to talk but anyway okay so Regan asks is it possible to learn to only learn a JavaScript library without learning JavaScript itself I would I would give it a qualified yes and the qualification would be you would certainly have to learn some JavaScript to be able to use the library you could probably get away with only learning a certain amount of JavaScript and not let's say mastering everything and then as to whether or not that's advisable I don't I don't know I mean you could probably build some things like that but at some point you would if you want to get better and be able to really customize and do things with that framework outside just the very normal scope of it you probably wouldn't want to learn more JavaScript so I don't know hopefully that's an okay answer dead zombie says considering that javascript library is based on JavaScript I think you do need to learn JavaScript before you try learning libraries yeah yeah so yeah I think I'm kind of the same way right like if I were to if you were to ask me what I thought was the best way to learn everything then I would say yeah try to learn JavaScript and then get into a library instead of the other way around but if the question is is it possible to learn a library without learning JavaScript yeah yeah and and by not learning JavaScript I mean not learning a lot of JavaScript you definitely do need some Blake says I like the comments I'm the same way not talking talking cool cool you understand Mandela effect conference says start with HTML CSS jQuery then go to vanilla JavaScript yeah actually that's a common thing really now that I think about it so I guess if you want to talk about you know is a JavaScript library a lot of people who do start with jQuery and it helps them to you know manipulate the Dom and do some cool things without getting into the JavaScript so I'm not sure how I feel about that that's how I started out but it's it's hard to switch it it is really hard to force yourself to learn how to do it in vanilla JavaScript because the jQuery Way is often so much easier so I don't know I mean jQuery allowed me to get a lot of cool stuff done and you know make money building websites so I don't I don't regret that but I do think I probably would have gotten better at JavaScript faster if I had forced myself not to use it but I wasn't really in a position to be picky about things you know I had I had to pay the bills I had to feed my kids and I had to take on clients that needed work done so I mean I just I need to get it done and jQuery can certainly help you do that but if you did have the luxury of being able to you know try to learn things exactly in the way you want to you know however you want to learn them then I don't know that I would have done jQuery first okay I'm pretty sure I got all the questions in I'm just gonna glance quickly here at the end of the live chat okay Umberto had a useful comment here in terms of us we're talking about Google's AR core only working with with a limited amount of funds here Umberto's says they are working on making it available for all their devices it'll just be a more lightweight version since they won't necessarily have the optimized hardware okay cool that's good to know yeah I really want to get into some of that stuff augmented reality stuff seems really cool maybe I can find some way to get into it as a project for work that would be pretty awesome otherwise I don't know that I'll have that much time as a side project but okay Blake said did you talk about the Ruby on Rails I didn't catch that yeah you know what I remember saying something about it but I don't think we I went on to read anything else about Ruby on Rails I think the only thing I said about it was that I thought it was supposed to be pretty simple to pick up and learn how to use okay and now I can trying to look back up in the chat for things on Ruby on Rails so I'm not seeing anything right now okay Mandela effect conference did say something similar to Ruby on Rails might be a PHP framework Ruby language I don't know what is similar that is actually used crystal language is similar to Ruby but is not used okay so I think that's all I found on Ruby as far as I know Ruby on Rails was like gained a lot of profit popularity out only years ago I don't remember about how many years ago but it seems like it's lost some popularity right around the same time that nodejs is kind of gained popularity oh that's just my observation I don't really have numbers you know on hand to back that up but I just don't hear rails talked about quite as much as I used to okay okay sorry so Blake repeated said that said my question was what is the general consensus on Ruby on Rails okay all right so I mean what I just said basically is pretty much my opinion on Rails just like you can certainly still use rails to build stuff it works and people still use it but if you had to ask me like if if you want to position yourself to have great like job skills that are in demand it just does seem like it seems like it's just losing popularity right so PHP to be honest with you because of how popular WordPress is I think PHP is still really valid to know node has really grown and continues to grow especially like with Reax popularity you know a lot of reacts although you don't necessarily need node need to use known as a backend it seems like a lot of the time node is the back end so for me at least I'm focusing on learning more node stuff for backend I learned the I use other stuff when I have to for like a legacy project but I don't know that I would recommend unless someone had a really good reason for wanting to learn rails I don't know that I would recommend it as you know being like the best career move that they could make but once again I'm gonna say like if you happen to really like it go with it if you know the company really like uses it go with it but just in general I don't know that I would recommend it but I never used it so take that into consideration with my answer as well let's see Reagan asked between PHP and Python which language is the best for you know bear says PHP is best I think it depends on what you want to do if you're talking about web development deal with PHP if you're talking about machine learning go with Python data science I will go with Python and that's just based on what the most popular languages are for those things I've rarely ever hear of people using Python in regard to web development but PHP is all over the place and even things like like all your shared hosting environments you know are running PHP stuff all the time it seems like I don't know that I've ever tried to run Python on them so maybe they run Python I don't I just don't know but I do know at least right now from what I've read for things like data science and machine learning Python is the the number one language being used Mandela effect conference says rails is on the decline in the US Europe and US says Europe and Australia might be better but not sure okay so that seems to be the consensus that rails are still used but it is you know declining at least in the u.s. okay rich rich Hobbs says is is happy jsh api je s better a better alternative to meteor for rest services I don't really know I've I probably know more about meteor than I know about happy so but but really it's it's very limited it's limited to seeing other people do stuff with it so I don't know that I can really answer that so sorry I just don't have enough experience with it to give you a good answer Bert Burke so BER ke so sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong let me know if I'm if I am I'll pronounce it right so Berg says hi when when is react going to be available in free code camp I don't know so it seems like the the answer that Quincy always gives is soon basically the answer is when it's when we're confident that it's ready it will be it will be released and I actually don't have anything to do with developing that so I really I don't have any more information than you all have with that so there are a lot of other people volunteering to to make that work and it github so you can check check out github and just see like how many pull requests are there in bugs and things and if you really you know kind of want to dig deeper and find out where you know where that projects at or even help I'm sure that would it would appreciate any help that you could give see timo says I personally feel like it will take a while before the beta which will include react is ready yeah honestly I have no idea it's been a long time since I even checked out the beta I know it's been a long time in development but I don't know it's still hard to me like I said I'm not involved in it but I would imagine it's got to be hard to try to come up with a curriculum for web development because it changes so fast you know if you take too long to develop it the stuff you did at the beginning is probably already outdated so that's I mean that's a challenging thing so I mean I appreciate everybody working on that because it's got to be tough okay Timo says there are a lot of issues to resolve before it's usable okay so it may be a while I don't know but I'm like that I'm sure if there are more people that are helping out with things it could be ready so I would you know if if you have any time at all to to volunteer to help with that check it out you know check out some of the some of the issues see if you can solve some of them and see Rishabh says for awhile we can use Codecademy introduction to react yeah I've done their intro to react I don't know they may have updated it from when I did it but when I did it it was it wasn't bad it helped I hope I learned some of the basic stuff didn't really make me an expert but it got me through some of the basic stuff which was nice especially if you don't want to have to deal with a lot of the setup to run on your local machine it's it's good to be able to do some in browser stuff alright another question Regan s can we call web developer a software engineer I don't I don't know I wouldn't personally would there be some justification for that I don't I don't really know I know there's like heated debate about terms of which you can call different developers and engineers and things like that so I'm not gonna I don't really need to feel like I don't have enough information to weigh in on that question to be honest with you when it comes to titles in this industry it seems almost like whatever you like whatever job you can convince somebody that you can do like that's your title because some of these titles are just like I just I feel like sometimes they don't really mean that much because it's such a broad range of things right I mean we're in an industry where people have titles like JavaScript ninja right I mean or like PHP wizard I mean you know it's like I don't really know what makes somebody an engineer as opposed to a programmer or a developer if there's some resource out there that clearly defines those terms for our industry then you know that'd be great but I don't know about it so I'm a like I said I would not call myself an engineer but I wouldn't be a poet if somebody offered a job calling me a frontend engineer I'll take it that sounds like a cool title if somebody wanted to hire me to do frontend work but my title would be software engineer I'll I would take it I mean I I would think it would be weird you know but I wouldn't be like totally opposed to it let's see okay Timo says I'm a core team member for the free code can't beta curriculum so we can definitely use the help of more active contributors Oh awesome cool so Timo thanks for for your contributions and being a core team member that's awesome and thanks for the info no beer says no to the question of web developers being called a software engineer Timo says I believe in Texas a fouryear degree is required to have the title of engineer uhhuh I had never even considered that so I guess in some places the title engineer is I guess legally may be reserved to certain degrees that's really interesting rish up says I've been working on react Redux in graph QL so it's always good to do something new that's cool I'll probably right now I'm working on react to Redux I really do want to learn more about graph QL so I'll be following the same path there Mandela effect as most engineering degrees five years I don't really know I'm pretty sure you can do four year engineering degrees I'm trying to think I do know somebody that got their engineering degree I'm just trying to remember when they graduated I'm pretty sure they did it in four years but I'm not positive I mean it's always possible that they took a bunch of summer classes and it should have been a five year degree and they just did it before I don't I don't know okay well I'm to the end of the live chat here and this stream has gone on for quite a while now so I can feel my throat starting to go too so I don't want to completely lose my voice so now is a great time to to wrap things up so thanks so much everyone for for watching and let's see looks like there's some more questions what question come in coming in so I'm gonna leave I'm gonna because we seem to get a neverending stream of questions so if I don't get your question if you're putting it in right now into the live chat go ahead and ask me for tomorrow stream or you can send me a send me a message on on Twitter or some other social media and you put in the comments to the video you could join our slack channel for this stream and ask everyone in there I think the link to the slack channel is in the description so next next stream is probably going to be tomorrow around 2 p.m. Eastern time so same time is today unless something comes up and then I'll either reschedule or cancel but I'll let everyone know on Twitter in any case what's gonna happen yeah I think that's it all right so again thank you everyone and really really great chat at the end there it went on for quite a while and a lot of great questions and answers I appreciate appreciate all of it all the questions and answers and yes so have a great day I'll see y'all tomorrow you
