variables a variable is a container for a value the value can be many things such as a number or a string like part of a sentence or it can be an object or a complex function with variables the value in the container can change to use a variable you first have to declare it there that variable has now been created or declared you're going to create a variable using the var keyword the const keyword or the let keyword now before es6 you could just use var so that's still the most common but those other keywords are available after creating the variable you must initialize the variable this is where you just give it a value this is done with the equal sign there we just initialized my name variable with the name bo it's a string you can also declare and initialize a variable all at once so we declared the variable state and we initialized it as michigan you can use variables all over the place in javascript so here if you want to console.log you're just going to put something into the console over here so i'm going to put my name is use a string here and then i'm going to add a variable that's also a string and we're going to run that so we can see it right in the console it's going to do my name is bo see there's no space between isn't bo because you have to put a space here now once a variable has had a value assigned to it you can update that value by just simply giving it a different value so i'm going to put state equals california so before state equaled michigan and now state equals california so if we console that log it or do anything else like that it's going to equal california there are certain naming rules and conventions for variables generally you should just stick to using latin characters like 0 through 9 or a to z or even capital a to z and you should not use underscores at the start of variable names while this is allowed it has certain meanings and could get confusing so don't use the underscore to start numbers at the start of the variable will cause an error so you can't have a variable that starts with a number it can have a number in it just not at the beginning a safe convention to stick to is the lower camel case so this is just the naming convention see what says my name up here that's the lower camel keys when you stick multiple words together you should do it without a space and you should capitalize every word after the first word so if we're gonna have a longer variable so that's lower camelcase there's no spaces capitalize each word just like the name of free codecamp is in lower camel case you should always make variable names intuitive so they describe the data they contain also this is very important variables are case sensitive so a capital letter and a lowercase letter are completely different lastly you should not use javascript reserved words as your variable names this means words that make up the actual syntax of javascript such as var function if else for and one final thing about variables javascript is a loosely typed language which means that unlike some other languages you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain such as number or string or object or anything like that javascript just figures it out for you well that's variables thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
