Hi, this is Briana from freeCodeCamp and today we're going to talk a little bit about binary code. Now binary code is a really really basic simple computer language where there's just 1's and there's 0's. There's bi (two things), 1's, and 0's. 1's meaning on. 0's meaning off. So think of like a light switch, which in some cases super old computers there was an actual switch which was either on or off. 1 being on. 0 being off. Bunch of 1's and 0's. They can mean pretty much anything, but really they're mostly meant to be numbers and letters. We're going to go in a little bit on how you actually decode binary or translate a number to binary code. But really as you guessed, you can usually just Google binary translator and have that figured out. The most important part of this Do you understand the concept that even basic things like 0's and 1's can translate into something really really complex. And it is the basis for all the computer languages and programs that exist today.
