hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're gonna be working with some react components if you were with us yesterday you know that we upgraded to the latest version of material UI since version 1.2 point O we had a lot of breaking changes that we had to deal with and now we're gonna go through and we're gonna edit some components to adjust to some of the things that change so they weren't exactly breaking we're not getting errors in the console anymore but the Styles are a little bit off now so we're gonna change some things up and see how far we get with that I'm thinking maybe an hour for the stream hour and a half depending on how many questions there are and let me check the stream health quickly let me know if the streams okay it was showing that the stream health was not good which is really weird because everything else is showing up as is okay so yeah just let me know if everyone can see and hear me all right and then if so we will get started I'm going to get that code ready on my other screen and then switch over all right cool looks like it there are no problem with one off Thank You Teresa and Nikki okay let's switch over alright so here's the code if you are working on this project locally if you have a fork or something like that of the repo if you have any issues when you when you pull in the latest changes delete your node modules and then run yarn again so I had to do that because I had some issues and that fixed everything so that's generally a good thing to try when you're having some weird issues and you're not sure why if it works it'll save you a lot of time and you know if it doesn't work then you know you've you've wasted maybe you know a minute or two depending on how fast your computer is char Belle says don't start now no one is here yet alright well there is one thing I want to fill you in on so I guess I can stall for another minute or so I don't want to wait too long I interviewed another potential student worker today and he seemed really interested in working on some of the data cleanup so I'm hoping now that I have like two or three you know student workers that should be able to start some time like in like the next two weeks so I'm gonna stop with a lot of the data cleanup that I've been doing that's been taking up most of my time and I'm gonna shift into you know dealing a lot more with the actual react side of things and maybe even start in on doing some some testing using lighthouse to try to get the site like really fast and get that accessibility score up as high as I can so it may not affect the streams and that much except that you know they'll probably be more getting done on the react side of things between streams and hey everybody see rotates here's a nice okay so yeah we gained about five more people in that that the last minute or so so I think we're gonna get started it's still a little bit lower than normal but I think it's it's cool to get started so it's like we have 15 viewers which is definitely way lower than normal but I mean when I started I would have one viewer I'm fine with streaming without very many people okay so we do have our code up here just in case you didn't get to watch the last you know stream this has changed and this is a big change so we have we now have material UI and I'm gonna probably remove this code mod at some point this was help with migration but I couldn't get it to work so we have at material UI core and at material UI I cons and this has replaced the other material UI packages so we've updated to the latest stable version and we're going to continue with a stable version this makes me more comfortable as we approach going live that we're no longer on the beta like latest release track so I was fine with that when we were developing but it's nice that we can switch to the stable here before we launch alright so and the biggest changes have just been around this where we've had to adjust to a lot of like the changes to the API alright so let me let me pull over on this screen let me there we go I thought we already had some local loose open I'll get rid of this we'll just wait for this to load there we go and let me start my Pomodoro timer so I'm gonna code now for about 25 minutes and then I'll get back to the live chat and answer some questions if you have questions go ahead and put them in the chat but I won't get to them for about 25 minutes if you can't stick around for that you can always watch that's weird let me refresh that there we go okay that was kind of an odd odd glitch okay so here's the first problem that I'd like to deal with right now this may end up being just a CSS thing so we may not we'll see how much we have to change for this but since we updated this is happening and I don't want this to be an oval it's supposed to be a circle I was able to narrow down exactly why it's happening basically once the window width gets you know wide enough the height of this element which is a button goes to 70 pixels but the width remains that I believe 48 pixels so then when we have the border radius of 50% it becomes an oval instead of a circle so what I think we can do I think we're going to use a little bit of flex flex box to vertically align this and then we can change the height so just to kind of demonstrate why we need to do it like that and why we can't just change the height right away is that let's verify that it's still an oval no it's a circle so I need to make this and you shift this over there we go now we have the oval let me make this bigger so y'all can see and one more there we go okay so let's select this button div and I really want you know what let me move this down there we go and then let me move me up there we go now you should be able to see this hopefully it's not too small let me know if it is and so let's put the hover on all the time so we're going to activate this hover state here and so that'll stay hover it up here and let's zoom in so we can see if I bring the height back down to where it is it obviously fixes it but now this is no longer centered it's it's up at the top and I think it looks a lot nicer when it's centered there so I mean what we could do potentially is just like kind of manually set hey let's let's make it this many pixels from the top right we could do that and then use the same media query for that or we could just try to vertically align it within its container so I think the better solution which will work even if we end up changing the height of the container sorry if you hear my stomach growling I haven't eaten very much yet so I just I didn't plan well and I didn't bring food and I didn't have time to go get food so anyway like I'd rather do the flexbox vertical centering because that will be better if we change things later on so let's check out the code it looks like we have interesting alright so we we do have a margin up here on the header okay let's give us some more space here this way this actually might be a little bit more difficult because we don't our containing div does not go all the way up to the top we have we have this margin here or is that padding I think it's padding yeah yeah the green is padding all right let's see how it looks I don't think it's gonna work but I think it's worth a shot if not we may have to go to my alternate solution okay alright so using them what's already display flex wonderful let's see if we can use a line a line self let's see what we get okay so if we Center it see this is what I was afraid of we're centering it and we we're centering it based on a div that stops here so if we were to let's say get rid of this padding top the centering works and you know what I I think we can get rid of that padding on the top let's shift the screen down just to make sure that it still looks okay I think it looks fine without the padding and if we need to add anything we can deal with that at some point we can just change the height but I think that works so we need to go in to the components or the CSS files that are attached components we need to add a line let's go back down here we need to add a line selfcenter and then we also need to take that padding at top padding off of the header and I think that should fix it all right so let's go to our code now and fix this so it should be let me close this it should be in our layout let's check layout first see if that gives us that header component let's let's shrink this a bit area hmm maybe not yes we have the footer we have yeah okay he's an app bar yeah it should be an app bar let's check this out right so let's check out the classes now on app bar we have them up here so we're doing some inline and if I'm going too fast please feel free to to ask questions I'll definitely go back and slow down a bit so we have these styles that are JavaScript but they look like CSS and they're right here in our component which is nice because we have one place where we can edit everything it's very modular we could use this component elsewhere and you know the styles will stay the same but in this case you can see we have our app bar and which acts as a class right and then we have this padding top so let's just get rid of that and then we'll have what we need we'll have one half of what we need so we've gotten rid of that padding on the top and then let's sum this menu button this is where we've switched up the height here and set a new height at that breakpoint but we're just going to remove that so that way we no longer have that change of height on that element and then we're also gonna add that aligned self we need the camel case here because if we were to put that in in JavaScript it's going to interpret that as like a math operator right it's gonna say it's it's a minus sign we don't want that but then we can put in quotation marks we can say Center and this should give us what we want in case I missed something so we're going to save that go back and I'm gonna refresh so it just gets rid of everything that we done in dev tools oops and I just realized that I my image over on the other side my video may have been blocking things let me oh no I think it was okay and only got blocked anything but anyway now all that has gotten rid of and we could see hey it looks fine it looks centered and it's still it's a circle and no no longer an oval let's verify that it still works on a smaller screen yep yeah it works we haven't messed anything up excellent and I think we ended up with a little bit less code than what we started with which is awesome always good thing all right great so that's the the first thing fixed and I'm just going to go ahead through the process of committing this change so let's do a get status right and I'm gonna move my image back down here for now so we can see we've changed that components that at bar J s component we've edited that that's what we wanted adds we're going to do a get add we put a dot that just adds everything if we had one only wanted to add a specific you know file or set of files we could list them out there but I just usually use the dot by default because most of the time I do want to commit everything that's there so now that's ready to be committed and I'm gonna do yarn CM for a particular project we have a little automated things set up to help us make a good commit message but if you don't have that set up in your project which much projects don't you could just type in git commit with the M flag and type in your commit message and that'll do the same thing so what we've done is where we fixed a bug okay and I'm gonna write a little description and fix it's a menu buses let's see menu button hovers when you think of me always always circular okay that works that really was what we set out to do right let me I don't think this affects any open issues no it doesn't okay now what's gonna run through Auto formatting everything based on our es lint rules and it's going to run our unit tests and our endtoend tests and if everything passes then it will commit and we have some we're passing but we do have some warning so that may be the next thing that we fix because those warnings are ugly we want to want to get rid of them let me know on my screen it looks like the video and audio are out of sync let me know if it looks like that to you all all right great so this all work now I can do a git push and that one I'll be available at the github repo that's linked in the description okay great usually if you're committing things if you using it to track or any version control system you want to commit often because each time you commit it's like a save point right that you can always go back to so if you wait too long to commit you might reach a point where something messes up and if you had to revert you'd lose a lot of your work so if you know it only takes you know a minute or less to commit but it could potentially save you a lot of time okay so it looks like some of you are seeing a delay and some of you aren't all right the delays getting better now it still looks like it's a little bit off but it's definitely better than it was hmm okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna worry about it now then because it's pretty close it was off I wonder if it was just off when I was running through all those tests anyway I'm gonna check my timer okay we got about 10 minutes so if you've asked any questions in the chat in about 10 minutes I will get to those we're gonna move on now and let's deal with these errors so I'm gonna pull this up just so we can see them and let's pull this to the side for a second all right so what I like to go whenever you get error messages I find it's helpful to go all the way up to the top because often the top error message is usually easier to comprehend and that'll get you to the root of the problem sometimes if you fix that the later messages go away I'm sorry it's a warning message not an error so that's where we're gonna start so it says a failed prop type the prop on open is marked as required and swipeable drawer but its value is undefined okay so if you remember yesterday we switched over to that swipeable drawer component but we evidently didn't put the on open prop so I didn't realize that that was required so let's do that now so this should be in our drawer component let's close this out I can close this out yeah I don't need to save that we've gone through that already let's go to our components folder and we're gonna go to drawer a s and we'll scroll down here to where we have that swipeable drawer you see we have on close but we don't have on open so I'm not sure let's just try to put toggle drawer toggle drawer in here as what's gonna happen I don't know if that'll mess it up but we'll see maybe it'll make our errors go away the next time so definitely want to test this though okay all right everything looks fine looks like it's working let me refresh just to verify that our changes are there it should Auto refresh but doesn't hurt to be sure okay looks like everything's working so let's just run our tests and which tests were this it's where I end to end test let me see let's check our package.json and see what command will run our tests and and I think this right endtoend test so let's go with e to e so let's run the e on e to e to run our test again and see if we get any errors or if we get different errors I'm ok with that all right wonderful you know what let's run our unit test as well just to be sure all right great so it looks like all our test paths oh there we go did we get Sun I guess I didn't notice those oh but we are getting different warnings so those warnings that we had before are not there so we did fix that the key keyboard focus provided to the class's property is not implemented in button base you can only override one of the falling root disabled focus visible all right let's search for this keyboard focus throughout our whole project and find out where it's at because we're not getting yeah it's not telling us where that is we can try to look at our console here and see if we get a message we are getting a message but it doesn't tell us where it's at either so let's go back into our code and we're gonna go here and this is Visual Studio code so if we click on that magnifying glass icon then we can search throughout our entire project so let's do that all right so in our inverted button component we have this keyboard focused mmm okay all right this makes sense now let's let's go to that inverted button component okay I was a little bit afraid this would happen so a while ago we wanted to create a different type of button so we took we went into node modules and we found the code for button that was that was being used by material UI so we took all that code we copied and pasted it and modified it directly and created this inverted button component what I was worried about was that the changes would break it it didn't break it but we are getting warnings so let's see what we need to do then keyboard focus all right so saying keyboard focused we're gonna do shadow focus visible alright maybe maybe we'll change it to focus visible and see if that that works so let's go with focus visible and let's make sure this is the only place where we've used it and it looks like yes these other places won't really matter they're just the names of classes we created we could have named them anything all right so I'm gonna save that if this is the only thing that I need to change for this still to work I'm gonna be surprised but let's run through and which tests where these well these came from our unit test all right so let's let's rerun our unit test see what we get now we could just check the console refresh the page but this way we can stay on the same screen there we go so now we've we've fixed that so you see we run your own unit and you know it's definitely the tests that are making the audio and video out of sync as I just looked over briefly and I could see what's out of sync okay cool so it looks like this works we can also verify over here cool so we're no longer getting that warning here either we could check the buttons yep the buttons you know they're working all these these buttons are these aren't using these ones are using the inverted button cool all right so that works let's see alright so I was just clicking just to see if we get anything happen when I clicked and nothing happened when we click or hover so I think I think that's good let's do a git add my timer is almost up so this would be the last thing we do before I go to the questions and all right so let's do another fix and what was the first thing that we did let's just say some say address Mornington console from A to E you I update this does affect an open issue I believe I created an issue for this so let's go over to our repo and check this issue so this is our repo open already to an old issue that's already fixed and this is the swipeable drawer error that we'd like to fix and that is issue 125 so we're gonna go back over here and we'll say yes it does affect an open issue and then we'll add a reference to issue 1 2 5 right and we'll press enter now to run through everything it all should work and then we'll push that up to github so I'm gonna set my timer now for 5 minutes and I'll answer questions for the next 5 minutes let me get my there we go I couldn't see the chat for a second I'm gonna scroll all the left to the top so whoever asked the questions first your questions will be answered first if I can't answer David us what are the prerequisites before watching this dream anybody can watch the stream and if you don't know what's happening just ask questions I'll do my best to explain but really to get the most out of the stream it would be helpful if you had some knowledge of HTML CSS JavaScript if you really want to get a lot out of this stream if you have knowledge of react that would also be helpful so I like to make this as a beginner friendly as possible so I think depending on where you're at in terms of your experience level you will get different things out of this stream but hopefully everybody can get something out of it but you know that's that's gonna change so just know that no matter where you're at if you ever get confused just ask I'd be happy to go back over something that I had done and explain it in a little bit more detail and yeah some in certain streams are different some streams we just work with CSS some streams we work with sequel some streams we work with WordPress so you know there are some shoes who do really basic stuff and some where we do more complicated things so it kind of just depends on what we're doing as well in terms of like what you what background will help you the most alright I'm gonna do a git push there we go let's go back to the chat scrubs I guess that's how I'm pronouncing that says I'd suggest watching at any level it's good to see how things are done by other devs yeah yeah thanks for bringing that up I think that's a good thing that you know even if you don't exactly understand what's going on on the screen in terms of the code it it may be helpful just to see the process or you know just to hear the opinions of the other devs in the chat as well there's a lot of a lot of knowledge there Julio says use get integrated forget add and get and commit basic commands I've never I've never done that before I maybe have to check that out Nikki says use control B to toggle that sidebar menu on and off control B okay off to check that out let me try right now all right it's not working no all right it's not working for me let me see what there we go you know what I have the Adam keyboard shortcut setup so it's it's actually for me on a Mac command and then I don't know the slash that also has the pipe operator above him the I can't remember what's it for word and with the backslash but anyway that's why mine may be a bit different I always forget to use them Julio says is a good idea react for single page app or better I go with angular it really depends on what you're more comfortable with and if there's some specific feature of angular or react that you would like react works great is a single page app and actually even further as a progressive web app so if you use you know create react app it will be really it'll set you up to have a progressive web app pretty much right off the bat I don't know enough about angular to really make a recommendation for it though I hope hope we hope what I'm not it's hopw II says hey Jesse amazing stuff you've got here may I ask you what exactly does the json syntax to do i mean how are the commands define and everything okay so this uh this package JSON file it's it's for using NPM node package manager so basically it's just a set of descriptions and it tracks all the packages that your project uses so that if somebody else wants to to work on it they can download all the code without having to download all the node modules but then they have a record of which node modules are used and so they can just install those and NPM will automatically like it'll just read this it'll know what to install and you can get working and then in this scripts part of it you can just define kind of like little shortcuts to use so you can type in like npm dev and it'll do all this stuff so instead of typing all this out you just make this little shortcut dev and then it will run and you can make you know whatever you want for for all your shortcuts so that's kind of a really quick overview but hopefully that helps a little bit okay my timer went up again so I'm gonna go do some more code there's only one more question left though so this is priyanka asked which is better adams sublime or Visual Studio I've never used sublime I do like Adam but I have switched over to visual studio it seems a bit quicker so I definitely like it but I can't say anything about sublime because I've never used it though but I think you'd be fine going with any of them they're gonna they're gonna work well okay all right let's go back let's set this Pomodoro timer and let's see we can see now that this is referenced so that commit we just made as reference here I'm gonna close the issue because it's been fixed and if anybody checks out that issue you know they'll be able to see like this addressed it and they can go check out how how we fixed it all right let's go back and oh ok here's another thing so when we updated the padding around grid items was taken away so you can see here all these buttons are actually encased in the grid components so we need to put back some padding and add them in here so let's check that out let's go to our component so we have this hero component let's take out drawer here take this out too just to make some space there we go here Oh so hero is where we have these buttons so we've set up so that these buttons are actually like constants and we move them in and there they're optional so this is where the actual code is for the buttons so the primary button is the one on the top and then we have the two lower buttons here as our secondary and tertiary buttons and then you can see depending on what props are passed into the hero component we will display you know a certain number of buttons so what we want to do though is for these grid items we want to have some some spacing so let's try to put I'm not exactly sure which part of the grid needs the spacing needs to go on so let's try to put it on that top grid container and let's go spacing and we'll say equals let's try 16 at first okay so we're gonna give it a value of 16 and see what happens usually in material design you the values are like 8 you know 8 or 16 for padding is almost always what you get hey there we go all right so that ended up being an easy fix so basically what happened between the older version of material UI and this newer version is that they used to have by default I believe it was a spacing of 16 since it's 16 pixels but it was messing some things up so they decided to go with a default of no spacing and then if you want spacing you put it in so that definitely makes sense but if you were counting on that spacing before and now it's not there it messes it up but see now we have our spacing back this looks pretty much exactly like it did before as far as I can remember awesome that was an easy fix great let's go with I don't think I had an issue open for this yet but I guess it's worth it's a check yeah nothing nothing for that open so I'm going to take my own advice about get commits and we're gonna commit often I've been a little bit lazy about committing lately and I've just been making huge commits where I basically work all day and then commit at the end and that's not a good idea it almost I almost ruined a lot of work on my presentation for the talk that I gave over the weekend which if you check out my youtube channel you can watch the talk if you'd like but my presentation I almost like lost everything because I didn't commit and so now I'm going to try to commit more often it's one of those things that you always know you should do but sometimes you just get lazy with it so let's do it get status it's always nice to get status just to verify what you've done has actually been done and nothing you haven't inadvertently changed a file that you didn't realize that you changed so we'll do a git add yarn cm and let's say fix and I'm just going to do a hero button spacing all right and that should all pass through all the tests I mean we've really only changed such a small amount it should be fine and while that's going let's go back in here and see what else we have going on I know of one other issue that we could work on but while we're on this page we may as well check these look fine it's actually something I've been meaning to do as well like right now we have these cards and their YouTube videos and you click them they play automatically which is really nice but I don't like loading the YouTube videos on the home page because it actually slows down the load time so I would like to come up with some sort of solution where we could still have a very similar functionality but not have to actually load the YouTube video so I'm okay with some sort of lazy loading or you know perhaps we don't actually load it until this is clicked on so we could kind of make our own play button when you click it and then it Auto plays the video it loads and auto plays there'll be a little bit more delay when you're actually trying to play the video but many users may not even try to click the video so we'll see we'll see how it goes but I definitely I don't want to remove all the videos because I think it's nice to have them right there but we got to do something so that we don't mess up our load times trying to load in all that iframe stuff for the videos all right so I'd like to go to the English faculty page oh no you know what our our snapshot failed because it's it changed so we're doing our unit tests it automatically makes snapshots and we didn't update our snapshot after we we ran that so let's go ahead and update that snapshot now okay great so now that we've done that we can go back and run this yarn cm with the retry flag so now it should just go back in and it should work this time we'll check in on it in a second oh okay so we actually have problem here all right it says to lower case is undefined see if we can figure out where this issue is what is this the faculty list pages I think I know what the problem is did we get an error again is this it's still showing the air with that test all right for some reason our snapshot didn't update so what we can do to fix that is go into our snapshots and check out we can see this snapshot is the one that's not working we can delete the snapshot and then run this again and that should create the snapshot properly this time so let's try that and while that's running let's go to that page where we're getting the air and that's the faculty list page be sure if you have to go in and delete your unit snapshot that you actually delete the snapshot and not the unit test itself they have the same name except for the stuff snapshot at the end so I've done this multiple times where I've accidentally deleted the entire unit test in and that's kind of like it's a pain I can do I can just go into github a copy and paste the unit test I guess I could go into the trash or recycle bin and restore but it is just kind of a pain so we can see that that work now so it created a new snapshot and you know occasionally I have to do that it's pretty rare though all right so let's see what else has changed so we do want to commit that snapshot so we're gonna do a git add as well before we run this you are in cm retry so if we just would have run the rnc em retry without committing that snapshot then what could happen is somebody who's trying to pull that that update would then get the same error that we just did with our snapshots right so we want to make sure we commit it commit them both all right so that's their push that to github now in this faculty list here's what I think is happening let's see if it's if it's the case I think maybe our imports are not we're not importing things properly or potentially something that were like below in the child components maybe is not being imported properly so first we're gonna check here in the faculty list and I'm just going to glance through this and see I'm looking for anything that we're importing from material I was okay so it's not here so I'm guessing it's in this faculty list item component so let's grab that component shut our test folder so let's check the faculty list item component and here we go I think this is our issue so in the latest version of material I we don't import things all together in one line like this we would import them all separately so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna grab these and I'm gonna copy and paste these and let's get rid of these and get ready and for this one we're just going to grab the card right and then for this one we're gonna grab card actions and then for this one we're gonna say card content and then now we can say actions content alright so that way that was pretty quick and it looks like we're not actually even using card so let's get rid of that we can tell from this wiggly line it's gonna say that it's defined in every use so let's get rid of that but now we can see that instead of importing all these together from card the the file card we're going to import card actions from card actions we're going to import card content from card content so they're all separated out now let's make sure we're not doing the same thing now it looks it looks good so let's save that and if I was right which I'm not very often but if I was right then the error should be gone so let's check it out yay air is gone all right cool the only reason that I was able to figure that out so quickly is because we we dealt with or at least i yesterday before i streamed spent a long time dealing with very similar errors so it was still fresh in my mind and I knew what that meant if I had probably gotten that error you know a week later I may not have remembered it all right so now that's great we fixed that error so we probably should commit that but what I really wanted to show you all is this we have this iframe that's coming through and we're seeing the code and not the actual iframe so we need to check out see what's going on here why is the video not displaying and why are we getting the code there what I suspect is that I'm I'm not bringing in the the content like as HTML so we'll check in in that this will be our faculty je s component in the pages folder so we'll check that in just a second but let's commit our fix that we did here get status let's do a git add and a yarn cm and let's say to fix and we're gonna fix fix imports we're gonna fix no nope there we go so it may be worthwhile to bill and check all the imports and all of our components I thought I had already taken care of them all evidently I didn't so while it's still fresh in my mind that might be a good thing to do I don't know if I'll do that on the stream it's just gonna be kind of repetitive and not probably not very educational all right wonderful get push all right so let's get get this out of here and let's get this out of here we've already done our work there and let's find that faculty is so here's all their pages so a faculty died Jas page and here we go so we're in our render method here and interesting okay let me check that again let's let's look up with the markup actually is here video embed oh I see interesting all right here's what's happening this is being brought in with with quotation marks around it let's go over to our wordpress installation and see what data is there I want to see where those quotation marks are being added in so go to WP Franciscan University this is where WordPress installation is right now great I was already logged in so that's awesome and we need to find faculty so you want to go in here to faculty and find our English faculty there we go all right so there we go that's it so in our actual code we have these quotation marks I think no no we don't why is it like this all right let's do some editing of the code here and see if we can get the video to appear properly hmm okay all right so I'm hoping that this will will make it work now unfortunately what I'll have to do is maybe get somebody in here to like a student worker to manually make these changes or we could come up with some way to change that programmatically within our component now that I will have some students working on this I'm a little bit more open tech to manually editing this data okay let's go back here and refresh see what we get interesting oh I see I check this out within our component we're searching for anything with this source attribute and we're replacing it we're adding this we're prepending this franciscan dot edu we need to do this for images but we don't want to do this for iframes so this is going to be this is going to be interesting let me know what you all think yeah let me see okay so here's our problem and I'd like your advice on the solution here so the problem is we do need to replace some of not replace we need to prepend a URL onto these source attributes for images but we don't want to do that for iframes so what would be the best way to do that I'm thinking maybe a regular expression but this is going to be another instance where my regular expression skills are not good enough to make this happen without without some research hmm all right let me look and see what would you all think Johnny instance says do a ternary true do this use video element Johnny instance since yes regex needed yeah you know what maybe trying to think about how to create the issues so that it'll make sense off to think about how to explain this in an issue I'll make the issue if anybody is good with regex and wants to try it out you'll feel free otherwise at least I will remember what the issue is and then I can spend some time researching regular expressions to see how I could fix this problem I don't really want to do research on the stream it's just not not very exciting watching me read things I wonder if we can take what we're doing with a CV link and just adapt it actually let's do it still it's it's worth a try let's just edit this see if we can get it to work okay so instead of CV link what we're looking for then is iframe and instead of a href we're just looking for mmm that's what we're looking for maybe we can get rid of this we don't need this all right now we just need to let me change this iframe regex all right well the problem though is we still have that replace happening you know what maybe we'll have to yeah well um we're gonna have to do another regular expression for where we're getting the image thing and actually my timer just went up so let me take a break and go back to the chat answer some more questions and then let me know what you all want if you think the streams already gone on long enough we'll stop here or if you really want to see if we can fix this then I all extend it a bit longer and we'll see if we can fix it okay Nikki made a good point earlier when we were talking about different editors so saying visual studio does not equal visual studio code so yeah I think a lot of times were just kind of talking you shorten it and say visual studio instead of visual studio code I like to say vs code it just seems faster but yeah visual studio is a much bigger program much more powerful but overkill for what we do vs code is very similar to things like atom or sublime it's built with electron so yeah definitely a different thing for Janka says could you please tell me how to get an internship after two years my graduation is it possible I tell you that I'm not sure I've never you know pursued an internship but there are internship opportunities out there if we're gonna look for internship opportunities you know after graduating I would to be honest with you I do a little Google search first I'm guessing that you've already done that so I'm sorry that's probably not very helpful but I I don't have experience with that if anybody else has experience with getting internships after you've already been in college please let let Priyanka mad Duchess says does it work to add the snapshots and unit tests into another folder for easier management or does that affect performance I mean I guess you could add them into another folder I don't know if it would hurt the performance okay sorry Nikki all right now I see what you're saying okay sorry so yeah we we do have the tests separated out so alright we have our test folder and then within the test folder we have the snapshots folder so they are separated like that but the problem is like when you have them both open or like if I have it closed and I just go in and say like alright I'm gonna remove my snapshot sometimes I accidentally remove the wrong one it happens Nikki asked with the Google doodle for today is Michael says this dr. Virginia apgar's 109 day cool I don't I don't know who dr. Virginia Apgar is but maybe I should know let's check it out cool it's app car like the score they give babies I think it is now it's coming back to me since I've had fork kids should know this cool uh yeah I'd love to find out more about that okay yeah it is the the Apgar test cool for babies okay so Carlos is saying in regard to the regular expression stuff you say maybe adapt another constant as like CV regex but for the videos okay so that's what we're doing and pull it on the replace method Charbel Sarkis is how do you select the same occurrence of the text twice and edit at the same time replace after it do a replace after the last replace if the regex doesn't match and nothing is going to change okay let's see hmm yeah I don't think all right well let's just let's just do this and see if what I think is going to happen will happen which is we're not gonna it's not gonna do what we want it to do but let's just give it a shot you know the iframe here and then let me grab describe this and then what we want to do is for this source we're gonna put in h2 or I'm sorry not h2 because we're gonna want yeah whatever's after that and then here okay we actually yeah I can I can bring this down even further okay it's still gonna be the second one okay and just to to make sure this is going all right let's just add that in so we'll know if it worked you're fresh and let's see okay it looks like this it did not work so our replace here did not work maybe that messed it up try again he that didn't work either alright let's add in it's not gonna work including today all right still not working let me see okay John Hanson says you may be able to write the ternary into the same argument where you replace the URL for the University since it's already finding that Julio is asking about I is on 2018 I'm not I'm not sure where you're asking we're not using is okay let's check this out okay so we're trying to find the source here the problem with putting the turn area in here is that I'm not grabbing anything other than that SRC so there's there's nothing for me to say like if I mean maybe yeah I'm not sure about the ternary I think it would have to be a regex thing again like we look grab ngosource but we're not gonna grab it if it has the word youtube in it or something like that I wonder what if we can do this I wonder if that'll work ah no what did I do all right this works but unfortunately it'll get rid of any anything in that image sag all right let me get rid of this then and we're rid of this all right let me explain why did this did so instead of just looking for the source attribute I said like okay I'm gonna look for you know image with source attribute which works but it'll also rewrite like if there were other attributes so let's just let's check it out and see if there even were other attributes in this case no there weren't all it's just the alt attribute was missing actually you know what I think there's a better way to do this and still keep our alt attributes or whatever attributes we have so let's do this we're gonna make it cost and we're gonna say this is the image reg X and let's create we're gonna get rid of the CV link stuff we're going to get rid of it here we're gonna replace this a tag with image and image F so that's gonna be all the stuff inside the href and then actually we're not gonna have an ending image tag right no we won't what we'll have then it's just this we're not gonna need this so this will be our href and then this will be all the other attributes at the end so then we go down here and we can say we're gonna replace this all with get rid of CV link get rid of CV link let's add an image I add in our image tag we'll place this href with the source the second section there is what we want for our source and then we're not gonna add in our other stuff here instead we're gonna put in we're just gonna grab whatever else is there which would be four so we're gonna say this is going to be four and then we don't want any of this we want that and then we can remove whoops almost forget that so we want to combine the in here hopefully that space won't mess it up mmm yeah let's leave it like that okay and we will get rid of this for now or let's just comment it out for now okay now let's see if that works no I what did we get the image source okay not too bad we didn't get what exactly what we wanted though but or maybe we didn't get anything maybe it didn't work at all yeah you know what it didn't work because we look for the wrong thing Oh someone noticed there is an extra okay yep good luck Nikki dang it's not working mmm I'm messing up something in this regular expression for the image so it's not actually getting oops sorry see all right let's try it now yes all right see an image source that works and then it also has the oh yes all right awesome so that worked okay cool the only thing I'm thinking that maybe might not work exactly right is if in the markup they've put a lot of attributes before the source in that case it's not that it won't work it's just that those Astra buttes might not actually get added in at the end but for now this works and it does preserve anything after which is definitely better than what we had before and our videos now work so that's pretty awesome I think it's awesome all right John said you made it look so easy I don't know how I just did that sometimes like you know what it's just it you just get this light bulb in your you know a moment where it's like I I have it occasionally that happens I think I just got like in the zone you know and it's just my brain was just working I don't even know why because I'm starving right now I was about to give up cuz I was just so hungry and I was thinking like I can't even think but alright I guess I'm okay under pressure then Carlos says yay don't know what you did but awesome good coding all right cool yeah so let me take just a second to explain what I did as best I can and then then we'll finish up any questions with any questions you have and we'll all in the stream okay so here's what I did basically so we quit using this just get rid of that right so we made this regular expression which all it's doing is just searching for something right so this whole constant is just a search and we've just given it certain parameters so that it searches for and finds exactly what we want so what I'm searching for is this particular string which is like the beginning of an image tag but I want to find the image tag that also has a source equals in it with a what am I thinking for with a quotation mark right with a double quote at the beginning right so assuming it finds that then what it's going to do is it's going to save whatever comes between the first quote the second quote as a variable and we're going to be able to access that variable by using dollar sign to write that's the second thing in there I'm not sure if this is proper of regex terminology but this is how I'm explaining I'm understanding it from JavaScript world okay so now everything that's in that source attribute gets saved for us and then everything after the source attribute but before the ending tag in the image tag will get saved as this other variable that we're going to be able to access as dollar sign for because it's the one two three fourth set of parentheses here then basically we're finding that ending to this and so altogether with this regular expression we're getting an entire image tag and this is going to say we want to search globally I believe so correct me if I'm wrong with this so this is global so we're going to find every occurrence of this not just the first occurrence and then we want it to be case insensitive so just in case you know somebody decides to make the image tag capitalized it still should work right now when we go down here we're getting all that content that we're grabbing from WordPress so everything that we see here we're getting all that content and then we are replacing parts of it so once we get down to this replace we're going to search so the first parameter of that replace is a search for that regular expression so we're searching for any of those image tags right but then we want to replace that entire image tag with the second parameter and so the second parameter is an image tag but we're adding in this Franciscan edu URL because that's where that image lives right so in order to grab the image we need that and then we're just adding in whatever was the in there originally right that dollar sign too and then we're just tacking on any other attributes like an alt tag or a title tag that may have been a part of that image and then we're closing our image tag all right so basically it's a find and replace but we're just doing some fancy stuff with the find does that make sense Aniki says go to another one of those pages is the iframe also enclosed by quotes there oh you know what that's a good that's a good idea we did manually edit some of that so that the iframe was enclosed in quotes yeah so potentially potentially we we could programmatically do that I'm gonna and I'm gonna just kind of stop with that now and then I'll look through a few other ones and see if we come upon that issue again I'll either manually change it or I'll add another one of these regular expressions for that particular scenario where we have the iframe within quotations so yeah but you're right that that may be an issue Matt Dutchess says thanks for making regex less scary and breaking it down for us oh yeah no problem it's still scary for me I just when I need it to work that's the only time I use it I guess and and really you know we had a pull request that gave us this you know I didn't come up with this but then after seeing this example I was able to understand what it did and then was able to do this based on that so when it comes to regular expressions I think that's the best if I see an example I can usually edit it right but if I try to come up with a regular expression completely on my own it's rough it's really hard so maybe that's a good way to approach regular expressions try to find something that's doing something similar to what you want and then maybe make make a few edits it could be a nice shortcut to get to where you need to go alright my I may as well start the process of this change while I'm doing questions so let's get started get status yep get a yarn see em fix so what are you going to fix I have video faculty pages yep there we go that's cool that's definitely something I didn't think I'd be able to fix during the stream so well that's the one it's thing let me finish up with some of these questions and then I might leave and get something to eat I might finish up my workday from home because I'm so hungry and it's so tough when you're on a diet you can't just like find whatever and just scavenge it you know although I tell you what like right now it's taking a lot of my willpower to not just eat like whatever the next thing is edible that I could find michael creo says you have four kids and don't know the Apgar test what once I saw the baby in the thing like it kind of like refresh my memory about Apgar but well my youngest is a year and a half old now so it's been a year and a half since I've probably even heard that and to be honest with you when my youngest was born my wife had a lot of problems and had to have a lot of doctor's appointments and surgeries so that I like took a lot of time off of work and drove her around all her stuff and took care of the kids so that's kind of like all blur and so I was much less worried about Cordelia my youngest then I was about my wife so anyway that's probably why I don't remember someone asked about my visual studio code theme and Nicki says it's it is SETI so yeah SETI is the theme that I'm using I've been using this for years and years like even back when I started with Adam which was I don't know like for at least four years ago I think it was I was started using Adam like really early on so not too long after it was first first came out so I've been using this theme for ever Michael Creole says is the a.href search hardcoded because not all CV link start with the href that was messing with me let me think you know what I haven't really tested this a lot to make sure it works everywhere but it should work so if the it doesn't necessarily have to start with href I believe that as long as href is contained somewhere it will still work I think that's what this period is going in here but I'm not a higher percent sure that was just my assumption otherwise we could have just taken this period out and left a space in and it would work okay yeah that's it so I need there were no other questions there in the chat thank you all so much for hanging in here with me for so long oh okay also asking about the font it's the fire or fear of font for Visual Studio code so Fira so search for the search for that font for Visual Studio code and should be able to get that it has the it does cool stuff like so when you do an arrow function it combines it right so it does some stuff like that alright so I'm gonna end the stream and get something to eat before I fall over here and yeah tomorrow it's a Friday already wow this week he's just gone so so quickly anyway yeah I'll try to do a stream tomorrow and not sure what we'll be working on we'll see maybe we'll find some more problems and fix those tomorrow but thanks again for watching and until tomorrow have a wonderful day
