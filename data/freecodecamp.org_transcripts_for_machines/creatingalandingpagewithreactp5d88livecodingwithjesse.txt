everyone welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're gonna make a landing page with react so we'll be using material UI to help us out with that if you don't know that much about react don't worry feel free to ask as many questions as you want and I'll do my best to explain things and answer your questions if you're new to the show this is how it works I set a timer for 25 minutes and we do mostly code for 25 minutes and then we take a fiveminute break and I check the live chat and I'll answer questions as many as I can in five minutes then we'll do another 25 minute code session and then after that I'll spend the rest of the stream answering your questions so if you can put a question in the chat and I'll definitely see that if you can't for whatever reason put a question in the chat right now you could always add it as a comment to this video or you could ask me a question on any social media my DMS are open and I do my best to get back to you as soon as I can all right let's get started I will show you my screen let's get this code a little bit bigger okay that might be an all right size let me know if it's not and let me show you here we go let's start out like this you all will get to see my excellent drawing skills okay here's the basic outline for the page that we're gonna build so we're gonna have a hero section at the top above that will be our hour at bar you know our top navigation menu that we already have we're going to do a hero section that's going to be very similar to the one that we did on the home page and then I'd like to have a section with a little bit of text maybe icons if we have some icons that's gonna highlight some of the programs on campus we're gonna have whoa we're gonna have another section that would highlight different types of programs so these will be on campus online and then steps for how to apply and these will be you know very brief with links to the ways to apply and then we're gonna have another section that potentially could include things about costs or we can include some of the main selling points that seem to be seem to resonate with our potential students so this I worked for University in this page is going to be the admissions landing page so I actually did this sketch after sitting down with the graduate admissions people and seeing what what they thought would work but we're gonna do one for the undergraduate admissions today but we're going to use the same layout so we're gonna use a lot of just sample data and then let the people from admissions you'll give us the content that we need to fill it out later some other things that we may want to include are testimonials and other sales points right so those could potentially go here and might be like a quote from a former student and a picture if we have a picture of them so today we'll probably just use you know whatever whatever images we can find and whatever quotes we can pull the most important thing is getting something on the page the layout something to look at because I have a meeting with the people from admissions coming up I think next week and I need to show them something because they're gonna be the ones that are gonna approve whether or not this site is ready to go live because this is primarily a tool for marketing to prospective students okay I won't make you look at my sketch anymore okay so for those of you who haven't been following the stream this is kind of a view of the homepage so this is going to stay this top navigation our hero section is going to look somewhat similar to this we may end up going with maybe like a smaller version of this the this kind of thing I think is okay for a homepage but for me personally it gets a little annoying if I start seeing this on a lot of interior pages I'd rather get to the content so we may cut down on the height and then we're gonna have some similarities in the sections and we may reuse some of these elements that we've already made and that'll save us some code but we'll probably have to code some some new stuff as well okay all right let me say I got a lot of action in the chat oh yeah a lot of people in here so I imagine there are some new people welcome so hey everyone just I'm not gonna say hi to everybody individually because there's a lot of people in here right now but I just want to say hi and I'll read through your comments in more detail at the end of the stream okay let's get the Palmer two hour timer started and let me start up this end Rock server so that you all can view what I'm working on as I'm working on it and you can inspect it in your browser open up dev tools mess around with it whatever you want so go and click on that link if clicking on the link doesn't work you may want to try copy and pasting it sometimes the live chat links don't work right if you click alright it looks like it's working for these some of you so first things first we need to actually create the page the component page and we need to make a route to it in our server das file and that's pretty much gonna be the only backend ish type of stuff that we do really minimal all its going to be all frontend stuff today okay so whenever I create a new component I always try to recycle code from a previous component to cut down on the amount of typing that needs to be done so let's take a current page that we're already using and we may as well use the home page because we're gonna use so much of what's already on the home page so our home page should be index yep index so I'm just going to copy and paste everything from index j/s and let's make a new file and we're gonna call this admissions ojs and i paste everything in there and we need to change the name to admissions okay other than that everything should work and now we need to point that that URL path for admissions to the right place so let's go to our server Jas file which I usually have open there it is and let's look up admissions admission there we go here's admissions and we want to say our default is gonna go to our defaults Nate and now go to slash admissions so if you're not sure what's going on here don't worry about it where this is all we're gonna do right now I guess the only that's important to know is that this just controls what components going to render whenever we go to a certain URL is so what did I do wrong what's it's elevating that should be fine right oops default is admissions and then what's the next thing this needs to be secondary right okay remember the key words I use let me doublecheck was standard yeah sorry standard not sure what I was thinking when I named it standard all right there we are so I had to put that in as well so that all the rest of the pages we want to go to the page component to be rendered for now this one is just going to go through the admissions page components and yeah and this should work cool all right so let's let's really test now and see if it does work so we're gonna go to slash admissions oh quick update for those of you that have actually loaded this hey it works awesome it'd have actually loaded this project onto your machine from github and links in the description if you want to check out the code on github it's all over the source do what you want with it but if you have downloaded it please pull in the latest changes I did a lot of work on Friday and like into Friday night and I made some updates for the packages and I had to update the version of node that I was using so you may have depending on what version of node you were currently running it may not work anymore unless you update so just a heads up on that okay so we have our route to the admissions face working which is great last week nothing works simple things broke and it was a mess we're already at doing better this week alright so now let's go into the code and rip out the stuff that we don't need and replace it with with some other things so a lot of connections open on end rock that's awesome shoutout to inconceivable for giving us a free unlimited and for these rico camp live streams with the end rock service okay so we're done with that server ojs file and we're just going to focus now on our admissions file and let's give us give ourselves a ton of space to work with and let me double check I don't know if anybody said anything about the font size so let me know now if the font size is too small increase it I'll try to remember in about a minute to look back at the chat okay so for now so if you're not familiar with react let me just give you a quick intro so a react component is just like a chunk of code and it can include your markup right like your HTML Javascript and CSS all in one but the HTML doesn't it looks kind of like HTML but it has JavaScript blended in we call that JSX and your CSS may not look exactly like normal CSS okay so in this case our CSS is actually a JavaScript object what it should look a bit familiar to you there's just some difference like we have some camel casing going on here and we don't have semicolons at the end of the line all right but other than that these do exactly what you they would normally do in CSS and we also are pulling in code from a lot of other places so all these imports at the top we're pulling in other components and other pieces of code to help us alright so all we're doing is saying we want to import this thing and we're going to call it typography in this case and we're going to get it from here and here is where we put in the path and the filename all right so these are all the styles we're going to keep those as is for now and we'll edit those later on when we need to all right here's how we're going to start out with so we have this hero component and that's for our hero section that we see here so a long time ago we months ago we abstracted out that hero component in into its own little component because we assumed like we're probably going to need to use this again for another page well we finally have to use it again for another page so good thing we did that for now I'm going to keep this image because I don't have another image in mind just want to keep it like this but eventually we'll change it out and we're just going to change out a little bit of the text and we're gonna see about setting the height I don't know if I built that in yet or not so we'll check that component out see if it's built in if not we'll build something into the component to allow us to really easily change the height if you joined a little bit late I'm not ignoring your questions for for good we're gonna reset a timer and so in about 15 minutes I'm gonna get to all the questions so if you can stick around for a bit I will answer it this stream will also be recording recorded and it will be available to watch the replay on this channel with free code camp channel so if you miss something don't worry you can always watch it again so let's change this to we're gonna change it to undergraduate admissions and then below this I'm just gonna leave the the tagline for the University which is academically excellent passionately Catholic so it's a Catholic school run by Franciscans and you know what I want to keep these buttons because these are the main things that admissions would want you to do apply enquire a visit so we can keep those buttons so a lot of that it's nice it can stay the same so we'll save that and then let's go to that hero component so let me close up some of these folders so it's not so cluttered okay so here's our components and where's our hero there we are I mean it's an alphabetical order shouldn't be that hard right all right so here's our hero component and here's where we get our height from this this min height of 80 VH so the VHS viewport height so if you see a t think 80% of the screen height so I do want to drop that down but right now we don't really have a way to drop that down through our props right so these are the things that we pass in so if you see here we passed in all this data into the component these are called props so we want to make a prop that could give us the height so let's see let's just call it min min height so it'll be really clear what it is we'll say min height and for this one I want to pass in let's go 66 tbh we'll see how that looks all right so we're passing it in now but we're not doing anything with it over here so over here I'm gonna say men whoops men Heights okay so we're using object destructuring here so that we don't have to keep typing in and this props over and over again so all of our props are here just nice to have a list of all the props anyway and then down here we're gonna find the spot where we've we're putting this these styles so parallax is the class that we've given it so let's see where we have parallax these are all our buttons here we go parallax so what we'll do we already are overriding a style here for the background image so we're just going to do it again and we're gonna add a style so this is similar to the normal style attribute that you can give an element in HTML right but instead we have these brackets the first set of brackets says hey we're gonna write some JavaScript the second set of brackets since we're in JavaScript now indicates a JavaScript object so again like it was above we have our CSS in the form of a JavaScript object okay and we're gonna do just like we did here we're gonna make use of template literals which is an es6 es2015 thing that allow us to mix strings with javascript without having to concatenate a bunch of plus signs so this will do so let's put in min heights and then we'll use actually what we need to know we won't because we we've put it all together so we should be able to just add in let's see if that works I'm a little bit minutes not too fine hmm it's not gonna like me saying me all right so let's see let's say minimum Heights about that in that'll avoid confusion and minimum Heights minimum Heights and then we'll go back here and add in minimum right so now there will be no confusion between the the CSS that says men height and our variable that we passed in as a prop that's it's men minimum height okay let's check it out now hey it worked right so you could see it used to be down here now it's much smaller so I like that for now maybe I'll go a little bit smaller we'll see it definitely depends on the image that we end up using as whether or not that image will even work with these kind of dimensions yeah but you can see when we do that it's definitely a percentage of the of the screen so it changes as we move things around just about ten more minutes and then I'll get to the questions all right awesome so that part of this is for now done right but we need we definitely need to get some input on the image and the text to put here but I believe the buttons and undergraduate admissions will be fine all right so for this next part let's let's go ahead and set it up for testimonials I think testimonials are good let me think about it when you go to Amazon and you look at a product you usually scroll down and see what people say about it at least I know I do right I want to make sure okay this product looks cool I checked the price first and I check to see if it's prime so I get that free shipping right and then the very next thing I check is I scroll down and see you know what did what did people say so I think that would also be useful if a student is potential student is looking at Franciscan University and they say all right well I know all the marketing stuff they're putting out there but what other people say all right of course we're only going to put the good stuff on our website for reviews but you know that's how it goes so let's take let's take these this style of of card and let's reuse this style for our testimony our testimonials so we'll do an image and then quote and we're probably we're not gonna have a link right so depending on the content we get maybe this could end up being an entire page but for now I'm just gonna assume we just have a really small quote and a small image and that's it and we'll try to go three across on a large screen of course they'll stack on mobile also as I'm going through if if any of you have suggestions for for what I'm doing or if you see me doing something wrong let me know alright so let's figure out what this what component this is it looks like profile card great so this is profile card and let's grab let's grab this whole thing because these are there's two profile cards in here already I'm just going to take this out to profile cards in there already and so that'll be good that's what we want and let's make a container so we're going to put it in right here so for our container we're just going to make a div and we're gonna give it a I'm sorry we're gonna do a grid this is something that comes with material UI if you're not familiar with react think of material UI is like like bootstrap is right or materialized CSS is for you know like a normal website look at JavaScript just vanilla JavaScript site so what material UI does is it gives us a set of styles and components that we can use and it keeps the consistent material design feel to the site so we're going to use this grid and we're going to call it we're going to give it the attribute or prop up container alright so we want to container grid wood and close that out as well oops okay let me double check and make sure it's supposed to be container I think it is I don't know why I didn't have a container earlier okay so we made a great container and now we have these grid items inside of here and I want to try to do three items so let's add a third one and notice when we have this grid that I may end up taking this class off we'll have to see what's in there but for our other props we're saying we have extra small small medium and large these are screen sizes so we're telling it how many columns out of twelve to take up on a particular screen size so right now we're taking up the full width twelve columns on an extra small screen and on all other screen sizes we're taking up half the width well that worked when we only had two but now we have three so that's definitely not going to work so let's change this up and let's try four right so four columns will allow us to have three items right side by side so let's see how that looks all right there we go so there's our three cards side by side okay so a few things to note I think we can go a bit smaller with these with these cars and I don't know that I like them being so wide across I would prefer maybe a bit more margin on the sides and I don't like that they're not the same heights so other than that they're showing up properly let's shrink this down all right you see and they didn't stack up when we shrink them down okay so they basically behave the way that they're supposed to okay I do want to check out what kind of CSS we're adding here so let's let's find our class called grid item fix there we are servicing with 100% Patti okay there's nothing there that would really mess up anything that we're doing so I'm gonna leave it like that what I think we we ought to do though is add this content container in all right this will give us that padding on the sides that we want and you see depending on the screen size we'll have like more or less padding so we're not actually adding like padding right like we would do a CSS padding we're just setting the maximum width to a percentage so it it seems like padding right and on a smaller screen we have less on the sides which makes sense because we want to be able to display more content on a small screen but on a large screen you know the content would be huge the images would be way too big which is exactly what we have going on here so let's grab this content container I'm just gonna copy that and then I'm going to come down here to our grid container and we're giving it a give it a class name of we're gonna say classes and I'll paste that in there we are so the styles should all be applied now all right awesome so now you see we have much smaller images yet this works I definitely want to try to find images of students where so like this type of image will work where it's primarily the the student you see the student when we have this one where you know the image is primarily the background right this this hallway it doesn't work quite as much because the images are now a bit smaller so probably want to switch out these images of course we're gonna have different students but for now this will work let's just remove these links though I don't want the links right now and we built these components so that I believe we should be able to remove this prop for link and and once we remove the prop it just won't display that link anymore okay so otherwise if you try to do that you haven't built that in wood you may end up with is an error because it'll be looking for data that's not there and I might throw an error so let's say that and this would be the last thing we check before you are the questions yep there we go no errors alright so got the hero section and that first section pretty much laid out notice I'm not doing any really detailed stuff that'll come on the second pass when we really get into things also before I have final approval it's almost a waste of time to go into the details and try to fix everything you know we could spend hours you know just on this action getting everything perfect and then I'll go into a meeting and find out they don't want that section at all when we throw it out right okay let me do a break I'm gonna scroll all the way up to the top of the chat and just go down so if you ask your question recently I may not get to it this time but I'll get to it at the end of the stream Sherman said before the stream even started is it a static website Vennela react you're gonna use things like Gatsby hopefully vanilla we're using next Jas so it's not exactly vanilla react but next doesn't add in a whole lot of extra stuff so in terms of how we design the components themselves it's it's pretty much vanilla react unless you know if you want to count the tour UI obviously that's not vanilla everyone so what are you saying hi more assess what live stream software I'm using OBS so OBS is free and I believe it's available for Windows Mac and Linux so check it out if anybody has questions about how I do my settings for OBS let me know I can screenshot my settings okay one us when I'm building and I think I kind of covered that so hopefully answer your question one if you still have questions about what I'm building let me know miss Sara says you use Gatsby for project fiveday did you use further Gatsby for project five or use Gatsby just for projects holiday we ended up not using Gatsby and we went with next Jas it fit the requirements of a project better and I was more familiar with it so we ended up one with next so we didn't use Gatsby for that project but we still have the Gatsby branch available so if you wanted to go back and you use that as a basis for a project feel free it may be a bit outdated now since that was six months ago all right Michael creo says don't put cost on the front page maybe don't but don't put it on the page that can be added with SEO maybe add a link to it yeah you know what one thing is for our graduate program the price is is a really good price so we want to put the cost for that because it's a big selling point our undergrad program is definitely a good price for a private education but it's it's not something that people say wow this is really cheap school so we don't really want to add that as you know advertise that college cost so much money that even if it's a good price it still seems like a lot so we don't really want to put that on there and you're definitely right Michael I'm not trying to hide it from anybody but you don't just want that to stand out on the very first page Steven says amazing art totally makes sense worst handwriting ever yeah for sure I type I type I don't need to write on paper right one says give me the link to get your source code it's in the description so just kind of scroll down and check check the link in the description crystal says what language you coding this with this is JavaScript in particular it's react which is a library that helps us build progressive web apps in JavaScript and you can build other things with it as well see one says cool I'm gonna clone your web with the source code awesome see crystal says what's the name of your editor it is Visual Studio code so I see joby thanks for answering that in the chat what type of font are you using for the website itself we're using Roboto and then for my editor its feet fyra font or fear of font I'm not sure how to pronounce that Fira and that is Michael Michael added in the chat it's Visual Studio code with the seti theme so seti is the theme that I'm using Christopher says good font size alright awesome I'm glad that I'm glad you all can see that oh well Michael so you might want to add that and rock shout out to your YouTube description for the stream that's X that's a really great idea maybe I'll write up something about that okay I'm gonna mark down where I'm leaving off at in the chat cuz my timer just went up and that way I can come right back to it after we do another 25 minutes of code okay so if I didn't get to your question now apologies but I definitely will get to it after the next 25minute coding session let's start this up okay and let me put the link into this Pomodoro clock this was built by Harshit who frequently watches the stream not here today though but it's a nice Pomodoro clock so go ahead and a few a few others of you that watch the stream also it made really awesome Pomodoro clocks so I'll shout out your clocks if you want me to just let me know okay over yet wait a second what's your seven there we are all right let's let's go into the next section then like I said I don't want to be too detailed about this so let's see so we said that our next section was going to be our programs now this would work for our graduate programs because we don't have so much so many programs but for our undergrad programs I don't think that layout would work so let's think of another way we could do this I'm thinking we need to break this out into categories so let's see if we can keep I definitely want to break it out into we can do three categories that would work we can do five categories we can do six categories I think any of those combinations would work just in terms of laying things out on a screen so it would look it would look okay so you know what let's take a look let's take a look at our page that lists all of our our undergraduate programs so it should be ug majors alright so this is just the list that's come maybe that's not it maybe it's oh no it's automatically sending us here now all right I'm not gonna worry about that now because I don't want to get into the the server stuff more but off to fix that after so let's go here academics ug majors alright that'll actually work academics that makes sense okay there we are okay so here's all the majors that we currently have so I'm wondering I don't know how many that is but we definitely could split things up although we could go through like humanities or Sciences I mean that's definitely a a.split we can do social sciences as a as a split all right let's try this split let's try humanities science and social science and then I'll we'll all let admissions figure out what categories to put what in oh Michael Chris at 53 Oh 53 majors okay that's gonna be a lot let's see how it looks I mean you have business business business business yeah I'm gonna I'm just gonna put these categories down as an example of what could be so that we can show it at the meeting all right so let me let's go back to this page we can visualize this so I'm envisioning like let's say five categories so we would have like one two three and then four or five would be in between in these spaces so we'll have bigger gaps here but they'll kind of split the difference and what we'll have is essentially lists I'm not hundred percent sure that this is is gonna work is it that in terms of is it it's gonna look good but I think it's worth a shot I think it'll give the students very quick access to more information about what they want to do and it'll let them know right off the bat you know here's what the majors we have here's what we offer right our products is based off of majors so I think that's a great thing to put out there right away here's what we offer here's all the flavors of college that we offer here right okay so let's just grab this grid that we just made and let's add this in here could we do yeah let's at it here we may we may not well this will work for now I may want to change this up a bit later on but no sense in trying to refactor anything right now did I get everything there we are okay so instead of profile cards let's get rid of these profile cards for now we're gonna create essentially our our own thing and if we really like it we want it to work we'll make it our component but for right now I don't have a component that does what I want it to do already so let's just go with this let's do a actually we just did this somewhere we might be able to copy and paste what page did we just do this on okay y'all that I some of you were there for that stream I know I was asking about how to correctly put a heading on a list in a way that screen readers would understand what page was that what were you working on I can't remember if anybody remembers let me know in the chat and we can copy that for now I'll just make this list cuz I know we need the list you well let's do a few L eyes and I wish I had a mitt in here I'm not sure if I have M it in here hold on aside I forget how to do it anyway the education page is that it the one with the courses yep that's it that is it where is it a sample schedule yes awesome section that's how we did it we did section that's what we want okay so it's good to always have accessibility in mind and by that I mean like mainly screen readers so they'll be able to see it but not just screen readers also like the correct contrast between your fonts and your backgrounds good font sizes so let's add this as we'll just go with h4 it's just like we did before and we can even pull over the styles as well let's see I'm not gonna put anything in these for now let's see so if we have about 50 majors and we're gonna have five of these categories then I need like 10 items in here 2 4 6 8 10 okay why is my my indentation is crazy well it'll the indentation will get fixed on save okay so for this grid item yeah this will actually work this this will work as is we just need to copy this over a few times should this get rid of these so let's copy this you know we may as well make let's fill in something so we can actually see it on the page there yeah the three one two three four five so for these ones down here these grids we're going to switch this up and we're gonna leave as four but we want to offset them okay so let's look up how we make do this offset grid so we're gonna check out grid this is material UI I'm gonna put the link in here to where I'm looking this up in the chat that way you can check this out as well so I'm assuming there's an offset because that seems like something people would want right let's okay so we may there's no offset built in we could just add a an empty grid grid tag let's let's check the API and see what we have all right let's try this so I want a grid so this is one two three so in between three and four let's put another grid let's remove everything though I actually don't need this ending so let's remove everything and on extrasmall let's say it's zero I don't know that we can actually put zero in there if that's valid but I don't want this to take up any space if you know if we're on a small screen so I may be able to get away with putting one in there we'll see we'll see how it works but if zero works and that's what I want to go with first so we're going to zero but then on a small screen I want to do it like this so we're gonna have our two larger sections that we want to see that are going to be visible and they're gonna be four and four that makes eight right so that gives us a whole nother for that we have to fill up that space so that's why we're gonna make this one two and that's going to be the beginning and then at the end we're gonna add another blank grid grid item that's also gonna take up two columns all right let's see what happens I'm kind of expecting an error but whoa no error all right so good to know you can put zero as a grid item and let's double check and make sure that actually works so this is extra small screen size awesome awesome great okay so that's what we have doesn't look good at all right now but let's bring over our styles that we had already figured out went on another component and that way yeah we'll see what it looks like after so I was just kind of looking at the spacing like maybe we should Center this stuff because it's all over to the side but let's add our Styles first and then see what we can do so on the sample schedule component that we made last week we had this grid item so on the grid itself we had a style of list grid item on our UL we had styles list on our h4 we had list header and then our Li we had list item so we're gonna copy over quite a few Styles here so this grade item list list header and list item list item list was tighter than this good item area alright let's copy all of those and we'll put them up here with the rest of our Styles it looks like we already have a list item list I'll type none let's say let's just call it major major list item we just change that up a bit and then now on these we can add in our class names so let's see we can probably get rid of this grid item fix because that was for a different issue so I doubt we need that anymore and actually you know what let's get rid of these first because we don't need any styles on on these ones all right there we are so we're going to replace grid fix item with list grid item that we just pulled over we can check out what these styles are actually doing you know when we we get them all switched over but for now you for now I think it's better to see it first and then we'll explain explain it after you do class name classes dot list and then there's a ul or H fours we're gonna get really should have done this before I copied them all whoops that would have been smarter last name equals classes whoops that's not an equal sign equals classes dot list header all right and then finally allies that's a lot of allies we can do this we're going to test the limits of multiple cursors and we change that didn't we list item we change it to major list item right all right there we go class name equals classes dot major list item that looked really cool I mean I don't know that just look cool editing all those lines all at once so hopefully I didn't mess it up let's save it and see what it looks like all right not too much different really but we don't have any of those those bullets anymore let's try to Center this at least yeah it's gonna be a little bit difficult let's see well again let's just let's try the easy part first okay about five more minutes less than five minutes I'm gonna go back to the questions okay so let's see see if we can just do a textaligncenter yeah we can awesome see we can do a center that's great we can do it on here as well this what I was talking about the easy thing okay we could do it the easy way and just have them all centered you know what for now let's let's go with that okay I I don't normally like to have centered things like this I think it looks kind of weird to have it like different starting points for the lines so the way around that would be if that does look really weird to try to just censor the list inside of of the div but we can already see like kind of an issue right because we're already full width so probably end up using some I don't know what I'd use but I'm not gonna worry about it now this should be enough that once we get some real names of the courses in here it'll be alright but I'm not gonna type out manually all the names of all of these right that's that would be crazy yeah I just did this manually just so we could get a nice look of what we're doing right so at first we're gonna build this out and it is gonna be a lot of markup here but then eventually all this data will be pulled in from our content management system so there really will be nothing but just the bare bones in this component so you wouldn't you want to normally want to leave it like that where you have so much going on you know in one component okay all right and I should only have a few minutes left two minutes all right what do we do for two minutes I know we do for two minutes we commit this stuff so I don't forget so you get status all right we can see what we've done we've edited the hero component we added the functionality to be able to pass in the minimum height as a prop all right we worked on the server just to get the route 1 where we wanted and then we've also added in this new component admission CAS so let's get add and I'm gonna just add in a dot because that puts everything in there wait Nietzsche says github is down whoa github is down it's working for me maybe it's just down regionally let me know is it down how many people have github down right now let me know in the chat I mean I'm gonna try to push either way but okay so it is working for some people well hopefully it'll work for us okay so we're gonna add a little commit message here to be a new feature and say add admissions page component alright this that works all right and my time he was just starting to go off so that means I have about 20 seconds left so we have something set up here that it will automatically format our code and it will run some tests assuming everything passes then we're good to go with this commit so if you do want to work on this on your own computer then just be aware that all this will happen when you try to commit using yarn cm instead of the normal method of committing it looks like everything passed and let's see if we can get this to push to github hey it worked ok so I'm guessing maybe github is down regionally I mean that kind of makes sense it would be odd if github goes down everywhere but I mean not unheard of but okay all right so that's the the timer for y'all didn't hear the time I heard the timer so anyway timers up so now I'm gonna go to the chat and pick up where you left off and answer all the questions that are there it's about 2 o'clock p.m. Eastern time so it's my time I have a meeting at 3 p.m. so I can answer questions for about 45 minutes if I have that many questions all right so let's get to it okay so Phoenix asks a little bit about an grok like the how and why of it so and Rock is a service that allows you to run something locally on your machine share a link and then somebody else can see what you're working on as you're working on it so you make changes you save it in your editor it automatically shows up on their screen so you can imagine this would be really useful for like showing a client updates you know potentially if if your pair programming or something like that and you want to see I'm say like pair programming remotely right and you want to be able to see the changes you know immediately I have the other person see the changes immediately and be able to inspect it and dev tools right it works and it works out really well for this live stream so that you all also have access to all the changes immediately without me having to push it to a server somewhere how that works internally I have no idea Jovie says have you done a high fidelity prototype you mean like like a sketch file this interactive type of prototype no we didn't I don't remember if we did some of that earlier on but at this point no I just go right from the little sketch I did and we have enough components that we can kind of go right into this to be honest with you it's faster for me to just throw up some code like this and adjust it a little bit than to do this in sketch or something like sketch so as long as if I was doing some like really different design it probably wouldn't be the case but with with these design elements and material design in general I've worked with it so much that it is faster for me just to code things and with material UI we have so many prebuilt things so I didn't I didn't really see the need to do a prototype first all right Divya says hello everyone after getting out 40plus interviews with node and Express I finally started learning react and also bought Steven critters course on udemy I've read a few media mill articles as well awesome that's really awesome congratulations let's see Christmas's looks really weird on laptop sighs all right I don't remember what part looks weird the whole thing or a specific part of the page let me know Divi s asked if I had a haircut I did I got a haircut laughs last week I told him to go really short so it still looks like it's a fresh haircut thanks for noticing what do you all think haircut good bad let me know in the chat it's superimportant which I'll think about my haircut Chris says no the smaller viewport height on the admissions page oh okay so you're saying the hero section with a smaller height looks weird okay yeah I could see how potentially if we had a wider screen that was a little bit short it might look weird I I really think it's what it's going to happen is this going to end up depending on what image we have here and we'll adjust the height to fit the image but we'll see alright it says there's bad there's no subtitles yeah sorry about that I don't know how we would subtitle a live a live stream I mean potentially if we get somebody to add subtitles afterwards at least the recordings can be subtitled but unfortunately I only speak English alright DVS says please suggest some kind of learning approach I should be open to while going forward or threeact yes the best advice I have for learning and this is not just with react but everything is try to do a little bit every day so it's always fresh in your mind if you can avoid it you know don't do like every Saturday I'm gonna do a bunch of stuff and then I'm not gonna do anything else with it all week right you will forget so much you know you'll learn but not nearly as fast as if you broke that down instead of doing like 8 hours on Saturday you did you know about an hour every day so I'd stick to something like that and then just be consistent with it michael says i was wondering whether you could use that card theme on the faculty list page also it would keep the site's theme consistent yeah we might be able to yeah I didn't think about that but you're right we could definitely just use cards for the faculty oh oh yeah I'll consider that I mean we already have that page done so I'd hate to go back and do more since there's so much else to do but I kind of do like that that suggestion Christopher says the spacing between the cards and the banner above them is different the spacing between the cards and the banner should be larger or equal to the spacing between the cards okay cool yeah let me stuff like that like I said we're not gonna worry about details right now but I am interested in stuff like that so especially like if you see issues like that and you have time please make a an issue on github on the github repo and then that way I can go back and check those out Aniki says I don't put much stock in testimonials a website puts their themselves they're gonna cherry pick most of them most of the time it still makes sense to put them there yeah you're right you're right thanks for sure divya says do you like those cards to open as modal's like the design Cora had some time back but they changed it back to normal for you and the answer sometimes I like these using modal's and sometimes not I it just kind of depends on what content the content we're willing to and potentially so if there's not really a lot of content a modal does make sense but if there's enough content for a separate page I like having a separate page with its own URL just for for SEO purposes I like that michael says put the cards in a div then adding a line items stretch to the div should make them all the same height shouldn't it yeah you know what Michael I I know we've handled this issue before so I was kind of thinking of just going back to some of the older code and seeing like how did we fix that but you're right it's gonna be something like that that'll make all these the same what'll end up happening though is you know there'll be some space at the bottom so no matter what it's gonna look a little audit but I'd rather have white space below this and the card come down here then to obviously have the cards be different it's it's slightly less weird to have the same height of the cards with white space at the bottom of the card let's see Krister Braun says 15 to 1 student faculty ratio is not centered vertically yeah you right it does look a little bit off huh yeah like that's another thing that's like a perfect issue right because that's an easy fix that either I could clean up one day when I will have a few minutes and I try to get you know just figure out something I can do in five minutes or if somebody else especially somebody who's a beginner wants to contribute to a project they can pick that up and you know submit a pull request for that as well to one I'm not sure how to pronounce that correctly but tu a an with a little symbol over top of the a it says view react or angular which do you like I like reacts I haven't used angular since angular 1 was out and I wasn't that great with it I don't think it was angular's fault I think it was just my inexperience I haven't tried view but I've heard good things so really I can only I only have experience with reacts so but I do really like using react new sources do we need to connect project one two three or should we follow project five yeah all the projects are separate projects so you don't have to go through project one two and three you could go to directly to project five if you like or you could you know you just check out video titles and and see if there's certain topics that you want to learn more about but each project is slightly different in terms of the technology that we've used so maybe you know just want to check out each project to see what we're using and then you know watch the one that you're most interested in noble savage says hi oh hi Jesse love to all hey how's it going thanks for joining us see Krister says add a search function a simple filter are we talking about a search for majors I kind of I want them to be displayed so I mean we already have like a sitewide search but you can actually click to say like I just want to search for majors so that's already there you know and it's already going to be accessible from this page but here is more like look at all the stuff we have so I kind of want users to be able to see it all I'm assuming that that's what you're talking about was the the list of majors Hill says wood is react I'm new here react is a JavaScript library that helps you to build progressive web apps so it's kind of hard to explain if you want to get into more detail you check out the react website you could read a lot about it but you know the short story is it's just another way to make to build websites or apps using javascript so it's just kind of like a certain pattern and way of you know building your app like who says we've been working on the search for months and still haven't got it looking good yeah we're gonna have to go back to the search soon we I finally have part of the reason why we put it on hold is I didn't have the data set up like I needed to for the search to actually be like 100% functional but now I do have the data set up so now it makes more sense to go back in and finish it and try to make it look as good as we can see Julio says you use any react extension to format JSX automatically yeah we have some Auto formatting going on with es lint like on on save with the visual studio code plugins and we also have using what is it husky prettier in ES lint whenever we commit it Auto formats the code so no matter what code kind of code you write if you go to commit it it's going to format it in the style that that we like which is we're using standard standard Jas style which is kind of nice because you can do it however you want in terms of you know tabs spaces semicolons no semicolons it doesn't matter it'll all be put into the same style once it gets committed okay cool Nikki says using the extra small zero like we did here would probably be the same thing as false sincere as a false e value cool I didn't think about it I mean I the way it worked so that's that's cool but yeah you're right michael says since you know they're working delete all but one moderate and then copy and paste that yeah oh you mean all these lists yeah yeah I'll do that I mean I just we didn't have time today during the stream but that's the the next step is basically getting rid of all of these turning one of them into a component so it'll be in its own component and then importing that component and just iterating over the data which will probably pull the data in from a content management system which we happen to be using WordPress and we'll use graph QL or the REST API to pull the data in we'll just map over at all it'll come in in JSON format and then it'll put out onto the page as many of these as we want and we won't have to have it cluttered up with with all this markup it'll basically just be like this you know one line with a couple of props and that way this component will stay you know nice and small easily readable if you want to see like how to do something like that you can check out some of the previous videos I'm pretty sure we just did that exact thing last week and see okay Chris or says the code you're writing is redundant store at least an array of arrays and iterate yeah yeah that's exactly right Chris's use dot map yeah Christopher that's so if you check out our other components that's exactly what we've what we've been doing so I guess a good example is like our drawer menu so the entire side navigation menu is it's here as an array of objects and then you know when it actually you know the actual component is just one component that just gets printed out you know over and over again but when I'm what I'm trying to nail down the design I always like to do it like this first because it just gives me a lot more control it I don't have to worry about all the props are passing in and things like that it's just you know I'm just putting markup on the page and I'm editing it you know it's it's really simple once I have it to the point where it's like okay I like this you know I think I'm definitely gonna go with this then I turn it into a component and then after that we can always edit it a bit but for now it's just kind of testing it out you know my name is like don't make another component if you're not sure if you even need that that on the page yet if you're even going to use it all right ladies singing so Phoenix is saying instead of selecting all the Li tags one by one you could use command control G what so what does that do what's the command controls G do last my place or it autoscroll me down to the bottom okay so officially it seems like github is working now for most of you so maybe it was down briefly amir says we can have some fake data objects for now until we get to CMS ready yeah we could I mean since I already have this data in the CMS I think it'd be okay yeah we could just pull it from the CMS but for now I was really more worried about like what would my idea for aligning these even look right at all would it look terrible so that was kind of more what we were trying to get there but I would actually like to see it with the real the real data so that will probably be after I turn it into its own component the next step would then be to pull in the real data David said how did you fill in those Li simultaneously okay so we used I don't know what the shortcut is on ever for everything but I can select this text and then on a Mac I press command D and it selects the next instance of that particular string you know all the way down so I can keep selecting it so normally you only use it for like two or three things in this case I don't know I thought it was kind of cool to try it out on a bunch of things just to see how it worked and it worked fine there was no lag or anything so and it looked I thought it kind of looked cool to have it all typing out so yeah normally I would probably do a find and replace if it were more but it just so happened it was pretty easy to just go away down with the with command D lenovo says how you doing Jesse it's me Anna I am doing well I always enjoy your stream enough how come your name's Lenovo yoga now on here anyway thanks for watching and I'm glad you're doing well it also says nice nice haircut Thanks see Ahmir says can we get that live link sure the end rock link yeah sorry about that I pasted it in earlier but I'm not sure if those of you who joined later can see it or not so I'll paste that in again and we also have the dev site which is not quite as uptodate but we have our dev site available too and that's it shouldn't be that slow I'm pretty sure I said it to always have an instance open with next so it shouldn't have to load up a new instance anyway michael says don't adjust the height to fit the image adjust the image to fit the height well what I was thinking Michael is it's possible that I might have to put a certain image in like somebody higher up than me might say you have to use this image and then I'll be stuck with an image so I'll have to make it work so yeah so I may not have the ability to choose what image I want Phoenix says what exactly is firebase and flutter okay so firebase is a Google service I people is it normally used for apps as like like a database for apps I'm not sure what people normally use it for but I'm I think it's normally for apps so it's it's like a databaseasaservice thing flutter so flutter is really new as far as I know and I haven't learned very much about it at all what I'm pretty sure it's a way to make apps and that's that's about all I know so I haven't learned anything about flutter yet other than that and that might night of it might not be the case so don't take my word for it Christopher Brown says no reason to use cards for faculty this in my opinion okay cool yeah like I said I think I probably won't put the cards in now just because we have so much other stuff to work on and the faculty list looks okay right now so for those of you who haven't been following the project this is a very very big site so the strategy right now is to get all the data there make sure it's accessible and seofriendly and it looks decent and it's fast step 2 after we launch is to go into each section meet with the people at the University who would be in charge of each section like you know that's their department or the professors that teach these courses and then figure out how we can best style things and what content we should put on there to make it as good as it can be so we'll kind of slowly go through there and then train those people to edit the content through WordPress so the old website is just so slow and it's not great on mobile that any pretty much anything we do will be a big improvement so if it seems like I'm being a bit sloppy with the details I mean that's that's kind of the point is that we just need this thing to be done and it doesn't need to be perfect because it's you know within the next few months we're gonna be going through some sections and changing them completely alright thirsty pooch says I have got a question when using nodejs on windows and some exercises which include such as gulp when I try to run go up I get module not found why is this should I use yarn get module not found when you try to run go up I guess you'd need to have make sure you have gulp installed you would yeah you shouldn't you should definitely run npm install or yarn first to make sure that it's gulp is installed that would be my guess i'm it's hard to say without you know seeing the project see what's going on but yeah definitely make sure that you act you do have gulp installed like try and your command line running gulp and then putting space v to see if it'll give you your version of gulp if it doesn't then maybe gulps honest though let's see see I think I'm almost through you checked my time ok still pretty good on time so I may be able to answer a few more questions before my meeting Ahmir says I tried angular react in view and in my experience I found view better you can say it's the best of both worlds alright that's interesting I definitely like to try view at some point it's just you know all my projects now have been react to kind of make sense for me to just try to get better at react because I have a lot of things now that I'm gonna have to maintain you in react but maybe for a side project or something but small something small I could try out you Dex Troyer of world says SAS or styled components I haven't decided on what my favorite way to style react components is honestly I've tried a few different ways and I just I keep trying more ways so within the same project I've done like two or three different ways I'm still trying to decide Ivo says what's p5d 88 that's project 5 day 88 so this is the fifth project we've done on this live stream and it is day 88 of the project we really stream 88 so I don't stream every day but we've been working on this project for about six or seven months something like that all right Krista Brown says to make cards same height on profile card set high to 100% okay cool I'm gonna alright I was good about to try but maybe I want to try it right now cuz I need to make sure I get through these questions but thank you for that okay so Phoenix saying that the shortcut he gave earlier was for selecting all instances of that particular those particular characters okay cool I'll have to try that all right Christopher says view is better but it's a little weirder to learn than react okay our sim says jQuery is still the best hey I made a bunch of stuff in jQuery before I learned react so I still have things that I maintain that her jQuery based Krister says you're composed thing is like SAS in JavaScript I like it that way much easier to use Christopher says jQuery isn't relevant anymore I don't know I if you're building new stuff yeah I'm not gonna use jQuery but there are a lot of sites that are out there that use jQuery so I guess it depends on what you're working on like the odds of going into an existing project and having to use some jQuery are pretty good I mean I don't know what the current stats are but I mean it I think it's still the majority of websites on the internet have jQuery on them so yeah I would never pick jQuery if I were making something new but like I said I still have to maintain sites at at jQuery so it's definitely still good to know it because you'll probably see it and and work on it and I mean shoot like before reacts and all that I mean jQuery was where it was at Anoop says have you tried styled components does it work with Internet Explorer the last time I use styled components was for react native so I don't really I never tested it obviously Internet Explorer so I'm not I'm not sure about that does anybody know I don't see why it wouldn't work you know assuming that the content the markup they gets spit out and actually sent to the browser is something that Internet Explorer could use I it definitely could work skip monday says hello from Nigeria hey how's it going thanks for watching a mere says view combined angularjs and react so if you know both I guess it's fine such V if or ng if and mount component did mount so as I said it's best of both worlds Phoenix says I have a tampermonkey script which checks for jQuery on websites a lot of site still has it yeah sure Krister says the problem with jQuery is that it contains a bunch of bloat that you probably won't be using and that slows down a lot of sites like I was applying for a job and I checked their site and it was slow I even did an audit on it jQuery is the main problem oh yeah for sure yeah like I said I'm not gonna pick jQuery now for a new project but it's I wouldn't ignore jQuery in terms of like knowing about it knowing basics about jQuery just because like if you're a freelancer and you work on existing sites for people you're gonna see jQuery right if you're going to go work for a large company that's not like one of the big tech companies you're probably gonna work with jQuery right there there are very few companies that don't have jQuery going on somewhere let's see Anoop says what are your thoughts on the serverside render react oh I almost always use serverside rendering reacts because it's a must for search engine optimization okay so I there's a nice performance benefit on initial load as well but mainly like you need that serverside render rendering for search engines to be able to see your content if you're pulling it from api's so yeah I definitely recommend that and for me you know over the last year the easiest way to do that has been just to use next jazz because it has it it works automatically you don't have to set it up Ahmir says the fun part is angular uses jQuery even it has internal JQ Lite thing in it when jQuery is not available yeah you're right did they still have that I remember an angular one they did have that that they had their own version of jQuery builtin Aamir says I decided to make my own version of jQuery with es6 that's cool Christopher says I preferred you as much coding as possible in CSS so that the JavaScript doesn't slow down the site oh yeah for sure CSS is definitely more performant than than JavaScript so it's good to know all the ways you can use CSS to do things that frequently do get done with with JavaScript crow says serverside rendering is not better for a landing page and SEO question mark I'm not sure what the question is yes serverside rendering yeah I'm not exactly sure what the question is so just say like with without serverside rendering if you're trying to run a react app and you're pulling your data in from an API these the crawler right your search engine BOTS that's going to go to your site it's not going to stick around long enough to wait for the data to come back from that API call it's gonna look at it and it's gonna see basically no content whatever content you are pulling from the API isn't going to be there so it's not gonna index those things in search so that's why you need to be rendered server side and then will get sent to the client is going to be HTML right HTML CSS whatever you know so that's why you you want that if you have a project where you don't care about the SEO then maybe you don't want to do serverside rendering I've done projects where I didn't need SEO so I didn't but you know for me that's the main reason why I do serverside rendering okay I've gotten to the end of the chat just in time to get some data prepared for my next meeting and let's see all right we have some further discussion in there about s CSS and things like that okay all right I'm an industry now I will probably streaming in tomorrow thank you all so much for watching and for all your help in the in the live chat so get a little bit done today not you know not totally finished with this page but we got a decent start and you can check out remember you check out the code the links in the description of the video and if you have any questions to check me out on in social media I think my Twitter handles there if you go to my youtube page which is linked I have links to a lot of my other social media things so whatever you're most comfortable with just find me on there and you know I'd be happy to help you out with whatever you're working on so until tomorrow have a great day
