this week I've been building note app with reactjs so it's like playing Lego I just finished the first basic version of not app so for today let's call it that day this app uh with the noes is like a short app to practice I've noticed that react has been changing really quickly I mean the tutorial was from this year here and some of the uh some of the comment some of the methods uh were uh outdated I want to style it a bit more uh because the basic functionality is there so I will come back to it tomorrow it's Wednesday and I'm pretty excited today because I just found out that there's first 100 subscribers to my channel it's pretty important uh because you know I haven't been a vlogger before and uh the aim of this Vlog is not to be a vlogger but to share the journey to share the story and to motivate others to learn to code and also to motivate myself because I'm taking a lot from your feedback from your uh from your support the thing is that uh it's better to create for people than to create for just only for yourself because I also take a lot of feedback a lot of motivation a lot of uh con a lot of uh advice uh from you I also had some voices from you that uh what I show is helpful is motivating also for you I love feedback or I would say even better I like feed forward so I don't like feedback so thing that's are just only based on feelings um and they don't give any reasoning I like feedback or even better feed forward which is a kind of feedback that that that gives you also the just ification and makes you move forward this feed forward is the kind of feedback for me that that is aimed to make a person to whom you give it uh develop to go further to motivate this person and I love it so I love this constructive feedback because it makes me grow it makes me get motivated even more to what I'm doing it's Thursday yesterday in the evening I was fighting with modernizer and my uh app I wanted to have the not dragable but uh on mobile it was a bit of a problem because uh this dragable um destroyed the functionality of the buttons that we're working on Hover it's uh just the app for me for practicing so I hope this enough for now and I will continue on adding other functionalities today I got a great news to share with you I was chosen as M to uh Tech leaders program this is the program organized by the Polish chapter of women in technology and I'm really excited to take part in it so I was chosen from hundreds of people who wanted to become a m as my mentor I chose Eva and I hope to talk with her really soon and the program is totally for free for us when it comes to mentees and I will have four months of work work with Eva and I want to focus on JavaScript with her and I'm really excited because as I read she's also interested in design and she also programs a lot in JavaScript so I hope that these for months uh will be really really U productive and I hope I will develop simply faster having this kind of Mentor uh so it's like a gift like a gift that I got we have first day in the evening this is how the app looks right now you can drag and drop the notes you can edit them as you see when they are shorter they do not have this ellipses here uh when they are longer than 30 um characters they got a ellipses so I can drag and drop the notes I can delete them I can edit them save the changes I can also clean the board and add just only my notes as you see when I add a new note in order to differentiate it it from the crowd it has got different color but when I edit it the font color is the same as the rest of notes so this brownish color is just only for the state when a note hasn't been changed yet and it's a new Noe the new nodes are distributed randomly so in order to find it on a huge screen it's better to to have a different color I can clean the board and I can add just only my notes on mobile the position of the buttons is an easy to touch area so it's at the bottom you can also add a note delete a note uh or edited it's just emulation here but it shows what I mean and and you can clean the board to make this work I come measured a few times on GitHub this week and I started with set up of react and started with um setting up the notes and basic functionalities I started building this um app using the tutorial uh however I added also additional functionalities like cleaning the board or um optimizing the performance or styling it up differently I also played with set index of them um because I wanted to make it more real um and if you take something from the bottom it should appear at the Top If You place it here I will leave this app for the time being of course you can add a lot of additional functionalities here or customization for users but uh I won't do it now um because the most important name in it was practicing components States and generally doing the app in reactjs this week I was mostly focused on reactjs and building the node app I was also doing some from free out camp map I've been also learning a bit more about build and install tools I know it need much more practice and using in the projects but at least right now I differentiate them more into to install and build so into those who run the tasks for you and into those that just only install the stuff for you some of them are really complex and I don't need them right now for my projects that are quite small but I got a better knowledge of what is for what practice makes perfect so while using them I hope to learn the most next week I'm going to focus on another tutorial uh connected with react and I want to build another small react app uh in order to practice next week we are also having the Meetup of front and Malaga and I hope to learn a lot about marrying SVG with the free JS keep on doing stay motivated and see you next week I almost forgot subscribe
