i will be talking about the current involvement for web development uh i will be talking about what text editor i'm using and what terminal and what shell i'm using um because i experienced in in many in many talks after the meet ups that people are constantly discussing what they are using and what would be good and the advantages and disadvantages of all the text editors so i just quickly going to show you my setup and afterwards we can have a collective discussion but what you are using and what's best so i'm using visual studio code and item you can see here is visual studio code and here is item how many of you are using visual studio code okay that's a lot um yeah so i i tried many many text editors i tried atom visual studio webstorm brackets and ultimately i ended up with visual studio code um yes i was really amazed when i was using visual studio that there is a thing like intellisense and for csharp development you have to use basically visual studio and so i tried visual studio code and i'm happy ever since and i'm also going to talk about item the terminal i use because the basic terminal is bash i think or it's called terminal something like this however um i will not spend much time here because i'm not using it that that often and also we just do the code comes with a terminal on its own um yes i think that's it another important information is that i'm using a mac macbook pro and yeah so the first thing i want to talk about is visual studio code and the features are displayed here if you click on the link here you should go to the home page which is not displayed doesn't matter we'll just copy it or we'll even i will even yeah we'll even just open it here and show you it should work right now yeah awesome so as i'm working on here i'm going for visual studio code no that's not so great here and here are the main features displayed first of all it has it has intellisense which is practically uh just syntax highlighting and also autocomplete i was very amazed when i encountered this uh feature it basically allows you to suggest you the methods of objects or functions whatever and i will afterwards show a short showcase on how to use it and then it will be clear and much easier to understand there's also debugging involved in visual studio code so you don't need to debug in chrome or whatever browser you're using you have also built in git comments and it's ultimately easy to extend extend but i think nowadays most of the editors are easy to extend i also created uh or even wrote an article about hmm about the visual studio code extensions i'm using and this is actually the article it has reached pretty much good success i've just listed all my extensions i'm using i'm using extensions for html like auto close tag rename tag html snippets markdown extensions of course javascript extensions this is very important debugger for chrome you can easily start debugging without a lot of configuration maybe i can show you that as well of course eslint linting checking your code yes in modules intellisense so if you're if you're interested just go to the article and check out the extensions they are pretty nice for developing yes that's the article about extensions and the next thing i want to show you is item is anyone using item okay one awesome then just a short and quick introduction to item just give you an overview just type in an item and it should be the first one it's a terminal especially for mac os and if i go to features you can see what what you can do with with item you can split panes you have hotkey windows you can search for stuff you can autocomplete and yeah so different features that makes the use of of a terminal very easy and efficient i never really used to use the integrated terminal of mac os i started using item right away because i was recommended to use it and i was always happy yes so that's the item part and if i go through the presentation i'm also using it with i think i will just put it in here because that's too complicated otherwise i also combine it with the chat shell is anyone else using the chat shell one nice i use it with the um or however it's called it has some nice uh teams and and features and also using the auto suggestions we just show you in in practice as well there's also a good article and i will show the slides afterwards so you can check that out as well since my setup here is a little bit weird i will go right away to the demonstration part created a nice a nice slide here yes so now i'm going to demonstrate how i'm using both visual studio code and the item just figuring out how to use it properly here i think the best thing is to just put it in there and looking on top so maybe another nice feature is to use spectacle is someone using that for mac os it's just that you can switch with your window it comes by default the most linux distribution probably yeah it comes on default but yeah but mac doesn't have has have something like this so spectacle on top the the glasses is a nice tool and that's for free and it's working great so as you can see here um i can't really stand on the side yeah as you can see here is that's the terminal i have used uh used a nice team with coloring and showing the git status and i'm currently at the developers rising repository you the allies allies yeah that comes out of the box and they are a lot especially a lot with git that's very useful this can be very useful you can see here and for example if i want to do something i can get status which is just just and it shows me my current status of git so what's also very nice and works well with which you study code is now when i'm typing or maybe let's have it like this if i'm typing yeah probably so so if i'm typing code dot there is i've installed it in the path i can just open visual studio code and now it opens of course in my other window but here it is and here i'm having the terminal on my side so i can always work with the terminal here on this side and can work with the editor on this side so what i wanted to demonstrate now is just to see how visual studio code works you have options here to show you the folders and files you have a search you have a known section for your git stuff you have a debugger mode and the extensions listed and it's also very easy to install uh install extensions you can just add them here and yeah activate them install them uninstall them etc uh what's interesting is also maybe it was a little bit bigger here no is it better no yeah you also have a console here you have a debug console you have a terminal and depending on what shell you have installed you can also use the comments here you see just work working fine and it's also if you have a linter or something else installed it displays all the problems and stuff that is not working so what i did here is as you know we have a home page where we uh for developers rising and i just added our new partner that is we accelerate um if a just and search everything is working easily we accelerate you can see i just put in a div here a diff class this section here and now one of the benefits with visual studio code is if you can you can simply click on the tab here just show me the working tree here and show me the difference and it's side by side showing you what you have added or changed and it's working perfectly on the side on the side here you even have a mark where the change in your file is so if you're if you're having a large file with thousand lines um then this really helps and in this case i quickly can see okay i have here added a div so now what i'm going to do is i use the terminal and i'm most of the time i'm using the terminal terminal to use git stuff because it's just faster so once again i use the check uh git status to check what i've what i've done now say okay i'm using also alias here and said okay are using a git commit with a message and i say just add new partner partner wii x blur rate accelerate is this type correctly yeah um or maybe with a double d you can also use it like oh holy what's that so now that it says uh still something missing okay i have a logo so just get at all very easy just and then i can ah what i also want to show you is the autocomplete i just go in with that and it shows me the last the last commit i did with with a type of message like that this so i use i just say add yeah a new partner's logo awesome i don't want to do that remove so this is not working what i'm doing now is just pressing ctrl c to get out of this whatever it that was i have no idea so i'm trying it again still just auto completing it what now it's working right no no you need to either oh true true true true awesome now it's working and now instead of get push i set the upstream already so just gp and now it pushes to the master branch and that's pretty easy what i also want to show you is now this one resolvers so it's it it's connected and knows that there is there are no changes and what i want to do or show you as well is to go to the help section and if you haven't worked with visual studio code you can easily just download it install it and then you can go to the hmm interactive playground that is what i wanted to show you and here actually i think this is amazing and i haven't seen this anywhere else it has an interactive playground where you can try to use the features so here is a interactive playground you can see the numbers here and you can simply do some as it is explained here you can combine different keys and for example add multiple cursors and write different stuff awesome but you can also maybe if i want to just switch lines or co or multiple multiply lines can also do that very easily i can switch them around that's very easy i also can do is i'm not quite sure if i've installed this yeah just on the line going down and adding i don't know what is this here oh no idea maybe i can add another comment hi that's it awesome i can also delete it cool so that's a great feature and it just goes through the stuff here what i want to show you is actually the intellisense which is amazing here is a basic express example and what intellisense allows you to do is if you type app now and then dot then it should suggest you things which it doesn't ah i'm not i it does but this is not optimized because that's the playground doesn't matter it it does what it should do um it just suggests you features and method that's not working really in the playground maybe i'm using it for more on top yeah yeah i don't think it's working like it should here doesn't matter you can try it on your own and it hopefully will uh work um yeah line action i'm talking about that refactoring so there is plenty of other stuff on how to speed up your coding and i think it's pretty good especially if you're starting with the free code cam curriculum you have the box where you write your code inside and at the beginning it is okay but when you later have to write longer code i think it's more and more important to have a good editor with syntax highlighting and also suggestions and what i've used in the curriculum when i was more advanced and working from the advanced algorithms i was always writing the stuff in inside the text editor like atom or visual studio code and i think it's just easier to work with it test it and see if you're working the algorithm the right way instead of using the field on the homepage yeah i think that's it um i think those are the most important things i just wanted to go through since the setup is really weird here for me i'm not going to demonstrate more um yes oh yeah i have an introduction or maybe i can close somewhere is the presentation yes here's the background credit for somewhere tella from unsplash yeah just about me a little bit um i'm coorganizing this meetup with rob with robert and i'm a business law student i'm working as a frontend developer currently and i'm focusing on machine learning and i also did if anyone is interested in machine learning i also did where is that or i even even wrote an article actually if i find that it would be nice yeah it's here so if you if you are whoa if you're trying to get into machine learning there's a great course online it's from kuzera cozero is also an online learning platform it has very it has a lot of different courses um i think also in css and javascript and stuff like that but i did the machine learning course and i also wrote tips and tricks on how to do it i think it takes three months or something and it's just amazing so i can also recommend to check especially this course because the teacher is amazing but also the platform called zera it's amazing yes this was my setup now we can discuss your setups or if you have any questions just feel free to ask thank you very much
