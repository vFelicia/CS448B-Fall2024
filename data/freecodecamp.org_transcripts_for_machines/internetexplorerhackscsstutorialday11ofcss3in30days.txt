hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day 11 and all about internet explorer unfortunately so now before we go forward internet explorer has taken a lot of liberty to try and improve their software and they're on like version 15 or something crazy right now i don't really pay attention because i don't really care but hopefully you're watching this at some point in the future where none of this is an issue anymore however there are some people who still use internet explorer 9 and below which is crazy talk but luckily in css 3 and css we can we can kind of make some accommodations and in my case i just like to remove the styles for those browsers all together so i'm going to show you how to do that with something called conditional comments jump over here and check this out you can see here i'm going to show you what a conditional comment looks like and what it does so basic conditional comment looks like this if i e and it's wrapped in basically an html comment and then you can put any html in between including links to css like a different ie style sheet and then you close it off like so you could select different types of browsers internet explorer versions rather six seven eight nine by using the following conditional comments you can use a specific uh conditional comment for uh say a version of internet explorer or lower so if lte stands for less than or equal to ie six seven eight or nine that styles internet explorer six or less seven or less eight or less nine or less or rather those browsers register those comments and then we have uh the opposite of that which is greater than or equal to so you could style greater than or equal to ie six seven eight or nine or i just like to use the uh the catch all if i e so that's internet explorer six through nine and that will be recognized and rendered by those specific browsers so jump over here in our code editor and all we have in day 11 you can go ahead and download that is an index file and an ie.css file gonna run through them show you what's going on and then we can be on our merry way and not think about ie anymore so right here you can see in the head of our html i have a conditional comment that's selecting ie 6 through 9 and i'm just adding an ie style sheet so only internet explorer 6 or 9 will recognize and render that comment and then we'll tie into our css file which looks like this basically i'm just i did an asterisk selector which is a catchall everything i'm removing the background color and line height resetting that really aggressively removing the course files button and the level two heading uh tab that sits on the side of of the container in the web page that we have here and then i found a complete css reset at this link that's just an aggressive reset just resets everything to just basic black and white text and that's all i want for ie six through nine because i don't wanna have to accommodate those browsers so i just show them my markup which if it's semantic they should be able to read it and get the meaning of the website anyway so let me just go back to our browser or index.html file here and i want to show you one last thing i've done right under the conditional comments i've put conditional comments through from six through nine and basically just some text so if you're this is a test method so if you're viewing it from ie 6 7 8 or 9 you'll see the proper the respective comment for the browser that you are using so why don't we test that i've taken the liberty of uploading this to my website on my domain and uh there's a webpage website called netrenderer.com where you can basically get a screen grab of an ie browser of a live web page so if you go to netrenderer and type in bradhusty.ca dev u e w w uh and choose internet explorer nine because for some reason seven and eight don't work on my website but nine does and if i hit render basically what's going to happen is it's going to take a few seconds and then it's going to give me a rendering screenshot of what internet explorer 9 how it sees my website so here you go it's just basic black and white it's got the text you can read it and then if you notice here you're viewing with internet explorer 9. you can't see that in my chrome browser because obviously it's not ie but here it is you're viewing with internet explorer 9 and the styles are completely wiped so that all they can do is read it perfect that's all i really need so i know that was kind of a quick lesson but feel free if you really care to utilize this strategy on your own blogs and websites if you just want to remove the styles altogether you could do simply what i did or if you want to take a little bit more of an accommodating approach you can do that as well play around there are a number of different uh browsing test browser testing tools such as browser stack but that's paid whereas netrender is just a screen grab of what ie sees your website uh how it sees your website so really that's kind of all i didn't want to spend a lot of time on this because it's quite simple conditional comment an ie css file and just remove the styles pretty straightforward uh i hope you're having a great day and tomorrow i'll see you in day 12 which is gonna be fun we're gonna be playing around with some css3 variables
