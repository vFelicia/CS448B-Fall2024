yo this is mike williams or you might know me on social as yo remy um so i built quite a few marketplaces in the past and uh probably one of the more notable ones uh studio time which is an airbnb for music studios uh most of the mvps i build are without code and using share tribes um hosted marketplace solution which is turnkey so i'm gonna make a brief tutorial right now first i wanna walk you through setting up an initial marketplace using sharetribe's hosted platform and it's great for creating an initial mvp so you can use it for creating marketplaces for selling products or goods rentals or services but for the sake of this to kind of keep it as close parallel as airbnb as possible we're going to go with rentals and we're actually just going to call it studio bnb and pretty much make it uh studio time meets airbnb all right so let's go ahead and get started and we're going to walk through this right now so i'm just going to go ahead and put my email in and select the country and the language which is actually going to be the default language for the marketplace so that's step two and just gonna enter my name here so and then create a password and then as i mentioned the different marketplace types they have that share tribe suitable for is products or goods rentals or services so we're going to go with renault since we're going to do an airbnb so we're going to call it studio b and b once again and agree to their terms and then create so this is creating the marketplace right now all right so that's the initial sign up process literally just from going to sharetribe.com and just clicking on getting started so it automatically um sets up a marketplace for me up here i did two previous ones that had to delete the videos so this is studio b and b two um but that would be the urlstudiobnb.sharetribe.com and we're gonna close out this little help chat but they drop you right into the main admin dashboard um it created a user account for me up here so that was using my first name last name email entered and password and then you can see right here i have a user account and it's just selected as an admin so now i'm on the dashboard so they have a really good onboarding process right here and we're just going to go ahead and set up the marketplace so we're going to add the basic information for the marketplace and right here so the marketplace name was already entered so that was studio time same thing up at the language you can enter multiple languages uh but i would not recommend having multiple languages and dealing with localization and whatnot for simply validating an mvp uh that's typically not the best thing to do when you're trying to validate a marketplace uh so since this is like a airbnb for music studios our slogan is just going to be um find and book music studios there we go and then the kind of tagline is just going to be the easiest way to find and book music videos just keep it simple and then the search help text is actually going to be um when you click on the search icon at the very top and the top nav it drops down right here and it says search is a hint text so you can actually change that uh the help text or hint text so if it's going to be location or keyword based um it's best to kind of pick one and kind of guide a user through this help text so let them know what search for so we're going to use location location uh as a primary search so we're going to say um where are you looking for a studio or where would you like to make music so we'll just have that and then you can have require users to accept um an agreement or some kind of uh text which i would highly recommend because this would be where you could say you know by signing up to the site you agree to accept uh the terms uh privacy policy and then community guidelines i would also recommend having community guidelines for marketplace because that's best we'll just click out so that way you want to put more text and we'll just save that all right so that that was saved and then we're going to click out of this all right so that was the basic details now we're going to click on the design so this is where we can further configure the marketplace for studio b and b in our specific uh look here so i'm going to click on the logo and i actually created a quick little kind of text uh based logo in snappa which is a visual uh design kind of creation tool like right before i did this so i just uploaded that um i would also upload it here for a logo for social sharing for the cover photo which is going to show on the top area kind of like a header section of the home page i'm just going to go ahead and select the image of a music studio and then same thing for the small cover photo so this is if a user is not logged in when they come to the home page you can select the favicon here you can also change the marketplace color so for right now you can see that it's like a blue you know you could change that right here just by simply entering a hex value uh same thing with changing like the slogan color and the description color and then down here is where you could uh change the default uh browse view so when a user go sees the home page and they see listings this would be um the layout or and how they're displayed so there's three different options you can't do combinations of these but you can do a grid a list or a map uh right now the current studio time site is on sharetribe's flex platform which isn't hosted it's on their api um and totally uh custom frontend so it's list and map view just like airbnb is a list in map view but for this invalidating an mvp the grid view is typically the best that's the best experience for users seeing the listings when they come to the home page i would suggest having the display names right below it as far as the metadata being first name with some initial that way you would see like studio listed by in this case like me should be like mike w just said it's kind of a personal touch to the studio um and we're gonna save this we're not gonna add any custom script right now because we're just setting up the basic marketplace all right and so we've gone through the basics of details design we don't really need to go through doing a lot of advanced uh configuration this that's what i'm gonna do in the next tutorial but i wanna walk you through just the uh i would say um start to uh kind of fully functional mvp in this first video top bar is not relevant landing page isn't really relevant because you can't configure that in this let's go to listing categories so if we wanted to create categories which would be the different studio types for instance this is where we could do that because it doesn't have any kind of categories except as default so we'll just keep it default for now because we don't want to do any kind of advanced configuration um we'll do that in the next video and then we'll go through listing filters uh in fields so when someone's creating a listing this is uh the different fields that they'll see so this looks good for now we can just keep it a title a price a detailed description an expiration date we probably don't need this so location and then images so that's good for now for the basics you could add text numbers drop downs checkbox groups and dates so you can totally customize that then we're going to go to order types so to speak a little bit or spend a little bit of time talking about this um for since this is like an airbnb for music studios uh the value prop is being able to discover and book music studios through this marketplace um so they suretripe also accounts for renting out without online payments or with but since our value prop for the mvp is dependent on online payments we're going to remove this the ability to list the studio without accepting online payments there are different use cases for different business models for that would totally make sense uh and it's just good to know that sharetribe does account for for this um and then here's the drop down where you could add others so you can have multiple um i would say uh different order types within a main marketplace so studio bnb could potentially also sell products um offer services for producers and engineers um you can create out of the listings for like requests all sorts of different listing types but generally you want to stick to one and validating that these are just for for you know other people that are trying to validate other types of marketplace mvps and they would probably you know just use these for their specific needs um but since as i mentioned we're not going to allow people to list us to do without payments uh we're just going to go down here and we're going to delete this order type so we just deleted that so right now uh it's just going to be order types running out with online payment and we're just going to modify this a little bit and i'll explain why so the name running out without online payment we don't need this right here it can just be ringing out music studio because this is what someone's going to see is the kind of top level selection when they click post a new listing so we just want this kind of text to be intuitive and the checkout button when someone clicks on the button that's on their listing we don't want it to say you know rent or or whatnot or or buy we want to make it book now so it's a little bit more uh a little bit more intuitive call to action and so since this is a uh renting out and accepting payments we allow them to add price uh select uh the ability to accept payments they don't need a shipping fee since they're not shipping any or selling any goods um or products and then for the availability uh this is where this kind of ties into them having their calendar availability um and that is based off of per hour day or night since we're not doing uh nightly of course it's for studios we're going to select the hour um for availability and that will be our unit pricing units too so we'll just save this and we'll go down so the payment system we're going to click on that so you can configure uh the default currency for your marketplace and then also the minimum transaction size um that's not really relevant for us we're not really worried about the minimum transaction size because we're assuming that the studio hourly rate um if they have hourly minimums as far as they require a certain amount of hours for the booking to take place um then they can just mention that in their description so we don't need to configure that um sharetribe does allow you to use stripe as far as accepting payments and that would be through a strike connect account or through paypal which paypal has a marketplace kind of solution and i can talk about that in the next video with configuration but we're not going to set up either right now because that's a little bit more um it's just it's a simple kind of connect uh entering your your stripe uh kind of ids and then connecting a paypal business account uh so i don't really need to go through that it's fairly intuitive um we're just going to kind of keep going through this initial setup and we'll click on the social media so we don't really need to add a twitter username because we're not going to have any kind of shareability as far as prompting people to tweet you can have a facebook off and they make it super easy to allow for that so it's not just an email and password and you can simply enter facebook client id and client secret right here so i don't need to go set up a facebook app for studio b and b since this is a demo so we're just going to skip through that also um and then you would have your analytics down here and then we don't need to set that up that's just like your google id and then they do have like instruction texts so you can have uh information here you can edit um and that would just expand into a text editor as far as um hint text for people to sign up so for instance you could add some text here that says you know uh if you're signing up as a studio for a user account you can add your studio by clicking post a new listing on the top left so just to make a little bit more intuitive as far as for your users in your marketplace and then we're going to click down here on the email configurations and they make it easy to um configure the emails that you're sending from so this is going to be like the welcome email and you can also put like a kind of a brief onboard email for new users um but this would be like who it's from so if this is like team at studio time it could be like team at studio or studio b and b if you're like team studio b b and like team at studiobnb.com um and that's where you would do that right here and then we're going to go down and this is our main marketplace settings and this is pretty much the last step that we're going to do to set up the entire marketplace mvp for studio bnb uh but some different preferences is allowing users to only join with invites so if you want to kind of close off uh the user registration uh and take advantage of some kind of like invites you could do that um a lot and allow users to invite others that there'd be a field there so we don't really need this because we're allow anyone um there is a configuration where you can only allow registered users to see listings and profiles so it would basically be a home page at the url so like studio b and b uh you know sharechart.com or studiobnb.com and then it would just prompt users to to create an account or log in before they saw the grid review with the listings um i wouldn't really recommend that if you're trying to share a lot of the new listings uh and kind of build some awareness around your listings on social because when you when they click on that link if they're not logged in then it'll just prompt them to log in or create an account um so it's not really like you can't really get a feel of the marketplace if you don't have an account and then something else they have which is really good is only allowing users verified by admins to post a new listing so that could be good uh if you're validating your mvp and in this case studio b and b's uh mvp because i could only select certain users um to be able to upload a new listing and that way i would know that um you know they would be like an approved user in that their studio would be uh you know higher quality studio listing um or you know they that we had some hint text that said you know uh you know email us and and we approve you know uh certain profiles or in your business information um we could kind of go through that uh that process by clicking on this so that would only allow certain users um to post new listings if they're verified uh so as i mentioned uh now to the search preferences uh you can do keyword location search or keyword and location um since typically it's by location uh and that's a little bit more intuitive for users we um we put the hint text for location so we're just going to go ahead and select that uh our default is not kilometers we're going to be based on the us it's going to be miles um and we don't want to only show nearby because we're not going to have a ton of inventory so we might as well show it all and then just the sort based off of you know the distance um we're going to display the listing type in in the main view uh maybe publishing date we don't need that right now but if the marketplace is safer and since every year old maybe it would be great to ha or sorry beneficial to show the listing date so that way people could kind of see what the newest inventory is um if there's no ratings or reviews then they would understand that maybe it's just a new listing so it hasn't been booked yet um you can also it does have a a comment um functionality share try does have that so we're just gonna allow people to comment um and maybe create a discussion on each listing uh just be aware that it might not be beneficial for a kind of dialogue and conversation to be going on on listings so if you notice that you know people are just commenting instead of messaging studios or there's any kind of negative comments about it or whatnot then you can just simply just unselect this and kind of resave that and then the email preferences a cool feature that they also have is uh this newsletter um feature and kind of functionality so every week uh everyone that signed up would get a this kind of newsletter format of all the new listings uh which i think is really good in the very beginning so we're going to go ahead and save these settings and then now that we've gone through this kind of entire process of the basic uh configuration all right so i need to confirm my email address so i'm going to do that so i just click through the email all right so i should be confirmed in that other window all right good some confirmed all right so now we're just going to go through and look at our initial marketplace so there's no listings so we don't have anything right here and we don't have any filters that display or anything i could just simply create one right here um we do see this like hint text from the search that's already populated and i'm just going to go ahead and sign out of the admin account though so that way we can see what uh people visitors that come to the site will see before they create an account with the intent to book or list their studio so i'm just going to go ahead and log out right now all right so as you can see this is the basic uh home page i mean this is actual home page view for the marketplace so this is empty without any listings um but as you see the cover that i uploaded uh the top left has the the menu um that you can expand and then we have the logo that i uploaded uh so we don't have the placeholder blue text anymore up there we have the actual logo and then we have our kind of like tagline right here so so this is the basic marketplace um that users are gonna see and then we do have like an about right there so i'm gonna take you through that really quick all right so i log back in as a user and i'm of course the the admin right now uh so i'm gonna just go through and just show you a little bit more about the admin uh panel right now and some of the functionality so in in the marketplace kind of admin management they have a uh you can click on this and see all the users and select uh users admin you can ban users um if you selected only users with permission compose this is where it would have another column right here where you'll be able to select that uh so that's definitely a good feature they have another um kind of listing management view right here so there's no listings but you'll be able to see all the listings by the listing title so for instance that'd be like the studio name uh the author so like who the user is their username uh the creation and then updated date um and then you can see the categories so for instance if it was like home studio as a category we would be able to see all the home studios and then also the status you also have a transaction view so you'd be able to see transactions and then the different states so it'd be transactions tied to a listing on the status of it as far as like requests accepted completed reviews left or whatnot when it was started the latest activities sort by so that makes it really good as far as like marketplace and kind of user management um who started it and then the other parties that would be the person requesting and then the other party would be the studio that was being requested uh you can actually see the conversation so you can monitor conversations that are going on from user to user so you can see that and then you can also see all the reviews down here there's another view for that and then email users and invite new users so this is the basic uh setup for a airbnb style marketplaces for music studios that we just called studio bnb for the sake of this uh initial tutorial um but it is a fully functioning uh marketplace and pretty much the same exact kind of functionality as basic functionality as airbnb which would be needed to validate this mvp as you can see right now uh this is our marketplace uh called studio bnb which is our airbnb for music studios um and it's pretty bare and basic so we need to do a little bit of configuration and customization so that way we have a little bit more um functionality and features for that we'll need to validate this marketplace so we're not logged in right now so this is what everyone that comes to the site will see as you can see they have the sign up and login in the left side nav um home page and the about page uh the about page how it works privacy policy and terms of service um this is all placeholder text that sharetribe populates um on our marketplace so we're gonna need to go in and edit this and change it so i'm gonna show you how to do that so i'm gonna go ahead and log in right now all right so we're logged in as a user and uh we do have admin permission um so we actually don't do this from the admin panel for editing the about page and how it works uh in those other pages we're just going to click on the the actual about page uh and then you can see each of them in this kind of left side you would just simply click on the edit from each and this takes you to a onpage kind of text editor and then at the very top um you have a little bit of functionality as far as kind of you know what how you can edit it and what you can add but we're not going to spend the time to go through that so we have some other features that we need to customize all right so let's go over back to the admin panel all right so now we're in the admin panel and our basic listing categories since we're only offering music studios uh and then the we're gonna basically have um the the different types of studios as uh filters um that way that'll populate on the homepage and we're sticking to music studios we're not going to add any other kind of main categories if we were going to be a studio bnb and we wanted to have for instance photo studios um you know video studios then we could add other categories and then that way when you click on post new listing as the user that is trying to list their studio you could select uh which category of studio but we're not gonna we don't need to configure that for our mvp so we're good with the categories um we're also the different uh fields and filters as i mentioned so we do need to create a filter um for the different studio types so the current uh fields um which can also be filters uh and this is what that the different text fields that are going to be on the listing creation process are listing title price description expiration date location and image really don't need expiration date we're not going to worry about removing it though um we are going to add a check box group and uh we're going to call that studio type is the title of it and i can type there we go and so it's going to be mandatory when each person creates a listing and then we're going to display this on the home page um so we do want that display on the left so it makes it easy for users uh to select a filter as far as which type of suit they're looking for so we're just going to stick with two just for simplicity in this quick tutorial so home studio we're going to add another so we're going to add top line studio all right so those are two we don't need to set up payments right now thanks for the prompt so those are our two different um types which are going to be filters on the home page and then i also for the sake of this tutorial added a added backend order type of renting out without accepting payments because i can't demo posting a new listing without uh doing a the payment integration so i just added that so i can do a kind of quick demo um but that's our basic configuration so let's go back to the home page we don't have any new listings but as you can see the studio type is on the left um so you can select home studio top line studio and then we're going to go back to the admin dashboard and we are going to add a number and we're going to call this uh price and we're not going to make this mandatory but we're going to display a filter so our minimum is going to be 10 and our um maximum is going to be we'll just say 400 um and then we'll just call it price uh per hour well hourly rental will be displayed in the listing so we don't need that so i'm just going to save this and then we're going to go back to the home page and as you can see now we have a slider that's going to serve as a or act as a price filter so this can then update all of our listings so as we start to build our listing inventory and have uh you know 10 50 to 100 steel listings this will make it really um this will make it really a better user experience for people to discover the right studio and then conversions to bookings so this is the basic configuration this is actually all we need to configure um and all the kind of functionality on on both ends uh as the kind of marketplace uh adding capabilities and then also as far as usability from the user side so now that we have the initial marketplace set up we need to go through and do a kind of a prep for our first real users and launch um so we need to make it very intuitive for users uh that way uh they can have the best experience and we can get uh um a little bit uh better feedback um and some external validation for for this mvp so let's go through right now um one of the first things that we're going to need to do um is of course post a listing um so before we try to onboard um new inventory from other people we should probably create our own uh and use a place a placeholder with some kind of some tips on the listing and that's what i actually did for studio time um when i uh right before i initially reached out to a few of the first studios and i still actually had the kind of placeholder listing on there when i when i launched on product time um and then even when it was picked up by press so we're going to click on post a new listing and we're going to do renting out without accepting payments because once again i don't have the payments integrated yet um on this mvp so uh we would need to do that uh before we did launch of course too because we want uh our first inventory of real users to actually enter their payout information too which is really simple so we'll just do see your studio here and then we'll just put a price um we're going to guess around the price per hour of the ideal kind of range that we want studios to charge per hour because this is what they're going to see as a placeholder so keep that in mind so we can uh put 50 if that's about what uh the price we would ideally like to see so we'll say see your listing here and i'm not going to extensively type this out um but i'm just going to put the placeholder and then we would probably put like tips so we would just list out a few tips um for like our demo kind of placeholder uh listing so studios could just get a good idea of what they would need to put probably about in this use case um you know more about the space the studio itself the equipment set up what it's ideally used for um and then any kind of uh you know specifics uh for their studio that others would need in order to um if they were going to be booking the space uh we'll just put both um that way if people use filters um and then location we'll just use santa monica because that's where we are and it populates a pen so they use google maps uh as far as for their maps share chart does um and then we'll go through and we're just gonna select our kind of placeholder image that we used before uh ideally you probably want to have some kind of uh a visual um image that you create like in snappa uh just to make it kind of look like very well branded and kind of slick so in this case we could just have like a background of a studio and then just like a watermark over the in in the middle of like the studio b and b logo or like see your studio here kind of thing and we're just going to go ahead and post it so yeah so the sure tribe's doing a prompt again for the payments but we're going to kind of skip over that step so as you can see i'm logged in um i have the ability to edit not only my listing but i could edit any listing that i click on as an admin so if we do have a few studios that sign up prior to us rolling it out to other external kind of testers or you know prep for launch we could go through and edit um some of their listings and just send them a note saying that we optimize their listing um and that way we have some kind of uh consistency in all of our listings um we could upload better images if we find some for them or whatnot we can also close listings uh for instance if they said hey take my listing down or you know i'm not running it out anymore we can close any listing as an admin um we can move to the top of the home page which is great feature that sharetribe has uh so that way if you know we're speaking with a studio because it's safe for instance one of my friend studios and i tell them that you know we're going to help drive awareness and we probably want to put them uh where they're visible the most so we can move them to the top um if you're going to charge studios to sign up and we had different levels like basic and premium uh and part of the premium was being at the top of all results and listings then we could of course simply kind of run a check on our and it would be manual at first um but it would be uh just seeing like in a google sheet all the premium subscriptions or premium studios and then making sure that they're always at the top we would also probably want to show them in a newsletter that goes out to all the users um especially kind of during launch uh and the you know where we're gonna get some uh increase in end users and um exposure uh we could do that by just simply uh clicking on this showing the next newsletter so here's the main listing uh and then we'll go back to the home page and that way we can see an actual listing now all right so we're logged in um and if we're logged in we're not going to see the cover once again that's only for our logged out state uh and then we'll see like our listing here so all the listings will populate and it's an endless scroll so if i mean if you build up an inventory um you know say 20 down it's just an it's an endless scroll all the way to the bottom so some other things we'll go to the admin panel really quick just to go through and just kind of run a check on if there's any other kind of configurations that we would need to do in order to try to get some external testing um and prep for a launch from this initial mvp so if we did want to have this on a custom domain or own domain we would need to upgrade so not on the free trial so we could just click on subscription here and that would be through the share tribe um and we're not going to need to do any user management any listing management for now um we're not going to be you know we're not going to be monitoring any transactions or conversations for now or reviews we could potentially email all users if we did notice that some of the users from that user management were like studio domains uh then we could email users you know sign up uh if your studio you can sign up um you know here and add your listing before we launch kind of thing uh you could send out uh invites um that's not really uh a functionality i don't think that even needs to be on the admin panel um but we're good with our basic configurations uh once again what we would need to do is remove the order type of the ability to list the studio without payments um since that's not what our mvp uh this you know that's not beneficial for for our mvp since part of our value prop is uh accepting payments and booking um through our marketplace um so we need to remove that and then we need to do our stripe and or paypal integration in this case we would do both and then we would just finalize all of our welcome emails and uh our hint text in any of the last kind of settings that we would need in order to launch but at this point we uh we have our basic mvp for studio bnb which is an airbnb for music studios we've gone through the basic setup um we've configured it so we have all the required functionality and we kind of went through a lightweight kind of mvp or product uh prelaunch and kind of launch checklist so now we're ready to get external users and prep for a launch and try to validate our mvp thanks
