hey everyone we are live here with column cheat hey guys happy St Patrick's Day happy St Patrick's Day I I guess that's particularly relevant because colum grew up Dublin Ireland and he still lives there and works as a freelance designer there uh colums built a startup and it was a acquired a couple years ago by a company called Marvel app that works with uh design prototyping tools and uh he's joining us now from Dublin where he has not had too much to drink yet he told [Laughter] me that's what you think well you're very good at carrying on a conversation then I can I'm pretty sober right unfortun well thank you for your sacrifice so our live audience thanks you for your coherence um colum tell us a little bit about your background my understanding is you as a high schooler you basically dropped out and you just focused on pursuing music and then after pursuing music for a while you transition into doing design work can you tell us a little bit about that entire era of your life yeah um so yeah I mean I didn't really drop out of high school but I mean I just uh in my last two years I guess I didn't attend many classes I guess you could put it that way and so yeah I was just like really big into music I didn't I wasn't really getting much out of high school didn't really wasn't into many the topics that we were studying um and I had a I had a publishing a film and TV publishing deal with a a company in La called editor Choice music so I was just like you know staying home learning trying to learn instruments studying music theory and just really big into that whole world um and my school my high school didn't offer music so it was just like inaccessible there so um so yeah and I spent like six years um just studying music NonStop and trying trying to make it in that whole you know industry but uh like got to a point where I hit a wall kind of it's just like music IND industry is funny it's kind of it's really locked down you know when you get to a certain point it's just so hard to like push through and go take it further you'd really have to like move to LA and like um you know really start uh building connections and like things like that like going to auditions and stuff like I mean I guess my ultimate goal was to like become a session musician of some sort like play guitar you know in studios and like you know tour with some type of live act make money that way but it's just so competitive it's so tough and like um in terms of songwriting and things like it's really locked down there's like an inner circle of songwriters that just write all pop music and and it's hard to break in so yeah eventually I like kind of you know became disheartened with that and wasn't really sure what I wanted to do and my dad had um had a print company just a very small print shop in my hometown um it was just him and his business partner so he just asked me one day that I want to come down and check it out so I went down H and he gave me one of those old uh bubble IMAX and just sat me in in a dark corner in the back room and just like gave me like some cracked copy of Illustrator and just like just just let me let me add it you know and I I just fell in love like straight away just just became completely enamored with the whole world of design you know I had no idea what I was doing at all wasn't even sure like what the the various paper sizes were like A3 and A2 A1 Etc um but yeah I worked there for like four years with them you know just learned everything um you know just off the cuff just like took a flyer poster and tried to copy an illustrator tried to recreate things business cards and you know just learned everything about print indry um and then you know after after four four years or four and a half years there um I I I got into web design through um what was the program I was using like a wizzy wig editor freeway that was that's what it was called it was like I don't know if you've heard it yeah freeway it's kind of like um it was like Dream Weaver you know back in the day it was like a wizzywig editor where you could like drag and drop elements to create a website and then you know deploy it live without writing without writing any code at all um so that's that's how I like transitioned into web design um and then my brother who my brother was a programmer at the time he's two years older than me so he was he was constantly pushing me to to write to learn HTML and CSS you know I'd have in one of my websites that I've built with freeway I'd have like some issue and I'd go run to him and ask him how can I fix it and he'd be like oh dude I can't I can't even read this code it's terrible those apps the most garbage code so I mean I had no idea what I was handling him but it was just like here trying and fix this um so yeah he was like constantly pressuring me to learn code um and eventually you know I just just learned some HML CSS online and uh then left that print shop I was working for and went down on my own freelancing awesome and your freelancing career ultimately uh transition into you building a product yeah well many products I had a I built like five or six or more probably startups yeah with my brother most of them with my brother um yeah we had no idea like this is going back seven eight years ago you know we were just like one of them we tried to build a um an app for for like a rental app you know for buying for renting or for buying houses and we were just using rails you know my brother was a rails programmer and uh you know we just tried to get that going you tried to get something going for the print shop that I was working at it was like Trello but just for print for the print industry um yeah tried a bunch of things and they all just failed miserably and and then uh just yeah one day I mean I was freelance freelancing there then for a few years uh you know just various clients and and building startups on the side and uh yeah I started Plexi which was a design Tool uh which was a web based design too so it's kind of like sketch but like um you know no way as like much more simpler you know much more simpler than than sketch um and it was in the browser and it was I tried to focus on animation like interaction based design um so yeah I I built the first version of that on my own with my extremely limited JavaScript skills and just like put a really really rough prototype on designer news and it did well like you know a lot of people took interest and a lot of people emailed me about it encouraged me to to keep working on it um so yeah kept working on that for like two years I hired a guy in uh called Elliott in New York he was like he was about 18 at the time uh it really amazed me like how he he had like he had a really high reputation on stock overflow for like answering JavaScript programming questions that's how I found him he was just like a genius you know it just everything I would just give him like a bunch of tasks in Trello that uh that I couldn't I couldn't do and like you know the next week he would just have them all done completely you know perfect like so wow so two two of us felt like a year and a half or two years working on on Plexi um and getting it to a point where where we could release it and uh then I released it and it just kind of went dead you know so um that was kind of detering but I mean we spent like six months uh or like I mean I wasn't working with Elliott then after that but I on my own I spent like six months trying to like improve it and continuing to develop it and and like talking with some customers who are still using it but um yeah overall it was just like really hard to get traction and uh you know retain users because like that whole industry is so uh competitive you know there are so many prototyping tools coming out every other day um then eventually just out of the blue uh morat from Marvel app reached out to me and said that they were um thinking about building a similar tool um but like rather than start from scratch that they would just acquire Plexi and and bring us on board so that was really cool so that's what happened then yeah well tell us a little bit about the acquisition process uh I would imagine a lot of the developers and designers who are watching this uh haven't actually been acquired like that's that's like uh very few startups are acquired it's probably like maybe two% or something of them actually make it to that level uh so what was that process like of being having your product integrated into Marvel app and joining the Marvel app team yeah I mean that was that was really cool the whole thing was completely new to me because I guess like the best part about it was that it was validation you know it was like because right up until that point I had no idea what I was you know I had no idea if I was on the right track or if I wasn't and you know I guess I was just like everyone else just like just working away slugging away um trying to learn new skills and not really seeing anything come of it you know unless of course if you're working for a job but um then like when when my startup got acquired it was like wow maybe I am doing something right you know and so yeah that was cool me the guy the guys at Marvel acquired the startup and then brought me and Elliot on board the guy that I I was working with in New York so the two was uh join the team at Marvel and you know spent about a year and a half there integrating Plexi into their platform um which is now called canvas Marvel canvas um I I mean it's been re since then it's been rebuilt from the ground up in uh in canvas um in like H 5 canvas um uh with the guys on board like like and rebuild and react uh so yeah I mean that was cool awesome so they took your prototype uh or I guess your fully functioning app use it as kind of a prototype for the full refactor to react app and H exactly yeah exactly I mean initially it was released as a beta um and it's I mean it was kind of like as a test initially I guess the first launch to see to see what people be interested in this it was because Marvel the way Marvel app works is that um you upload images like you design your your screens in sketch or photoshop and then upload images and then you can piece them together using Marvel apps platform um so Marvel canvas was like the first step toward having an inhouse like a builin way that you can draw your own images now um so I mean the guys are still developing that and I believe that they're pretty pretty close to their first release awesome we can we can definitely uh look for that in the future so you went from just to recap you went from a high school student uh who was primarily focused on learning music music theory composition uh you did that for a number of years then uh you did graphic design I guess working with print and and learning that aspect of design and then you transition into web design you learn to code U and then you built a product you built many products but one of them was acquired and you worked on that for two years and now uh you're working as a freelancer and you wrote an amazing extremely popular medium article recently about the notion of Design Systems and I've linked to it below for anybody who hasn't read this article you should absolutely check out column's article but can you describe what a design system is real quick and perhaps contrast it to a design framework for example a CSS framework yeah um yeah I mean I've been going back and forth on like various definitions I'm not really sure myself what exact the best way to describe it but in in my article I said a design system is an evolving set of rules governing the composition of a product so it's like it's basically everything from your your pallets you like your color palets you you know Shadows all of the the values that you apply to the properties that make up you know the styles that make your company look like your company and not like other companies um you know coupled with the components that you have like buttons and inputs which would be your UI toolkit I guess um coupled with like um you know larger components um and then compos like screen compositions um plus like code guidelines um you know naming conventions for files and and and for like code I guess and plus like rules like uh for for like when to use this button when to use that input when to use this heading and when not to use this font size um you know rules that like that govern how your developers and designers should compose screens you know using using your code base and using your design um and and that applies like across platform you know not just on web not just on mobile but like you know on your entire Suite of products so yeah I mean that's that's what I mean at least when I say design system so really the design system is like the central document that governs all the other design documents it's like the master design document yeah I guess I guess you pull it out here yeah and do you know of any organizations that have this kind of like master plan for design that that they've actually taken it to that level where they're they're kind of doing full systems design thinking um I mean honestly it's like it's very very rare uh I mean I mentioned in my article that design systems are becoming much more popular um which is great to see I mean everyone there are tons and tons of articles about Design Systems there are like tons of people linking to books and resources about Design Systems lots of job post lots of companies are posting job listings like and setting up teams specifically for uh for Design Systems design system roles um but in terms of like like seeing products that are you know rolled out with like complete completely integrated design systems that are up to date it's very rare you can see them and I guess like best examples would be Google Google's material design which is like a super super comprehensive design uh system H guidelines and another great example would be Airbnb yeah who they do tons and tons of work on Design Systems and design system tooling uh I believe they've got an inhouse team and specifically for Design Systems so I mean yeah that's another company another company would be intercom who are as far as I'm aware they're just setting up a Design Systems team but they really I I chatted with with some of the guys at inter intercom and I mean they really seem to to understand the importance of Design Systems and like how um they really like how you know how important it is to to approach design in a systemic way you know rather than just like sporadically but like things like even things like tool kits like uh Foundation or or bootstrap you know even though they have like bootstrap has like comprehensive documents on how to how to work with the bootstrap toolkit but you know it's not it's not coded or designed in a really systematic way like for example take the button component um like it it displays the button component it shows you what it should look like and it shows you how to use code but it doesn't go as far as to say like how should this button look on a dark background or you know on a blue background it doesn't it doesn't take into account the actual pragmatic uses of a design system you know when you actually go to build a website you know almost 100% of websites will have some alternate background color and each of your components should be able to function on that background color you know if they are supposed to you know some components should never be used on a certain background color um and if you look at various websites like um not I don't want to be knocking any anyone's work but like if you want like I'm always open to constru just thinking Mar auto works at GitHub and he built bootstrap but um there they recently rolled out a new header a new nav like a dark nav and I was looking at I was looking at CSS and it's like they've styled the input specific to the dark header so it's like elsewhere in the code base they've said here's what our input looks like but in this specific location we're going to hack it to make it look some like some like differently because it's on a different color background and we didn't think about that earlier on when we were designing our design system so I think like that's for me that's like the essence of Design Systems thinking like everything you do stop for a second before you do it and think where exactly will this component be used and how will it be used and like and what it it's not going to be used in just one way you know we need to consider all the different ways that this component is going to be used yeah so in many ways it's it's just a an extension of design thinking and and systems engineering kind of Concepts the notion that you should slow down and think in a whole systems way whenever you're making a change so that you don't end up with a whole lot of bolted on functionality and a lot of exactly yeah oneoff stuff yeah yeah yeah and like I mean the the thinking is when you're doing a oneoff change the thinking is oh it's just a oneoff but like if you look at 90% the Cod bases they're like they're just made up of tons of oneoff changes yeah there's always that that joke about um like this is temporary or something like that like and then you look at Mid history and it's from like years ago yeah always treat any code changes as though they're going to live on forever I mean look if you look at like Microsoft so I'll talk in ter terms of code because that's what I know but if you look at like Microsoft Windows for example the reason the code base gets huge you know bigger and bigger and every release is like an extra gigabyte or two um is because they're worried about breaking stuff and changing stuff so instead it just it just creeps and uh for example a function that would normally take like two parameters has these other 20 parameters nobody's brave enough to remove them exactly yeah I mean you see that all the time yeah yeah and CSS I guess so you let's step back and talk a little bit about how you research these things because it sounds like you spend a lot of time just going and looking at websites and inspect element and digging into the CSS it sounds sad but that's most of my life so do you think that that's an extension of your kind of selftaught ethos um you know you you learn music on your own you learn design on your own without formal training uh certainly not formal academic training do you think that's just kind of a reflection of how you learn I I definitely think so I think so because I'm not sure I'm not sure if I gravitated towards those um those Industries or those types of jobs because of some innate personality tra I have or because I gain this innate personality trade from working in like so many of these types of jobs I'm not sure which which way it went but uh but certainly there are tons of Parallels for example between like the work I did in music and the work I do now in design for example um like distilling distilling down a song like into tiny little Snippets of Music um and then like storing them so I can you know I can refactor them until they're perfect you know nothing's ever perfect but until until I'm happy with them and then like reusing them throughout the song and um and it's exact same with code you know like like distilling down a UI into tiny little reusable components and even for down into tiny little reusable Styles and uh you know refactoring those until they're perfect and then reusing them throughout the whole UI um but yeah um sorry what was the question just we were just kind of riffing on uh oh the nature of is it a reflection of the way you learn um just kind of this ad hoc like let's yeah gu in the real world and and I mean that is how I learned initially I just um like even in print that's how I learned I would just take a poster and I would just try and copy the poster um but like when I was learning web design I remember like going to Facebook and trying to copy their their blue header nav and you know and I would just I would just inspect element for ages like and try and copy the color and then try and rebuild it myself without having Facebook open so yeah I mean that's that's like a huge part of How I Learned just just like drilling away at something until it was perfect and I mean I guess that's why that's that's that's why I I went so deep into Design Systems because constantly when I was when I was building websites um I would just constantly run into this problem where I you know designed my input component for example and like thought it was perfect and then when I actually went to build a number of different screens with that UI component I would always have to tweak it and change it and like hack it into place like to make you know some margin fit or resize it for a sidebar or you know change the background color to put it into a header knv or and I always I just got to wondering like am I doing something wrong here or like is this what like all websites do and it turns out that that is how most websites handle it they just hack it into place but I just always thought like there was something I was missing and and I finally realized yeah like I mean I was just doing half the work all the time I was just doing half the work and then like neglecting the whole like neglecting the other half of the work and all my components were like only Built 50% they were just built for a white background and that was it and I had no actual I wasn't I wasn't baking in any understanding of how these components will be used in the real world I was just coding them for like uh so they looked good on dribble or something you know so I mean yeah I mean definitely well I understand uh that you're working on a new project right now uh I think you mentioned that you were working on some sort of CSS framework or tool yeah it's called call BM you know For Better or Worse what's it called bantom bantom okay what does bantom mean is that like a a noun I hate naming things so badly but uh it's you know Bantam weight you know like the you know the fight weight divisions Ah that's where I've heard that before better weight or Bantam weight or heavyweight you know so it's like I I named it Bantam because like Bantam is a really lightweight Division and at the time years ago when I started it I was I was just trying to like um build the smallest set of reusable style classes that I could build that I could just use to build almost any website and it weighed like you know three or four kilobytes after compression um so I call it bantom wow since then since then it has evolved into a fullblown to tool kit so it's not so bantom anymore but it's I mean I'm not changing the name because I hate naming things that's a good name it's it's very I mean I didn't know what Phantom weight was but now that you explain it like an excellent synonym for lightweight which it sounds like that was certainly one of the goals is just performance and not being a heavy Tool uh like bootstrap keeps getting bigger and bigger for example u a lot of the other popular Frameworks are getting bigger and bigger uh how do you how do you prevent so one of the things we've been talking about is the fact that you're doing like when you just build the component without thinking of the context is going to be used in you're really only doing half of the work you're always going to be encountering Corner cases that you need to update your entire design system to reflect and and Encompass um how do you keep a tool lightweight when you know that there's going to be that uh kind of evolutionary trial and error process yes so I mean right now I'm I'm I'm in the midst of of building out Bantam I'm trying to get ready for V1 um and what I'm doing is just taking each component one at a time and I'm I have like a test a couple of test um screens so I'm building like a really complex X email screen you know something like U mailbox was you know um and I've got a marketing uh screen that I'm building out and I've got another like statistics based web app screen that I'm building out so I'm every time I I make some do some progress on on one of the components I test it out in these screens in each of these screens and I make sure that it h it fits and it works in all in each of the different contexts that it's to be using eventually um I mean obviously these uh these three screens won't Encompass every single use case for all of these components but I mean I'm never going to you know be able to solve everyone's problems so um I mean I mean I'm happy I'm happy with uh just testing it in those three screens and so it's like you know those those three different screens have different color backgrounds they have like some sometimes the component is in a sidebar sometimes it's in a nav sometimes is in your main content and sometimes like an input is coupled with a button sometimes an input has an icon inside it there's just so many different variations on each component and um as I'm building out the pages I'm going back to the components then to like you know make sure that they that all these um contacts are baked into the components how soon do you think you'll have like a a alpha lease uh the people can play with uh I mean well people could start playing right now it's on it's on GitHub Bon um I have it on mpm uh and I have it hosted on S3 so you could start playing playing around with it right now but it's uh it's I mean obviously it's heavily in flux but I'm hoping to have like V1 ready in maybe three weeks four weeks something awesome and so once you have that V1 out is is are you going to try to keep the name spacing consistent so that it doesn't like so you don't break backward compatibility for future versions or is that a is that a concern or are you just gonna people are gonna be I mean I haven't this is like this would be my first h i mean this is my first open source project that anyone's taken any interest in I mean it only has 100 stars on GitHub but it's like infinitely more than anything else I've ever worth on um so I don't have too much experience working on open open source projects um haven't even contributed to many open source projects so I'm not I'm not entirely sure exactly how it works or what's what the best practices are but uh from what I gather just from reading some articles on it um I don't think I want to be too concerned with versioning um because it just becomes this nightmare of like you know dealing with support requests and things like that right um I think I think like I think after I release the V1 the next uh step would be to Port it to react um and like maybe using CSS modules or style components or something like that but uh after that I guess like the main changes for in each version would just be visual you know like updating the components so that they they you know they look modern you know so so the whole framewor doesn't end up looking really dated you know aside from that I can't imagine changing too much or at least I'm hoping not to have to change too much I guess we I guess we'll find out yeah I mean that's a good problem to have if a whole lot of people are using your product and and giving you feedback for sure well I'm I'm going to recommend everybody who's watching this uh read that article again that you wrote about Design Systems uh you should all follow colum on Twitter and check out his personal website which I discovered is hosted on netlify which is a pretty cool new static page uh hosting service and uh I'm GNA also put a link if you have a link to your GitHub repo I'll put a link uh into the the notes below as soon as we end the stream and everybody go check it out if you think it's cool give it a star cool well thank you so much uh colum for taking time out of your uh St Patrick's Day Friday evening no problem thank you thanks for having me it was fun yeah it was a pleasure and uh I'm looking forward to hearing updates on how banto goes and and I'm very excited to if you get a chance to write about it I'd love to read it and I think our community would love to read about the evolution of this framework as well yeah yeah I've got some articles planned um yeah some plan to write some some new stuff on it after it's released all right well thank you again have a beautiful weekend thank you everybody for tuning in and uh keep keep working on that man we're we're very excited to see it cool thanks guys cheers everyone
