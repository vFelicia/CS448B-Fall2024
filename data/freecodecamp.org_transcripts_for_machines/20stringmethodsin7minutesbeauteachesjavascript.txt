20 string methods first one care at this returns the character that specified position if you look on the console we apart because it's care at index one if we go to string one when it starts with index 0 then index 1 is our now we have care code yet this returns the Unicode of the character at the specified index and now we have 114 that's the Unicode character of our from let's run right here Concannon returns a new joined string so we put the first string and then concatenate in the parentheses and then we get free code camp is the best place to learn front end and back in development you'll notice that there's no space here because there's no space in between these two strings ends with checks whether a string ends with a specified string or characters so if we have learned in here in the console is going to show true if we put 2 in here it's going to show false because string 1 ends with the word learn and it does not end with the word ok from care code this converts Unicode values to characters this is a static method of the string object so this is the first one that we're not starting with a string or a string variable like string 1 and all the other examples this time you have to put the actual string object string dot from care code and then you put the Unicode character right here so let's run that and we can see our because if you look up here we know that kira code at 1 is 114 so I just put 114 in here and we get our again now we have includes this checks whether a string contains the specified string a character so would you include we can see it is true because string 2 does include the word end it actually has the word end two times because it's frontend and backend development ok index of returns the position of the first found occurrence of a specified value in a string if we do string two index up in order to end we're going to get the number five so let's go back up the string up here let's see 0 1 two three four five and at the fifth index is where we start the word end even though you can see the end is actually in that string two times but we're only giving the index of the first time next up last index of that's pretty similar so for last index up we're going to return the position of the last found occurrence with a specified value in a string so we have 17 that's going to be the last word end because remember that word end is two times so this is the index number seventeen here so this is the first found this is the last found four index of and last index of okay now we have match match is going to search a string for a match against a regular expression and return the matches so we got strength to match here's the regular expression and if we run that it's going to be actually an array of each match so the word end is is actually in strength two two times so there's gonna be array with the word end twice in the array check the description for a link to more information about regular expressions repeat is going to return a new string with a specified number of copies of an existing string if you looked at the bottom of the console it's a three Co campuses best place to learn one two and three times because we have string one or EP and I put three next is replace replace searches a string for a specified value or regular expression and returns a new string where the specified values are so we have got the string through that replace we did the same regex from above but and now we're going to replace with all capital letters so if you look at what we get out here frontend and backend development the end is all capitalized okay now we're going to do search here the search is going to search a string for a specified value or regular expression and return the position of the match so we did string to search end and we can see that the position of the word end is an index five slice is going to extract a part of the string and return a new string so if we run that it's going to start at two that's going to the first index and then four is going to be the index after it ends so you can see we got the word on here so if you look up here 0 1 2 this is we're going to start the letter O and then 3 4 the 4th index is going to be the next after it ends so we're just going to have the word on okay split is going to split a string into an array of sub strings when I call the split method I'm going to pass in the character that you want the string to be split on I'm going to split on spaces so it's going to be an array of each word in the string if I look at the bottom you can see there's an array of each word in the string because it's what that string on the spaces now starts with is going to check whether a string begins with specified characters so let's check if string 1 begins with the characters fr EE if we look at the bottom of the console true because it does begin with the characters fr EE sub STR sub straw is kind of like slice it's going to extract the characters from a string beginning at a specified start position and through the number of characters so we can see we started at 2 and then want to go for 4 characters and so it's going to start if you look up here this is the to remember for slice we start with 2 and then we ended with the 4th index but here we're starting with 2 and we're just counting four characters so you can see there's gonna be four characters Ont e.substring is also similar it's going to extract the characters from a string between two specified indexes so let's run that and you can see it's very similar to slice we get we're starting with index 2 and then we're going to count we're not going to count 4 we're going to go to index 4 and 4 is going be the last index to lowercase is pretty selfexplanatory makes the string all lowercase letters if you look over in the console now before free code campus and capital letters but now that we've run to lowercase there is no capital letters now to uppercase is going to make all the letters uppercase in the string okay the last one is trim trim is going to remove whitespace from either side of the string so now we have a new string string three and you can see there's all these spaces and it says subscribe now and then there's all these spaces again so if we call string three trim it's going to say subscribe now and there's not many spaces in there okay well thanks for watching my name is beau Carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
