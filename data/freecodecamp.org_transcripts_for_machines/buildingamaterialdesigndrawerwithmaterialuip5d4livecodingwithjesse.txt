hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse today we're going to work on our our side drawer and we're using material ui to give us some components to use material design for our react project so just to get everyone up to speed on the work that's been done since yesterday's stream we have some testing available now so if you check out the github repo the links in the description if you check out the repo you'll see uh harshit added some tests for the pages that we have so far and i think that was pull request 19. so you could see exactly what he changed if you go to the pull request and her also added in or i should say uh got these all styled properly and used i believe flexbox to align these instead of uh what did i use i think i was using uh just some fixed um alignment before which actually now i look at this that that would have been weird um i didn't realize that we weren't using a fixed header so are we using fixed here no we're not huh for some reason i thought we were oh well i was mistaken so now i realize why everyone was telling me not to use position fixed that would make no sense since we don't have a fixed at bar at the top so my mistake i thought we did have fix that's why i went with position fix instead of position absolute but it doesn't matter now so you can check out everything that changed if you know you look at the github repo check out the last two pull requests as of right now all the issues are closed so i'm gonna try to get some more issues up there and um that way if anybody wants to give their advice or discuss how we're going to do something then uh you know you can comment on the issues or if you'd like to you know to write some code or anything then you know go ahead and take one of those issues and try it out okay it looks like all right adam says the video is not working it's paused um is it is it like that for everybody is anybody else having trouble with the video let me know everything looks alright for my end but i could try to change something let's see what else world says youtube notifications aren't working occasionally youtube notifications don't work for the videos if i start them um if i schedule the stream within an hour of when i'm actually going to start the stream it seems like the notifications don't always work i did yeah you know what i didn't get a notification saying i was going to stream but i got one when i did start the stream uh so it's on my phone so that's the problem i was just caught up doing some work on some other projects and didn't get the stream scheduled so later i'll try to schedule it earlier tomorrow and um and then hopefully uh everybody will get the notifications let's see so i'm just going through live chat really quickly hey everybody i see a lot of people saying hi um you can find uh if you want to know when the best way to figure out when the stream goes live so a few people were talking about that number one you could subscribe to this channel free code camp youtube channel and if you have your notifications turned on uh then you should get a notification um both before i stream and then when i stream also if you follow me on twitter it's my uh a link to my twitter account i believe is in the description to this video if you follow me on twitter i um i always post on uh on twitter so i i always tweet about what i'm going to do that day during the stream and i i try to do that so when i schedule the stream immediately after i i tweet about it so those are the best two ways to find out let's see all right so i'm gonna get started and then i'll answer some questions in the live chat so i do see some questions there already so uh hang on we're gonna do 25 minutes of coding and then i'll take a five minute break i'll answer as many questions as i can we'll do another 25 minutes of coding and then after that i'll answer all the questions there in the live chat so if you can stick around i'll answer your question if for some reason you can't watch until i get to your question just check out the recording uh of the video later on uh and i'll answer your question uh you know no matter what whether or not you're still still around and the recording is usually available a few minutes after i end the stream all right so let me switch to this screen and you could see uh some of the additions here okay so i'm going to make a few adjustments you know with the size and everything but for now this is this is looking good uh we don't have the actual links in here yet uh you know these aren't on real links yet and then our search doesn't work but right now we're not pulling any any data so i'm not as worried about the search uh we are to make it so that when you click on this a little um text input opens up here and then you can close it so that's going to happen at some point uh but like i said i'm not that worried about getting the search going until we actually have data and can test it out so this is what we have so far for a side drawer oops let me set my timer here for 25 minutes this we have so far for the the side drawer uh so so we're gonna do actually let me start my um let me start my server for ngrok and i'm going to paste the link in the live chat now and you all can check out the site as we're editing it all right there we go okay so um the ngrok server is working i see a lot of connections on there uh so check that out you can open that up in your own browser use devtools and um you know as soon as anything changes locally for me it'll refresh and change for you as well alright so here's what we're going to add the logo is good uh that's actually i like the size on that that's fine we're going to have in this position a search bar and that will end up being i do believe let's see what mobile so i need to think about what we're going to do for mobile yeah right now we have nothing going on in in terms of a change up here so i'm not going to worry about that for today's stream but what i'm thinking is we're going to have to cut some things out to make this look all right on mobile the this search button is going to be cut out but then we'll have one here on the sidebar so there will be a search available uh that'll save some space and decrease kind of the complexity of you know where do these things go uh or the logo where does this all go whenever we want to expand this you know so we don't have to worry about that at all so we're going to have that search input and then below it we're going to have menu items but they're all going to be nested so you'll be able to click it and then see uh sub menu items below and that'll be nice because it'll allow us to include a lot of links there'll be a visual hierarchy so immediately users will be able to tell like what section something belongs to and also it won't be overwhelming at first so potentially there could be a lot of links on this site so the current site at franciscan.edu the current site has a ton of links a lot of different menus so it can be overwhelming to some users if they're not sure where to find something this is going to be much simpler at first look but then as you click through the different levels you'll be able to see a lot but hopefully by kind of by nesting these things it should make it kind of a nicer um kind of a nicer navigation experience it looks like something's broken phillips says it's broken blake says it's broken uh what's what's broken the uh the ngrok server let me know if that's it if if the site's broken the ngrok server is broken let me know it is if it's working for some people let me know as well uh justin says wow what a beautiful school so you maybe you looked up the website so um good for you for sticking around through that long load time for the main website right now but yeah the school does look it looks very nice um we're kind of up on a hill uh and just kind of surrounded by trees and things and uh the grounds crew that does a really nice job of landscaping too so it's a nice little campus all right cool so let me check out let me try to fix engruck if i can get it fixed here in just a minute or two uh then i think it's worth it if i can't get it fixed within a minute or so then uh we're just probably just not going to use it hmm okay ngrok is at an older point in time maybe i mean okay that was it uh it looks like androx is at an older point so goodness uh yeah so this keeps happening occasionally any idea how we can fix this right now the only way i can get this to work is if i restart the uh the server and i can't just restart immediately i have to stop it wait for like 10 seconds and then restart it if i restart it too fast it doesn't work it's really weird so this is gonna be a significant uh drawback for us um if this keeps happening frequently all right so let me restart this now i've had it off for a little bit okay i think it should work no did it not work all right yes okay it worked this time so uh check it out see if it works now on on a new version of uh ngrob so generates next server rendered dynamic class names class name conflicts okay so um harsh is saying their class name conflicts um which okay let's see i'm checking out the error log now interesting all right well maybe i'll have to look that up and see if um if other people were having the same issue and if they found any um solution there's not really any obvious errors that i'm seeing on the console i just had it open on my other screen there are some errors but it it looked like they weren't exactly related oh actually now i just open it again there's a lot more errors wow okay well let's get started on on actually you're working on this sidebar and then maybe before sometime before tomorrow's stream i'll try to i'll try to figure out what's going on and get that working properly alright so i guess we could put in let's put in our our nested items first because i have this page open on uh the material ui documentation now so we'll go with that first and then we'll do that um that input i think the uh the search input will be slightly more complicated so let's let's get something done first and then tackle that okay so here's our nested list this is how it will end up working so you see when we click it we have a change in that icon our menu items appear slightly indented okay and then we click it again and it closes so that's exactly what we want all right so let's copy we need our expand more and expand less and we need our collapse all right let's grab let's grab all of this we're not going to need it all uh but we'll remove some of it but for now we're going to grab all of that copy it and then paste it over here into our our drawer component so we already have that drawer.js component in our components folder and okay we have our lists items here which is awesome so we can remove it yeah we can remove it from here and i'm not sure if we're going to use the sub header i'm going to leave it in for now we need the collapse we don't need these icons the inbox or the drafts icon or the send icon we need the expand icons and we need a divider yeah i think we will use the divider as well let's have those in here now we could add let's add this nested in all right and this is going to give us that indentation for our nested items actually just it's odd um i'm going to try this this isn't exactly how it had it in the um in the example let me see how we have this in that bar okay we are using the styles theme in app bar uh hardship why why are we doing it like this in atlar.js but then in draw we're not uh so we're not using theme can we use theme will it um make is will it make a difference either way i'm asking horsham because he's the one that implemented a lot of this let's see a place where we're actually trying to bring these styles in okay so classes list all right seems like it's working in the same way class name classes root okay it seems like we're using it in the same way so let's give it a shot see if it works uh now we let's need which one we want there we go all right so we want this list item and then the collapse and we need to nest that within a list so we already have a list and we have our a list item in with our our logo and then we have this this other list item here which we're going to overwrite for now okay great so we need to add a click handler and state let's make sure we have okay good yeah all right and we're gonna have to switch this yeah we're gonna have to change this all right so right now we need to change this to goodness all right we're gonna have to make some changes so uh let's see first off we need to make this class temporary drawer extends component sends react components and then we're not going to be able to do things like this um see how we have this we need state we need this click so let's grab these and okay so let's put these in first whoops let's let's get rid of these for now um nice let's see we need our yeah so we can put these here and then within our render function and we can have this and then we're going to need a return oops oh you know what we already had a return i didn't even see that okay so we should be all right if i remove this and let's take out this and we need one more yeah one more bracket and that should be it all right i'm not going to worry too much about formatting since we have the auto formatting set up actually i'm it's odd that i'm not getting a ton of warnings right now uh that's weird let's see okay let's see what kind of errors we're getting theme is not defined oops okay um why don't i even try to use theme oops here okay so let me pass in theme how do we do this there we go oops and super must be either no on a function not undefined where am i using that all right let me check this all right i'm checking the live chat harshit's got a lot of uh words with all caps in here so let me see let me read through some of this he's got a way another passes for us let's see okay uh all right so i'm trying to figure out what hershey was saying they're passed as these are passes props all right so harsha i'm not sure what i was doing at the time you were saying the things you did in the live chat so at this point what what are you uh suggesting then let's see temperatures i probably messed up something as i was copying pasting everything let's see this is nested what's my error message now okay that's for my my it looks like this is just two see in case you haven't watched this stream before part of the purpose of the stream is to show me at my normal daily job making mistakes and trying to work through them so i don't practice this ahead of time uh so that's why i'm i'm just kind of working through this right now all right well i want to make sure at least that i copied everything that i needed from here oh shoot all right let's see what that did i'm still getting the same error but that that should have been changed anyway oh you know what shoot i have this tape all right let's see what's this so r should submit a pr about this right so i have harsha's pr open uh on another screen here styles which is all right so hard let me check the live chat um oh my goodness this is the problem all right well that was one problem okay great yeah so sorry that i was looking through harsha's stuff and i'm like my stuff looks exactly the same uh but it was the uh the capital so uh diogo thank you so much for catching that um and harsha thanks for that as well and let's see um okay and also rcr saying you don't need the handle click um okay all right my timer so my 25 minute timer is up so let's do a short break right now five minutes i'm gonna go to the live chat answer any questions you all have then we'll come back sort out these errors and um and move on from there let's see so um random person says what is material ui from and what do you need to get it uh okay so material ui uh did i did not i don't know what happened with that anyway i thought i said it to the five minute one so material ui is a framework let's see if i can get so it's just a bunch of react components that are styled in the material design style so it's free to use uh you can you bring it into your project you know with with npms you can npm install bring it into your project and just follow their documentation to you know have kind of these prebuilt components so it really helps save a lot of time it would take quite a while to build out all the components that they offer so it's really helpful and yeah if you have any more questions about it let me know but i check out the docs they're pretty straightforward uh philip says should i just merge master to my fork to have it all updated uh yeah if you have um if you have forked the project you'll definitely want to like periodically um update your fork with what's in um in the main repo that way if you do end up submitting a pull request then there'll be much less chance of having a bunch of merge conflicts anthony says uh ask do you know all programming language uh no i my i know um javascript and i know a little bit of php i've done like build some wordpress plugins and um been able like handle um form submissions file uploads um just like basic very basic security on handling file uploads in php um i've done a little bit with python not like really basic stuff i've done a tiny bit with java on uh kind of just messing around with making a game with java and i've also done a little bit with c sharp and some with c plus plus so that's the extent of my programming knowledge so the only programming language that i would even say that i'm i'm at all good with this javascript but i know enough about a lot of other ones that i could like kind of get through like reading a little bit of it and figuring out what's going on uh chris how many projects do you usually work on at once um i usually have two or three going at once uh almost always there's like one main one and some other ones that i'm just uh fixing things on currently um in any given week right now you know in terms of the last few weeks i've worked on this project uh we have two other react projects that i'm working on and i'm i just have some styling stuff to do on a salesforce based project and i'm helping out uh someone in the it department uh with some some styling and and just kind of like going through some old code and uh doing some basically some code cleanup stuff so is that like five five projects right now that i can think of that i'm working with uh but like i said this is actually this one isn't even my main one right now uh in terms of what i spend my time on outside of the stream so this is the only project that i'm streaming consistently right now the other projects are what i spend most of my time on outside the stream and that's mainly because uh they have those projects need to be done sooner and then also i think it's kind of nicer to do most of the work for this on the stream and then that way you all get to see a lot of it and there's not like really huge periods of of change like where i have to spend most of the stream just explaining all the things that changed so sometimes that happens and i got to do a lot of work outside the stream just to get projects done on time but for now when we're kind of in the beginning stages i'll try to work on other stuff and then save this this project for um for the stream all right so my five minute timer is up so let's get back to this code and uh get past some of these errors and then i'll come right back to where i left off in the live chat okay let's see all right okay so we got our 25 minute timer started let's check out it's not defined all right let's check this out and uh okay hardship i see that you uh you merged the um or you submitted the pull request um i'd kind of like to work through this uh like on the stream you know and um with everybody so i'm not going to merge it right now on the stream i may end up merging it later if we can't get this to work like right on the stream uh but for right now list item icon is not defined oops i forgot to take out these icons so of course that's not gonna work okay so if you remember i copied and pasted a lot of this and then i removed a lot of the imports well i removed the imports but i forgot to take them out here so it's looking for them and it can't find them so let's go to where all right this was here this is this starts what we brought in right so we have inbox icon let's remove that component and i think there's one more actually there might be two more so the star border we don't need that and there's the last one i don't see it maybe there wasn't another one i thought there was all right let's see if that did anything where am i bringing this in 55 oh goodness i didn't even see that okay there we go all right let's see what we get now oops okay awesome so whoops yeah so i am messing something up so i see harshit was saying something about i added in some extra stuff that i didn't need to so uh i guess i copied over more than i needed to let me go back to that that list so um let's check out so he's talking about state uh so he's saying i copied over more than i needed to in terms of handling the state so let's check this out and stayed open true let's see what we're doing here with our hmm all right so uh harshit and your pr let's see did you put in oh okay so you did not bring in at least from what i'm seeing okay so this was just converting it uh from stateless functional uh to a class okay um okay great uh okay so harsha explained a bit okay that's what i was thinking as well so basically i'm sure you all saw this already uh even before i did but um right now we have open for state uh but we we have a conflict right so we're we're using we're using names we should not use be using the same name so i think the simplest thing is for me to change this open items and then we'll leave all the drawer stuff alone and then down here we'll change this to open items and let's see if that works for us oops okay so i mean that's working in terms of this but why are we getting did we have this set you know we must have this set to close on click a menu item click so let's let's check out the documentation for our i guess for our drawer and let's see we don't have the responsive drawer this is the one we have all right so let's see really we want the api actually so let's go down to this drawer api and see salvation maybe it's not on here you transition route on click leave it like that okay yeah i so hard i see what you're saying you know for this one i definitely wanted to to do that so i i want it to close automatically because we are going to transition route but for this i don't want it to happen here this is so we need to change it for for just these ones um because those won't actually be links let's see what we have here let's dine actually did we bring in list subheader i was thinking about changing these to list sub headers let's see what we look we have here here's our lists and i can't find our list there is this item was text oops you know we're in the api section anyway there we go um where are we using the list subheader oh okay yeah maybe i don't want that as a sub header all right uh diego says check the trigger on this menu item okay let's uh so right now we have this is our menu item it's this handle click this is our click handler here uh but what do we have are we passing this anything up toggle drawer yeah actually we are let's check out our layout component stage four okay so we are passing that down the the state is held here in the parent component so you see in the parent component we have state drawer false means it's closed true would be open and then we have that toggle drawer here so on drawer we're passing down whether or not it's open or closed right so by default we're passing down false and then we're also passing this toggle drawer down so the the events will come up here uh and call this function it will change the state and then that will get passed back down so let's go back to our drawer and on request close toggle drawer and then we have on on click toggle drawer okay so basically we have our on click for toggle drawer here but we don't want it there let me try okay so basically anywhere i click within that div yeah uh it'll close this drawer so i hate to do it like this but i'm not really sure i'm just not really sure what to do let's see if let's just try it see if we can put it on this this list item let's see if if this will work all right so we should we click here nothing happens we click here it closes great okay that's what we want let's see if i can all right so i can hit enter here and that that does that but then if i i can't see if i can tab trying to tab down to start all right so i can't tab down to that menu item all right so i don't really like that so this works but the only thing i'm worried about is i can't tab down to this item using the keyboard it like highlights both of these like the whole thing and i can't navigate like that so i would it would be nicer if i could have it work so that you could navigate by keyboard alone we can work on that but for now this is closer to what we want not perfect okay all right so let me just go over can i go over what just happened in case i kind of was going around too fast which uh sometimes when i get into it i think i'm almost like found a solution i do go too fast so uh basically what was happening is we had this containing div here right that contains everything inside this drawer right at least all the items so it wasn't stretching the full length but it basically from here to here everything in here was within that div so if you clicked on anything in this area it triggered a close so what we did was we just move that from this containing div down to this item this list item and now you can click on this or this and it does not automatically close the drawer but if we click on on this item right on start it does close the drawer now what we probably should do is move these now that i look at it so here's the list item and then we have a list underneath here and we'll keep adding items to this list so it'll be better if i think we end up putting these classes i'm sorry these toggle classes here on this list that way we won't have to put it on every single list item because we may end up having quite a few items here so this will be a lot nicer to do it like this so i'm going to move those let's test it out so i can still click here this works this works and then that works wonderful okay awesome um very cool all right so i have about 10 minutes left let's see about adding in hmm yeah let's try to add in this search input let's see if there's any examples no i don't see any examples here of using a search input inside a list okay so let's go this is really small let me make this bigger for everybody whoa okay um let's go to our forms or text fields is the name of this section so we're going to go to our text field and let's grab one we're going to want one with an icon to see if they have that and put adornments okay this is probably what we want uh the input adornments so just gonna quickly scroll through make sure okay so this is probably what we want let's check it out and it looks like and put adornment okay great so we can just add in an icon here within this input adornment component and we specify the position which in this case end will work for us great okay so let's all right let's copy all of this for now we're gonna have to edit this of course whoops not all that all right let's copy that and bring this over and we're going to want this right after that um that logo so let's go with a list item and then all of this now let's bring over what we need to bring in here so form and input that looks good okay uh that looks good we also need to bring in an icon and i know we're already bringing in the icon here so where we have for the app bar right i thought we were bringing in an icon weren't we that search icon oh okay all right so it looks like um i guess horseshit brought in an um an svg icon into here okay that's cool let's see if we can pull in a search icon though yeah so we'll just grab let's grab this and use it here oops wrong component looks like we already yeah we're already bringing in some icons um let's try search search icon see if it works so down here oops where we brought in this icon button there we go visibility oh yeah we don't want that we want search icon and put that in here icon button we don't need any icon we don't need any uh click handler here on our icon button we may not even need this component at all may be able to take that out uh i'll double check that you know afterwards um should password yeah we don't want it we just want text so we can get rid of all of this and just put text as the type um we don't need this state let's try this search estate search and unchange this handle change um let's just do handle search change and okay so this is going to be a controlled component so if you're not really um if you've ever worked with um inputs and react one way to do inputs is as a controlled component so um let me walk you through that i know i've gone over this uh in previous streams but i i assume we have some people watching that hadn't watched previously when we've done components our control components so here's what we're going to do i actually don't really care for this id right now i'm just going to try to get rid of as much as possible to simplify things um uh you know what i do need the id just for the label um but i do want to change this to search and let's change this to search so remember uh just like you can't use class you have to use class name you also can't use four you need to use html4 um so those are the two that come up most often for me there may be some other properties on uh you know html properties that need to change but for now i can't think of anything so okay so here's how a controlled component is going to work if you notice the value for this component is coming from the state okay and then when we change we're going to call this handle search change function so let's scroll up and write that function now so we already have this handle click and we i guess we could have just left that that the name of that function as handle change uh but handle search change i guess immediately tells you what what's going on handle search change and we're just going to do this set state and we're going to do um search and let's change the state search let's go and at first let's just make this an empty string and what we want to do is let's see what we have here french text this handle search let's see how we do this target how do we do this i feel like how we did this on the other one do we need i'm not going to guess let's just go here um where's our ad bar unchange text field handle search toggle there's that input text field search handle input change all right so i'm just i'm checking out change okay so we have this in our container component as inputs there we go there we go that's where you had to do okay um so let me bring the target value okay so that's a previous project so here we go e there we go so what's gonna happen here is when the component first renders it's going to get its value from state which currently is nothing but then when you type in the search input it will fire off that search function that handle search change function and then it'll grab the value that's that's just been inputted and it'll set that as this value here for search okay then the input will get its value from state right so it's kind of like this circle uh so instead of it's all it's kind of weird that the input's value is always coming from state it's not like you're directly changing the value uh there's this little roundabout thing going on the background in terms of from a user's perspective it works exactly the same as a normal input but behind the scenes it it happens like this so that's um what you call controlled component let me save that i don't think it's going to work because i think it's going to it's still looking for some styles that i have not brought in so let me bring in some of those styles uh let's do form control and do we have anything else without label now we are using a label so i think we just need form control so let's bring that in and let's see if this will work for us nope icon button is not defined oh we didn't bring in an icon button all right i'm not even sure if we're going to need icon button anyway but let's bring it in now just to make it work since our timer already went off all right great okay so here's our search so you can see we type in and we should have let's bring over yet so in react we can see our value so here's our value for that input and as we change what's in the input you can see it updates automatically sorry that's kind of small hopefully you see that but it's updating the state automatically okay which is that's pretty cool and then even if i went in here to the value and change the value is going to let me change it i don't think so all right it's not let me change that text usually i can just click right in there and change it but anyway if it would let me click in there and change it uh then i could update it would automatically update in here so uh not bad pretty cool i do need to change the label i never changed the label so let me do that now and then then we'll finish up and i'll go to the live chat and i'll make sure that i commit these changes right now so you all can see it see the code for them uh in the github repo so where we at up a little bit huh yeah okay search here we go so it says search awesome obviously we're going to change those styles a bit we don't want that you know lime green color in there and uh we may actually want to change the styles a bit more i have something else in mind but it's going to be one of those things that is not necessary but if we have time it'd be cool to put it in you know this looks okay it functions in terms of being able to input stuff it functions of course the search isn't working yet all right awesome let's commit this uh i'm going to bring over my terminal so you all can see how to commit um and you can see the tests running and everything in case you um you're not familiar with that so let's do a git status just to see right all our changes are on our drawer.js component which is good that's what we wanted to see uh if we saw some other components that had been changed then that would be weird we'd want to check it out and see what had changed since we haven't worked on any other components that may have mean that we made a mistake and accidentally edited something without realizing it but this looks good so we're going to do a git commit and we're going to use the am flag a for add so we're going to add um the the file okay add the changes and commit them at the same time and then the m flag means we're going to put in the commit message as well so let's say we add search and nested list to drawer okay now it's going to run through this parts the auto formatting whoa and it looks like this subway is defined but never lose former form help type okay all right not not bad this is kind of cool this came up so we have two errors that we've imported things and never used them so this is very helpful error message it tells us exactly what component and drawer.js and then it's also square so line 6 and line 14 we need to just delete them so let's scroll up here line 6 and line 14 which is now 13 we need to get rid of form helper text great now let's try this again all right so we made it through the linting and then it passed all these tests right so we have a test for layout index and at bar past all our tests and now it's ready to go so we go get push origin since we're just pushing you know right to the master branch this is a little shortcut normally we could say get push origin master but this works as well all right now all whatever we've done now is up on the github repo you can also notice that when we left this we had some weird indentation stuff going on we had semicolons at the end of some of these really wasn't consistent now there are no semicolons our indentation is all fixed even down here on our components look at this everything's everything's looking nice very consistent okay that's that that automatic formatting that we have so the same thing will happen for you if you download this repo you can format the code however you want but when it comes time to commit it'll fix it all up for you and then commit it so that everything committed to the repository will all have a uniform consistent look and it'll still allow you to code in whatever style that you're comfortable with and then it'll auto format for you i think that's really useful you can check out our package.json to see how that was set up and now let me scroll back up in the live chat to where we left off and at this point i'm going to answer all the questions so um if you don't want to stick around for the question answer session i totally understand thank you so much for watching i'll be back tomorrow around the same time 2 p.m eastern time but if you have an extra few minutes i'd love if you could stick around and help me answer some questions or ask some questions of your own i definitely benefit from your expertise all right so if you do have any questions please put them in the live chat now when i get to the bottom of the live chat i will end the stream uh so make sure you get your questions in before then if uh you don't want to ask your question in front of everybody on the live chat uh that's cool i totally understand you can always send me a direct message on twitter or message me on any other social media platforms email me whatever you want and i'd be happy to uh take a shot at answering the question um you know more privately let's see okay cool uh harshit says he's added notifications to his pomodoro timer so if i refresh it should prompt me to enable that i guess it didn't let's try to do a hard refresh that's uh notifications i do have it to allow notifications that's weird um you know what hardship maybe i've already allowed notifications but they're just showing up on my main screen that's probably the case and i i probably don't notice it because i'm usually looking at this screen that you all are looking at as well so i'll have to keep uh keep my eye out on my main screen to see if if that's the case see all right so i'm just scrolling down looking for some questions right now okay there's a little bit of a discussion about um binding this so not necessarily a question for me but i think it may be useful for some of you or just starting out and react so i'm just going to address this briefly so the discussion in the live chat is is about this binding this so if you'll notice uh we don't have this super and then bind this down here for these um functions instead we're using arrow functions so that's what we're doing you know handle click equals we have our our parentheses and then our arrow here and then inside here this works okay so it would have been the same as if we had bound this you know up here and um let's try to find an example i wish i had an example of us using that but i don't i don't think i have one that won't take me a few minutes to get to but basically this is all you need to do in a react component so you don't have to worry about binding it separately you can just do everything right here with an arrow function so really nice a lot shorter and um at least i i think it it makes things a lot easier um i always thought it was kind of cluttered up to have you know a bunch of stuff you're binding up at the top at 2 30 pm my time so a half hour after we started the stream rook got the uh youtube notification that free code camp is live so sorry about that to anyone who didn't get their notification on time that potentially was my fault because i started uh i scheduled the stream so late um that maybe that messed it up so i apologize if that was me i'll try to schedule the streams earlier okay okay harshit says that uh mature ui is actually really hard to test in unit testing uh so he's gonna submit a pr probably submitted pr with end to end testing that'll be really cool if we can show on the stream the comparison between how we're doing unit testing and endtoend testing um i'm i'm excited to check out the difference and because i'm i'm very new to testing and i think it could be helpful uh to some of the you know some of the viewers here and then some of you in the live chat that maybe are more experienced with testing can you know help explain how it's working all right uh harshad says hi jesse i just started project five today and i went through project five day one as a suggestion please add the project five day four project five day six etc a bit at the start of the video it's easier to read and follow in the free code cam videos tab all right i'm not sure i'm not sure um what you mean by that harsh head so i'm sorry maybe i'm just i'm reading that wrong i'm not understanding so if you're still watching could you clarify a little bit for for me what what exactly you'd like me to add um at the start of the video um i'm also going to put these all in one playlist as well so i'm not sure if if you're kind of you'd like that if that's what you're you're referring to or not but i am going to add these i was just waiting to get a little bit more you know video so now we're up to what is this four videos for five i think it's four uh so now it might it might be enough that i could put it in its own uh playlist you go separately from our main live coding with jesse playlist all right so um it'll change i think we're looking at here right there we go okay so uh rook had a question about what's the d bounce and that handle change function so um so you're using uh heart should set this up with with d bounce basically um what that ensures is that this this function isn't uh firing like constantly right so there's gonna be a little um break uh because it doesn't really need to fire constantly right and harshit used lowdash for this so check out the lowdash docks on debounce okay um saying in uh install linter and lint parser es linted parser es len um you know what i have i don't understand why it wasn't working for me uh it was working earlier and i don't know if i was working on this project or if it was another project it's possible maybe that i installed it and needed to close like restart and it worked in the other window because i had opened that afterwards so uh maybe i'll i'll try to give this a restart at some point and see if it works for me then um but i i did have actually is that working okay now at least some of it's working now so these little red dots these are new this is a newer um this is the newer linting so i don't know i don't know why it's working sometimes and not other times um let's see uh any car says uh would be nice if you add issues tax at github so we can collaborate with something yes definitely i i plan on adding some more issues we did have some issues up but um they were all closed uh today so i need to add some more but i definitely plan on doing that so keep a look out in the in the issues especially as the project starts to get bigger i can put a lot more issues in there right now you know we're just starting out so it's harder for me to come up with uh really specific things but i'm that's why i'm kind of skipping over a lot of small style changes because those are great issues especially for beginners and i'd like in case anybody's interested in just kind of learning and getting started with github uh it would be cool to have some you know some issues that wouldn't be super challenging uh for those people and if nobody does them then that's that's cool too i can just finish those up later on um but i'll add some of those in if i have some time today before i go home i'll add them in otherwise maybe i'll try to get to them tomorrow morning uh harsh it says um jesse you should read the contributing file of the repo and maybe review it okay yeah oh um i did read it before when i merged in and it looked pretty good um i'll review it maybe more closely and check it out but i really i liked what you uh which you wrote so if you haven't checked it out already check out the contributing file in our github repo and let me know if you have any suggestions for it or feel free to open a pull request um if if you'd like to change some things but uh it's pretty solid uh harsh you did a good job on that so uh thank you um let's see oh i mean okay so harsha thinks that maybe um the comment earlier from harshad about uh what to add on the videos is the day tag uh which i'm adding on the later ones okay i didn't realize that i didn't add that on the first one so if i didn't i'll go back and check it out oh okay so harsh is saying i i didn't add the right linting i added standard and i need yes lens okay i have to check that out actually let me see where's my i'm preferences and packages yep that's right yeah i did do the uh standard linter so a stand in standard formatter okay so anyway so harsh you're saying i should go with with eslanton um alby says hi guys new to the free code game community as well as coding in general still wrapping my head around a lot of it came a bit late to this live stream um sorry for the new question but what would you use material ui for okay um so for material with the tierra ui basically it just provides us with a bunch of premade react components that are already styled in the material design you know style so it really helps us save a lot of time because we don't have to style them you know ourselves and instead we can just adjust them a little bit you know according to our needs so that's what we use material ui for also you know since material ui components go through testing a lot of people use them it's way more likely that their components would act you'll behave as they should in different environments different browser device combinations so that's why we would use you know something like material ui it's the same reason why you would use let's say bootstrap if you're familiar with that it just provides you with a lot of style a lot of design already there so you don't have to worry about it and it's it's pretty reliable so and also welcome to the free code camp community uh so you know if you find these streams to be helpful please you know come back and join us contribute uh in the live chat and um and ask as many questions as you like and don't worry if you think it's a noob question uh it's not that's not a problem um i welcome any questions so don't don't worry about that at all all right okay rook says code school is having a free weekend this weekend so awesome so if anybody's interested in taking any uh courses tutorials in code school check it out this weekend oh okay cool so uh harsh it's explaining what i need to use an atom so if anybody else would like to do this as well um you know maybe i'm going to read out kind of what harsh it's saying so basically we're using eslint in the project with standard js rules so what we need to do in our editor and in this case i'm using atom is use eslint with what i assume with standard js rules and that'll give us the same so what we should use is the linter es lint package so we can check it out here so we'll enter yes sorry for this being really small so check out linter eslint and then install that and okay harsh it's actually pasted in the command so you can install atom packages from the command line if you like uh as as long as you downloaded apm um you can install it so in this case we just use the the interface you know the graphical interface for that but either way will work so i'm at the bottom of the live chat so i'm not i'm not gonna wait and set this up um you know completely but you can see it it doesn't actually take that long so i'm assuming that we're gonna have to put something in here for the rules to change it up uh but that's what we will be using for future shows uh assuming i can get it to run okay okay so harsh it's saying i should see automatically cool um i should probably disable some of the other stuff i'm using then right do we no i shouldn't disable it okay all right let's try it out then uh let's try it on this side so just add a semicolon okay so i'm not getting anything yet so roxanne restart the editor okay all right so i'll try restarting the editor then later and um uh and then try that out so anyway thank you um thanks everybody uh for for watching and for all your uh great um contributions in the live chat thanks harshit for um for all the pull requests and everybody else who helped out on those issues kind of discussing what we needed to do i really appreciate all of your input and um i'll be back tomorrow um what's tomorrow wednesday yeah wednesday okay yeah i don't think i have anything going on meeting wise tomorrow so it should be around 2 p.m and uh yeah so until then uh have a great day and yeah see you tomorrow
