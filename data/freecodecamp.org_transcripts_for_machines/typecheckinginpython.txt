the best way for type checking in Python is by using is instance this is the traditional way of checking the type of a particular variable in python as you can see we have to use the type function and check if it's equals to a particular data type then we can print whatever we want to print but a better and more reliable way of doing this is by using this instance all you need to do is say if is instance then you need to pass in the value and the data type that you want to check and do whatever you want to do if this condition is true so if I run this you can see that both of them says value is an integer but this is a better and more reliable way of doing this
