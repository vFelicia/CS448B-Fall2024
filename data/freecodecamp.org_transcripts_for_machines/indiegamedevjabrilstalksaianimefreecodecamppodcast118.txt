e welcome back to the free Coke Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of free Coke camp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by jabril jabril is building a turnbased fighting game called Ultra bouts and he's developed a ton of games over the years which he's featured on his very popular YouTube channel all about game development got lots of links to cool stuff that he's built over the years that you can check out but first jabil how's it going man Quincy thanks for having me man thanks for the intro that was such a great intro thanks yeah I just I rehearsed when I told you earlier I just rehearse when I'm like walking back from dropping my kids off at school like just kind of yeah any anyway yeah I'm thrilled to have you here man cuz like I've just enjoyed so much like uh watching your video lat I always watch it late at night because it's so entertaining and you I find you like laugh twice as hard at things when it's like a little bit after bedtime so uh yeah man like I was just watching like for example the fake Shark Tank Episode generator tool that you created that that creates the the scripts from like uh Shark Tank and like they're very absurd product ideas but like you know it feels just like an actual Shark Tank Episode in terms of the absurdity of the show which is if anybody spent a lot of time in business you know that the show is pretty divorced from reality in terms of how business deals actually go down but that's that's part of the fun of it right it's reality television which is really hyperreal television yeah yeah so anyway I'm sorry to like ramble right off the bat man but it's great to have you here yeah it's great to be here man I'm excited to talk about all things code and development and Game Dev and let's get into it awesome and I just want to point out also jabril uh contributor to the freeo camp Community you can check out his 5our introduction to programming course it's very flavorful and it's very different from like kind of like the more straight lace course that I would develop if I were creating of course it's you just have all these different kind of like visual gags and other things you do to like really engage and help people retain everything so like yeah I'm going to link to that as well in the show notes be sure to check that out after you finish listening to this interview yeah after after yeah and just a real quick I want to thank the 8,452 people around the world who support free Coke Camp each month thank you for supporting us with your donations it's a huge help to our charity and it makes programming like this possible so if if you are not yet supporting free C Camp check out uh freec camp.org donate and you can start supporting us today tax exempt charity you can deduct this from your taxes and you know our mission is very simple to create free learning resources for everyone one of those resources of course interviews with real life game devs who are in the field building projects getting players play testing refining and continuing to extend their library of awesome interactive experiences for people interactive art really um so yeah jail I just want to go way back I always like to start with childhood like tell us about little jbr tell us about like your early formative years and how you got into Game Dev yeah let's go back uh before I do that I want to give a shout outs to you guys over at free code Camp love what you guys are doing keep it up um so let's let's go back I think it's it's probably best that I start with um I was I think 9 years old I was living in Virginia at the time my father's in the military so I've been around the coast of the United States and I played a lot of video games when I was growing up actually I should take it back back back when I was I think four I think it was my mom used to play a lot of video games on the Super Nintendo and she used to play uh Donkey Kong Country and I would watch her play this game and I was just so amazed because she had a control in her hand right and she's controlling Donkey Kong but there's other agents on screen and as a young kid I'm like who who's controlling the agents who's controlling the other ones right and so I've always had a FAS but it wasn't until I was about 9 years old when I was introduced to the first Smash Bros on Nintendo 64 and I don't know what it is about that project that game it just like got my game development bug like just running and I will never forget we moved from Virginia to California and I had a notepad and the entire time I'm just like designing levels that I would do if I was the developer for Smash Bros um and then fast forward to I think it was like I was 14 and I got an advertisement for this thing called Game Maker it's like you can code you can code you can make games without coding what the ad and I was like no way Mom can you buy this for me and she was like well if you do your chores for a week straight I'll buy it for you you dang right I did my chores for we week straight she bought it for me and that was the last time I got a full night's sleep wow yeah so you pretty early on you were like I love games I I'll tell you a little anecdote about Smash Brothers when it came out like of course I was like a big N64 like like I had N64 actually had four controllers cuz I loved couch coop games as as they're called now you call it couch Coop because you're actually playing in the room with other people unlike most you know online games today uh and I remember like that was such a game changer it was so imaginative I just I couldn't believe the absurdity like wow I can actually go up as Donkey Kong and punch Mario in the face like and knock him off the level and even like the the actual intro stuff kind of like like the final boss is like hands and it it really evokes kind of like a childlike play like you're actually like you pick up your action figures as a kid and you'd have HeMan and Skeletor fist fight and stuff like twisting him around and stuff and and that kind of it had that that Vibe of like I'm just a kid who's hanging out on a summer day and playing with my action figures yeah such a cool game yeah it's an amazing game huge competitive uh scene around that game too which I never would have imagined like people getting so good at it they dedicate like years to getting really good at playing Princess Peach in Smash Brothers Melee like a specific character in a specific game but it's a Legendary game you know it's Legendary game yeah so okay so you get game maker your your mom gets it for you after being a really good kid for a week I don't know about all that but uh I did my choice what what what were the first few days like uh when you had game maker like what were the first things you experimented with okay man so it was Game Maker 5 and they had a bunch of examples I'll never forget it it was like a I forget what the actual game is but it was like a plane game 2D plane game and it was like an example project and then they showed you how to like shoot bullets how to control the plane move left and right how to spawn enemies and I just spent so many hours trying to understand like what every little component was doing and all the examples that they had I think they had just converted over to mark in game maker as a something you can make games without coding so like a drag and drop system like really early days and I did the best I could to understood like the logic that was going on and then I made my first project was was like a a pong remix if you will uh I can send you an image of that I still have images of it yeah and it it was terrible it was an absolutely terrible game uh I did not understand physics but I did the best I could uh but I shipped it so that's that's pretty important and then I just kept on I and then I learned about the forums I learned about the game maker forums which was like so important to my learning on how to use Game Maker because all of a sudden I had this resource to all these people that haven't doing it for years and I ask them questions they will answer it and yeah yeah so getting hooked up with other game developers like did you find that that like was a huge motivational shot in the arm in terms of like I'm actually showing off to people that I'm interacting with did you feel like you found your SoCal you know your tribe so to speak yeah yeah 100% And I think one thing that's easy to miss from back in the days is that distribution of games was not it was not a thing like you were making games for yourself and maybe 10 other people in a forum thread that's about it so back then like you had to do it for the love of it and I think that having discovered the Forum it really helped keep that love alive you know yeah I mean did you build any games that you just like kept to yourself like this is my game like I just want to like I'm the only person who's ever played this this game kind of like a lot of musicians they like hoard like their best work just for themselves to enjoy there were a few projects where that was the case but I I wouldn't say I put like all my time energy into it um the ones where I put a lot of time energy I wanted as many people to play as possible but again back in those days like you're talking 20 down it's like oh my God yes I can't believe this yeah but there there was one project in particular I'll never forget that I made with my brother and sister and it was you you had to like race to the helicopter it was like a threeplayer game we had to split the keyboard into three different controls through like it was was arrows and something else and we just shared a keyboard but it was so fun to you know be able to put our imagination you know into an app it was a good time do you play with you said Lo WD just for anybody who hasn't gamed recently like that's those are the keys that I guess customarily uh people playing like Counter Strike and stuff will use but I actually use esdf because it gives my pinky like access to more buttons for like switching weapons and stuff so and I I know uh I learned about this from Gabe Newell founder of steam uh or of uh valve uh now the steam company instead of making games they just have a game platform they do occasionally put out games but uh but yeah he he's like a esdf player instead of a wd player how do you what do you have any particular since we're on the topic like do you have any particular like control scheme quirks that you think are unique to you uh I don't think so honestly these days I if it's not a Gamepad I don't know if I can play it okay yeah so so even like for PC games and stuff you like plug a PlayStation controller in or something like that I'm a I'm a huge Gamepad buff I have so many game pads like weird ones and all types of unique ones so yeah I have a bunch of ones that will fit the best need for whatever the game is if they support it of course awesome yeah do you ever get like like the steering wheel type game like or like the flight stick do you do any games like that I wish that I had time to invest in stuff like that I my dad had one when I was younger and it was pretty fun but now days I I don't have like an hour block to just dedicate to that unfortunately so it's not worth the investment well you're you're focused on getting getting things done and making games not just playing games right so um so before we get into like fullblown game development I do want to learn a little bit more like so you went from the forums was there like a particular like Apo in game development where you're just focusing on that very small audience of people on the same thread on a forum like hey I've been working on this game here's the latest build you know stuff like that was there was there a transition period where you started making games for like a broader audience and do you remember what that Reflection Point was um H that's a great question honestly I don't think that really happened until I started the YouTube channel yeah now there was like a a rudimentary form of that so on the forums I I don't know how many active people there were I'd say probably a hundred people were active you know a given month any given month and if when you got good enough in the community you could have a a thread post that you would update like your game is doing and people would chime in they would play it and give you feedback but it required a certain level of skill and I remember I hit that I hit that threshold for like one or two of my projects but by that time I was you know transitioning out of game maker and getting into like you know High School sports and going to college prep and all that stuff you know so so a lot of people's passions are derailed by high school and like the kind of high school metag game so to speak like oh I've got to be were you were you like a popular kid at school or like how would you describe your high school experience I wouldn't say I was popular in the sense that like a lot of people correlate like the popular kid too I got along with everyone so I I guess I was popular in that sense but no I wasn't I definitely wasn't the popular kid and and it's interesting the school that I went to I I was definitely in the closet about making games I didn't tell anyone just due to the school that I went to like no one cared about it and it was kind of nerdy if you will back then so I wasn't trying to get stuffed in the locker you know yeah have you like so this is just like an observation like I I saw this interesting video essay you know I watch lot lot of video essays on YouTube uh and it was about like how like nerdy and geeky and like these terms have kind of like almost fallen out of use because like everybody's a Star Wars fan now or you know uh you know a Lord of the Rings fan or something like there there's not really a stigma associated with using computers like there used to be I mean have you observed that like I mean do you ever feel like what you're doing is quotequote nerdy anymore when you're like you know making these very you know artial games that are very esoteric and like probably a very small subset of Gamers let alone people at large would be interested in playing these games yeah the so nerves are definitely in Vogue now and I think about this quite often it's hard to unpair my experiences as a nerve as a kid right from you know the the man that I am today but uh it's so I think it's so beautiful that there are so many people that I can reach out to and have conversations about code about game development about apps because I remember when I was starting out it was nearly impossible to find anyone to talk about this stuff with like I was lucky that my mom had a friend that knew someone that had a software development job and when I asked him for advice he just gave me Visual Studio 20 for something like that he just gave it to me and it was like good luck like that was all I had and I remember trying I tried to install it and I was like I have no idea what this is and I just never touch it again um but yeah I think it's so beautiful that you know nowadays you can talk to literally anyone about code and they'll have some idea and I think it's just due to the prevalence of how important you you know code is and how prevalent it is in our society nowadays you know yeah 100% like I've definitely found that like when I'm at a dinner party or something uh it used to be like even 10 years ago I'd be like oh yeah I'm a software developer and people would be like oh okay cool and the conversation would just move in move on but now people are like oh cool like um I'm working on this app you know or like I've been doing some python on the weekend and stuff like that and like suddenly like it just seems like the number of people who are interested in learning programming has skyrocketed and that any like uh there there's kind of like there used to be that like oh it's for smart people type talk but I don't really hear that anymore when I talk to people it could be that just like the crowd I'm rolling with is a little older now um because I'm older so like when I go talk to people they're often in their 30s and 40s like I am you know uh as opposed to like younger kids when I was a kid like people were like not very sure of themselves and they would often like limit themselves but you know as you grow older you start to realize oh like these limits are artificial you know like there's nothing stopping an accountant from getting really good at coding right um I did you I think it's more than that though well I I I think it's a bit more than that I think that you know just relating to my experiences when I was a kid the accessibility to these things were so hard to get to right but we have things like free code camp for example right where if I want to learn something I just go to free code camp and you guys have all these resources for me to learn how to do these things right and this is something that we have to thank the modern era for you know uh you you know you take game maker for example I'm so happy that they decided to do a drag and drop system because without that I don't know if I would have I don't know how long it would have took me to discover code you know but that was a good entry point for me to say like hey this looks like something I can do you know you're you're telling me I don't need to code but little did I know it was a stepping stone to the actual code because there's limits to what you can do with the dragon drop but the point I'm trying to make is that I think just things have got a lot more accessible in the Modern Age and it has really enabled so many people to be able to learn to code or just simply know more about what it takes to code or be a coder you know yeah absolutely well uh I'm really interested in like understanding kind of the tools that your tool progression because you said that uh you had like some some friend who gave you visual Studios which is a gigantic very complicated piece of software right like that's like an industri at 15 yeah so you that's like giving somebody the master sword right when they walk into the cave instead of like you know stair stepping them up through like some sort of like leveling progression right uh so what what did you do you're like you put that down did you just go back to game maker like what what tools did you get into do you remember the sequence of tools you progressed through well funny enough the the I got Visual Studio before I even knew game maker existed so I knew that I wanted to make games but I didn't know how it it like I cannot explain how my understanding of making games was like how how difficult it was for me to to grasp the concept of making a game how do you use a computer to render Graphics to render logic Etc I I can't explain to you like how difficult trying to imagine that was um and so yeah the first I asked my mom and she had the friend he gave me Visual Studio I was like here you go this is how you code good luck that was all he gave me I tried to install it I tried to install it didn't work thankfully like a year or two later I discovered game maker uh and they did game maker for like four years I think it was something like that and then I found Unity soon after that and tell us about Unity just like for people that are uninitiated like why is Unity different from you know like n SDK for developing on like PlayStation or something like that right yeah Unity it just provides so many things for you it makes like developing games so easy uh they do graphics for you they do physics for you they do um different like pathf finding logic they do so many things for you right out the box that you don't have to think about the hard stuff you can just get started making some type of game and then in the process of making your game using their their out of thebox tools you learn how to like use those tools more proe over time and that was really instrumental for me I I'll never forget when I first started Unity that using Unity was the first time I ever made a 3D game it was always my goal to make 3D games but having done 2D for so long I thought it was like such an impossible task but in the first I think week of using Unity so much of what I learned with game maker not to mention game maker has their own coding language as well so that was another thing that was like oh I'm not a real coder I'm using gameer language yeah exactly it's like I'm not really coding I'm using scratch or I'm using some simplified for but it really is still coding I think people kind of like talk themselves out of like like you know acknowledging what their their accomplishments they they kind of like denigrate their accomplishments oh I'm just using the training wheels equivalent but it's still coding right yeah yeah 100% And so I'm using Game Maker language and I'm like I'm not a real coder because I'm using their little subset language right but then I start to uh develop games in unity I was like why not right and I was like wait a second this is C this is this is a this is a big boy language I know what a for Loop is I know what an if statement is I I know what a wild Loop is like hold on I know all these Concepts and like it was so easy to transfer from game maker language to C and then from there C to Python and then yeah it as long as you learn the basics I don't no matter what the language is like coding is so easy to transfer the skills over yeah absolutely like at the at the end of the day it's like the same basic like data structure and algorithm Concepts that have been around since Allan Turing right maybe maybe like a few were refined by subsequent generations of computer scientists and then you're just applying math that has been known all the way back to like aisi back and like yeah you the ancient uh you know Indian civilizations and Babylonian civilizations and stuff right like there's nothing new Under the Sun except layers of extraction that make it easier and will continue to make it gradually easier and easier and and we'll definitely talk about that in a little bit but I what were you doing now you can make a 3D game right it's not some pipe dream it's it's something you actually did within the first week of using these tools yeah like what was that like a honeymoon phas for you were you like walking on air knowing like wow I'm actually doing it yeah I was incredibly proud I I believe the first s game I made was a game Jam uh it's still up somewhere it's called super hay stack finder or something that super stack finder finding a needle in a Hast stack or something like that that's yeah that's the concept so you're jumping platform to platform you're looking for a little a cookie for some reason um so that was the first project I did and I was like there's no way like this was so easy you just add one extra Dimension and it's not that difficult and then from there I made my first app that I launched on the Google Play Store it's called Pizza jump still up to this day and I was so proud of that game I was so proud uh and then from there like the sky was the limit I was unlocked I was Unleashed like I I I will I never will forget that after that project that was when I really realized that like there are no limits I can do anything I can do anything and then from there I got into python which I want to say really quick there's one piece of advice that I have for anyone who especially like starting to develop no matter what language it is be very careful listening to some people who try to give you advice on like what language is good or bad or not because there were so many people that telling me that python is not a useful language and it's it's for beginners and it's not a good language but python is so powerful like when I started to code in Python and how simple it was to do certain Concepts comparative to to C I was like what are you guys talking about this thing is amazing and then obviously you got all this support and you can do Ai and artificial intelligence learning it but yeah there just so many lessons that are coming to me at at such a short period of time that I'll never forget so it's almost like uh like a lot of the kind of Mythos around game development is melting away and you're seeing like the actual daytoday of game development the Practical considerations how do I get distribution for my game how do I um come up with interesting ideas that are going to be fun how can I recombine these different game development Concepts and tropes that have been pioneered through like the 70s 80s 90s like how can I recombine those into interesting games right I I don't mean to be putting too many words in your mouth but that's I imagine you're probably going through something like that as a kid who's just built their first game using Unity yeah and and so where did you go from there like so you're in high school you're building games like do you show your friends you said that you didn't uh that you kind of kept your game development to yourself because nobody was interested in that stuff they're probably interested in you know typical high school stuff like football and getting a car and other stuff like you grew up in California right like you said you moved for what uh area of California were you in I live in San Diego and went to a very very Urban school so yeah a lot of the kids there they're used to playing like the Call of Duties and Need for Speed and all the you know the the triaa games I'll never forget I showed my friend I I had this really uh rudimentary but cool drifting game like like car drifting game yeah drift racing game that I showed my friend and it was like gray box and whatnot but and he just laughed at me he's like what is this like why would I ever play this you know and I mean listen I understand where he's coming from you know why would he waste his time playing that when there's like Need for Speed etc etc but I'll never forget that experience I like yeah I'll just keep this in my little Forum friends that sucks man that's that's so discouraging but like like let's talk about kind of opening up and blossoming of the BR as you kind of like so you're going to have lots of encounters like that just like like I had similar encounters with my writing like I'd write like a short story I'd show it to somebody they'd be like oh man this is why would I read this when I can go read you know you know bestselling book by somebody right that you get it like the supermarket or whatever you know like how did you kind of did you ever stop doing game development at any point I did I did I had a I think it was like a fouryear gap of I didn't really touch code at all wow um yeah it was so The Story Goes at 15 I introduced to game maker five and then I'm making games really passionate about it but then I think I I turned like a junior in high school and all of a sudden like you know I'm interested in girls and being cool and going to parties and stuff right and so that's where I start to invest a lot of my time and I just like stopped touching code um but I pick it back up at I think like 23 or something like that so from 19 to like 23 four years something like that 23 24 um is when I pick it back up again cuz you know if you have a passion for something like no matter what it's always going to poke you so hey was it like calling to you from the bookshelf like you just walk by your old uh Unity books back in the day we'd like buy actual gay like books like these big thick books some of them would come with CD ROMs and stuff I don't know if that may have been before your time CU you're a little bit younger than me but like did you ever like look at your old things like oh like kind of like heave like your chest little huh like like Toy Story when he kind of like gets tired of the toys and uh maybe Toy Story 10 Toy Story 11 he actually becomes like Tom Hanks character from big where he's like working at an exe you know as like a toy tester at some big toy company or something like that you know like like pining back for the for the toys did you ever feel that kind of like that you were trying to deny a part of yourself that Society was like causing you to like deler V deler from that childhood ambition yeah I think in hindsight I definitely agree with that obviously in the moment I I didn't have any awareness of this but yeah I think it hit a point where I realized that all these things that I was chasing externally didn't really matter you know like when the friends dried up and the party stopped you know calling me to come over all you're left with is these memories that you have as a kid you know spending 16 hours a day developing this game that 10 people are going to look at you know yeah and yeah it was calling me back I was like hey look I you know really enjoyed those times s and I want to have memories like that again so I picked up game maker again started making some games again and then it hit a point where I wanted to 3D and so Unity was that option yeah so like once you hit the ground running with unity like like maybe you can just take us give us a quick tour of the next few years of your life like what what were you doing did you have the equivalent of like you know Kanye staying at home an entire summer making beats you know like where it was like a Renaissance of creativity or like what happened yeah yeah yeah yeah I I yes 100% that that was me from 15 to like 18 like every single Summer from that point on I was like nope don't want to go to parties no don't want to do anything I'm just going to sit here in code games um but in terms of so I I I got to Unity I think around like 23 24 and then I'm making games in unity and I'm watching all these different tutorials and whatnot and I'm also making YouTube videos not I'm not making the YouTube videos I'm making today I'm making like documentary style YouTube videos but then I realized that like there's a lot of people that have tutorials on how to like make these games and whatnot right but there weren't a lot of channels of people making stuff from what they learn from the tutorials yeah and I was like I'm going to do that that sounds like fun you know you kind of found a new Lane uh and and like I have lots of friends who do this genre of YouTube video where they're like I built this game like like or they speed up the development and it's like just lightning fast like here now we got the character jumping and not like slumping over and stuff like that right so like I to some extent I think you inspired or helped inspire a lot of people who now do that kind of uh game development and like actually apply the skills that they learned from tutorials on like free code camp and places like that right can you talk about like an early video that you created and at what point did you start uploading videos to YouTube it was like maybe like eight or eight or nine years ago yeah that's a whole other that's a whole other Branch but yeah yeah been a long time before we get to that you've been building games like I'm just trying to bridge the past with the present like yeah what point did you start like like did you why did you even approach YouTube did you were you like this can help me raise awareness of my games or I just I have time I'm just going to create some videos for myself and my friends what was your philosophy I I've done a lot of things all right I've done a lot of things I'm going to make it really brief because that's a whole other branch of the story but to make it short and correlated to the coding stuff when I was in high school me and some buddies got together and decided to make a a YouTube channel okay we didn't have any skills we didn't really know anything so we made a prank Channel okay it was just a thing to do back then and that taught me a lot about uh how to build audiences how lucrative it can be to create internet content and so that bug that that bug was like the the foundation for me to later create the Channel that I have today but so long story short it hit a point where the pranks where YouTube demonetized all pranks across the platform I was okay this this Jig Is up right yeah however I knew that there was still a lot of value in speaking to an audience and you know giving them entertainment and value and so I made a documentary Channel where I would just document various things that was happening all the while in the background I come home and I'm coding like hours and hours and hours at night but it didn't dawn on me to share what I was doing it was this is past game maker Forum so I didn't really have anyone to share it with it was just kind of like a me thing I did for myself you know as a as a meditation if you will but yeah one day it hit me that I spend I was spending so many hours developing games and apps so many hours watching tutorials and what I wanted was more content on YouTube of people demonstrating their learnings from these this content and at the time there was maybe one person that was doing it and so I decided to completely Rebrand my channel to jabrils we're doing coding now and I think like the fourth video blew up I did a AI machine learning project in unity and uh good times good times yeah so um first of all why is there an S at the end of your name jabrils is like Jail's Channel or is that why I I love this question um you're going to be a little disappointed the answer is just because I find it funny I can't tell you how many times like i' I've been in rooms with execs and they call me jbr's plural and it's just so it's just funny I don't know if I call it's test of whether people actually know who you are like no we like um so I have a friend uh and what she does is like she puts like an emoji like a Ramen Emoji or something at the front of her LinkedIn name that way when like recruiters or some automated message sends it it always she can always see the ramen Emoji at the beginning of her name and she knows oh this isn't a real person who knows me this is just like some bulk like mail or something like that so smart unfortunately no I just find it funny when people refer to me as a plural it's just funny it's like if I call you Quincy as you multiple people it's just funny that's it yeah that'd be like the Quincy from Bleach everybody's tell I haven't seen bleach but everybody's like oh yeah the quincies like people occasionally every once in a while you get this email I want let you take my bonai what's bonai you know but apparently there's like this race of like Angels or something like that in in this show Bleach and they're the most powerful cuz they can take away like the Bleach characters like weapon the Bon anyway sorry but but like yeah so you have this YouTube channel the fourth video blows up of course like this happens to a lot of people like free C Camp we published uh you know some videos that really blew up like after like I think like three or four years and we're like oh should we chase this success like maybe we should lean into this like Lane that we found and it's it's hard to reproduce that lightning in the bottle yeah what was your like after that fourth video what happened I did not learn learn my lesson unfortunately it took me a while to learn my lesson what I mean by that is so this video blows up and it reaches a large audience an audience I've never seen before and in hindsight I realized like what I should have done was really capitalize on the audience give them more of what they wanted but instead I continued to make content that you know was just really for me and the views didn't really match that but I I think it was a really important part to to my journey but it did give me a greater audience than what I had previously but yeah so so maybe you could talk about that balance of like balancing your own interest rather than just becoming like YouTuber person who's the generically approachable interesting person that like you know probably does well on YouTube but but I think to some extent the algorithm probably forces you in certain directions in terms of uh being not yourself but being who people want you to be right like I imagine if you're like a late night TV show host you have to shave off a lot of the edges and and you know like probably similar with YouTube I I mean I don't know this because I've steadfastly refused to adopt like various conventions around you know video podcasting like I didn't even do video podcasting for a long time and now that we're doing them I'm doing them in like a kind of a weird way like no editing uh any of that stuff that it's like unconventional but it's I want to do it I want it to be real right like how did you balance like you probably saw the numbers like oh people don't like the real jabril as much as they like the jabril from video number four do I have to like put myself in a you know freeze myself in time and just be that exact person for every video if I want to get traction like did you go through that kind of like soul searching it it took me a while to to understand that dichotomy of content uh I'm I'm saying like probably a couple years ago when I really understood this this dichotomy of content um but at the time you you know I was just happy to have any audience watch this watch stuff that I was doing uh but yeah I I it I think that it's not necessarily like what the algorithm is encouraging I think it's more rooted in just human nature right like you turn on any show and you you have some expectation as to what you're going to see right if you turn on America's Funniest Home Videos and all of a sudden they start showing like an a hockey match you be like yeah what what is this I'm never going to watch this again right and you know it's a lesson I had to learn and it is really unfortunate but on top of that I think it's what has inspired me to do things like create a manga or create a game because that element of pleasing an audience really only affects you when you rely on it to pay your bills right I don't rely on the manga or the game that I'm making Ultra bers to to pay my bills therefore I can be as free as I want in my expression with those projects and you know the the the goal with the YouTube channel is to hopefully get to someday where I figure out a way to have that free expression while also paying my bills but it's easier said than done and I'm I'm currently in that Journey so yeah so if you don't mind me asking like like how how do you pay the bills like uh and and maybe you can talk about how you paid the bills like graduating from high school and just you if you graduated and and progressing in general I say if you graduated cuz I I didn't graduate I dropped out as a sopore but like a lot of people uh like they they kind of have this listless period uh did you go to university I went to Junior College for a couple years and then dropped out okay so lot going for the wrong degre yeah what were you wrong degree I was studying film and communication no one told me all right no one told me um but we're s we're literally sitting in class watching movies and like writing essays on movies and I'm just like what what am I doing and so I I was I dropped out with the plan to return to do biology cuz I love biology so much but I learned that my financial aid right now and I was not down to to a loan so yeah well so you dodged the loan bullet uh that's good like you did you figured it out before you had taken on a whole lot of you know potentially restrictive debt that you'd have to pay off um which the credit card they the credit card companies hate me for they tell me I need different types of loans yeah exactly uh well congratulations on that so you you dropped out of Junior College what happens what do you do this is like at some point you did create the YouTube channel but like or maybe you've been doing the YouTube channel for a while but like how did you get from that jabril that didn't really know what what to do to a person who you know has a pretty large like half a million subscriber YouTube channel who's like a household name among game developers who uh built a lot of games and has a lot of games in the App Store and just comes up with really cool projects that we're going to talk a little bit about later like seemingly like every few months you you pop up you're like hey here's this crazy new thing that nobody's ever done before like how did you what what was the transition period yeah between those two people yeah so I I've always had multiple things going on like since as early as I can remember and at the time that I'm doing College I'm also filming for the prank Channel that I was talking about not too long ago and so me and my buddies will get together on the weekend we film the prank stuff and that it didn't pay any bills like it was you know it paid gas for us to get around town every once in a while we get like a sponsor deal and we would split it but I did that at that time I was I was living off financial aid but after that ended I got I started doing a bunch of odd jobs so I worked at a comedy club uh what were you doing then I was I didn't have an official title so it was a new comedy club that opened up in San Diego called American Comedy Co and I just remember code uh emailing the owner because there's a bunch of articles on it and I was like hey I will do anything please just let me help you out I was like yeah sure come by and then I came by and I never had official title but I helped out with marketing I helped out with um you know a little design and whatnot uh that was a lot of fun but that ended for me and then I got into doing uh working at a radio station uh all the while all the while I'm still making YouTube videos trying to figure that part out and then I worked at the radio station for about four years to pay the bills and then oh man I don't know how deep you want to go into this I've done a lot let's do it Comedy Club to a radio station you've had an interesting life so far yeah okay and so so the radio station was the last job that I ever worked and when I left the radio station life got incredibly interesting and difficult at the same time man okay I'm G break it down so at the at the end of me working at the radio station I had a friend that I knew that made prank videos that I met through making prank videos right his name is Garrett his Channel's called over when you say prank video just give us an idea of what a prank video would this be like like MTV punked or something like that or like what what is it what is a prank video so I'm trying to think my favorite prank video that we did so like one video that I did is um I did like a magic trick so I had like a shirt that had a graphic on it but it was like a it was like a magic trick shirt right so like I go and ask people for directions say hey do you know where this thing is and they point me to directions but then like I turn around and do a magic trick the the graphic would change and I turn around it's a new uh graphic and then like wait did your shirt change I'm like what were you talking so it's stuff like that you okay so basically kind of like uh yeah yeah it's just like gaslighting people essentially just that's one way to put it Quincy yeah Okay cool so so I'm sorry like I just wanted to get an idea that sounds like a pretty cool I didn't know there were like design changing shirt I won't ask the mechanics of that cuz I don't want to ruin it if you know how what happens with the quarter when it's supposedly behind your ear it makes it a lot less interesting right but um maybe you can talk about that go back to that friend who was doing these videos with you yeah so so he had his own channel and he had a lot of success from uh doing YouTube pranks way more than I had right and we had reconnected when I was working at the radio station and you said hey I need help filming are you willing to like you lived in Orange County I lived in San Diego it's about 100 miles something like that apart yeah both very nice places to live by the way very very nice places indeed and so I agreed I I would go up to his house I think on the weekends and then stay for a few days help him film then I go back home uh but it hit a point where I was filming with him so much I had forgot that I had a shift at the radio station and they called me and they're like hey you have a shift I'm like I am not in town I cannot make it and so like they call me in they like give me the talk and whatnot they didn't fire me thankfully but I go back to my buddy and I'm telling him about this this this dilemma how fun it is to film with him and how annoying it is to go work at this radio station he's like you should just quit you should quit come work with me I'll pay you some money and it'll all be good and like I'm terrified you know content creation is very risky and So eventually I say okay I'll do it I quit I go work with him a month later we're no longer working together what happened I had there's a lot of drama there's a lot of drama he was going through some stuff in his life um but it's all public if you don't look it up okay my homie overboard humor shouts to Garrett shouts to Garrett um but long story so so after a month of working with him I'm no longer working with him I had maybe $2,000 in savings and I'm like what did I just do and so the content creation is not really doing anything for me uh I take up a lot of odd jobs which is really difficult to do in San Diego at least with the skill set that I had of like film making and whatnot and I I'll never forget I gave up I was like I'm done I'm done throwing in the towel I'm just going to go work some job and figure out how to live a regular casual life and so I take an interview at a store called Joan's fabric stores so like literally like generic retail essentially just just just give me some money I'm going to be like one of the characters from clerks basically just give me some money yeah that that was my only priority and I'll never forget I walked in there and the manager takes me to his room really small cramped room with boxes everywhere and he's like okay so tell me a bit about yourself I tell him he's like interesting what what are your what are your dreams what do you want to do and I was taken back by that question and I told him I was like you know I really wish that I could you know build a YouTube channel and travel the world etc etc and he closes this little book and he says I'll never forget this you don't belong here I'm not going to hire you and I was like what he like yeah all I'm going to do is use you to stock shelves uh stock books uh boxes on shelves I just need someone tall that's it I'll be wasting your talent I I kid you not I kid you not and so I walk out of there just like what just happened but that gave me the energy that I needed to really push as hard as possible on content creation wow shout out to Joan's fabric store like the the manager there for setting you on that course that's great yeah I I wish I would have went and got his name and shook his hand but uh I'll never foret that if he can see you now yeah so that that gave me all the energy I needed I was so fired up after that and I did a bunch of content creation I I spent maybe eight hours a day doing odd job or or looking for odd jobs to enough where it would pay my bills and then one day I came across this odd job from someone who's looking for help to film physics content which happened to be Diana Cowern from physics girl and so huge YouTube channel huge science learning Science Education Channel yeah and I responded to that did some editing for her she liked it and I've been with her editor for like three four years and very incredibly grateful shout outs to Diana I uh can't wait for her to get better yeah absolutely yeah yeah so um so you're doing editing and and is that like how did you transition into like building some of these games were you doing games at the same time maybe just give us a little bit more context into the timeline so that's cool so you've made the transition from Radio which is probably a job a lot of people who study Communications and journalism uh and things like that would be interested in going into but um you know you stopped working in radio and but now you're working in editing for YouTube creators and you're still creating your own stuff on the side but you're paying the bills by working with you know a much more successful like name brand YouTube Creator right correct yes yeah so so yeah I would pay the bills doing a bunch of jobs but all the entire time I'm creating content like it's not getting views it's not making any money but I'm creating content the entire time because it was it was a fun thing to do that I really enjoyed and I always believed in his potential just to get the timeline synced yeah okay awesome and did you have other videos that started to get traction like that like your fourth video did you did you kind of like strike gold so to speak or or like uh kind of find that filament that like lights the bulb correctly to use like a weird uh Thomas Edison analogy like were you able to like iterate toward a formula that worked that would that also resonated with your passion as a Creator a little bit a little bit again in hindsight I think that I I probably should have been learning more lessons rapid more rapidly than I did at the time but I had did the first video of uh Mak a machine learning game it was like writing my first machine learning game something like that it went crazy viral and then I just continue to upload videos like as I seen it and then I struck gold again I made another video called making a game in 48 hours like this is before this was a trend and that video also went really viral but at the time like I was honestly just getting lucky you know I I was learning like little lessons here and there but it wasn't until I connected with a bunch of other content creators and they were able a like share lessons between each other where I really started to adapt you know optimal strategies if you will yeah yeah and like just looking at your most popular videos many of which I've watched uh you know the infinite staircase is real nearly 8 million years my first learning machine learning like about 2 million for that and also the 48 hour game Jam thing uh Minecraft but on a quantum computer you know stuff like that very cool so uh a lot of your videos have connected with the audience and like I guess Way Beyond your audience have had like mainstream appeal over the years can you talk about like what that's like in terms of uh does when you have a video that goes viral like your infinite staircase video did uh I mean 8 million views for like a sciency topic this is not like some you know you're you're not like a hot woman or something like that right like you're you're just a guy who's developing interesting stuff he's like building stuff and showcasing what he's building um can you talk about like the the audience and the experience of having that video blow up I think I've had like a a tweet go viral with the BTS Army and that's like my 15 minutes of fame is like I I I tweeted something about like BTS just not even realizing what I was tweeting and like all these people jumped on me and that I guess that got like 15 million retweets or something like that that's like the closest I've ever gotten to famous so to speak but did you feel famous did things did it feel different to have a video getting all these views and people commenting and talking about it and sharing it uh I think unfortunately the sad part about consecration is you normalize it after a while and the any everything on the jbros channel comes after like some pre Fame that experienced so I did a prank with some buddies a long time ago where we we would I don't know if this is bad or not but it was what it was okay we went up to people and we asked them if they wanted a little pot okay right like pot marijuana we asked them if they wanted a little pot right a little pot they like they like no get away from me freak what the hell and then we would pull out a literal little pot like a literal little pot a cooking pot and that video went crazy viral back in the days and I had so many people reach out to me I was on TV uh someone offered to buy me a meal like it was it was crazy that was the first time it actually felt crazy um but everything after that I think I kind of normalized the experience a bit so you're just kind of like you're the equivalent of that kid like at the computer in the meme like yeah thumbs up it worked you know but then you kind of move on with the the content grind right yeah um and and you view is a a grinder like how how do you approach creating these videos about you know programming computer science and and demonstrating different projects You're Building yeah I don't ever do it for any of the fame or any things like that like I I do it genuinely because I love the ideas and I I love being able to explore new Concepts that probably someone hasn't really explored at least in the manner that that I want to explore it and so my Approach is always is how can I present something to you that you probably don't think about that often or probably haven't seen before in an entertaining manner uh that often when those two meet is often when my videos do the best yeah yeah well let's talk a little bit about Game Dev in general because Game Dev has changed a lot since you got into it obviously like game maker like there was a game called like Hotline Miami that did they use Game Maker for that they use like some really rudimentary like early tool to develop I believe they did yeah and I believe they that was a cool game because it felt like you wouldn't know that they'd use such simple tools to create such an elaborate game with like its own kind of physics engine and everything like that but like there was that whole Flash game era that you develop flash games CU newgrounds.com was huge when I was a kid or when I was a teenager like people would like develop these games you could play right in your browser and it just took accessibility to a new level cuz you just click on it it loads and you play it you don't have to download stuff you don't have to like buy a physical media that you put into a console or anything like that yeah I definitely played more flash games than I made uh I might be mistaken on the timeline but I think by the time I was able to you know grasp logic and coding it was kind of past its prime I may have the timeline incorrect here but I definitely remember when I was younger playing flash games this was like before for Smash Bros and all that mhm um and but I do remember trying I made like one Flash game and I just remember being really annoying the UI interface in in Adobe what was that adobe adob I don't know yeah Adobe Flash yeah Adobe Flash yeah they renamed it so my brain was was yeah Adobe Flash the the UI was really annoying in my personal opinion and I had already had game maker experience so I just preferred game maker but yeah well um um maybe you can talk about like the game development meta so to speak like like who is working on games like are are is it mostly hobbyist are there like hardcore game devs out there that like like like how would you describe the typical game developer in terms of like how they're approaching getting games done I saw the the documentary Indie G Indie Dev uh indie game yeah that was pretty good but I've heard like mixed things from actual game developers about like how representative it is of the typical Game Dev experience and things like that and obviously all three of those games were pretty popular successful in G so it's already kind of like uh showing like a little bit of selection bias survivorship bias I guess uh I I imagine like most projects most don't go anywhere right they probably don't even get completed it's rare that people even finish projects that they start right but like maybe you could talk about like what your how would you describe like a typical game developers lifestyle and and where they hang out like whether that's Discord whether that's um like local kind of game developer hacker space type places maybe you could just give me an idea of you know the the devs that you've come across and you've worked alongside and maybe give us a little more context in your process um do you mind refining the question a bit more yeah absolutely that was like 15 questions in one what do game devs do Daya what's the typical day in the life of a Game Dev yeah so I think like most things there's a lot of variation right and as game development has got more and more accessible I think the variation has only increased so like I know people that are they like game development is their fulltime job right they've released some games to some audiences that love to play their games they charge them for it and they can pay the bills that way right I know game developers that you know they're habitually making a game count in it making a game canceling it making a game cancel it right I know game developers that are always looking for funding right they are going up to investors saying like hey I have this idea will you please give me money to make it right and I know game developers that just do the YouTube thing right there's a lot of variation um but I will say thank you I will say that I think the the commonality between them all is that a lot of them have like a a lot of passion for making games and and telling stories and uh you know trying to present something cool and creative to an audience yeah what what are some I think the most important thing if you are trying to be a game developer that can actually ship games is scope you have to learn scope uh I think that's top of the funnel next up is Passion focus on games that you you yourself want to play and then after that I would say is audience try toate games for existing audiences um I think if you pair all those three things together you will have a lot of games under your belt which which and and I want to emphasize how important it is to actually ship games I think it's fun to like habitually explore new Concepts and whatnot but shipping games is what you get critiqued on you don't get get critiqued on you know how well you can Implement a pathf finding algorithm you know what I mean yeah that makes total sense so just uh to recap scope passion for what you're building and having an existing audience not having to like Forge out in the wild for people that are interested in your completely novel game um but can you describe scope like and maybe how you Scope things and and where scope creeps maybe just start by defining scope yeah uh so so scope is the hardest one because it does require some like prior knowledge on what whatever you're building right like so if I'm building a game that requires pathf finding I have to have some knowledge on like the domain of pathf finding to be able to scope it um and pathfinding is like like having an AI kind of like go around in certain paths is it that literally it like just programming NPCs and stuff yeah nonplayer yeah yeah yeah um so so yeah scope is the hardest because again you need you need to some you need to have some understanding of the domain of whatever you're implementing but it's not impossible to get that information right there's so many resources everywhere you know especially in 2024 but yeah so can you give me an example of a time that you like maybe made scope too broad and scope is like like just basically focusing on a few key game elements or focusing on like what the goals of the project are you know it's easy to think like oh I'm going to create an open world game and it's going to of XYZ and like you know you look at like Cy Punk uh 2077 I can't remember the exact year but like that is a game that had so much scope creep that it ruined the game if they just not made it open world or if they' not tried to add all these different attributes and stuff like they they they got too big for their britches right they they leaned out farther than they they should have in in terms of you know the scope and right yeah and scope can prevent a project from ever getting done because the the scope can keep expanding as an excuse to not actually ship like as a procrastination you know excuse right yeah yeah 100% yeah so so has there been an instance that you can recall where you're like you you're like you know I think I've I've gone outside of my original scope or I I've I've made some sort of error when it comes to scope and I need to correct it it's a problem that I used to have a lot but developing for a YouTube channel it teaches you Scope really quickly because you have a regular schedule of releases like I've only got two months to build this game or like what's your release schedule do you have a fixed schedule yeah every I have to upload one video within 30 days of the last video that's what I operate off of okay it can be seven days it can be 12 days but I can't go more than 30 days okay that's a great rule to live by so that guides like for example I have to publish a podcast every Friday I have to send out an email newsletter every Friday right like so like those things force me to be to myself and the rules I put in place so I love how you have that very simple rule you know I can create videos as frequently as I want but it doesn't matter how many I've published I still need to have one within 30 days of the last one yeah yeah that's really cool it's like like uh yeah so so come full circle so like that that process it really has taught me a lot about scope right because it's it's one thing to be like I want to make this game where I have all my my subscribers connect to a server and they can walk around the world and drive cars like that's one thing right but then just having done this for so long I can have a good idea on like okay how long is it going to take me how many hours I investing if I start this video project in January am I going to finish it in in March or is it going to take me February of next year you know and it's something it's a skill that you have to hone I'm not going to sit here and say that it's easy but it's definitely something that I encourage everyone to pay attention to and try and home you know yeah so one of the things I want to ask is for people that are listening and they're interested in going into game development maybe they have some basic programming chops maybe they've completed cs50 they've gone they've earned a few free codam certifications they have a basic understanding of you know maybe python JavaScript uh maybe they haven't worked with unity yet but you know it sounds like that's a tool you would encourage people to pick up um so let's say hypothetically um they want to be a Game Dev two years from now they want to have a game life or do they even need two years like like what would you do if you starting over with everything you know today but you didn't have the skills you have today you didn't have the network that you have today in terms of like distribution being able to just publish a video on YouTube and have thousands of people see it like what would you do I love this question yes 100% listen nowadays is one of the most like accessible times we've ever lived in for anything and everything if I had to start over given the prompt you just gave I would first of all make a mobile game I would do active development so make an MVP that's minimal viable product yeah mhm launch the MVP start collecting feedback immediately whoever you can get the hands on your mom your brother your coworker whoever it is we have platforms like Tik Tok that you can easily reach an audience if you just learn how the like the different ways to game the system Instagram reals YouTube shorts like these are all platforms that have millions and millions of people watching a ton of content in a short period of time so that's what I would do and and and in fact that's what I'm doing for Ultra bouts all those things I just described I think that is the modernday developer and there's a lot of money to be made you know if you do this as well you know it's add model and if your game is good enough it connects with the audience good enough you can do inapp purchases yeah awesome so that would be your your advice if I can re summarize it is just build an MVP as quickly as possible get it out there start iterating and publicize it through short videos the short video format that is taking over YouTube For Better or Worse um and like of course you know like uh you know potentially programming our kids to be like extremely uh you know um sensitive to their physical appearance right um things like that right so sure sure we don't talk about that can yeah can I add one more caveat yeah last thing I want to add to that is really important is no one to quit no when to quit okay tell me about no one to quit no when to quit I'm taking notes so if you do all these things and you see that like no one's really responding no one really cares about your MVP or update 3 whatever it is you have to realize that maybe you just did not create a product that has a good Market fit and move on to the next one it's sad sometimes it sucks but it all depends on what you're looking for if you're looking to actually be a game developer that you can get Awards and all these accolades and pay your bills knowing when to quit is very important and it it's hard when we talk about like art but the truth of the matter is nowadays we have a completely different system you can't it's much harder for you to be the artist wait hold on let me let me rephrase that yeah nowadays it's more expected that you not only just the artist or the sound designer or the programmer you're all you weren't all hats now right once upon a time you can go work for a company and just play that role and have someone else figure out when to quit right but now you wear all the hats and you have to you know put on your business hat and you know pay attention to things so the brutal suit that's within you the uh the the pointy haired boss right the uh the the person who has to you know make the cold calculated business decision that person is the same as the creative genius who's like scrolling all over the Whiteboard with all these game ideas you have to be both if you want to succeed if if you want to succeed if you want to do it as a hobby you can do whatever you want but yeah I find that to be like the biggest thing that a lot of my game of offer friends fail to realize is that as much as this is an art medium and like we want to use it for artistic means what is art if no one ever engages with it you know yeah and I mean there are probably lots of people who think oh maybe some like historian is going to appreciate you know my game the way that van Go's art was only appreciated after he shot himself in the chest with a revolver and like years had passed and people just oh who's this V go guy right like but that is extremely unlikely for every van go there's probably thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of artists who just died in obscurity and are still obscure right so it's a dice roll yeah so so I mean uh sounds like you've taken a very pragmatic approach toward game development um one thing that I want to talk about is distribution so we talked about like um the role of you know Tik Tok YouTube shorts Instagram reals there's this saying that like firsttime Founders focus on technology second time Founders focus on distribution how how do you distribute your game how do you get it in front of people obviously you talked about short firm video but but like what are the other ways that you distribute your game and like like are you using App Stores are you um do you have a mailing list are you like how do you get it your game out there and get people playing it I think I've came to a realization not too long ago that all of my games moving forward are going to be on the App Store and this is Apple and and Google App Store correct correct and the reason why is because it just matches so much with kind of my business model as it already is like a lot of people come to my YouTube channel and they watch my videos for free and then you know a small percentage they'll donate or they'll buy merch right but the majority in whole they expect free content and this is what the app stores are predominantly operated on it's like free apps and so I found that it's just a good fit where if I make free videos and I I I'm really lucky that I have an audience that I can make content for right like I have my own audience that I can show ads to I don't have to pay anyone right right which I'll get into that a little bit but in a little bit but just to wrap this Sor I have so many put all together I'm excited I'm taking notes um so so so again so the business model I've been operating on for a long time is free videos is what people expect so it only makes sense that like hey here's a free video also here's a free app that you can play in the meantime while you wait for the next video right and the reason why I think that the App Store themselves are good is because they promote apps based on their performance of people playing it of people downloading it Etc versus you look at some other stores like Steam for example they promote apps based on how they sell you see so there's a bit of a disconnect on my current business model and how Steam Works not saying it's impossible to make a successful game um from your YouTube audience but it just makes more sense that I have a free app that I can send my audience to and funneling traffic to my app is measured uh is is a key performance indicator for these app stores to then push it even further so it's just like extra boost if you will okay interesting so so essentially external traffic to an app uh will give like like Google's app store or Apple's App Store and their like top app leaderboard of the week and all that stuff like you can get a lot of additional juice out of like maybe the same number of people just because of the type of traffic that's coming to the app and if it's external that's interesting to note okay yeah I didn't know that and and the thing is like I don't even need someone to play the game more than an hour you know all I need is the download and then the app stores pick that up and they say okay there's some interest here we're going to promote this to people who don't even know who J Bros is you know yeah you say more than an hour because steam you you can get a refund if you play it less than a certain amount of time right so a lot of people refund it yeah yeah sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your flow they can well well I mean look that's actually another good point as well right like I think it's eight hours if you play before 8 hours you get a refund which means that you have to create a game that has more than eight hours of content which is not easy you know and if you're you're if you're a fulltime content Creator and you're trying to launch a game on Steam you need to make a game that has more than eight hours of confident so that people don't game the system and get their money back right you know again I'm not saying that it's bad I'm not saying launching games on steams is bad I just think that launching games on in app store is just far more optimal for the business model of a content creator uh like a YouTube content creator yeah interesting so uh not to mention the accessibility as well yeah accessibility one thing I learned one thing I learned transitioning to doing mobile apps is how simple it is for people to play the app I used to do Steam games and there would be so many different things oh I need a coordinate a time oh is it is it this system or that system oh my PC specs aren't good enough right when I've been doing mobile apps I've doing play testing I say hey here's the app link in three minutes they have it downloaded ready to play I mean you've even done some live streams where you're like here download this app and like let's play it and like those streams are great like your who's the AI game I can't remember the exact name yeah yeah where you got like video coming soon yeah so different um different ideas like that you can iterate on them so quickly and your audience can get into the game and once they've played one game that like breaks a barrier where they're like okay next time he's doing a live stream I'm going to download the game and interact right there these multiplayer games so cool so uh let's say hypothetically you didn't have the uh YouTube following that you have how would you dist your game would you still stick mostly to the App Stores yeah I think app stores is the best way to go in terms of someone I don't know I I'm still thinking about like app stores versus steam yeah like this is a relatively new discovery for me I'm still thinking about it but at this moment I feel that app stores are they are the future there are limitations you can't really create every experience with an app but I think you can create most experiences with an app and and the reason why I would suggest someone who doesn't have an audience to use an app store is because you have a greater probability of getting promoted with on the App Stores literally the the key performance indicator for steam is sales yeah so if you don't have an audience already you make a game you put up on Steam and you don't get any sales you're just not going to get seen yeah but if you can if you publish an app on Google Play or the app store or the Apple App Store and you create a Tik Tok or something and the Tik Tok gets some traction and you get people to go download your game that is a key performance indicator that will be looked at and you will get extra promotion so it it just makes sense you know yeah okay I think yeah that's really that explains why a lot of the most Innovative games I've seen are on mobile formats even though a lot of Hardcore Gamers cringe and bristle at the notion of playing a game on their phone when they've got like you know a $2,000 PC with like a fancy graphics card and they got like all their ergonomic stuff set up at their desk so moving on from distribution I want to talk about like game design as a field and one of the things that's so interesting to me is like the games you're developing are very different from other games uh like almost like genre Less in a way or like if there is a genre it's very you know specific like I we we saw the rise of lots of different genres of games such as like Tower Defense games for example or um you know like obviously realtime strategy games have been around for long a long time but before video games reached a certain level of sophistication the notion of a realtime strategy game where you controlled a whole lot of different units and a whole lot you were like making so many decisions like that had to come from somewhere right firstperson shooters uh like like Doom had to come from somewhere and they came from the idea of from the mind of a few developers probably sketching things out on whiteboards probably building really coarse prototypes right even sides scrollers like the original rcade games had the strength that they couldn't scroll because it was too graphically intensive now you can I mean I want to say you can do basically anything with the computational power of like an iPhone or an Android like do you think we'll ever exhaust the design space for games and interactive experiences no I don't think so I so there's a game that came out not too long ago it's um I don't remember the name of it but it it meshes two genres together two relatively new genres together and even that I'm like we're never going to run out of ideas like there there's so many genres that you can take to this day and and just do one plus one and get two like to this day there's so much unexplored and we we are still creating new genres as the years go on so I don't think that we will you know you yeah I I can go on but I'll stop there okay and like so how do you how did you come up with the idea of having a turnbased fighting game cuz of course there's like Pokemon there are lots of like collectible card games and stuff like that there are lots of games that are turnbased uh like board games basically anything in the tabletop world is necessarily almost turnbased just because otherwise you'd have people like throwing their hands all over the table and stuff yeah how did you come up with this particular idea because people think about you know Tekken they think about Street Fighter they think about games that uh require like frame perfect inputs and stuff like that like what inspired you to go on this this route thank you for asking this question I have immense passion for uh this game this turn based fighting game then I'm making Ultra BS uh because it it mixes everything that I've kind of learned over the last like 15 years in the sense of design and the sense of code and sense of so many different things Graphics Etc but the to answer a question directly I've always been a huge fan of anime and I've played many anime games over the years but I've never been really satisfied with the anime games that I play because you watch like Goku versus Vegeta right in Dragon Ball Z and you see them doing some incredible things that you just wish you could do but then you go play a game and they have to limit you because you're playing a game in real time with the controller with a limited amount of inputs right and so having the desire to want to like really feel like Goku but also uh coming off of a chess addiction that I had yeah I realized that and I I I'm still exploring this Beyond Ultra bers I realized that I think that some of the the greatest experiences we have yet to experience are ditching real time simulation and inste in in favor of like a like a turn base or a frame by frame simulation yeah and frame by frame maybe you can describe verbally like so you're doing like a show ruken or something and it's like frame by frame it's like okay what would you like to do at this step like and so you can alter like you know all different aspects of like the combat experience and you can kind of adapt to strategies it presents like this multifaceted whereas like okay I threw a punch and they threw a punch and my punch has higher priority or my punch comes out in eight frames they're comes out in 10 frames so I win and then they there's nothing they can do once that button's been pressed and so many decisions in these you know real time fighting games like fighting games because they're all real time basically like they happen at like a the level like the human threshold for reaction time I think is like a quarter of a second right like if you have like you go to the Science Museum and they've got the the magnet thing and it holds the ruler and it drops it and you have to grab it and it like I tried it so many times I could never really get below the quarter of a second threshold M the games happen faster so you have to kind of like input and you have to come up with humanistics like oh I'm going to throw this and this and you kind of develop an intuition but you can't actually react to what's happening it's right it's kind of physiologically impossible to really react you know you you might be able to memorize exactly how to Parry you know like Chun ley's special or something like that to where you can Parry every single hit of it or something like that right but you're not going to be able to uh adapt your gameplay in real time and it sounds like what you're building gives you the opportunity to consider all those things and and it lets you step back and deliberate like a real time chess experience would be extremely boring watching two grand Masters sit at the table and think really hard for 15 minutes and make a move right like the chess clocks are like nine hours in some games right yeah but at the same time it's incredibly engaging if you're the person who's at the chest table looking at the game trying to decide what to do yeah also replays I I was really addicted to watching chess replays there's uh I think Gotham chess he does like his YouTube channel does a bunch of uh replay commentary on like really famous matches and it was so enthralling to me but I I realized that it's not going to be enthralling to everyone like you have to have an understanding of Chess to some degree and you know it's really plain Graphics um yeah there's so many things that came together for the ultra BS project I remember I was going to do a video a few years ago about um a concept in The Matrix right so you think about the Matrix you think what what would it take if we had the ability to dodge bullets right and the truth of the matter is you just would have to have a much uh a much larger iteration of time uh perception right in terms of like one yeah like one second you need to be able to perceive much faster right and I was going to make this video where you could put on a VR and and you would get shot by an agent and then I would calculate the trajectory that it's going and then just skip the time so that it puts it right in front of you so you get to react to it but then the the person who shot the gun sees you dodging it so yeah so they they can quickly adapt to where you are and like triangulate where they think you're going to go and shoot in that direction we're talking about the 1990 n classic The Matrix if anybody listening to this has not seen that movie I I mean it is literally my favorite movie I'm not exaggerating I've watched lots of movies I I think it's the most creative interesting like it holds up really well uh even today in 2024 but but sorry for the the segue like and the plot is surprisingly deep if you watch the entire Trilogy are the machines actually bad think about it you know U but uh but to get to your point like the the ability to adapt and then have your opponent adapt and like there there's there also kind of like the metag gaming like conventionally people will do this so like they can recognize the strategy and they can develop heuristics to be able to make decisions again the sort of stuff that like maybe an extremely high level fighting game player already does but they do it almost intuitively after thousands of hours of practice what if you just picking up this game could start to have that that kind of push and pull that interplay that's the exact point of ultra bers is you no longer need that thousand hours like here we're going to give it to you step by step so you can you can take all the time you need to evaluate the game State yeah you know yeah it sounds so cool man and uh you mentioned anime I'm just going to jump to that man like what inspired you a game developer to create anime to Japanese animation style uh you know cartoons essentially uh that's great question I I personally think that a lot of the best stories come from anime um I can't like I think a lot of the stories that have resonated with me to this day are like all anime stories from Cowboy bbop to to Big O to Dragon Ball like they're all anime stories and I came to a point where I wanted to tell my own story and I thought what better medium than to create a create an anime it's still in in progress It's in manga form at the moment but we we'll get to it eventually awesome corre you hiring to develop the you're actually artist and I took this the tofu car that is like the star of the uh of the show and I just was like Hey can you can you do something similar about me holding my bass playing like kind of like leaning against the car so that's the cover of the uh the uh learn to code RPG soundtrack thing but um nice nice but I've worked with artists and they're not that expensive at least the ones like it's amazing like uh you you can find artists who really take pride in their craft you can support them in their craft and you can get them to uh essentially develop art based on your prompt if you will like you've been doing that right you've been working with artists correct correct and it's been quite the journey I um you know before I did any of this I was like yeah usually I just go and tell someone who I think is talented to make some art and they do it but yeah you know they're individuals they're also entrepreneurs you know they have their own schedules and timelines and projects and dreams and aspirations and you know some are better than others unfortunately but I am lucky to have found a good group of artists that I am able to work really well with and they do really talented work and learned a lot yeah so you so you write and you come up with the characters and kind of like figure out what's correct what you want to relay to to the reader or eventually the viewer and then they help you execute on that through their skills correct correct I do all the writing character design all that stuff and uh there's a bit of a compromise you know when you when you bring anyone on any project right like they have their own fair share of say into the content just by the nature of their art style and the way they interpret things but you know it's part of the collaborative process so I I don't mind it so how would you how would you compare working with human artists to working with you know Frameworks that you're developing games on and stuff because as a as an indie Dev you're kind of like doing everything Soup To Nuts Lock Stock and Barrel right like you're you you're kind of doing I don't know if you actually develop your own assets but like maybe you could talk about like just how many different hats you wear when you're building a game versus you know collaborating with humans for art it's it's a lesson that I'm learning uh how to do less wear less of the hats yeah um once upon a time I I had this belief that you not a real creative if you didn't do the whole thing yourself once upon a time I believe that but I have I think actually thanks to the manga project and working with artists because I had no other option to because I can't draw it is taught me a lot of it has showed me like the value of working with people and so Ultra bout is actually it has I have a 3D modeler shout outs to my boy colossal cake he's doing the 3D models on that they look beautiful far better than anything I could ever do and I sorry I forgot the question you said oh yeah like what hats would you wear as a Game Dev versus now you're just writing and kind of directing I guess yeah yeah back then it's everything design it's code it's art it's sound it's music it's it's writing it's it's everything you know character design it's it's everything and I and you know what's interesting is that I think that's part of the reason why scope is so difficult is because like you have to do everything and and now that I've relinquished the art to an artist colossal cake for Ultra bers that's just one less thing that I have to worry about right so now I can I have this I have this uh like this this group of things that is like a little less heavy with the art remove that I can put more time into and help me scope things correctly awesome well I want to talk a little bit about AI That's like the thing that everybody talks about now uh there have been some really impressive advancements in AI recently we saw like Sora which is this uh um video creation tool put up by open AI um and of course we've got like image creation tools uh and we've got text creation tools you've used AI in a lot of your recent projects um let's talk a little bit about your relationship with AI and how you got how you like looked at it like this is ready for me to actually use it right because it's been around forever you know lots of people have developed things with AI over the past few years I mean you could argue that like game AI is as old as games themselves because otherwise there wouldn't be much of a game if the PacMan ghost just sat there right like yeah but what inspired you to pick up Ai and what are some of the things you've been building with it what inspired me to pick up AI once again this is a call back to the beginning of the podcast um I used to watch my mom play D Kong Country on Super Nintendo when I was young and again she had a controller and she was controlling Donkey Kong but there were agents that I I just was like who's controlling the agents who who who is controlling the the enemies the baddies and that like I think started my fascination with AI and wanting to learn more um so I get the game maker and I'm making a bunch of games and I'm learning how to do AI for the first time and once I learned how to do it well man I made so many games that like couldn't even play like I just said and watched it I had this one game quick side note that I made that was like anime shown in style bunch of Fighters they're in like an arena and I would just put it on and watch it as I fall asleep anyways that's cool I I eventually come across um Carl Sims um Evolution simulator uh demo thing and that really changed like my whole concept of what AI could be with their generative algorithm they was demonstrating obviously I had no idea how to do at the time but but that stuck in my brain for many many many many many years until finally I found unity and there's all these announcements about tensor flow you know which is a machine learning library yeah yeah and um uh now all of a sudden all these resources are available where I can learn back propagation and the various calculus things that I need and I spent eight months to learn all that stuff and then I make I basically try and make what Carl Sims made in his 1990 one demo I think it is um on YouTube and it worked it blew up and I've always had a Fascination for AI awesome I'll track down that Carl Sims demo and put it in the show notes for anybody who wants to watch it let's talk about some of the things you've built with it like I can't not talk about the amazing shark tank Shark Tank Episode generator uh this I was laughing like like practically rolling on the floor watching the video where you demoed some of it and and it's just the the show shark tank is so absurd for anybody who knows anything about business like even ad me administering a charity like the show is so absurd and ridiculous and it's not how real people invest the business advice like there might be some useful advice in there but it's it's hyper real reality TV right yeah so now imagine people are coming in with straight faces pitching things like underwear underwater shops for fish to shop at um I'm trying to remember some of the other ones but baby's first hand gun you know to absurd but they're coming in their they're do they're silent fire alarm yeah silent fire alarm like isn't it annoying when a fire alarm goes off silent fire alarm you know like pitching it as a product and having like the you know the cast of uh the Sharks I guess is what they're called like reacting to it like oh I'm out you know the cigarette that has 10x the nicotine or something like that yeah yeah like you you don't have to smoke as much cuz you get next ni easier on the ls right I mean and then uh I mean it sounds like something that would have been pitched at like the height of the ' 80s or something like that like but these are really amazing scripts and you've even kind of figured out like some rigging so that you can have like it a visual element to it like the the shark sitting back in their chair like their lips are moving as they talk and and the voices like GPT has probably read the transcripts of every single Shark Tank Episode ever so it can kind of almost nail the manner in which the Sharks would react to a given proposal if they were entertaining is is a serious proposal which none of these are yeah maybe you can talk about developing that and like what inspired you to develop that yeah I um I love shark tank it's a very entertaining show incredibly entertaining but you know kind of like what I touched on the video the best episodes of Shark Tank are the bad ideas those are always the most entertaining and it just came to me one day I was like well I want more Shark Tank episodes of bad ideas and I think we can make this happen with AI I think someone had asked me when I was talking to them about it like what if someone pitched it was some crazy idea and I was like that would be so funny and I think the initial idea was to just do it myself and I was like no no no we can make an AI algorithm to do this for us and so I started to develop it and funny enough I was actually going to stop at the 3D rendering but I remember showing it to someone they're like oh yeah this is cool I was like no what do you mean this is cool this is this is amazing and what I what I had figured out is that the idea itself was cool but the presentation was terrible in the video there's like a 3D model of the Sharks and it's like whatever presentation and so that's when I learned that like I need to take it further and so I got a bunch of different libraries to make them like the face driving and whatnot and then I showed that to the same person like oh I love this is amazing I want to see more right so rapidly iterating essentially uh as you got feedback and just thinking like hey I could use AI for this I'm sure a lot of developers are kind of like working on things and they're like wait a second I need to generate a whole lot of scripts and I don't want if I write them myself they probably won't be as funny as what GPT creates anyway yeah um because again it's read everything it's read every Reddit post it's read every book in the Library of Congress like it has the context to be able to come up with stuff and it's very useful in that regard so maybe we could talk a little bit about um Ai and what what you think is likely to disrupt you did a recent kind of tier list of jobs you think are likely to be disrupted by Ai and very controversial yeah yeah I'm sure it's controversial because I think a lot of people greatly overestimate the capability of AI and they see like this big step change and they think that like oh the next big step change is just around the corner and then next thing you know we're in like you know lawnmower man or something I don't know but maybe you could talk about like um your tier list and like EXC where you put different jobs and then what proved to be the most controversial all of it all of it's controversial apparently um yeah I I don't remember specifically a lot of them to be honest but I I do know that I got a comment like an hour ago of someone talking about how delusional I am thinking that factory workers won't be replaced and so I I replied to them and say okay just to make sure I understand what you're saying you're saying that the 200,000 Factory workers who work on the iPhone are going to be replaced within 5 10 years and then his reply was like well I think about 180,000 of them are going to be replaced in 51 years I'm just like how do we get here yeah how do we get here that is an absurd claim 51 years 180,000 Factory workers will be replaced to make an iPhone like that that is so absurd yeah that is so absurd like when we get into like the actual economics of it it's like how much does that cost I was lucky enough I did a tour uh of one of Amazon's robot facilities and Amazon I think they have like a $ 1.6 trillion do market cap or something like that and they were showing us Rob robots that were in beta you know and this person is talking about we replace 180 it's just it's just crazy to me I don't know I don't I I I have an idea how we got here scifi is really appealing and you know oftentimes we don't even think too deeply about like the economics and actual effects of these things but you know yeah it is what it is I guess so do you think people greatly overestimate like like the the most common thing I hear the most common question I get an email about it people who've listened to more than one episode of the freeo camp podcast will no doubt be like oh quiz's going to talk about it again but I am because it's important people write me every single day hey should I still learn the code or is my job going to be completely automated and uh yeah what what would you say to to some whipper snapper who's like jail should I still learn Game Dev or is Game Dev just going to be automated in 5 years um so I I do think that there is a probability that it will be automated at some point I think 51 years is too short of a time scale um I can get into why but before I do that before I do that I I again I always like to like ground these things and economics right if I am going to go make the next Facebook or what they call it meta or whatever they call it and I want to hire an AI to do my to be my fulltime programmer right the real question is how much does that cost in API Keys like how much does it cost right now if I want a full team of AI programmers how much does that cost like these are real questions that we need to ask right and then furthermore right we can keep going if an AI um programmer makes a mistake like a fund Al foundational mistake within the code and doesn't report it who do we blame you know like there's so many questions that we need to explore that I think that we're so far away especially someone that's been working with these tools uh on a daily basis building actual products with it there's so many foundational errors not saying it can't get better but I I I think that there's an element of language that we as humans don't even understand and to see the um to see that understanding uh being implemented in these AI language models within the next 5 10 years when we don't even understand it I think it's a little absurd but yeah and what I think are the things that you've been most impressed by with tools like gbd4 that that you're like oh this is genuinely useful and this saved me a whole lot of time yeah don't get me wrong I think GPT Chad GPT is like one of the most foundational like amazing products of the last 30 years I think it's amazing however I just always like to push back on like you guys think the show like it's it's it's not going to do all that the things that you think it's going to do at least not right now um but in terms of like what I use it for I use it for virtually everything man if I'm making a video I go asking for some advice uh if I am working on a game feature I'll ask it for advice or even code um if I'm having problems my relationship I'll ask for advice if there's some news article I'll say hey can you summarize this formula I use it for almost everything to be honest with you yeah and it improves your productivity your personal productivity and I think that's one of the things you struck at in the the video is it's going to improve the productivity of lawyers but it's not going to replace lawyers heaven forbid we have you I mean I can only imagine like all the you know lawsuits and all all the economic waste that would come from delegating that when you could just hire a lawyer who yes they're expensive but these are important decisions right um yeah yeah so very important to yeah and and I would say like you know a doctor a lawyer like I don't think that those jobs are like and I think software engineer is also in that category because software engineer makes a mistake and a plane falls out of the sky you know like yeah you're going to want actual people working on some of those things I guess the the main question I have for you is are the fields not complete replacement which was what your video was about but do you think that an individual developer could become so productive by leveraging all these tools that you just need fewer developers yeah I think that's definitely possible and I I would be surprised if it's not already happening to be honest um but I mean but I the question I always have is like what is that what is that saying and what are you trying to say not you personally coinci but like someone who make puts forward this argument are you saying that we should stop AI technology because it makes people more productive like that's not in the human Spirit you know we for a millennia have been creating tools to further our production right um I personally find arguments like that when we talk about displacement right instead of replacement I find that to be very telling on like the individual you know learn these tools man they're not that difficult you know yeah I mean in in my opinion tools are getting easier to learn every day like it's getting easier and easier to learn how to code for example to learn how to be a database administrator to learn how to do devops um yeah the tools are improving so I just want to wrap up with a few quick questions uh that I'm excited to ask you are you like inspired by like Hong Kong Kung Fu dubbing or something like why is it so many of your videos you're like hey how's it going you know like I love that it's so funny and I I I haven't seen any other creators do that is that common am I just missing out on like a genre of you know videos or is that distinctly you um I don't think I've came across any other creators that do that so just to describe it like verbally for for people that aren't watching the video like when you watch a ja video he'll be like eating pizza and like his voice sounds totally clear it doesn't sound like he's eating pizza but he's obviously eating pizza and like doing these very exaggerated movements and stuff it's so Charming uh and it's so there's like this weird kind of Disconnect but like I'm watching jabril but I'm not you know I'm listening to a different jbril like in a different time why doesn't he sync it up it it also seems like a huge time save because you can just just gesticulate and do whatever and then you can have that almost as like broll from when you're actually recording your fil your videos right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's yeah so the the inspiration for it before I used to make my videos uh like reading scripts like I would dead pan just read a script but it took so much time it took a lot of time retaking and I don't say a word properly and one day I was watching a video it was like some kid he was doing like a commentary with gameplay footage on screen I was like this is so brain dead simple why can't I do this I like wait I can do this you know except for I'm Just a Little More egotistical I need my face on screen so I just use my face in lie of the gameplay footage um but I don't do that anymore unfortunately it it it got to a point where it was like a highlight for a lot of people to the point where like I'm overthinking so many takes and it ended up taking a lot more time than it used to so I kind of I found a new way that's faster to make videos yeah I get comments every single day what's your new faster way just out of curiosity yeah so my my latest way is I will go on uh green screen and just basically just Rift yeah just just start going basically yeah just just Rift I'll have like bullet points on what I want to touch on but I'll just Rift in front of a green screen yeah uh and then I'll I'll film clips here and there throughout the process uh just doing like commentary that I can play if need be yeah that's cool so um at the end of your free cocaine course the course that you published uh on math or on uh computer science like basically programming 101 you say remember to always always feed your curiosity you say that's the final most important rule can you true explain what you mean by feed your curiosity and why it's so important yeah that used to be my Mantra I used to always say it at theend of the videos I have it at the end of my description still but yeah so the the whole concept behind that is I I think it was really important it was a lesson that I learned pretty young that there there's so many like things that we can do in a in a lifetime but if you don't if you don't follow the things that make you curious if you don't feed that Curiosity you you will you'll never end up where you need or you deserve to be and it was just something that I like to say just to remind people that like yeah you might get curious about code you might get curious about whatever it is Graphics or sports or whatever it is take that action feed that Curiosity find out if you actually like it or not because you never know where it might lead you you know I would not be here today if it was for me feeding my insatiable curiosity yeah you might be working at Joanne's Fabric Store hey I could be working at Joann's Fabric Store it's a good call back yeah so what are you focused on now obviously uh you've got uh hackware can you talk about that real quick and also like your hacks like kind of like logo that's on your beanie here yeah very distinctive uh kind of like handdrawn almost like street art style oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so Hax is the it's very boring but it's just like the company that I use for legal stuff um but tax wear is the IP that I've been building out um I have a really really good story that I cannot wait to tell I wish I can do it faster if I could I would um but hack SAR is the IP and then hack is just like the business that I do merch and anytime I show up I don't know I I haven't really thought too much about hack but it's it's the business and the merchant the hackware it's a it's like a large like intellectual property you say IP like almost like a franchise or like a universe of characters and stories like you would think of like the Star Wars universe or something like that this is a big project it's like a multiyear Endeavor it's huge it's it's humongous it's humongous I've been writing it since 2019 wow it's humongous I wish I can get content out faster but is there like things anything you could say to describe it Beyond just like the name and like those posters behind you like what is it about sure sure so it's a it's a Galaxy um in which uh it's based on Shonen um battles so sh being like the like shou and in uh like the the young kid basically or like young years small years I think is literally how it translates and it's a style of manga like if you ever heard of like Shen jump or some of those uh manga that you can get from Japan that often are translated into English uh it's basically like a style of anime that's all about like mostly young men like kind of overcoming Their Fear and like leveling themselves up is the best way I could describe it is that a good description though yeah I think it's a fair enough description I think the description I like to use nowadays is it's uh story progression through fighting that's that's like the best way I like f like challenges like if you watch like uh for example uh Demon Slayer like it's like he goes from fighting like having to like slice the boulder in half to like finding progressively higher level demons um and and that that kind of uh yeah but go ahead yeah so so that that that's what has inspired me I love Shonen so much and that is the that that's at the center of of what the IP is but there are so many really good stories that like I've experienced that I've taken from other people um I I plan to bring out some other writers to tell some of their stories as well and just it's a Galaxy in which like all of this uh is contained in and the first story that I'm starting with it's haware Paragon it's that's the manga and it's about a young man Jinzo or two young men Jinzo and Swift who are from a little desolate planet and they have this dream to become a great fighter very cliche I understand but it's about the journey that they take that is the real interesting part um and so they're up against the the place that they live doesn't have a lot of resources so they don't have access to like you know work a job and and whatnot so they resort to Crime to make their money they're up against law enforcement they're up against um uh the generational um Authority that came before them uh they're up against themselves and they have to figure out how do they overcome the situation and that is the Lynch pin for the hack for IP but I I have so many stories that I've written and I honestly can't wait to tell and just I got to figure out the best way to get those story out yeah and so you're thinking it's going to be a manga and then ultimately like an anime or are you going to make it an interactive experience I'm still trying to figure it out I I started with the first thing I made was a um audio book because it was simple and easy to get it up and running but like people don't really care about audio books is what I learned and so I did a manga but now the manga's taking a while so I'm thinking about doing like an app type thing yeah like maybe a visual novel or something that's the medium we chose I mean it's not as exciting I think but maybe like a voiced visual novel could be like a good compromise where you could just get still images instead of having like animation you're doing so many frames it like exponentially balloons and cost right yeah yeah well we haven't done any animation yet we still have the manga but yeah yeah so there's a lot of lot of really good stories that I'm really excited to tell um we also have a video game that is being released in this IP as well hackware enforcer games haware enforcer very cool yeah and uh so would you say that's like your like long run like your longterm Vision like how like the next 5 10 years is that a huge part of your professional life uh I hope so I hope so I think if I'm looking long term I just really want to tell this story and just have the story out here I I one of my favorite stories I'm sorry one of my favorite IPS of all time is XMen and it didn't become my favorite IP until I learned about its inspiration it was Stanley's commentary on civil rights and when I learned that it overnight the value of XMen changed for me and that is just the power of Storytelling I believe and so like that that that's what I want to do is want to tell a really good story that is fun entertaining but also like really says something you know yeah absolutely man I'm a huge XMen fan uh I'm actually watching the animated series with my kids uh the the old one didn't they reboot it Xmen is not a reboot it's a continuation they just pick up where they left off really yeah it's called XMen 97 and it literally takes like the last episode and just goes right into yeah like it never ended oh I never knew that so I don't I just learned about this from Leon Noel 100 dev's founder a few days ago like literally last last week is when I learned about it so uh yeah that that interview is probably live by the time anybody's listening to this but we do talk a lot about XMen he's a big XMen fan too he said he literally cried when he saw the trailer for the new one yeah he was that excited about it it's a real fan yeah awesome man well
