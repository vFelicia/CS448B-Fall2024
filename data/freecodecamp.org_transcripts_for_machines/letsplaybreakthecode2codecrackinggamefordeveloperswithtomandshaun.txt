hello everybody today we're going to try to do some coding challenges um i'm going to do a quick introduction first my name is tom and i work for free code camp and i created the relational database courses that are now available on freecodecamp.org and i will share a link in the description to those if you want to try them out with me here is sean you want to introduce yourself sean yeah sure hello code breakers my name is sean i also work for free code camp and i created the rustic raptor course as well as the euler rust project whoops yeah it's there there he is okay so what are we what are we gonna do today sean so today we have been invited by brooke by tech domains to do their break the code this is the second time break the code has come out the first time was in 2020 and it was hugely popular so today tom and i are going to be going through and doing a let's play of break the code 2. yeah i haven't uh i haven't checked it out at all other than this first screen um yes i don't really know what it's all about but uh looks like there's some signing to get playing rules and prizes let's uh check out some rules basically there's like a timeline it says there's eight days left which would make it finish on april 15th i think um so if you're able to get it done by april 15th you can win some of these prizes instead is that how it works yes that sounds about right so they started on april 1st and they opened these drives sequentially and each drive contains missions that you do and we're going to find out what those missions are for drives one and two but currently drive three is open which you can complete and when the price is associated with that drive so it's like there's some pretty nice prizes here good old ps1 and a ps5 so yeah we're gonna try and finish these first two drives today i think and then um yeah if you finish drive one you can potentially win a ps5 or some other things drive two the grand prize is a macbook pro and drive three um five thousand dollars worth of ethereum what's that right well that's what it looks like yeah it's quite impressive and these are surprises yeah i don't know what this is code breakers layer custom gaming rig and monitor okay and share oh that's what this is right here all right well um i suppose if you are watching this post when the prize and the competition has ended um you can still welcome to watch and get the entertainment value from tom trying to go through this oh i'm gonna find a way to drag you into this don't worry about it i think we're going to try and treat this as a pure dev session supposedly the missions are quite a bit like um i suppose coding challenges so let's find out all right well i started this up and it says uh i have a new email from carehq and it's dated december 99. it looks like it's some recruiter is looking to hire me um suppose out lock express so yeah this is kind of cool we got like a windows 95 or 98 theme going on yeah i believe it's 98. no this is awesome click on click on clippy there let's see i got the job at here okay yes i uh read the first sentence of that email anyway i'm clicking on clippy and not much is happening oh something happened a bunch of stuff showed up don't click me okay that's tempting isn't it it sure is um i guess we'll just close the email and play around a little bit we got log off shut down classic i'll see what programs they say not pad code editor isn't wasn't notepad the code editor back on 98. ipad was just everything everything text now we have easter eggs left behind well i can't type all right so i'm assuming this is maybe something we're going to be using um i imagine we'll try and use a lot of it mine labor this is this is like riding a bike here bringing back good memories yeah did you ever play minesweeper oh yeah quite a lot i didn't spend much time on uh windows 98 but i had windows xp for about 10 years until windows 10 came out and then upgraded from xp to windows 10. so it was quite the jump yeah um well we know we're supposed to go through the drives so i think we should just start as drive one oh i'm hearing noises i don't know if if that's coming through or not um i can't hear any revamp it's a sealed uh yeah napster when amp and napster um this is classic what we got here drive one i guess we'll click on this okay code breaker tom even though you're still considered recently recruited code breaker carol b assigning you a mission of top level importance three of our essential satellites have been systematically disconnected during recent sync attempts okay so we've got some satellites that are disconnected sounds like a problem our technicians have had a hard time identifying pattern but they have uncovered traces of a virus linked to the anarchist organization dot gang okay our intel has uncovered four areas of investigation that we believe could have clues to regain control we need you to assess the situation and attempt to access the damaged systems at the same time keep an eye out for dot gang's methods that we can exploit down the line okay oh boy maybe that's take some notes or something and drive on you'll find all the leads that we have collected in our investigations analyze each one and try to find the relevant connections report everything you find in hq as with all covert assignments unless specifically authorized by hq take no action all right sean so what are you thinking i'm thinking we're investigating we're investigating their satellites going down and we need to just report everything we find including potentially if we find something useful that this anarchist organization has done then we need to keep it in our repertoire of tricks to potentially use against them okay so maybe i should use that notepad well let's just uh explore i guess and if we come across information maybe we'll take a note um drive one okay g drive c drive look at that a giant bunny was spotted leaving go dot tech oh slash okay maybe open the web explorer g chords yeah it's also useful yeah now go where they where clippy told you to go oh geez i just said it yeah it was something that tech slash oh is and i hit the back button browser took browser hotkeys took over drive one box of chocolates now and i go to one ladder and go to that website can't copy there we go awesome because obviously nada are involved with getting the satellites up in there so they must be how did you put that one together that just went right over my head no no no okay okay moonwalking or moon driving got an article here security update that sounds potentially useful um and he had an unscheduled stop on a malfunctioning seat belt i don't know how much of this information is useful nada clearly needs a librarian that's another hint we need to hear okay there's a lot of information here um that's frequently asked questions uh no this is clickable no okay none of this is clickable 1919 the internet's friendly reminder that life is slipping away click the lifespan none of these are clickable but that sounds scary i wonder if it's a white y2k thing probably that's probably what the ads look like on on the internet 99 the death the giant internet death is coming y2k so they they recently needed to change their passwords and currently there are three letter passwords so that's something we can guess i called jackson moon walked on the moon would we call it a moonwalk would we talk what are you reading you didn't see the note from cliffy no what did it say michael jackson moonwalk on the moon would we call it a moon moonwalk yes yes you would so really probably should just read all this huh no i wouldn't i think not that much if we get it just of it we can just move on and if we need to come back to it we will i think there's probably weird hints in there like when it talks about malfunctioning seat belts and you know morium of charles pete and the fact that all passwords are currently three letters yes please do not use the same three letters three times that sounds like a hint that's what clippy said no right there on the uh yeah okay new so the new format is nine and the current three letters will be phased out yeah this is any idea where we're going with it so the other thing um there's these three buttons resolve is where we go when we think we have the answer right i've already forgot yeah though but i don't have any answers has used national's old account right okay so they use the three letter password to erase all the logs and the first part of their password is cbc first the first part of their new password so is that the new they use an astronaut's old account so the astronaut's new account starts with cpc uh you know what the password is definitely cpc cpc cpc why because it says ps do not use the same three letters three times wouldn't that mean it couldn't be that please do not use the same three letters three times do not or well i don't know if i'm told that with my password i'm definitely going to do it so you're saying because they said not to do it that that's what you would do yeah that sounds about right in my mind well let's just try it huh are we allowed to get the answer wrong i don't know but it looks like that's the format wrong answer okay maybe we should just build a brute force script to try and well what if we know what if we do permutations of that cpc so we do cpc ccp pcc i think the whole answer because because that's just guessing yes what's your idea um keep exploring until we find well you got that wrong anyway what we're supposed to find um there's a lot of permutations there i think um okay see would help hint hint hint no we don't want his hints we probably need them but yeah we can set ourselves a time limit and if we don't get there we'll just oh there we go look in the world of charles pete conrad that's why it's cpc charles p conrad oh that sounds interesting nice eyes on that one a former navy test pilot right there cpc died at the hospital in fuji my thought here was that in this little snippet on the left we have three words that are capitalized and then it says that i wanted to just kind of see if i could see anything else here's something jbi yeah i think that's probably also important james benson irwin so we got two names and two capitalized abbreviations is there there's seatbelt rock no seatbelt rock there's something about these astronauts but it's six feet under okay there's gotta be another astronaut name well that's because of the charles p conrad who died okay so they're making jokes about somebody's is that what's happening i think the theme here the theme here is death because we have the death clock right we have white okay and we have these astronauts so that's definitely something so well i think one one dead astronaut are these ones dead no okay what what were you gonna say well i think do you think there's anything in that that hint that clippy gave of no who knew astronauts needed to be so first look at look at those ads yes maybe i'm thinking was abs capitalized i can't remember well i think you can always try this there's no harm in doing that so so we got c p c dash j b i i slash abs what if it's abs jbi well we didn't find them in that order so it can't be that hard all right oh wait oh snap he got it awesome man we're good at this excellent extraction code breaker now that we have the full password we can take back control of the hacked account so doc gang won't be able to use it on our satellites i'm going to record that password so the cpc abs and no i don't have no i'm pretty sure twitter didn't exist back then yeah that's a good point um i'm not alone on this um oh i get it now i see there's there's four things for drive one that we all have to finish things to share with friends what was it i saw pizza but pizza and drinks i think so where did our our three hints there two of them were in that article and one came from clippy right i think they all came from libby because tippy talked about the dead astronaut who was cbc that we talked about the astronaut with the sixpack there's no way to get the abs one without clippy and the other two were in that article i don't think there's anything saying that we have to find all of the hints on the one page yeah but things to share with your friends clearly songs is something you're sharing 141 songs so maybe this is another thing of three and 141 is the first this looks very copyright problematic what are they piracy that's what they called it right yeah you're not supposed to do this you haven't even looked at the brief of this yet okay okay brief mission part 1b napster we intercepted communication that revealed dot gang's plan to inject a virus into napster downloads neither be a virus here so i heard of this song have you heard of this software it's absurd it plays to share compressed music files through the internet there's no way the public would be interested in something like this but we need to get ahead of it so begin your next mission do whatever you can to identify the virus okay so potentially one or more of these files are viruses and let's see mission name napster drive one mission two answer okay so we have two hints so far the one is things to share with friends we saw pizza i'm thinking songs is the other and then something about looking at the songs so many typos if you know you're going to love or hate the song from the very first word well i see a typo here okay a lot of viruses do have typos in them here's a typo so i see two tables are we looking for the letters that are missing like h and a it's a type of oh maybe b you're nobody's supposed to be here so that'd be an h and have you ever a a so aj hard knock life ghetto anthem livin la vida loca i think that's probably the virus right there and that's just the movies jumper p so hap um yeah yeah yeah lenny kravitz maybe there's typos elsewhere fly away let me see elliot tripping is there another p missing there it seems like there might supposed to be two pieces here but i'm not sure difficult to say yeah nikki it's not right but it's okay there's a comma missing give it to you oh there's one why i guess i've always felt the word happy i don't think that's a coincidence so shall we try it happy yeah happy happy gilmore um let's see oh we've got more people here or something so this was music kid is that me is that us and gang oh oh there they are that's the that's the the hackers or whatever all right let's see this one all these but goodies robbie robertson up on creek moses ellison mosey allison parchman farm willie nelson georgia on my mind that's race to play i don't see any typos now this one here looks like there might be a typo because has a capital d in a lower case s interesting the one above also has a capital t though so maybe the lowercase s is more important yeah like this one has on capitalize so everything is capitalized it looks like except for test here happy this one's cut off can i see the rest i don't know if i could okay well that's the only thing that i see um frequencies times length someone yeah i was looking at the length to try and see if something seemed strange 555 that seems fake um you could go online and look up the length of the songs that they actually are to see if they match we do have the web explorer we do i don't think we really have access to the internet though i think my camera is a little off here you know are you going to level hate a song from the very first word how do you tell if you're going to love or hate a song from the very maybe try happy together are we looking for one song or multiple songs well i think like this first area we put together the word happy from the missing typos so i don't know i think we just need like one word or one group of words so yeah and all the length of those songs is zero happy together napster for movies so high school musical cast we got some artists and then we're all in this together get together we all stand together together better together get yourself together happy together um well this one has a longer dash than the rest of them happy dash together so yes you're right the length is all zero that could be a potential clue file size is zero so these are all clueless man all these but goodies music kid can i click on anything else upgrade your billboard magazine subscription no i don't want any help well suppose something else i don't know can you go to the web explorer and go to go go.text reddit or something slash reddit we go and get help from the community i suppose was it this course or discord i don't know it's a word uh now clip he's just giving us bad hits uh clippy's getting frustrated with us we are too slow um okay i think all the clues are in here though somewhere well so far we're certain of happy entry pretty sure yeah there's something about happy there's something special about together there yeah and the length of the songs and so far clippy has said that something about missing a beat i didn't catch that one um we looked at the songs for the typos and things to share okay 4 million songs 150 000 users i twitter get go so you have 141 songs is that special i thought it said 140 when we first started yeah okay um so i i don't know were you going somewhere with that well i'm trying to think i'll be coming up with maybe another three um three set of three password so i listed these i'm thinking it's just maybe three words you know one word happy i think is the word for this page and then we've got these other two pages i don't know if we need to find a word in each one or a word combined go back to the brief let's see if there's a hint there we intercepted communication that revealed.gang's plan to inject the virus into napster downloads have you heard of this software it's absurd a place to share compressed music files through the internet there's no way the public would be interested in something like this clearly but we need to get ahead of it so begin your next mission and do whatever you can to identify the virus happy so one one of the files is going to be the virus i'm not sure if it's just one file but yeah you might be right but you would think like happy together would be it what if you type in that whole thing the turtles happytogether.mp3 there you go now you're thinking turtles happy together mp3 no did i misspell something try without the mp3 i just feel like we're missing something because there's still typos here like there's this dash and something on this page let's pretend that's a hint you know what would be great napster for movies any of these movies quite possibly high school musical that's a movie kind of yeah all in this together get you the real statues what is the turtles you know this this one this one is not capitalized either this i everything else is capitalized almost and the and yeah but those aren't supposed to be capitalized if this was written correctly but there are all capitalized everywhere else here in the i mean it's supposed to be capitalized when it's a song pick songs and bring them together into a brand new playlist that's what we're doing we can't do anything with these no no but we're clearly trying to take a collection of all of these songs and make a brand new playlist so i think we just need a small a few few word answer is what we need i don't know what you mean by make a playlist well there's something in all three of those that would make a playlist write down these these uncapitalized letters s i i um and then there's this weird dash okay will we say now we need to make a playlist somehow i don't know well try that try happy sia sure could be capitalized i wouldn't put a space yeah yeah see ya is that a song see ya as an artist well then you should say sia happy yeah um come on fingers crossed kept less i wonder how specific it's gonna be um see ya mp3 do you know any of her songs by chance no nothing's coming to mind um that sounds like that's on the right track to be honest i don't know see ya happy together this whole page has the word together in it yeah kind of strange okay well let's keep that in our mind so we have happy and together and go to please but goodies what's special about this one because we haven't really seen anything other than the missing capital wise from the very first word i assume that's happy maybe it's not love or hate so that whole page is capitalized weird too hey here's another typo there's a colon right there interesting what did that last thing say upgrade to the new millennium to yeah fix the virus so if i change my time break the code to prizes catalog yes i think go to start and look for the way to change the data display so there's a show clock thing right in settings yeah but just show clock it wasn't well click show hidden files and folders that might be useful for later there we go that looks interesting that's potentially helpful later on or something select screen saver okay we'll go to this one anyway because um okay so i don't see a way to change that i clicked on this i can't change anything um don't click me mine leaper terminal my computer what's in the readme it's december 31st 1999 the cusp of the new millennium the electricity in the air makes this day feel like a onceinalifetime event upcoming parties will be the stuff of legend but while people plan their new year celebrations in the real world an unseen struggle is raging far from view hidden away behind internet protocols and dialup modems computers are facing their greatest threat since since the apple newton a new destructive virus disrupting digital services and quickly spreading the infection to the far reaches of the virtual world but who's behind it that's what you code breaker need to figure out along the way you'll meet other code breakers not unlike yourself okay i don't think we need to keep reading this file edit help help about the game surprises if you're stuck this game isn't for the fainthearted all right we can't give up on this sean so if you're here don't fret you're not alone of course you need a little nudge in the right direction here a few things you can try to recruit a friend to unlock hints more code breakers you recruit the more hints you unlock some call it sneaky we call it a sure shot way to share the awesomeness so i guess if i were to like maybe share this with you i would get a better hint refresh current lists well no let's keep back with the hints we've just read okay so we got this misspelled one we know it's happy the oldies but goodies we know it's upgrade version and the clueless man it's together so maybe you do need to share it for something you have to do something together um so what does that mean go on twitter and discord or something and share it with you i'm not sure i don't know why it keeps saying the four million the songs 150 000 users your recruitment link look at that can i paste it why don't you try visiting this yeah i can try let me send it to you that is what we're supposed to find i think it said something about this six degrees thing i forgot what it was share your recruitment link get the most recruits and get awarded hint points and an ipad air i'll be that sounds worth it remember recruiting existing code breakers does not count points are only awarded after the referred person completes the signup processor recruitment points are reset for every drive the table below updates every four hours i think this is it we have to i have to have a recruit to do this maybe but there was still that the hint about the time said upgrade to the new millennium it's 10 p.m right now maybe we just need to wait two hours that has been ticking up slowly so there is the chance we could add your screen to the video maybe that just over complicates it what do you see do you see exactly what i see yeah no nothing looks different um wall street journal the mission is accessible only by via web explorer revamp would you like a walkthrough boxer this is classic treespin mirror um i am just going to i did not think i'm just gonna finish this one quick was it ct dash abs share with your friends maybe i'm supposed to share it i'm not logged in you can write that down as a note maybe share together but you're here now i don't see your name here refresh okay there you go okay let me solve a mission do you want to um just maybe talk about what you're you're doing or potentially we should share things to share with your friends secrets pizza and your six degrees link there you go secrets pizza six degrees that's what's that was the hint that we missed we got the pizza in the drinks right away but it just too fast and then it took us a half an hour to get to the next step um i'm just completing that first mission yeah i already went back and did that too and i can share it you want to share it i don't i just don't feel like that's not gonna do anything but i maybe drive one blocks of chocolate c drive files games now it said upgrade to the new millennium so go to the terminal go to the terminal and upgrade the time change the time how do i change the time from the terminal there's also a hello the hints yeah there are hence no for the gray matter four six clippy you're too fast i can't read dude hello typing headlight hello brilliant okay say ping that thing my valid parameter is what would be my address i mean we know about one like not at that tech nothing okay giant bunny was spotted leaving code dot take hmm where's my history well i gotta look at the cheat codes we need to upgrade the version of something is it napster we need to upgrade pain time average um i think we just need to explore stuff i it said upgrade the upgrade to the new millennium upgrade the virus to the new millennium so the virus would be create the file upgrade the system time upgrade the napster leave behind 19.99 welcome 2000 delays students upgrade your billboard magazine subscription today that sounds promising yeah that does actually right in front of your face the whole time billboard sorry i feel like that's it in the terminal what install billboard so clippy i don't know about that great leave behind anyone can you see that yeah okay yeah upgrade your subscription online alessandro that's probably just a current version 1999. weird um files dude let's just look at all these this bill gates nothing oh here's the mp3 file interesting in the c drive files blue one love i wonder if that's in the interesting thing it's a horse did you hear that yeah okay download i suppose we'll download it i don't know what that's gonna do sounds like a horse again okay so blue one love let's look at this one we got a bear and some birds if you go to the cheat codes in the notepad where was that right here yeah it has the link to the repository and then in the terminal you can clone the repository you just said that i take it oh not connect to github please try again i did not have any success did you do it no i didn't did it work for you why don't you give it a try and tell me if it works time net address port install plugin install billboard oh napster okay create your billboard magazine subscription today that's definitely the clue i just don't know how to do it take screenshot share i'm just manually going to the reaper okay oh you know why it's not a link to a repo that's just a link to someone's profile to the breakthrough profile and there's a repo in that profile called neo which is an advanced free and universal game trainer plugin for the operating system that was in the cheat codes yeah it codes all right let's check it out just go to the first link there um the 98. there it is plugin install run hack x github repo all right let's try this terminal bunny was spotted leaving go.tech slash ig easter eggs were left behind install run and okay we call in the repository here we go we got run hack x installed your run program has been upgraded to run hack x you can now use it to execute cheat codes by simply going to start high x and run run hacks let's probably run a hacks close enough um well i mean use the code hacker man that's 100 points all right clippy i'm going to put she over here that's all we want to do this hacker man that's achieved but it must mean something uh yeah yeah what else to try so there's the hint of obviously we have we've decoded the first one right we got happy the second one as well we got upgrade version and then the third one helps with how to write the answer together so happy upgrade version have we tried that i haven't tried much yeah well that's 470 upgrade version happy together maybe maybe we both need to enter it in the box at the same time together yeah i tried it without any spaces and it didn't work happy upgrade version together the third one tells you how to enter it together yes you are here i'm happy 20.00 it's it says you're getting that off discord or reddit or something that the third thing tells us how to do it how to how to enter yeah the third one helps with how to write the answer so we have happy upgrade version zero current version i don't know if you get the same thing but if you get an answer wrong it makes a funny noise sometimes up upgrade version so that's nothing i got nothing it says devtools um happy upgrade version together and 19.99 or 20. 0 0 i was going to say that maybe we should i don't know give it a little more time and see if we can just look up the answer give it up we're on the second thing and we can't figure it out some hard stuff oh i keep looking at i leave behind your billboard 19.99 i don't know all these but goodies get in there replace upgrade version with the upgraded version you looked it up no okay so put in your answer 2 happy really is that what it is well i put it without the space but yeah wow it was all there just wow that um yeah that's right there it's sad when you have it but happy upgrade version together i wonder if it would have failed if you weren't in in there with me well i got through so i don't think so
