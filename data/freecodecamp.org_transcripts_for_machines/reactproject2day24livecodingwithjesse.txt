hey everybody its Jesse and happy Monday I hope everyone had a good weekend I had a nice break from coding this weekend so I don't I don't think I did any coding at all except I help my wife with with some coding so she's doing she just started freaking camp so but other than that I had had a good break my oldest daughter just turned six what she's gonna turn six in a few days but we had her party on on Sunday so I'm all rested up and today I've been working on adding some security to our file uploads so the first thing I was trying to do was just to add a whitelist for file types so it's pretty predictable what gets uploaded I already can see what what everyone is uploaded over the last year I guess so I think it why twist would probably be the best way to go and I could probably add in some more things after that like limit the file size the number of files but when I was trying to do that I did all this research to try to figure out the best way to do it and then I couldn't get the server so we had one version of this site that was running on port 9000 and I couldn't get it to work and so now I'm going back through pool requests to see what has changed since the last time that I had that working so I'll show you what kind of errors I'm getting and see maybe maybe one of you have had a similar area before and can point me in the right direction here hey everyone I just check the live chat how's it going Ike so the the editor is actually Adam so it's the Adam editor from github with the SETI theme alright so let me show you the errors so this is what I'm getting I'll make it a little bigger I'm getting these errors I have there are some things on Stack Overflow and an issue on the create react app github repo that's people are having similar errors so I'm I'm just trying to troubleshoot that see the stream is started right in the middle of me doing the troubleshooting this is what I found so oops Thanks so someone had had a similar issue and after going back and forth a bit trying to figure out what the issue was this fixed it for them so in their package JSON they had their home page listed and I thought hey we did ever homepage changed it at one point so you could see on our package JSON we actually we have this as the home page and that was to get github pages working so I thought okay maybe it's that so I took out the home page and that didn't fix it I tried adding the home page in here like like it's been done here and that didn't work so now my my next my next idea is have a basically I just want to see what all has changed can I just take out some things and test it so I'm looking back into I guess this was the commit let me bring this over this is the commit where we added github pages support and so the only file changed basically is a package.json so it it shouldn't make a difference that we have these dependencies that all the only thing that change that would actually make any difference at all would be this home page thing and if we change yet this should be fine yeah hmm yeah so I'm kind of at a point where I guess I need to do some more research some I'm a little bit stuck here so unless someone has some ideas I probably just switch back to the main branch so I luckily wood started doing this on another branch because I well for number one it's good practice to do new things on another branch but I suspected that I might have something like this happened where I get stuck and so I'm just going to switch back to the master branch and work on some other stuff because for the live stream me reading through github issues is not going to be very exciting not not that my streams are supposed to be exciting or arcs I think that but it's definitely don't want to watch me read so the movies over in my other screen and work on them later and let's pull over this so you can see it's on the branch file type check and I should probably push that to github in case anyone wants to look at it so okay that's good that's what should be changed so I'm just committing this I'm adding the files and I'm committing it to our git repo and I'm at a commit message basically all I did was install a package called file type that reads a stream of your file coming in and it reached enough of it to give you the the file type and that was about as far as I got and I set up in the server JS file just a console log the file type just a test to make sure it was working and at that point that's when I realized that I needed to fix whatever was going on with with the server not being able to run okay so let's go there we go so now that's on github you can check out the little bit that I did do if you like and now we're back on the master branch so we should be able to just continue on and do some other things and then come back to that later on after I do similar research I'm gonna bring over my Pomodoro timer and okay cool so Patrick is testing this so thanks Patrick I I appreciate it all right so I'm going to start my timer and do some stuff I'm going to start the timer we'll check my Trello board and see what we can do okay so actually I think that's it guys spent for Pomodoro sessions on this today already alright so let's see what we need but okay let's do this because this will let me this would be a good way to introduce some of the changes from last pull request as well so Matt submitted a pull request with some good stuff in it it was pull request 52 if you want to check out everything to change some of the things that changed include using so setting state outside of the constructor we had a big kind of discussion and talking about what will the best practices were for that and so basically the conclusion is that it's okay to do that it's syntactic sugar you need you definitely need Babel which if you're writing stuff with reactive you're running that anyway so you just need to be able to have so this is we're talking about just setting state like this at least initially right you're we're still going to use set state you know anywhere down here you know which is what you should do but at least initially instead of doing the constructor we can do it like this so almost everywhere this is in change back to using this method which is you know a bit shorter a little bit cleaner something I can't remember all the other changes as well but that was one of the main changes was to change these back and also the other one of the other big changes and the one that we're going to work on right now on kind of improving even more is this this card so what Matt had done so what I had done previously was I wrapped this card in the paper component and I gave it a Z depth so in material UI you give you can give an item a paper component depth what I mean by depth in case you're not familiar with how this works in material design is let me pull this over something like this okay so on the posters page you can see each one of these cards has you know an apparent depth because of the shadow and then when I hover over it the depth changes or it changes apparently it seems as if the hovered card is closer than these other cars so that's what I mean by Z depth as in like the Z coordinate for talking like X Y Z so this is how you set the depth on the paper component so you can't do Z depth on card that's why I wrapped it in paper so I took away the black shadow from the card so I wouldn't have double shadows wrapped it in the paper component set the Z depth and I was checking for when the the mouse was going in and out and I was changing the state so the state in of death and actually this isn't the new stuff actually this isn't bad Elvises right now because this will show you what we were doing and now it's changed so you can see I was just changing it from depth 1 to depth 2 but there were some some weird stuff going on it wasn't exactly the what I wanted so I'm not sure why they didn't update sometimes when I pull things and it doesn't auto update and Adam I have to close it and open it again so let's try that hmm okay it looks like it looks like Matt didn't remove these possibly we you know maybe he wasn't sure if I wanted to keep these to go back to it so he did remove the onmouseover and onmouseout from the actual component so it used to be on this paper component here okay so that's nice it is kind of nice though that we can see his side by side so instead of doing this Matt made a a clasp and what did he put this I think he put it on in the poster CSS file of the sass file yeah okay so he just uses CSS hover and he added that on on to this div so he wrapped everything in another div gave it a height of 100 percent and then is adding this this class name of yes it fix hey you see sorry I'm just checking this alliant yeah the fixed site just does the 100% height so basically what I want to do now is I think we can remove this paper element we can probably remove this div and just apply the styles directly to the card we may need to keep one Dev actually but we for sure we can remove the paper so I'm gonna go ahead and remove the paper now because we will not need that so let's remove that and we can get rid of paper here and now we can check this out just to verify I thought we could remove a paper telling you know I know what's happening okay so that the paper was where we were getting the initial state from which is fine we don't need that because we could just take this off of the card we take that off the card and the card we need to add the we can add fixed side yeah okay so that gives us pretty much the same effect but it's not it's not exactly what I want so let me pull in so hopefully you'll be able to see the comparison so this is on materialized and this is how their effect works and we'll compare that to what's going on here so there's definitely a difference there's a difference in the shadow and and it seems in the transition it seems like the transition is just slightly slower here the shadow is longer not quite as dark this one is shorter and more dark so I want to switch this to use the shadow you know more like this on hover and so as far as I know materialised doesn't have just a class a hover class or I'm sorry material UI doesn't have just a hover class it's possible that I missed it but in looking through the documentation for cards there wasn't an option just to make the card hover Abul so in materialise there is so I'm just gonna import the styles from materialized and apply them to these cars okay alright so I just checked the live chat quickly and have some more info about the air ok thanks so matt matt has some input as well so patrick it was working on port 3000 it was port 9000 that I couldn't get it just came up with a blank page and had some errors all right so let's just change change the hover a bit and possibly see if we can even get rid of this this other div and just slim things down just a bit so what I was thinking initially was I could just get rid of this and set the styles set the styles for the box shadow it's a nun like I had before the problem is I'd have to use I'd either have to do it in line in that case anything I do here one wouldn't work it would get canceled out by this or I could do here and then put important which I'm gonna try to do but I vaguely remember trying this before and if you're using important the hover style just got automatically applied it was kind of odd I'm gonna try it again but maybe I'm remembering wrong and it'll work but that's the plan so basically we're going to use this hub herbal class but we're going to bring in the base card shadow from materialize and also the transition so basically everything that they use in materialize for their card hover we're going to bring that in as well and we're just going to try to override what's going on here so I think I have the the code from material as yep since we've been borrowing so heavily from materialize I just leave their repo open okay just not in this one just get back to components I don't remember which one I was on before their evils okay we'll try out cards okay zdepth which ice I figured zdepth would be in variables but maybe it has its own no it doesn't this will try again maybe I know it's not there it's probably in global there we go okay so we want to grab this I guess I'll just grab the whole thing like since we're using sass anyway we'll put it in that format okay and the initial card zyne up for one okay okay and I don't think I don't think we need this extend we'll see we'll leave it in for now Susie that's one and all right so we need to put in let's try it we'll try taking this out first like I said I hopefully we can make it work like that and then it would just make the component a bit smaller let's see where's my clothes I'm not sure what classes I'm already passing in hmm I guess I'm not I don't think I'm even using this anywhere to have the classes here oh wow can you check I'm gonna check my time okay we have five minutes so five minutes I'm gonna go to the to the live chat and catch up on everything that's going on so if here so if you ask me questions or anything I'm not I'm not ignoring you at least forever okay well let me check just to make sure okay so good so far let's let's give this these for testing let's just call this card oops and hopefully my doing let's give it a see dad one and actually classes however so let's go actually how do I add what's the best way to add in classes that I'm hardcoding but then also be able to put in some classes as well so obviously I need this classes but then I want to add in these can I I don't think I can do that we'll just we'll see find out all right I didn't do what I wanted it to do but let's see what classes end up on here undefined card see there's one okay okay so Matson use template literal syntax okay cool I like template little syntax anyway yeah oops so I know we've gone over template literal syntax a bunch of times but in case you didn't see any of that or you know you're not familiar with it let's let me just explain it since it is it's not like oldschool JavaScript I guess so this is not es5 this is es6 stuff so when we use backticks instead of double quotes of single quotes this is a string that you can do JavaScript inside of so if you want to do JavaScript you just put dollar sign curly bracket and then anything inside these brackets is treated as JavaScript so we this classes is not a string it's a variable so it'll pool in whatever the value of classes is and then everything else is to string other cool things we can do with there like like this works you can have spaces and stuff in between so really cool very useful way better than having to put a bunch of plus signs and lots of quotes so anyway thanks Matt so this should say yeah so now this is spaced out although it does say undefined and I don't want it to say undefined so what am I doing wrong oh I never changed that wait no I don't need to change that what am I thinking yeah so I'm pulling in should be pulling in classes oh well my timers up so let me take five minutes and go through the live chat not a whole lot in the live chat yet so shouldn't take too long may not even use up the whole five minutes so you have air drifters hi from San Diego awesome welcome and thanks for joining in in the live chat okay so update on the port 9000 err so Patrick was able to recreate that error yes it's a cryptic error yeah the error just doesn't it's not super helpful okay well at least I guess I feel better that you can duplicate the air and it's not just something on my machine Sebastian Xavier says I think coding is cool I just started learning HTML and a little bit of JavaScript I took a weeklong class too that's awesome and welcome to coding yeah so hopefully you're you're able to follow at least some of what we're doing so I know now if you just you know you're doing a little bit of JavaScript you may not know figure out you know everything that's going on here but little things like template literal syntax that'll be kind of a cool some cool syntax that will save you some time that you might not get in maybe like beginning JavaScript courses okay so Matt's given some advice as well on this okay so did I have so I guess I was before classy anyway cool okay it's a Sebastian's a versus I know the basics yeah so anyway so hopefully it's you can you can follow along with some of it depending on what I'm doing for you know for one of these it may be more beginner friendly you know we just do we would own everything we need to do to build you know a whole site so some of them will be really basic and some streams will be a little bit more advanced all right so I am through with everything in the live chat for now early which that's crazy normally I always go over and so I am going to set my reset my timer to twenty five minutes so I'm gonna do at least one more twenty five minute session and then we'll see how much is in the live chat I don't think I'm gonna do a third one we'll see I do want to make sure that I get out of here and enough time to take my son to his karate class so may wrap things up a bit earlier we'll still definitely have an hourlong stream today though all right so on my other screen I'm gonna bring up I'm gonna bring up what that generic card component was since I've changed it and I don't I don't want to undo everything just to see what I would I change so because I think I changed some stuff that I shouldn't and that's why I'm having some problems okay so I actually did have hmm so initially I think it was like this and that's where I was pulling it in so I never really needed to change these well I guess I guess it didn't really matter so but originally on the outermost div this is what was being pulled in I always did have classes here to just pass down the classes right to the card component but this makes sense to do it like this so let's see all right cool so now we are getting hoverball which is what we want cards you have okay great so now let's make this work why isn't this working what did I do alright so I'm gonna try this with this is gonna look terrible the first so I'm just gonna confirm that this is working yet okay I was great know how let's see if this works yep all right great so whatever I was worried about at the beginning I don't know what I was thinking but this definitely does work great all right so now we can see it's definitely a different a different effect okay so I I wanted to switch it up to this for for a few reasons mainly because this is consistent with what I've been doing with all my other sites so while I do want to use material UI for react sites going forward maybe probably I'll use the newest version for the next site I do but I I do want the styles to match because you know we have some sites that it's going to be a while before they get redone so I do want to keep it consistent so in little details like this it's not really a big deal especially since there's not built in hover mechanism I think it's okay to go with materialise and the way they do it all right but I think that's it it looks more smooth I kind of like how the shadows a bit more spread out I'm not so I don't know it just seemed abrupt I guess that it was so dark underneath here so anyway that that works so I'd say that that was bestcase scenario here so you know over here we added in a bit more CSS but the component itself we're able to get rid of four lines in this component so it's not bad also we can remove this because we're no longer we no longer need to use that because that was here so that's five lines and we got rid of our import for paper it's a sick lines so we remove six lines that's cool so six lines from that component and we've imported this now what I'd like to do is have this in a different file right because I'm not just going to use this for posters so I think we should actually all of this should be should be used so I think I'm just gonna take all of this and I'm gonna put it in something that gets loaded up a bit higher so maybe you're in our app yeah so these are more I guess like utility classes so like this this video line you know so I'm gonna move that up here I think it makes more sense to be here since cards are so common in material design and we use cards on a lot of different pages oops okay so for right now at least you don't have anything in posters so let's see I I don't know that I will add anything any special styles and posters so I may just get rid of this file completely let's get rid of these and then let's get rid of it oops now I wasn't importing it there I was importing it in posters actually now that I think about it since some of what we're doing applies to the flight of cards I guess it doesn't apply to just cards so we could add potentially we can add hover ball as a class to anything and make it horrible so I'm for a second I thought about making some a SAS file for this generic card component and moving the styles into that but now I'm I'm gonna leave it where it is I don't I can't think of anything right now that I would use hover go on but at least in materialize it is separate and you can use it on more than just cards so I'll leave it as is for now and that'll keep us from making more more files so all right so now all told we've removed seven lines of code between the two of these components we've removed two files we have added a bit on to our app dot s CSS file so let's say not bad I'm happy with that result and that took while way less than anticipated so it's great so what was that I'm gonna say 1.5 so I guess not way less I forgotten I'd already done one Pomodoro psycho on this before okay but still under the amount of time that I expected so while we're on this generic card we may as well go to the home page and add that to some of the home cards so these two kind of go together so we'll work on both of these I'm gonna move this over here until I get some more ideas about it mmm not I'm not gonna try to add the icons right now I'm still not exactly sure how I want to do that okay so let's go to the home page I'm gonna move this over here and do this okay so here's our our home view and here's where we're bringing in our generic cards and we want to instead of doing it like this we want to do it more like this so we want to bring in hover Balazs well actually in link writes have horrible and link and actually let me show you the home page in case you haven't seen it before so here's our home page right now so you see we don't have hover over any of these I'm clicking on all of them and they're not linked ship but they all need to link to something so some of them are actually going to go they're just going to be a file download so the PowerPoint will be the brand manual will be but then these four will link to other places other views within this site and and this is at is not the final version of this page I realized it's very plain looking I guess so we need to go to where the data is so this is kind of really nice how this is set up is because this is all pulling in data and then everything's set up kind of as props to do different things in this component converting these cards over is going to be really easy we just need to change things in the way the data is set up and pulled in which is really cool that was our goal from the beginning with this generic card component was something that could do anything you would want a card to do I mean within reason just by passing in different props alright so let me see let's find our data and we want to pull our poster data up here and links data yep this is it okay so we just need to add huh verbal true.really to everything so hmm actually these already say linked to so that's all right I suppose if we just changed this to link that we should be fine oh you know what I'm sorry these are the side nav side nav links so sorry if you hear that noise it's my phone going off I don't recognize the number I'm not going to answer it but it's sound vibrated there we go that's what we want okay yeah so let's pull in huh verbal and also like audible both of these in now just to get him in there I guess so I'm gonna put them on the bottom okay let's let's pull up that links data again because we can use a lot of this request shares story this isn't just posters this will be logos logos posters what did I name that page those posters I think that's what I had it as manual and then the other two I'll just leave like this for now I'm not sure where those files are actually gonna be so when I find that out I can just put the data in whoops okay hmm okay what am I not bringing in oh I forgot to actually pass those props okay so car title there we go that works great let's see I do want to check alright great so that is did we never make this view I guess we didn't I thought I had me put in the content for all the views but I guess I missed one so I'll make that one yeah this one's really easy it's just two cards okay actually kind of don't like that you have to click this and then click another spot to go in there it would it would be nicer if maybe I just had logos posters and you could click to go under one of the other and then it wouldn't match the rest of the cards unless I had other things down here I'm not sure let me know what you think it's one extra click and I guess I do get the chance to put more information about the logos and the posters on the second page the only reason I combined them was because I just I didn't want one extra hanging down here but I guess we do have we have the tutorial if I can think of one more thing to put here the glossary I guess then we could have nine that might work let me know what you think about that would it be too much instead of six to have nine of them split out logos and posters have the tutorial visible right away and have the glossary visible yeah that might work and before when I had these large icons that would have been too much but now it will definitely fit and I'll make the page look a bit less dull okay all right see about three and a half minutes left for this Pomodoro session since we finished that so this was I guess the the smallest I can put in is a half so I'll put in a half for both of these but really it took less than a half of a session if you're not familiar with Pomodoro sessions and things this is just a way of breaking up your time of working and estimating what you do so you take a fiveminute break every 25 minutes after four sessions a tenminute break there may be other ways to do that that's just the way that I learned and the the estimation comes in where you try to estimate beforehand how many Pomodoro sessions it will take to do something and then after you do it you put how many it actually did take then you can get a good idea of whether you know how long projects will take after you do it for a while you get pretty good at estimating so right now I'm you know these numbers are pretty close when I first started doing it my numbers would be very different I usually would overestimate now I'm a lot better at that and that's really good it's good for time management personally but it's also good if you're freelancing to give have an accurate idea of how long projects will take so that you can figure out pricing so very very helpful it's been very helpful for me to keep me on track I've been doing this system for over a year now alright oops and I meant to look at another thing I don't know I get anything else done in three minutes it's probably two and a half by now oops actually we can clean this up a bit so Matt already did this so I'm gonna just put that and done since I have no idea how long it took Matt and I am NOT I really I don't want to require contributors to check their time as well anything done in a pull request I'm just gonna pull over and put nothing there so that way I'll know if I see something like this immediately they all know I didn't do this this was from full request okay not bad getting through a lot of to do's I know this list isn't complete I'm sure there'll be other things I'll see to add to this but not bad we cut this about in half from what it was earlier in the day okay let me so it's just regular get add get commit just like we did earlier so as soon as that finishes I'm going to push this to github so that you all have access to everything that we just did make sure there was one other thing that I think we could take out now so I'm pretty sure pretty sure we're not using horrible anymore yeah we're I think we're not using hub herbal and since we're not using all this I'll probably remove all this let's just remove this right now so I don't forget so you don't need hover bowl and we don't need it was it in posters so we don't need it here and we don't need any of this and since we don't need that we don't need debounce or we're getting rid of you in more lines it's just great we don't need this oops actually do we need any of this now I don't think so I'm scared of this I just saw Blake said his fan is loud I actually don't have my fan on right now maybe my computer is lovin yeah for some reason I didn't notice it cuz I had music playing in my headphones but yeah my computer is a bit louder than normal it's normally pretty quiet let's see I think that's all we can remove but that's pretty good and we can also that's all I'm gonna do right now I'm thinking can we change this into functional component probably all right so Oh and I just changed this hold on so let me go to the live chat and see what's going on if you aren't familiar with how this stream goes the end of the stream is saved for question and answers so we have a little intro some coding and then question answer Wow I messed something up let's and then the that we do some code and then the last part is question answer so if you don't want to stick around for the question and answer session then thanks for watching and I'll be back tomorrow hopefully you can join in again otherwise please put your questions in the live chat now and I'll just go straight from the top of the live chat and go through all the questions try to answer as many as I can if you can't stick around to hear your question answered you can always catch the recording of this that's available on free code camp or you could just ask me some other way like on Twitter or any social media network where you can find me interrupted depth of thumb okay I must not have gotten rid of everything actually yeah we did have depth we were using the zdepth in here what we hmm all right but I think we can get rid of this safely without without needing it so let's let's see okay so that those still work great so hopefully if anyone notices any bugs with that because of how much was changed I mean I certainly didn't test it thoroughly but everything should work and all right so let's see what it says now so while that's running I'm gonna try to find some questions Chris Chung says can I do this on a Chromebook you certainly could do this on a Chromebook you would have to use some type of cloud editor like cloud nine I can't remember I've used some other ones before but I can't remember the name so if you check out I think the website c9 dot IO that would work basically you just need an environment where you can run well you can run all the stuff that you need to run so you need to be able to bring in NPM packages and things like that so cloud 9 can do that and there are alternatives so I I have developed on a Chromebook before and it works basically in the same way as long as you only have a good cloud development environment I say it says can you get a job with just knowing frontend yeah yeah for sure so I mean I'm a frontend developer right now I do know a little bit more than frontend I do have to do some backend stuff and DevOps stuff from time to time because we don't have other people to do that here but there are plenty of jobs for frontend developers if you check out Stack Overflow jobs you'll see a lot or really any any job get github as their own job thing but I see it son of frontend jobs on Stack Overflow pretty much every time I'm on there it shows me frontend jobs Patrick I see you told me not to forget the commas I knew someone had you have seen that in the live chat wants us Andrea says great when I'm watching this video I can study coding and learn English at the same time well that's that's awesome I had never thought that someone could learn English while watching this but that's cool glad I can help in any way Rohan says late yet again well at least you made it before it was over this time yang John says hi hey how's it going thanks for watching John Henson says Jessie yes add more to that dole page yeah for sure okay Blake sorry Blake Blake had said that my fan was loud and I commented on a few minutes ago thinking that he meant my my office fan which I did I was running you know when it got really hot in here earlier in the summer but he actually did meet my computer fan so sorry about that and actually quieted down huh I can't hear it at all so I don't know what was going on I mean you all saw what I was going it's not like I had anything open or closed it but whatever occasionally my computer has just been like the fan just kicks into high gear and it's just super loud for a few minutes and then it's okay Blake says c9i Oh does require credit card but it's refundable and it's either zero a $1 charge said he did it the other day and it was not a problem at all yeah that's true I always forget that when I started cloud 9 they didn't require a credit card but then they changed their policy afterwards and you do need a credit card to sign up even if you're just going there plan they just wanted I did continent get I like kind of I kind of think cloud9 got bought out by somebody and then the policy switch but I can't remember exactly what would happen with that J Evans asked hey Jesse what was your time management solution again okay yeah I'll go over this time management solution so basically it's it's a Pomodoro Technique and so I have this Pomodoro timer so it's a 25minute session fiveminute breaks every four sessions I take a long break of ten minutes okay so that's the time this is just tomato timer calm that's tomato timer calm there's so many Pomodoro timers out there and in fact I think I think it's one of the lessons in free code camp to make your own Pomodoro timer so I'm sure there are thousands it probably tens of thousands of Pomodoro timers available out there but that use that for my timer and then I have this is just Trello and it's a free project management solution and I set things up like like this it doesn't come set up like this automatically so but I so I create these these cards these columns of to do ready for development in progress testing done and wish list wishlist is just stuff that I'd like to have that isn't necessary to complete the project but if I get time I'll put them in the other ones are pretty selfexplanatory so when I go to create a new task I try to break the tasks down as small as possible and I create the task and then I add a number and that number is how many Pomodoro sessions so how many 25minute sessions I think it will take me to complete this now that there are other ways of doing this some people I've I've heard some people do like complexity so the number doesn't represent time it represents complexity so I'm not to that point yet maybe I'll switch over to something like that but for now this this works for me now after I complete this I would actually put how many points it took so let's say it only took me three I have three in there so now these two numbers get compared so if I were to move this over here you can see it tells me you know five was what I estimated and three is what it really was and you can see it just adds that up on the top so I can see very quickly since it's still in progress this means I'm not done so if I look at this I would say okay I need about three more sessions to go until I'm done with this column I can you know I can look in here and say okay five more sessions I'm done with my entire project assuming that I already had laid out all the two dues and then at the end I can look and say it took me this many sessions to complete or this many sessions to complete so it was either I was ahead of schedule either overestimate or underestimated but I can tell all of that and on my next project I can go back in and check and say okay well this took me this long last time so I would have a good idea how long it's going to take me the next time so that's how I do it it's um it's been pretty useful you definitely have to be consistent with it for it to be useful but I found that the the five minute breaks are really nice because sometimes it's easy like if you have these for me when I have a problem I'm working on like a bug or something and I can't get it to work I just get so into it you all get buried and documentation and trying to search through things and it's easy for me to waste you know hours trying to look into this but if I take that five minute break it just forces me to take a step back and say look back at my Trello Trello board mark another Pomodoro session and then I can see the big picture again and at that little bit of time that few minutes allows me to just think okay is this superimportant can I just switch to something else and get something done and then come back to that when I have a better idea of of what I want to do and sometimes that's that's the best thing to do at the time I switch it up I get some stuff done I feel a little bit accomplished and then later on some idea comes to me that I can try so instead of just spinning my wheels or not getting anything done I'm way more productive so it doesn't always work out like that but it's happened enough that you know this has definitely been worth it for me and very useful so anyway hopefully that was a decent enough explanation there is a I learned this in a course on Pluralsight so I had like a free threemonth subscription to Pluralsight at one time and there was a course on I think the course was called agile for one so it was talking about agile technique but in in that course it was talking about the Pomodoro Technique and Kanban boards which this is actually I not Pomodoro this is Kanban so anyway it was combining several different techniques and trying to adapt it so that someone who's not on a team could work in a way that's closer to how agile teams work I mean you can't replicate it with one person but it it definitely helped me like I said I've been using it for over a year now and definitely liked it a little bit more work to set up at the beginning but it's nice I let's see let me get there's a few more comments here almost to the bottom oh sorry Jay had a followup question about the number system for Trello that yes so that's actually a chrome addon called scrum for Trello yeah I'm pretty sure that's the name of it let me check I'm gonna check my extensions I say my chrome ascent extension is quickly to let you know the name of this for sure yeah it's called scrum for Trello so it's not a Trello thing that you get in Trello it's a chrome addon which is kind of cool because the Trello addons I think you can have one now for free but if you want any more than that you have to pay so it doesn't use up one of your your Trello addon slows alright so John Hanson says a component that imports multiple components and two components imported array data comes from two sources can't see how to make the array get mapped from a variable so I can reuse the components okay let me read this again all right so I'm gonna read this to myself all right so you have one component that's importing multiple components all right so that's that's fine so in two components imported array data comes from two sources can't see how to make the array get mapped from a variable so I can reuse the components okay so I guess it would be easier if I could see the code so if you do have this on github or something that would be that would be cool but I would check out I know that we're using we're mapping over a lot of data in this this project we're doing it and then the last project we're doing it maybe if you check out some of the the views where we're importing different components and different data I know especially in the last project we we were importing well I guess we we ended up importing it combining it into one one array but I want to check that out and see if it helps if not and you if you can send me a link I oh I check it out and let you know what I think about it maybe I can help but anyway I mean you should be able to use map and go over unless I'm misunderstanding what's going on you should be able to you know have that array you know as a variable and just do dot map something like something like this right so array variable map and then you could just put data and then after that you could have like h1 I mean you get at something like this where I mean I guess we could do it more like right so you could map over that data and so this component you would be able to reuse this component as much as you want as long as you have that data available in this parent component so not sure if that's if that's helpful I said I could be misunderstanding what's going on but let me know send me the code if you can okay so John said I just want to import a different array for different views using the same components yet you should be able to where are you importing the arrays from so are you making API calls or do these arrays exist like like how we have them in these data files because I guess that essentially that's kind of what we're doing right so you know so we're importing an array called poster data into posters jas and then we're using the card component we're mapping over the card component and then you know in home DJ s we're importing an array called generic card data and then we're mapping over that data and we're reusing the generic card component there okay mattias what are you doing if you mean the project this is a react project that would create react app and it's basically just a way for people at where I work to submit requests to my department through this react site so it takes file filled input file uploads and it forwards that on to a project management system it does a few other things but that's the main purpose of it if you meant what was I doing at the time you asked that I was explaining my approach my time management system right at that moment Patrick I just saw that you gave J the name scrum for Trello so thanks for that sorry I didn't see that earlier okay so Patrick says that John could pass in a boolean flag to decide which data to grab and pass that in as a prop yeah or Patrick says if you have more than two types you can pass a type prop so that could work I guess each I don't know I really would actually like to see that so I think this is probably the type of thing that if I or someone else in the live chat can see the code you'd probably be able to figure it out a lot more quickly so so anyway if possible I think we can get it sorted out if we could see it but I've come to the end of the live chat so I think I'm gonna wrap things up now thank you so much for for watching and for all your help especially for those of you who submitted pull requests help me out in the live chat tested things really appreciate that I appreciate everybody watching everybody ask questions I love to get questions and it's really cool if I could help you out in some way I will be back tomorrow I think that should be the same time as normal I don't think I have anything conflicting so 2 p.m. Eastern Time and hopefully I can get whatever's going on with that server sorted out so that we can go over some file uploads security with nodejs I think that would be cool to do on a stream but until then thanks for watching and have a great day
