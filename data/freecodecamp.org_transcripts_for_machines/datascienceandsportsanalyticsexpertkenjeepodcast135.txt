and part of getting good at sports especially reactive Sports is training our own internal algorithm to be able to predict outcomes as effectively as possible same thing with tennis same thing with any of these Sports where you're hitting a ball you're actually creating an algorithm yourself to predict what is coming and how to how to locate or go to it and that is what makes the best athletes in those domains if they can accurately predict where something's going to be and to execute after they've gotten to the right positioning which to me is this really cool intersection of like the same process that goes into a machine learning model but we're training ourselves and like the way we train ourselves can be very different if we use gradient to sand if we use some of these different things like welcome back to the free Cod Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freeco camp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting it a tech this week we're joined by Ken G he's a data scientist Sports analytics practitioner who works with USA uh us team Golf and USA basketball and he's also the host of the excellent Ken's nearest neighbors podcast and the exponential athlete podcast Ken welcome to the show thank you Quincy always grateful to be able to have conversations with you and come on your show and and hopefully we'll have a a fun little chat here yeah I'm excited to tease more insight out of you because you've been in the field for so long you've interviewed like nearly 200 different data scientists over the years through Ken's nearest neighbors podcast by the by the way uh the name of that is riffing off the K nearest neighbors maybe you can explain how K nearest neighbor approach works yeah I mean it at the in most simple terms you're looking at the K which is equal to whatever number you set and then you choose the that many of the nearest neighbors who are CL close by so I have one guest and I choose their you know their or or three guests and uh whoever is closest to that person might be another interesting person to interview but I I can't take credit for that name it was actually a a poll that I did or I opened it up to the community to name the podcast and that was by far my favorite one that was the 100% the one that the one that stuck yeah well you you have such like an interesting career because I know that uh of course of course you have like a formal academic background you know master's degree and studied a ton of stats and things like that but you also play a ton of golf and you've played a ton in the past uh so you've got that athletic background uh and my understanding is you're you're pretty good like I I don't know where you stand at the Grand schema like there are probably uh you know tens of thousands of like very good golf players in the United States but uh I just want to we're going to start by just going way back and I want to go all the way back to where you grew up in Maryland and and kind of like just so we don't have to constantly be revisiting your past like let's go ahead and establish the origin story of Ken G so yeah maybe you could just start by talking about like your early days and uh how you got interested in you know Sports yeah my since I was a little kid my life was almost ruled by sports that's all I really wanted to do if you go back to my earliest professional aspirations it was to be a professional baseball player baseball was my first love I played it all the way until my last year of high school and that's when I switched to playing golf I honestly was not very studious I was I was a terrible student in middle school high school all the way through all my effort and passion was directed at playing sports at at the highest level and I I had some baseball opportunities to play in college but I ended up injuring my shoulder and I also didn't necessarily love the the team nature of baseball which I think is kind of funny I baseball's a weird sport where you have individual statistics for a team game and I was always very much interested in my own performance and trying to improve that it's a little bit harder to isolate how a team performs to create a win than it is to figure out how an individual performs to create good outcomes there yeah yeah so I I think teamwork and all these things are very important especially in the professional world but for myself growing up it's it's hard to measure you know we lose a game and I have a good game did I do something fundamentally wrong was I the the coaches would criticize you for for the the team as a group when individual performances might have varied and and that that was a little bit confusing to me golf was fascinating to me because it was completely quantitative the only thing that mattered was the number number that you posted on the scorecard it didn't matter how you got there how you took all the different shots it matters the the coaches any of these types of people they would just look at the numbers on the card and that objectivity was really interesting to me coming from baseball objectively I was UND sized I around 5'9 in high school maybe 150 lbs I was not exactly a a a physically gifted uh person in that sense and that's something that for example College recruiters looked at that's something that a lot of um there was a lot of onus on that how how big and strong you were is is a major recruiting turistic in in high school athletes and in golf none of that mattered all they care about is what number is on a scorecard at the end of the day and to that for me that was that was a really beautiful thing so I continued down this golf journey I played golf in college I then tried to play professionally afterwards during that journey I took my first economics course I believe it was my third year of college it was a little late in the game and a light switch just went off for me I realized that you could understand the world through math through graphs through Trends and I realized that I could apply that to my own golf game something that also happened in college is I switched Majors I think six or seven times in my first three years and for three of the majors that I switched into I had to take a statistics class or a research methods class so I ended up taking statistics three or four times the same course and who would have thought I got pretty good at understanding statistics and I also realized that I could apply it to my golf game to help get better so I really started to look at the standard deviation of my scoring on different whole types I started to combine that with some economics concepts of increasing or diminishing marginal returns so I'd look at what area of my game would would have the highest return for the time that I spent on it and I got a lot better very quickly I was I thought I was getting good enough to be able to take it to the next level unfortunately that did not work out but it it it ended up being a very positive thing because I was able to longer term uh leverage the interest in math statistics and eventually coding into a career that I that I have now so I I tried to um after took that economics course honestly my life kind of turned around I realized that school could be applied to things that I loved and I just really uh jumped in head first I started to enjoy learning in a very different way and I I ended up transferring schools to uh Talsen University so I was in in um South Carolina before I ended up going into to Baltimore later and you know that's when my my golf career started to take shape that's when I started getting really into uh uh into more statistics into continuing that those economics principles and into taking some business courses uh after that I did go down that professional golf route and while I was there I realized about 3 months in that this wasn't probably going to work and I started studying for the GMAT so my thought is if I go back to grad school probably do something like management consulting I'd be able to have a really broad opportunity set coming out because I was clueless about what I wanted to do at that point in my life so I take the GMAT I do well enough to get into a grad school at the University of Virginia so I did their masters in Commerce program and in the interim I had another two months before class started so I took an internship with a company called DraftKings so at DraftKings it's daily fantasy sports I'd been playing it a lot I was a super user of the product and I was about breaking even which is pretty good with the super rudimentary models that I was using but I realized that there was something more that I was probably missing in terms of analytical chops that I had learned from my basic business and statistic courses so I went there I saw the music squel I saw them using R and python to analyze this data and that was a completely new world to me so I went back I did my degree at the University of Virginia it was a masters in global Commerce with a focus on marketing and Analytics and I learned some sequel I learned some basic analytic skills but honestly that wasn't uh that was I I'd never written a line of code even after that point in my life so we're getting into where I'm I believe 24 25 years old and I'd never written a line of code which is totally fine I mean if I can do it anyone else can can probably create a career in this domain until until late in that period but you know going from there I did end up going into management consulting I worked in the Washington DC area I was in technology Consulting and I absolutely did not enjoy it at all I was advising I have yet to meet somebody who enjoyed it what's wrong with this field the funny thing is that I do Consulting now and I love it right so yeah it's it's all about the domain and how we fit into it and so I was a technology consultant I was advising cios or VPS of software engineering about the software development life cycle and project management and program management and I had no clue what I was doing again I'd never written a line of code how am I supposed to be telling the cios how to run the organization when I have no clue about how the the bits and pieces work together so I decided I'd had enough I was I don't recommend this but on the job I was just sitting there and I was trying to learn how to code I was using I think code academy at the time but yeah probably before fre code Camp yeah yeah I will say now free code Camp is a dramatically resource I wish I had it back then but in between calls in between things I'm sitting there learning how to code and at one point I just said these skills are so important why wouldn't I just go ahead and learn them everything I wanted to do I didn't really mention this but outside of sports I'd always been fascinated with entrepreneurship I'd always been and my parents have been grained in to me that you want to work for yourself and I realized that everything I wanted to do coding was important if you want to build anything in the model modern world coding is one of the number one tools that you use to be able to create that infrastructure so I said why don't I just go back to school if I go back I can learn these coding skills I can buy more time to figure out exactly what I want to do yeah I'll go into a lot of debt but I couldn't see a world where the combination of the Consulting and interpersonal skills that I developed and the coding skill that I would develop would not be valuable in the job marketplace right and so I did the arithmetic yeah so so you just again you had confidence that like you were learning actionable like useful things so that it was okay to take on debt like I I just want to like that's one of the things we often take talk about on the show like the recurring villain of uh student debt essentially in the free Cod Camp you know uh Cinematic Universe right um so I just want to what you're saying with like you were going back you were taking additional debt so you could like learn go even more technical right um yeah yeah sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your flow there but so you're going back after you've already completed the master's degree and essentially you're going back again yeah to payon more debt so uh and yeah I mean I had a good amount of outstanding debt from that previous degree and I said well you know might as well just throw a couple more chips in uh but obviously clear return on that investment for me yeah all of the opportunities that I was seeing from the Consulting side is that one these Engineers are making really good money and they cannot get enough of them at least at that point of time I don't think it's too different now I think that software engineering data science these skill sets are still in demand the the marketplace though is dramatically more difficult right now I don't think that that's something that um that uh I'd want to like spread any false rumors about but yeah um so from there I I actually started working at the company that I work at now so one of my friends I grew up playing golf with him and he hatched this crazy idea to pitch the uh us Ryder Cup team or the PGA of America who runs them on a research program so there's a really good business case I think at the time the US had lost eight or nine of the last 11 Ridder cups and they we hadn't won overseas in something like 20 years and on paper the US team was dramatically better than the European team and for some reason we were just still losing in in these competitions and it had to be a operational a management a leadership type change and analytics is a huge part of it analytics is also very kind of a sexier thing and hiring a stats team or an analytics team is is something that people are willing to pay money for right especially after Like Money Ball popularized kind of the notion of having these you know kind of quantitative like metrics uh applied to athletes right exactly and so that's something that we eventually built out a program for and offered I was able to do that while I was doing my master's degree in computer science and to me that was so such a cool experience because I was learning these sorry I was learning these things and then I was able to apply them directly on the project and the work cycle and the flow that we were doing and so I was able to build out a lot of the infrastructure I was low alloted a lot of freedom to be able to experiment with these tools and these Concepts and that turned into more work into future writer cups future presidents cups into our basketball work into some of these other things and I wouldn't say it's been all history since I actually took a Hiatus and I worked at um I took an internship when I was in grad school I took a Hiatus and I worked at like a rapid growth company in in Chicago for a little while but the sports analytics work has always been my true passion and yeah admit admittedly it probably comes from my own uh my own deficiencies not being able to make it in professional golf has been an unbelievable motivator for me to understand why I could not make it yeah man there's so much to unpack there first of all uh how cool is it that uh you were you were so passionate about this as a kid like like looking back do you think you know kid Kenji would be pretty excited about the work you're doing today yeah I think so he probably wonder why I didn't make it as well and that's sort of the the fun of it too I think that after studying for my other podcast exponential athlete I realized a lot of the reasons why but there there's a a very specific cocktail of the right process the right ingredients the right mentality the right training approach and natural ability that create a great athlete and I realize how how nuanced that is now and I think the beauty of working in this field the beauty of studying this is you get to really understand and enjoy the the small details and how important they are and how much of a difference they make between two people you know the a great round of golf and a pretty average round of golf can be separated by by a single decision or a a single shop and understanding how to look at those in the big picture and over a large amount of data is a very different perspective than you have as an individual athlete where you're living and breathing by every single movement or every single action that you take yeah that's so interesting I mean like I've heard that any field when it gets like sufficiently competitive right like everybody has kind of like this Baseline capability and like it a lot of it comes down to just like I'm not sure if it's like luck uh I'm not sure how much luck plays and like highle competitive things but obviously luck across a large enough sample size gets kind of like averaged out right um so what are the traits in your humble opinion like having studied this just personally curious that that make like an amazing golf player like like a tigerwoods type character I just say him because everybody is familiar with him versus like somebody who uh is just shy of being able to be professional yeah well so let's start with luck I think luck usually comes in the form of genetics you you look at and it varies dramatically by sport so for example I don't think it's a surprise but in a sport like football or basketball or even swimming genetics probably play a dramatically larger role than a sport like golf or even if we go all the way down to darts there's probably less luck involved in in those two sports I mean as associated with genetics as there is in a basketball or a football or swimming there is still some luck in genetics so some from from some of the research that I've done if you look into the field of motor control there is a certain amount of Randomness in everyone's given movements so if you ask me to for example hold this little fidget toy and hold it perfectly still that might be easier for me than for some other people probably a lot easier than for me I'm like terribly clumsy exactly and they call that uh it's like n or like noise in in the in the movement patterns we have so that could be something that is uh uh you know essentially inherent in people is their level of Randomness in their movements and you can imagine in a game like darts that's very fine motor control someone could have just a natural ability of having a steadier hand or less Randomness in their movements that that that could be obviously something I'm obviously more interested in the process and the the conditioning and the training so there there's a bunch of of different factors it would probably be an entire dissertation to to go through those you know my my other podcast each each series is almost 6 eight hours long so uh but at the highest level there's the psychological perspective so the belief that you can do something and the ability to psychological uh distance distance psychologically from the the pressure or the pain or some of these other things to look at things in perspective uh a big part of that I'm seeing now is something called the alter ego effect where people can take on a persona for a specific role that they're playing so let's say I know for a fact we've talked about it you're quite introverted right and if you're going to give a presentation in front of hundreds of people that might not be something that you love I don't know if it is but but probably have to turn turn on like you know gregarious Quincy fun loving happy gol lucky Quincy as opposed to normal Quincy be pretty reserved and like you know keep to himself and and and that's exactly what it is is that we can step into these different personas but we can also build these personas exactly how we want them to be so you could step into uh Tony Robbins Persona where you're you're mimicking his behavior you're you're stepping into to how he handles himself and and his belief system and that also actually creates the psychological distance where you're buffered from those normal feelings of anxiety or those types of things you might have uh this guy Todd Herman who I've interviewed on the other podcast talks a lot about that there's also a process perspective that I think a lot of people don't realize so being great at something coding uh Sports any of these types of things it's a daily habit more so than it is a uh oneoff thing that you do so if you pursue Excellence every single day and you do all the right things every day to be able to uh to reach whatever goal that you've set then all you have to do is follow this road map that you've set and a big thing that the best coaches do are that they create this road map for their athletes so the athletes what they're responsible for is setting the goal and putting in the work to get to that goal and then the role of a coach is to figure out all the subsequent steps to be able to get to that goal so if you think about it if you have a good coach and they're good at estimating they're doing all these things greatness becomes this daily task rather than this incredible uh crazy thing that you have to do over time or or this like crazy achievement that you have to do you look at Michael Phelps every day he's in the pool swimming he has very specific goals that he's supposed to do he has specific actions that he takes and more often than not if he takes all of the actions that he's supposed to take every day over the long term over the next fouryear cycle he will hit the world records or he'll get the times that he wants um and inevitably that leads to winning gold medals uh another good thing is that all these athletes really focus on the controllables so as I just mentioned with Michael Phelps he only focuses on times that he wants to set he does not focus on medals that he wants to win there was all this talk about he won those eight gold medals in Beijing yes the gold medals are a result of him hitting the times that he wants those times are completely objective there's something he has control over what he cannot do is control the other swimmers if they just simply swim faster than he does if they had a better day than he did and so there's this whole pipeline of the psychological side the goal setting side the process side and then you have a deep dive into the fitness and the even motor learning or these types of things where there's more effective ways to learn uh more effective ways to practice more effective ways to do these types of things so again there's this whole field of performance uh uh Sports performance a big part of that also is the analytics that I do so how do you evaluate all these things you measure them how do you figure out if you're getting better you track it how do you uh you know evaluate if uh if there's things that need to be changed is you look at the data and you you figure out what is is feasible or what what needs to be adapted so to me there's this beautiful Symphony of all these things fitting together and it's fascinating that I get to go through and study this because the each of these individual disciplines are studied quite well but the again the Symphony of how they connect and how they create music or this beautiful um Melody of of unbelievable uh like outlier performance is not something that I think a lot of people have dived into yeah this melody of unbelievable outlier performance so you're getting to to dive into that you're getting to understand why Babe Ruth was so good at hitting home runs even though they had nothing like the apparatus you have and the faculties you have in terms of being able to like analyze things right like that that was like nearly 100 years ago you know and like uh back then he was just good at you know like people didn't necessarily understand why so here's where this all fits into analytics so I I believe I'm correct I think it was Babe Ruth um he was actually blind or like legally blind in his left eye interesting one of the greatest hitters of all time one of the greatest quotequote athletes of all time baseball is a little different game I won't lie about that but baseball a lot of these Sports they're not about raw athletic ability yes you have to have some capability athletically but baseball in particular is about predicting outcomes more than it is being able to react to stimuli so when a pitch is coming out of someone's hand at 90 M hour the amount of time that you have to react is too small for you to actually see the ball and hit the ball and make that cognitive process you have to essentially be starting the swing when the ball is coming out of the hand so you have to be knowing in within a very short period of time and the ball is leaving the hand roughly where you're going to swing and if you're going to swing or not and that is a predictive algorithm that people are running it's essentially like a beian process right um that we have to make very quickly and part of getting good at sports especially reactive Sports is training our own internal algorithm to be able to predict outcomes as effectively as possible same thing with tennis same thing with any of these Sports where you're hitting a ball you're actually creating an algorithm yourself to predict what is coming and how to how to locate or go to it and that is what makes the best athletes in those domains if they can accurately predict where something's going to be and to execute after they've gotten to the right positioning which to me is this really cool intersection of like the same process that goes into a machine learning model but we're training ourselves and like the way we train ourselves can be very different if we use gradient descent if we use some of these different things like it it' be a metaphorical gradient descent right yeah but but to me there there's there's so much uh interesting Nuance there that uh a lot of the things in these fields are not too different a lot of the what makes things or models successful is not that different across domains that's so interesting so like you know I don't know as much about like actual physical sports but like I enjoy watching videos about like competitive fighting games and things like that and that that's the same sort of thing human reaction speed is simply too slow to be able to you know make some of these frame perfect inputs or predict what like a an eight frame punch is going to do and and be able to react to it so you instead have to develop her istics uh and in general like if I'm this far from the other player and they tend to do this type of move then I need to counter it with this move or something like that right and I imagine it's it's very similar in like uh you know sports that are just like where essentially things are happening so fast that you just have to rely on Instinct uh rather than be able to like cognitively process and think like uh you know I I Marvel at like the human uh anatomy and and like the way that um for example a lot of decision making is distributed down the brain stem like all the way down your spine uh and like when you're like walking around and you like start to step on like you know mouse or something you'll like feel it under your foot and you'll like lift your foot before you like kill the mouse you'll be like you know or something like that right like like and there's no way that that signal has time to go all the way up to your brain and all the way back down to your leg it's actually like part of your like lower spine that's like making that decision and in dinosaurs you even have like almost a second brain like halfway down their backs for like large dinosaurs uh to to help them make those kinds of limic decisions very quickly um so yeah sorry I'm kind of like rambling here but like it's very exciting to me uh the notion that like so much of getting good at sports is like you said like training uh a machine learning algorithm the the same way they they taught like ala go to play Go by just playing itself for hundreds of years simulated of course um yeah so so to some extent just by playing a whole lot of baseball uh and swinging at a whole lot of balls Babe Ruth was kind of training him on like how pitchers pitch and like kind of developing like an internal Instinct for like the probability that the next pitch is going to be a fast ball for example am I is am I kind of like on the going in the right direction in terms of like understanding what you're saying yeah yeah exactly and so now we have ways that we can short circuit that or improve the effect effectiveness of this is that they can strap you to a headset and you can use VR to pick up pitches and identify those those types of things one of the things with sports though is that you realize how important relevant practice is so just picking up an object is not going to be the same as picking up a baseball so very Sports specific practice or or situation specific practice is really relevant and so there's there's a a tight balance between practicing General skills and practicing specific skills uh there there's a lot less crossover than a lot of people generally think and the crossover happens it sort of uh weird times I don't have a great example off the top of my head well if you can dodge a wrench can you dodge a ball that would probably be close enough but you you'd get more Returns on practicing dodging balls than on dodging wrenches like they did in in the movie yeah the movie of course we're talking about is the Viner dodgeball classic uh low brow humor movie that probably has an H well so um let's dive more into the notion of data analytics and I guess how you got into the space because I'm really interested what your early projects were what kind of uh like what your progression was in terms of learning specific skills because a lot of people in the audience are developers or they're you know University students and they're very interested in becoming data scientists or machine learning engineers and that's something you've done and uh I want to understand your journey like you're like so let's rewind it just a little bit you're like 25 26 years old you have learned all this math you've learned all this domain expertise in the field of sports and yet you you know communicating with machines through programming like like what did you learn in in what sequence and like what were some of the early I guess Revelations and step changes in your ability yeah I I I wish I remembered it more clearly than I do but at the early stages when I was in grad school for the first time something that I was was doing was just trying to build models in Excel I was using linear regression it wasn't very sophisticated and I kept trying to understand especially for the daily fantasy sports it's like how are people able to compare and evaluate the different athletes based on the predicted fantasy points so essentially it's daily fantasy you have these fantasy football athletes you choose a team and based on how many points that they score in the real game or their actions on the real field your team team of whoever you've picked gets points and the goal is to maximize points and so I didn't understand maximization I didn't understand budget allocation and these are things that I was completely baffled by so this is version one I'm working in Excel I go to grad school I learned some other different approaches using SPSS some of these other tools still didn't I after grad school I didn't have access to SPSS anymore so I couldn't really so it's a pretty expensive statistical software Tool uh I can't remember the expense I I remember I don't think it was free right it's not matb and a lot of these other kind of like more academic tools you have to spend like hundreds of dollars for like a site license or for the licenses these types of things yeah and so I I couldn't necessarily use those tools to be able to to build the models that I was using and so I just essentially realized hey I have to uh pick up a whole new skill set this coding thing seems like I could build whatever I wanted seems like it's flexible it seems like I can do a lot of these different things and so I go and I I start grad school and I start doing a lot of different projects related to this so I learned about the napsack algorithm so the napsack algorithm is exactly what you need to essentially get the most uh like the most projected points for the lowest cost or the some fixed cost that that you're trying to get so if you have uh a napsack you're trying to figure out okay if you're robbing a a bank what are the high highest price items that I can that I can get to all fit in the bag without it overflowing you wouldn't want to just put the heaviest biggest stuff in because you'd reduce the amount of uh overall High profit or or steings that you would get so you want to maximize the value and that's the algorithm that essentially solves this daily fantasy problem that I was having interesting so like like in Dark Souls trying to figure out the right armor without weighing yourself down and having the encumbered roll you want to have like the fast roll exactly exactly so very useful algorithm for a lot of things but that's something I picked up I was like oh I can use this for this specific problem and it also took a lot of research it was very difficult for me to implement I could implement it in 20 seconds now with chat gbt which is great uh but I still had to know of the algorithm and I had to be able to adapt it for for the use case which is a really good learning process then I started working all all my projects were related to sports so I did a project related to uh predicting basketball performance in games I did a project uh related to UFC fights so something that I was frustrated by was that in the UFC there's a lot of decisions that are just really poorly judged by the referees so there was quite a lot of fights where it went to decision and based on all the objective measures the person that won the fight should not have so you know significant strikes time on the ground control all of these different things and so I was like can I build a robot judge that is better than these uh that is better than these uh judges that are judging the fights and I go in and I built that and at the time I was a little naive I didn't really know how uh I I don't didn't know everything I do now but what I had to train the models on was the judges decisions so you're essentially building circular logic into this but what I did determine even by doing it in that way is that the judging was virtually unpredictable with the metrics that were were there the the data that was collected on the fights and that suggests to me that there is massive bias or that the judges are unbelievably bad because you should still be able to see some sort of trend or be able to predict outcomes when matches go to a decision so it wasn't necessarily a complete loss it's that oh I can't build a model the predic things but in some sense I proved that these judges that they're using are really bad and they should you know have some sort of overhaul associated with that um so really just fing my interests also solving problems that I saw in my own personal life or or a big thing was also data that I had readily available to me and kagle was an incredible resource at that time yeah let's talk about kle kaggle is like almost kind of like the the eighth wonder of the world World in terms of just having tons of data sets like I go there all the time I'm going to be interviewing uh one of the the key people at kaggle um on the Freo Camp podcast heck soon uh so look for that but uh yeah what is kaggle so kaggle is the best data repository and learning platform for data science so they have a ton of competitions that you can compete in to you know op optimize a model or tune a model to get the best prediction but they also have a ton of just random data that people put up as part of a community project what I like the most is that there's a lot of free code that people put up so all these kagle experts or these Advanced Data scientists they share their process of analyzing data with you and you can go and you can learn and and see how they go about not necessarily solving a problem but approaching a data science problem yeah and just a very question that's mostly done in like jupyter notebook correct or Google collaboratory which is kind of like jupyter notebook in the browser yeah they have their builtin Google collab uh environments that they use sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your flow but I just want to like uh make sure I understand so the main way of analyzing and communicating data in 2024 would you say like jupyter notebook type user interfaces are are the way that you break kind of like step by step almost like a the process of like a mathematical proof it's like first we take this data and here's this code that runs against it and then you're kind of like walking people through a narrative of how you're understanding those data is that is that accurate I I think in those communities yes it's probably one of the best ways to be able to share uh data related code I think in production and implementation I I don't personally use notebooks very often I use I I use like vs code and I just use a regular python file rather than a Jupiter file because you can run cells in a python file in very much the same way but when you execute code um if you're doing some sort of ETL or you're you do it in scripts yeah extract transform load right ETL okay yeah yeah so I I prefer to write my code in scripts rather than in executable cells because if we're trying to scale that generally scales dramatically better if I'm trying to share my work and make it understandable to other people which can be sometimes the role of a data scientist Jupiter notebooks are okay I probably would prefer dashboards though if I was going to share it with end users so I think Jupiter notebooks are great for sharing work with other data scientists I think sharing jupyter note books with business people for example or people that don't code is not a good use case and for sharing uh codee with other computers or with systems or with Engineers it's better to do it in just regular python files or in GitHub repos or or in whatever infrastructure that that your company or or these other people use because it's designed to be uh there's there's just benefits and drawbacks of like the different ways that we package code yeah man that's that's really helpful insight uh we're getting the straight to straight from Ken uh as to like how you know data scientists work uh which uh I want to step back and just talk a little bit about the field of data science and how it's evolved over the past really decade or so maybe decade and a half like like the term dat data scientist is my understanding is relatively new and there was even this joke like what do you call a statistician who lives in San Francisco a data scientist right like that it was like kind of like uh almost like just like a an ausc of an old role but the tools have progressed very dramatically obviously the methodology has progressed dramatically the statistics that underpins a lot of this is probably you know very old like in some cases centuries old but um I want to get a feel for like let's just step back and explain it like on five what is data science so I think if you look at what a data scientist does they are simply problem solvers that used relatively Advanced tools so you're presented with a problem hey I don't know why uh my sales are so low this month so problem I go in and I say okay well what what could be causing this one of the best places to look is in whatever data that you have so you go in I start analyzing this what do I use I use uh probably SQL to to pull the data I'll use python or or r one of these languages to uh interpret organize clean and then analyze the data and that's really at the most basic level what it is we're creating the solution and then we also have to tell the you know tell the the stakeholder what the problem is and communicate uh exactly why that's happening and hopefully propose a fix but at the very most basic level that's what it is and the role of data scientists hasn't necessarily changed if you're thinking of an end toend data scientist what's happened over time though is that one the tools have changed and uh the specialization has changed so if you look back let's say like you're a private investigator right I think as a data scientists in a very similar way hey we're trying to like solve this and understand what's wrong and then propose what you should do about it uh that functions very different uh you know 60 years ago or or even like the chief of police an inspector they were probably doing all of the research and going to the crime scenes and doing all this stuff themselves uh a long time ago now you have a whole team that does one specific part of that process maybe you have someone for uh blood analysis maybe you have someone who goes and interviews different people maybe you have someone that um is organizing and and filing all of the new things so what's same thing is happening in the data domain is rather than just one data scientist that does everything we have like a data engineer that's cured and and managing the data we have a data analyst that's maybe focusing on dashboards and putting those in front of end users we might have a machine learning engineer that's doing uh the the model production and and uh like making sure that these models are up to date and and tuning them and and monitoring them yeah so you have all of these different things that were maybe done less efficiently as a singular person split into multiple roles over time and then again these tools are changing as well just yes we're still using largely the same programming languages which is now predominantly python but we have new AI tools we have new mlops tools we have better uh data engineering tools it it that's that's the core of what data scientists do is not change the again those are the things that have shifted yeah awesome so I'm very interested in just kind of your quick advice we're going to delve so much deeper into this but just for people who are listening since we're we're establishing kind of like the the Baseline understanding of of the field if somebody let's say they have very basic okay so I've heard that data science is really like a fusion of three different disciplines mathematical knowledge programming capability and domain expertise and um I'm not would you agree with that assessment or is that incomplete no I think that that's pretty reasonable I would say that in the world we live in now in a in like a future AI World um all of those are probably like the the requirements for each of those is reducing yeah um I would say the the most important thing is understanding how to ask the right questions and developing that sort of meta problem solving skill because in a world now we can you generally need two of those things uh to be very effective uh whereas you used to need three of those things so for example some of the people that win the sports cackle competitions they know nothing about the sport in question their learning is they go but that outside perspective can actually be very useful in helping them solve the problem because they're thinking about it not through the same lens as all the people who have been working in the domain before um in a world now where if you have really good uh mathematic mathematics knowledge you can use a Chachi BT to complement or supplement some of the coding if you can code really well and you have great domain expertise you can do enough research in the math to be able to um or you can experiment enough with a code that you can kind of iron out the need for some of that math knowledge that you used to need to have so I would say that that's also something that is technically changing as well yeah that's so interesting the notion that essentially you can Shore up the weakest of those three dimensions using AI tools um and I want to talk a lot about AI tools uh and we're probably going to talk a great length about those but I do want to get back into uh now that we've established that that foundation so just just to reiterate what you just said somebody who's relatively weak in mathematics but knows a lot about the sport in question or the general uh field that is being analyzed um they they can make up for the math or they can make up for the programming capability by having a tool like uh gp4 create some uh scripts that accomplish specific things uh like here's a mathematical formula can you implement this in Python code right uh or uh people that don't have domain expert that's so fascinating that some of the best analysts of different sports don't even necessarily know how the sport works it reminds me of you know like like does gbt even know what a go board is right or like does does alpha go even know what a go board is do they know what stones are do they know what the the concept of two people sitting over a table as has been played for I don't know four 5 thousand years you know setting the stones in the different uh grid points no it doesn't know anything it just knows that like the expected value of going to this place is high you know or it's just predicting the next move right um yeah yeah I mean and humans who don't have that domain expertise are still able to perform very well apparently uh in these CLE competitions so I mean can you give me like kind of like an extreme example do you have any off the top of your head of like somebody who did really well at a competition without necessarily knowing anything about it there I will tell you a quick very fascinating real world example of this so there is uh a gentleman in I think he's from like he's somewhere in Europe sorry is this the Scrabble example Scrabble yes the guy he an English speaker he does not speak French but he's like a Scrabble Champion like and uh he decided he wanted to go to France and like beat the French at their own you know at scravel but he didn't want to bother learning French uh so what he did was he instead like memorized the French gravel dictionary which is so absurd for like a neurotypical person like me like I struggle to you know you know I've been studying Chinese for 20 years and I struggle sometimes to like even remember remember like how a specific character looks that I've looked at like 20 times and yet this guy is remembering the exact sequence of letters in these extremely long you know weirdly pronounced French words but he probably doesn't know how to pronounce them either so that's not a difficulty he just has to remember the sequence of you know Roman characters so he can put those onto the Scrabble table but he did it right like do you do you know the story behind that I believe he won the French Championship uh possibly multiple times um but uh but yeah I mean that that's where you have he has domain knowledge in Scrabble and probably has like a framework in place there but you know he realized that can scale to to other languages maybe he he saw opportunities for words that French people wouldn't necessarily do right if you're a native English speaker even if you play Scrabble certain words are going to be more commonly thought of in a Scrabble game that you play because they're more prevalent in our vocabulary he might be going there and he has no distribution of like recently used words or popular words or anything like that they're it's like a uniform opportunity to explore all these different options it could have actually helped him because he didn't have these internal biases with French words that he might with English words so to me that's like a pretty fascinating thing and and that's the whole idea there's a great book by David Epstein called range and he talks about how either analogous thinking so pulling in ideas from different domains into your current domain can be a really powerful thing or coming at things from an Outsiders perspective can help you identify you know the these builtin biases that that people and organizations have and to me that's something that has been a very big change in my perspective on things is that yes uh domain knowledge absolutely very useful but it's also important to have Outsider knowledge or have a different view or a different perspective and if we're thinking about the job market or any of these types of things that's not something that a lot of people uh relish or or or in your own personal life you don't really see it as an important or valuable thing but employers or um or people that are hiring for roles they might find a unique perspective to be very valuable because it is inherently different than than what everyone else is doing and um to me that's something that is is frequently overlooked again I'm not going to say domain knowledge is not important but I would argue the ability to at least step outside of the domain and pull in things from other places that's as important if not more important because that's where Innovation happens yeah what are some ways you personally like do you just try to be like a verocious reader of like lots of different topics or something like do you find in your daytoday work analy ing uh Sports Performance and things like that uh that some analogous um topic or or some completely different topic or you just heard some random story like 10 years ago and you're like wait a second this reminds like that kind of pattern recognition that the human brain is so good at like do you do anything to actively just shove more random stuff into your brain so that you can potentially have this big associative web to draw from oh yeah 100% so the biggest thing for me is well there's three things that I do that I think are really effective for that so the first is reading a ton I probably read about three books a week now uh which is a little aggressive but for the podcast the exponential athlete podcast that I do I usually I have to read five to 10 books for each series that I do on the athletes so it's pretty involved but I'd want to do it anyway it's super interesting to me I'm reading a lot more biography than I used to uh to me learning from individual stories I mean it makes sense I I do the Ken neighbors podcast where I do this biopic of interesting people in the data space but to me I start to make these relationships between what other people have done rather than necessarily the large uh Concepts uh that you get in a business book or more structured book I've been I found that to be very useful so I read a ton I try to read a diverse array of things uh but to be honest I mostly read nonfiction every now and then I'll dabble into some fiction I read the about half of the Red Rising Series so far which is I really enjoy I highly recommend those to to anyone uh the other thing I do is I listen to podcasts I I really absolutely wear out the founders podcast I think that uh Founders innovators entrepreneurs are people who are doing things fundamentally differently and it's in the way that people approach things differently where you find innovation of sparkk you know 90% of it might not work for you or probably won't work for you but there will be 10% a 5% that is different than what you're reading about other people doing that might resonate with you and again I I think life is about a series of um sort of like Venture Capital right where you're uh trying a lot of different things and eventually some of these things hit and they really work for you and that's what you have to continue to index on and the way that we find those little things that we'll hit is in a lot of research a lot of study and and yeah I mean completely I I cannot say enough good things about the founders podcast yeah I've listen to it too I just want to I also want to chime in and say like listen to the Anna winter I think the V lady she's great excellent episode I'll link to uh to that episode and also the James Cameron episode's really fascinating too the movie director um yeah so it's mostly like people who found companies like especially like robber Ron type Aras and stuff but but there's also like lots of kind of contemporary figures I think there's probably an episode about Oprah Winfrey for example um so sorry I didn't mean to do ear but I just wanted to chime in and I I'll link to uh I'll link to that Anna Wintour episode uh it out also link to the the James Dyson one that's one of my favorite ones where he has this thing of essentially being different for the sake of it rather than necessarily um like different with functionality that's something I've tried to integrate into my life is that novelty is something that We crave and the only way that we're able to create truly Innovative things is to build uh like Randomness or difference or contrarianism into what we're doing he might take a little too far at times but Dyson's been a pretty successful company for making vacuum cleaners and hair dryers so um it's interesting uh to think about as well yeah yeah and I'll just say uh I just want to share a quote like J George Bernard Shaw said uh the reasonable man and by the way this is man uh today it would be the reasonable person uh the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the Unreasonable Man exactly exactly how I would describe it if you try if you just keep doing things like the way everybody's always done them you're not going to get any Innovation right by definition Innovation is throwing new things at the wall so um yeah cool sorry to interrupt your flow again I love sharing like that that quote has always been very inspiring to me and uh it it's reminded me that like it's it's fine to be unconventional and to take different approaches and like all those people that went to school with you that did everything perfectly and like had this very clear linear progression uh in their career and everything and like they probably have a great like lifestyle and and maybe they've got a house and they've got kids and all that stuff but if you choose like a completely different path there's a lot more risk but you could end up doing something completely different like like being able to work you know kind of your dream job doing data analysis oh your dream job would probably be to be a pro golfer it sounds like but uh you're you're I actually I would prefer this much more the travel lifestyle of these professional golfers as I've gotten to work with more of them uh it's not something I would enjoy you're on the road 40 weeks of the year it's hard to have a family it's hard to have consistency I very much like what I do now I I think it is between the podcasting and the analytics uh it's it's perfect for me and this this isn't a job that just like existed when you were a kid this wasn't something you could like necessarily aspire to be right uh this is something you had to kind of gradually like kind of pathfind your way into over time right 100% well to go back really quickly to that quote you said I on my board here I I literally uh I have it written down it's it's the do things others won't so you can accomplish what they can't so if you do all the same things as other people I think it's unreasonable to expect that you'll accomplish different things than they will and so by doing different things every day or experimenting I think you get to a different place um just overall and and what your experience can be and so that's something that drives me every single day day and it's very much in the same vein of of doing the the unreasonable things um the the last thing that I do to consolidate all this information is I try to go on a lot of walks and I also I I meditate every day uh usually in the morning and then at night before I go to bed it just helps me to have that time where my brain can do the work for me and that's usually when I have the best Insight it's a little disruptive because you're sitting there and you're trying to not think about anything and all the great ideas and all the connections are being made and they pop into your head so you just write them down and then you uh and then you move on but to me that's uh there's two parts where you have to accumulate knowledge and information and then you have to let the subconscious brain take over and digest it I I think that when people are learning in general that's a step that everyone forgets I know that when I was learning how to code when I was learning through all of my school years I would be so frustrated at that I couldn't get something and then if I went for a walk I took some time off for some reason it just sort of figured itself out in my head and I think that that's an integral part of learning that is almost uh um almost glazed over in every single educational institution that I've ever been a part of yeah absolutely you like I'm not sure if there are parallels to like how we train machines um but but like I know myself like precisely what we were saying earlier like every single day I play bass for like you know half an hour or so every single day I study Chinese uh for like half an hour and and I've just it's just part of my routine and I know just like Michael Phelps he's trying to like Target this time and he has confidence that if he is consistent in his you know uh I guess adherence to his regiment uh to to the the game plan he's laid out for himself the road map that he will get there he has that kind of self belief that he is getting better even if he has up his actual progress feels like it's going like this if you just measure like oh today I'm swimming slightly slower than I was yesterday you know but it's kind of like a sine wave that's going up and to the right right and and so many things in life are like that and I I believe that that's how it is with learning like you feel like you hit a plateau and you're like oh man but it could be that it's just like an instantaneous kind of like feeling of that and in fact from an absolute standpoint you're higher than you've ever been in terms of your ability to perform could be that you're just having an off day maybe you didn't sleep very well or um you're distracted by some sort of stressor in your life but uh as long as you're you know putting in the time and the energy to incrementally step that up uh I I feel like it's almost like a foregone conclusion that you will improve whether you hit your goal uh depends on how audacious your goal was but you you will improve and I don't believe that there's like there may be some things where there is like a ceiling like a performance heing but I haven't discovered that in any of my own personal Endeavors like I feel like everything I practice at I get better at and uh like if you were to go and look at my old podcast and probably if you were to go and look at kenji's old podcasts he'd be less effective and aite and he probably uh than he is today right and like that's certainly how I feel about myself uh to the to the extent that I don't even edit my podcast I'm like it's like the equivalent of like Crossing between the two uh the two buildings on on a tight wire without without a net like I genuinely feel like that forces me to perform and it forces me to be interesting and it forces me to uh to not interrupt my guest too much for example or go on too many tangents uh so so getting back to that what you were saying about accumulating knowledge then processing it meditating in the morning and in the evening and and so it's almost kind of like like uh you're training you're you're ingesting and and uh Ingress I'm not sure what the the actual term is in data science but but like you're you're piling in all the knowledge and then now you're you're able to like actually have like some output from that and that output is just random insights that occur to you when you're meditating yeah pretty much I I mean I I would say some of the best insights that I've had about my career and my life and those types of things come in that process and also related to my work or some of these other things it just it it's crazy easy to conceptualize that like the best things aren't necessarily things that I have logically come to but I think that this is the process that humans have used for thousands of years I mean you look at some of the greatest um inventors ever you look at Einstein you look at um Edison you look at some of these types of people this was a part of their routine I think it was Edison he would hold like a like a a ball in his hand and he'd he'd like essentially try to almost fall asleep in his chair or he'd get in this like dream light like Zone and if he dropped the ball he fell asleep but if he could hold the ball there he would be in this like correct zone for him to be uh inspired and and to invent and to create incredible things I wouldn't quote that that's Edison but it's some great inventor so yeah that's that's an interesting process I mean you have to throw stuff at the wall and see what works you have to try different you know things like I also am a lover of walking uh and I would say like even though I go to the gym uh you know two or three times a week and just do like cables and stuff uh some free weights like the main thing that I do for physical activity is I'll just throw on my headphones and I'll throw on these one hour long podcasts like this one that you're listening to right now like like Ken's nearest neighbors and uh and I just kind of like ingest it's my my information diet it's somebody teaching me about the world teaching me about new like I love uh stuff stuff you should know is like oh I haven't checked that one out yeah so that's like a great one where these two guys just like do a bunch of research about a topic and they talk about it and that could be something as simple as like how is barbecue made or something like that like completely just almost like you would throw a dart at a board and you just hit some topic all right let's do a whole bunch of research on that like I think they had one about like Zamboni machines like that's how weird and but like I know quite a bit about zon machines from having listened to that that I before I never even knew I wanted to listen to that yeah so um so that's that's cool that you're like really into walking uh as well and uh like Steve Jobs you know famous Divergent thinker uh loved to go on walks and uh he would even like whenever he wanted to have a meeting with somebody he would grab them and he like let's go on a walk and walk and talk it increases your heart rate uh it ju like you know that's why I like record these standing up because I like to have like a higher heart rate a higher energy level and I think that does do translate into some like slightly better you know brain performance when I'm asking questions and stuff but but like you definitely think when you're walking I find that when I'm running like I'm too tired to like really think as well so walking seems to be like the The goldilock Zone like the perfect kind of happy medium between like no physical exertion like relaxing and meditating like you said earlier and some degree of physical exertion you know or and like over exerting yourself to where you don't have the capacity to think right where do you stand on like why do you like walking so much so there's really good science around being in nature uh prly walking through Parks or green areas uh around essentially one sense of a so sense of a is very good for creating psychological distance uh nature is restorative so if please don't quote me on the actual science here uh I can try to find the research for you uh but I if I recall is basically if you go f 20minute walk uh without your phone versus with your phone there's like unbelievable differences in your brain uh just like going for a walk in nature versus not going for walk in nature uh there was a very good study about um I think it was housing project in Chicago uh and I believe half of the housing project had green views and the other half had city views and they went through and essentially studied the um these were randomly signed and they studied the psychological profiles of the people in green versus city views and I believe they found like dramatically less instances of anxiety a lot more motivation a lot more energy ability to focus uh there's just really good I mean going for a walk in nature is just in no way bad for you yeah it has a ton of positive effects and it has that very similar meditative effect being able to um like I think there's also something around uh like not seeing all these crazy geometric shapes that we see when we're in a city so everything is very square but very few things in nature are necessarily perfectly round there there are like these weird amorphous shapes that make our brain have to do different things and I think that there's something inherently beneficial even if I can't necessarily recall the research or remember exactly what it is but um yeah basically all the science says go for walks all the science says uh meditate take time do these types of things and exercise and they've done very well for me in terms of my ability to understand the world around me my sense of self and my sense of innovation and understanding as well yeah let's talk a little bit about geography so my understanding is you did you used to live in Hawaii yeah so I was in uh Chicago for grad school and then Co hit and I decided that it was uh not super great to be trapped inside in the freezing cold uh just by myself so I said you know what I'm going to go somewhere warm uh my my dad uh you know grew up in Hawaii I have a ton of family there and my parents have a uh a retirement home that they had purchased and so they weren't living there I said it'd be a good son I'd look after the place and I went out there and uh I stayed there for for about a year and then I I moved into my own place but um yeah I was out there and then I very recently moved to Austin Texas yeah awesome so we're in the same same time zone I'm in uh Plano Texas which is uh you have maybe like three hours three and a half hour drive you got to come visit I will absolutely like I didn't realize you were in Austin until like recently when you mentioned it in one of your podcasts uh so yeah let's like obviously Hawaii famed for its natural beauty it's like the most remote island chain in the world and it has such Lush kind of like probably like very distinct wildlife and stuff so did you spend if somebody's going to Hawaii uh and they want to like really get like the best out of Hawaii in terms of like natural beauty and things like that what are some things that you would recommend that they do while they're there uh probably go to Big Island uh Volcano National Park is awesome you see the active volcano there's a beautiful hike in there there's great hikes on all the islands admittedly I didn't capitalize on it as much as I should have I actually do not enjoy the beach at all I uh I think sand is like the worst thing ever created I don't have a problem with the water just getting to the water on an island you have to pass through the sand and that's that's a difficult thing for me um but yeah I think you're the first person I've ever heard say they distinctly don't like sand I mean yeah it gets in your shoes and it sticks to you and there's sometimes like I'll be walking like uh here in Texas when you walk on the beach there's these little crabs that have like little holes have you seen these these little holes they breathe through and like sometimes if you actually step on like one of their holes that they're in they'll reach up and they'll like claw your feet yeah oh interesting and that permanently like traumatized me like I don't want to walk on the beach anymore in Texas cuz the crabs will like grab your feet yeah they're after you yeah wild that's that's an interesting so so you like the water but you don't like the sand that you have to get did you ever like just like get a really good run I got on a boat I don't I don't I don't mind uh some of the other ways to get into the water but uh and I I'm not completely aers to sand if I have mentally prepared enough I'll I'll go to a beach what is it about the sand I just the the the feeling and then it gets in your car and then it gets in your bed somehow and then it's everywhere and you can't get rid of it and it's just it's just the a curse that follows you forever yeah it's like if you have a birthday party and somebody brings glitter yeah exact the exact same phenomenon for me I was saying but um yeah I think if we're thinking about the I actually have been Outdoors a lot more in Texas so in Hawaii because of the you know like the living conditions it's an island so there's only a there's space is so much more limited uh you have to you know drive or take some time to get to the Natural Beauty and these types of things I found moving to Texas there's a lot more space there's a lot more like intermixed Greenery in the City areas and and in the kind of suburb suburb areas and it's it's been really good for me uh on that front yeah um I obviously we'll still visit Hawaii quite a bit I think I'm going to go back in June but I I I've really really enjoyed moving yeah I mean Texas does I just want to like acknowledge Texas is not a perfect place there are a lot of problems here uh but one of the things that they've done a really good job of is like have lots of parks everywhere and like they they do invest a lot in public spaces that you can go and like walk around we've got some near my house um during the pandemic I took my kids to tons of playgrounds and just let them they got extremely good at like doing monkey bars and like hanging for like seemingly super human length of the time with their tiny body weights and stuff uh and and uh yeah like Texas is a really great place if you just want to go hiking or we went to San Antonio we did these like caves if you get a chance to go to San Antonio there's there's like this C an hour and a half away so I might as well yeah yeah absolutely and there's also this cool like ropes course thing with like zip lines and stuff awesome uh I'll if you're curious I I'll try to find the the name of the place I I'll shoot it I'll put it in the show notes perfect so well so one thing I want to say is that if I if I look at growing up something I loved about golf is that you're out in nature I mean these golf courses maybe are artificially green and and have wasted a lot of water and these types of things but from the human perception perspective it's quiet it's relax I mean maybe not relaxing if you're like playing competitively but you're going for if you're walking you're walking probably around 7 Miles when you're out there uh for around you know 3 and 1 half to 4 and a half 5 hours and so that is unbelievably refreshing to me and that's one of the best ways that I was personally getting out in nature and having that time to think so on a in a normal round of golf you really don't spend more than about 10 minutes actually hitting the golf ball most of the time is spent going in between shots and thinking about what you're going to do and so you have a lot of time to be able to smell the roses and and enjoy yourself if you don't take it too seriously yeah awesome well I want to get back to data science but like I think welcome to Texas man it's so so great to have uh another data science uh heavy who has moved here to live among o Texans uh so um I want to talk more practically just for people that are listening who want to get into the field and understand what's going on in the field cuz it's changing and evolving very quickly uh what are some of the biggest misconceptions you see people coming into data science with misconceptions coming into data science like let's say somebody is uh they're like a a statistics major or let's say they're somebody who uh used to be you know working in retail and they learned to code and they've been working as a software developer for like a year or two and they're interested in taking their career into a data science Direction so I I think let's even back up so someone that's coming out of college or high school that wants to be a data scientist something I really struggle with and one of the reasons I've switched more to podcasting content than more traditional data science content on my main YouTube channel is that for some reason people think that data science Landing a data science role is like this unbel able Holy Grail this this perfect position where you make a ton of money and you have this great life and all these types of things and while data science work can be fun and rewarding it isn't the end right you don't just get a job and your life is over and perfect you have to continue to work you have to do the work on the job you have to manage office politics you have to work in the specific domain and work on projects you might not enjoy or you might not be super comfortable with there is there's drawbacks to every single um opportunity that you have in life I think data science can be an incredible career and a great stepping stone you can learn a lot you can make good money but a lot of people uh especially college students they think that everything is going to be solved when they land a job at whatever company that they want to do and that simply isn't the case I think that you have to think a little bit more long term to be able to have uh uh like a happier life because if if you don't you're going to land this job and then there's this what's next thing that happens and that happened to me is that oh my God I landed this job I thought I'd be so happy and then the job isn't necessarily what I thought it was what why do I have motivation to continue to work I already achieved the thing that I wanted and so thinking about things from a larger perspective of hey what what would I like to do uh with my with my life not just with my job or or or what would I like to do this year uh that can help you figure out where to go with that data science job and after that data science job and you know it isn't specifically related to The Domain but it is related to the career and that is one of the biggest problems that I see is there's a ton of attrition and and probably to the fault of myself for putting out um a ton of content around why data science is a good field to work in um I still believe it is but inherently different roles are different different people are different and you know data science might not be for everyone right there are some aspects of the coding or the problem solving or the autonomy that that you're awarded in the job that don't necessarily resonate with everyone but there's definitely roles that yeah those those people would be perfectly happy in just maybe not data science or maybe not software engineering or maybe not pro uh product management there there's these different you know that what I should say maybe to sum this all up is introspection before action especially in your career is probably pretty important excellent uh and I think that that is resonant because i' I meet so many people that like went to law school for example and found out after going very into debt and spending like you know an extra four years and maybe extra years doing like clarking and and uh other sort of Association ships that they didn't like doing it and what do you do when you're in that circumstance we've had lots of guests on the free Camp podcast who who've realized you know in in their mid 20s sometimes in their mid30s or 40s that like they're not going where they want to go and they don't really like their work and they want to do something completely differently so introspection before action especially when it comes to careers um that's a that's a great insight and um if somebody wanted to get into the field based on like obviously you're very candid about the fact that you learned to code and you learned to do data science and all this stuff like more than 10 years ago and you're not that you don't have that beginner's mindset perfectly preserved in like Amber in your mind somewhere that you can just go tap in and like okay what was it like back in the day you have probably vague memories that have been like as you said like glost over by time and and uh you probably look with ro rosecolored glasses at some aspects of learning to code and so you might have like a romantic perspective of that I'm certainly guilty of uh as opposed to like uh like you may not remember all the time that you just like had some sort of like banging my head on my keyboard when I forgot a semicolon yeah uh so if people wanted to get into the field which again I still think it is a good a great field to get into if you know if if it suits you and you're interested in it the the biggest thing now I think this is very are are a good idea anymore and I I could see the blood rushing out of your face qu see no I'm just kidding but what what I recommend now is actually Building Products so the difference between a project and a product is that a project you're building it just for yourself you're trying to create some insight in a product you're building things for other people to use and I think that that's a big shift in the data science world a big shift in the overall engineering world is that with the AI tools with the advancements in technology ology it's a lot easier to build things that other people can use than it used to be you have things like streamlit you have things like uh shiny for python you have all these different tools to make things useful to other people and you also should be sharing your work that's the best way to one get feedback but also to get recognized by employers or whatever it might be so just constantly building is more important than necessarily learning the fundamentals or the the Frameworks if you can build something you'll intuitively um you'll intuitively pick up how these things work at a base level I'm not saying you shouldn't learn the fundamentals I think that they're very important but you understand what the fundamentals are a lot better if you actually have to construct something to begin with um and so I think that there's sort of this balance approach where you learn some fundamentals you build stuff you learn some more fundamentals you build stuff and you sort of uh Weevil wavel back and forth till you have really built some really cool stuff and you and you're able to um you you're able to create opportunities for yourself in in the job market awesome so that's like just to encapsulate that device build products not projects because products have kind of like an outward focus on like an end user who's going to pick up what you built and use it for something like the difference between just having a GitHub repo where you've got a bunch of code and you do your data analysis and you look at like all right I'm done I'm going to move on no instead go on kaggle and and build like you know essentially like a a I guess a they're called projects on Cagle but but essentially like have a narrative of like what you did and what sequence so people can like look at it and learn from it and maybe clean a data set and put it up there so other people can use it uh and and you can think of that as a product free Cod camps curriculum is very project oriented but we make it a very clear point that like there's a difference between projects You're Building to learn uh you know kind of step by step and then there's like openended certification projects that you have to build and get all the test to pass to earn the certification but then there's the actual personal projects which you could view as products essentially you should have like a big overarching problem you want to solve whether that's like some sort of analytical engine for like under understanding like baseball statistics that are published through some API or something right like so that you can have a website where people can go and check see like at a glimpse like a dashboard where like they can see the performance of you know a player on their little league or something like that I'm not sure if that's available but like something that people like even if it's just a few people would actually use that can really inform your development and it can give you kind of a North star so you're not just thrashing like maybe it'd be cool to add this no like people are asking me to add this so I can add this um I I definitely like that that focus on creating an artifact that other people are going to actually be able to use and then there's like that feedback loop of of you know maintaining it and extending it um not just based on we talk about this all the time on the podcast but not just following your own Flights of Fancy but actually you know getting actual real world feedback um yeah yeah I agree and I should clarify I think projects have absolutely use case in the learning process if you just write a simple line of code you copy one line of code and you run it in whatever ID you're using that to me is a project right you're you're experimenting you're trying to do those things that's an integral part of learning but if we're talking about getting a job we're talking about thinking about making that transition from learner to practitioner I think the project to product paradigm shift is a really important one because in Industry when are you ever writing code that someone else is not going to use or some other system is not going to use and to me that's a very important distinction there's one thing to write code for oursel to learn and to use and there's another thing to write code that that is essentially almost always going to interact with other people or other systems right yeah 100% um do you have any cool War stories that you could share from just like mistakes you've made over the years uh doing data science that's a good question um yeah I think you something with my work is that we work usually with professional athletes or coaches and so when we're working with these groups we have to remember that they come from very different backgrounds than we do they could they generally are really intelligent they work and they understand GF for their doain unbelievably well but the idea that they will necessarily understand the analysis that we do they'll that they'll necessarily understand a specific type of graph if we show it to them that's not an assumption that we can say make they they've indexed really heavily on being good at golf or being good at basketball or being good at whatever it is they haven't indexed in the same way on being really good at statistics or uh interpreting graphs or any of these types of things so when when we're approaching our clients and trying to explain our work you know how do you explain a mon Carlo simulation to a professional golfer how do you explain uh C's clustering or or uh that this model came out of XYZ neural net that we were using that is a very difficult challenge that that we faced is just the ability to explain in real terms or in in golf terms some of these types of models and Analysis that we're using so it's hard to get by and if people don't understand what you're talking about and so as much as it's a fun engineering problem in our work a lot of it is a communication opportunity as well to be able to speak in the terms of whoever you're working with so that's something that I've struggled with historically and we're showing graphs showing all these different simulations and the different um like the the bootstrap standard deviation of the of the of the results and maybe that's not the best approach it's definitely what we've learned um but for anyone that that's working in a specific domain if you have these domain experts and you have some domain knowledge it's probably better to explain things in their terms rather than your statistic iCal terms if they want to know the details of the analysis great but does it really benefit them for you to go through uh all of this painstaking detail uh around any of the relevant uh metrics that they might not understand like what's the point you're you're wasting both of your your time and so that that has been a huge lesson for me is know your audience and try to speak their language can you think of any like specific instance you don't need to say the name of the athlete or anything like that but like an instance where you learned something where maybe you presumed too much or or you just didn't have the ability to communicate in a way that resonated with them yeah I I think something that I hadn't really thought of uh in a long time is that like percentiles the idea of a percentile can be pretty complex actually so people think in terms of percentages so they might think that hey like uh you know if they're 90th percentile that means there's a 90% chance of something happen I could see where that would be a a logical leap but percentiles and percentages they can mean very different things um you know they're not probabil percentiles are not probabilities and that could be something if you're communicating that could be um that could hang that could hang up on some people and so we we've had to clarify language like that specifically um I I I I don't want to get too much into detail into that but that is that is an area where you could see hey like um not having a statistics background not having like a like that great a grasp of that concept uh would be really difficult it's the same thing for like a um you know if we're talking in golf language you know like what is an um you know like a I'm trying to think of what what a corollary would be but you know the like understanding uh angle of attack versus D plane like people might be really confused about what those two things are I don't even really conceptually understand what they are but a golf instructor would be like oh that's so easy to explain these different things but they look kind of the same on on like a piece of paper to me so I it's it's understanding the domain and it's you know it's not a it's an a completely understandable uh differentiation uh to make as well in that case it's just that we have to be better thinking about okay could this be be misconstrued yeah yeah uh like like a a I guess a common software development uh Coral are that a lot of people might encounter maybe they're at a dinner party and they're like oh I'm a JavaScript developer and the other person will be like oh uh I took a Java class in high school not knowing that jav you know JavaScript and Java Java Java is to JavaScript what car is the carpet yeah as they say right like uh they're they're two different things but but it's like it's almost like people's existing understanding of how percentages work got in the way of them understanding the notion of like percentiles um so so just little things that can you can easily work around that if you just word things differently but you have to know to work around that um yeah like like there there are like false cognets when you're learning a foreign language uh for example like there are words that look just like English words so you might be inclined to think that they're the same word but they're actually totally different that language is just a coincidence that they're the same word right uh so so kind of like structuring your thinking and structuring your approach through a product to communicate things without over complicating it without having to pull somebody aside and have like a whole sidebar about like okay let's explain how this works and this works and this work like they just want to know at the end of the day what they can do to improve right I I mean maybe it's it's a lot more than that but I presume that athletes they want to be the best golfer they can be and learning a whole bunch of stats that time could probably spent working on their swing or or you know so just practicing right U maybe maybe there are some concepts are there any like statistical Concepts that just like living your life that you wish more people were aware of um like are there like any like do you see people make mistakes with like probability time and time again like but if they just took a moment to actually understand like some facet of product uh of probability or statistics they could like really do themselves a huge favor I'm sure there are some but I can't think of one off the top of my head right now let me um I'll try to get back to on that one yeah like correlation and causation it obviously that comes up all the time the lay person might not understand the difference between two things being correlated and may think causality right hence superstitions right like um well something that that I like is like Optimal stopping problem optimal stopping problem yeah so essentially if you're hiring or you're trying to find a partner or whatever it is the math Nets out that you should probably stop around 33% of the way through your search and choose the next candidate who is better than all of the previous candidates um that is I I don't remember exactly how the math works there's this book called algorithms to live by I think that's what it is or it's how to not be wrong one of those two books and effectively that is the way to um to optimize and maximize getting the best candidate in a scenario like that so a lot of people think that they have to go all the way through it or like job hunting or uh hiring or any of these things are difficult problems but to me that's there's like actually a quantifiable way to get probabilistically the best candidate interesting so so just to make sure like all the job Seekers out there are probably going to be really upset about this but if this is true like if you're a hiring manager and you get 500 applications you should just look at you know onethird of 500 um and you should basically stop there and just choose your best candidate because no no you choose the best candidate after that oneir after you throw away that one/ third and then the next best candidate that's better than anyone in that onethird is the one that you would take ah interesting okay okay now I can see how it works okay I mean in theory that's not how the job market precisely Works in dating it's probably more of a coral are right where um you're getting the most return on your time uh because looking at the remaining 2/3 is going to take you know three times as long as you've already spent but finding another person who's better than those might only be you know uh few more terms uh a few more uh iterations right precisely yeah and and it does sound really cold and weird when applied to like the the labor market are certainly applied toward trying to Rel partner you know but that's math right math doesn't care about your feelings I'm I'm not saying that people should do this I'm saying that it's a useful tool if you were like trying to perfectly optimize for time spent and but but like that's not how any of these things work in practicality that's how another thing I'll also say is that you know in in the real world where there's infinite variables simple heuristics can be I mean statistics can actually be a heuristic rather than a um like a like a factual thing right because the statistics we use a lot of the time don't incorporate all of the data that is available in human interactions and dating and any of these types of things so uh that's another thing that I've learned about statistics is like yes that they're relevant um what there's almost always things that we can't quantify and so using you know taking everything with a grain of Sal is is pretty important as well yeah I mean like any complex system you're going to have a model and that model is an oversimplification of that complex system right so when you say the word heris I just want to make sure everybody in the audience knows what this term heris means it's basically like a mental shortcut essentially or like a rule of thumb which does not mean what it they say it means in Boondock STS it's not about like spousal abuse the term has no association with that so I will not you know not use the term rule of thumb because it it's just like a weird movie thing um okay so so like a heuristic like essentially a rule of thumb uh kind of like a tool that you can use to save yourself a whole bunch of time and energy doing exhaustive search um so you're saying that a lot of Statistics applied is not like if you were to talk to like I guess like U somebody who was obsessed with getting the 100% accurate like stateoftheart response you could save yourself a whole lot of that work and get a good enough answer so to speak by applying statistics as a heuristic yeah I it's very often I mean let's think about it heuristic can be a statistic right so let's say um we're trying to determine if someone can like bench press a certain amount and maybe there would be like an age heuristic that we'd use and so technically that is a statistic as well right um if we add additional attributes to it the more uh like Advanced we make the model the less of a heuristic it is because the heuristics are based on the sort of like either gut feeling or the shortcut but still both of those are statistics and I think a lot of people don't realize that hey there's in Whenever there is still a gap in information it is technically heuristic the machine learning models we use all of these types of things in my opinion are technically still largely heuristic models they're just significantly more refined than just highlevel heuristics yeah um and I don't think people realize that there is a scale uh that these things operate on uh so like the highest level might be that age heuristic it would be less of a heuristic the more refined we make it and the more more specific it gets but if it's not 100% technically it is like a heuristic model right yeah awesome uh could you like talk a little bit closer to your mic like it the volume just dropped a little bit sorry about that okay I didn't want to interrupt your flow okay so so uh one of the things that you said uh on your podcast one of your recent podcast episodes I listened to a bunch of them in preparation for this interview that really jumped out of me is like being really interesting is that um there's a danger in taking other people's humanistics uh and applying them without understanding how they arrived at those heuristics and it's often much better to just grapple with it yourself and create your own humoristic than it is to use somebody else's so like don't take somebody else's humanistic of face value and try to apply them to your own work why do you believe this uh so I think in the world we live in it's it's becoming more and more of a mass customization world and let's take a biology example where if I take a certain supplement and someone else takes a certain supplement we might have varying uh reactions to it someone it might do really great things for them and may make their G really comfortable but if I take it it makes me feel really bad um and that could be for a whole host of reasons it could be that hey I have different genetics it could be that I have a whole completely different gut microbi iome that impacts my sensitivity to supplements or all these different things there are these individualized factors in all of our problems that um that that can lead to very different effects from the same inputs so to Me Maybe if it has helped a lot of people and say oh this helps 80% of people it's worth experimenting with but I should still validate the results on myself because my unique situation is different I don't see this as being different for companies or different different for athletes or whoever it is there has to be that level of individual experimentation to make sure that things are fit you can't again take this on face value and assume it'll work I see this with for example content all the time so you go and you look at uh Mr Beast who has is by far the most successful YouTuber of all time he creates thumbnails that are very like emotional they're very uh whizbang there's they're very clear but me creating that type of thumbnail for educational content would not work because what the user is expecting to get does not match the content of the video so you know if if you look at the unique situation if you have something that is more relevant to education that thumbnail will be more likely to be clicked by the audience because it resonates with the message of the content as well as the content itself and it'll lead to better outcomes so if you were to say oh just make it how Mr Beast does it that isn't going to line up from uh from a conceptual or analytical perspective at a certain point in time so I think that there's uh there there is that again introspection that we have to do on ourselves or our business but there's also uh that understanding of of like of the matching and and the small data associated with ourselves that we have to be evaluating as well yeah 100% And and I can talk anecdotally about very that very thing because you and and you know your YouTube channel is quite big and you you've had a lot of very popular uh educational videos and it's very hard to get people to click on and actually watch something that's good for them right it's hard to get your kids to eat their vegetables take their vitamins when they could just be eating you know Cocoa Puffs or PopTarts or whatever right but but uh yeah a lot of people ask me like Quincy why don't you make the free Coke cam thumbnails pop why don't you make them more like uh Mr beast and and have like the the YouTuber face and like you know like all the arrows and circles and all those different tricks that people use but like with YouTube you actually don't want people who aren't going to like your video to click on your video it penalizes you for getting have if you have like a really high clickr rate but a really low watch time that video is heading downward like it's not going to be recommended to very many people it's much better to have a like with education to have an extremely literal thumbnail like the kind that Bo K creates for YouTube uh for free C games YouTube where it's just like you know um our programming in 10 hours or something like that or 10 10 hour course or something like that and it's just like the r logo like we found that that works a lot better in terms of getting a video to like actually do well than trying to like jazz it up and Mr Beast eyes it uh maybe we could talk a little bit about your career as a Creator uh I have a lot of other data science and AI questions and do you still have time yeah yeah I I should let me double check real quick but I think we're uh yeah we blocked out two hours for this but like yeah we're good we're good I'm I'm was so fun talking to you if it's cool I just want to keep keep firing these away it's not every day you get to sit down with Kenji so iy Quincy you just got to move a little closer yeah I I got to get get down there to Austin we got to go get some uh some some food together get some barbecue all right so um let's talk about creation like you've been doing this podcast for so long uh You've Got You Are are incredibly prolific you're incredibly consistent and uh and now you have a second podcast as well which it sounds like I haven't listened to it yet but it sounds like it's a a different format of you going really deep um what would you advise someone to do if they wanted to create educational content or science content uh like like what are some of the things that you've learned on your own journey and and what I guess got you to upload your first video to YouTube to begin with so my first video was for a a class project that I did so when I was in grad school we had to do a little presentation and I had compared two different types of recurrent neural Nets to predict crypto prices and it took me five minutes to make a video and it was an online course so I just uploaded it didn't think anything of it shared the link I didn't realize you could make unlisted videos or anything along along those at that point in time so I just made it public and then I look back three four months later and it had a thousand views at the time and to me that was a ton of views I was like Wow people are interested in this like this this is I'll take note of that and then a little bit later I was Landing my first kind of internship enroll out of grad school and I'd gone from management consulting into data science and there was absolutely no road map for how I could do that and so I'd gone through this process and I was like well maybe I should build this road map so it could help other people going for I already have this YouTube channel that I had published this one video on I might as well put that up there and see if there's any traction and that did okay and then I said wow I really like making these videos I I like educating uh there was also a point in time where I did an interview where I had to just talk into a camera and I it was a prompted question I just recorded my answer and it was unbelievable I watched it back and I was like man I don't even want this job anymore and I realized that one of the best ways to help improve my communication skills was to record myself on video and watch it back and so I said why not I'll I'll do that it'll be a good way I can spread information I thought was useful and I can also improve my interpersonal skills in this way and so it started like that and it just continued to snowball I realized I really liked making videos I like storytelling YouTube is very interesting because it is a data problem so you get all of your metrics for the videos you have the clickthrough reads you have all these things and there's all these different things that you can tweak so to me that was a really fun exercise as well and then during the pandemic there was a massive surge for in um an interest in remote jobs and data science and these types of domains and the channel really ended up taking off more and as as part of that I was trying to produce a lot of content I was making three videos a week and one of the types of videos is I was just inter interviewing people in the field and I realized that I like that even more than making normal videos so a podcast to me one you get a meet another really interesting person you get to sit down and have an indepth hourong conversation with them and it's also easier content to make you have to spend an hour maybe 30 minutes before preparing and an hour talking and you get this content that people are ready to consume already and I said wow that that actually makes a lot of sense why don't I index a little bit more towards that uh one because I enjoyed it arguably more than uh putting together a YouTube video and it was also Contra to the uh kind of snippet uh or short short form sort of phase that we're going through yeah I'm a believer that Nuance is really important and going into detail is really important and in the short form world we live in we're making everything about these highlights and if you live your life by highlights you're not going to get very far because that there's always like the devil is in the details in in in almost everything so I view podcasting I view my new podcast as a way to go really deep into the details which is where the true Insight is found in my opinion yeah 100% And like with Tik Tok and with YouTube shorts and even with like you know some of these short form articles that you read like you know pop science type magazines and stuff like that like to some extent you're just information grazing you're you're just kind of like oh this is information this is content with a lowercase C right um and I love long form conversations like this and I find them so valuable and I listen to hours of this stuff every week like I probably listened to I listen to everything at Double speed so I probably listened like two or three hours of podcast type conversation every single day it's like a huge part of my information diet while I'm walking around and getting exercise or while I'm uh you know I'll take the kids to the park and they'll be on the monkey bars and I'll just kind of walk laps around the playground area right and uh I find this incredibly useful because if you think about it practically like what are the odds that I'm going to be able to have an indepth conversation with somebody like Kenji regularly right um uh am I going to meet him at a dinner party is is he actually going to focus on talking just a me for this long am I going to be able to you know and then so you're doing research uh before you even sit down and talk with these guests that you've had on um and as a result you're like much better prepared than you would be even in some casual like oh you're at some party and you walk into the kitchen to get uh you know uh some ordes and and there's like this person standing there and you start talking like the amount of depth you can get in a podcast conversation especially when when you're doing things like defining uh terms for the for La audience and things like that like it it's an incredible learning tool and I really wish podcasting was around when I was a kid because I think I would be so much smarter and more interesting than I am today if I'd grown up doing this uh so so yeah I just want to emphasize that like if anybody's listening to this and they're thinking like oh there's already too many podcasts out in the world who has time in the day like I spent a huge amount of time I listened to dozens of different podcasts maybe hundreds of podcasts over the span of a year and uh a different podcast like RSS feeds um it's amazing also if you're watching this on YouTube there are RSS feeds you can just listen to Apple podcast you can listen to Spotify you don't have to use as much data um uh definitely I encourage you to subscribe to uh Ken nearest neighbors and to the exponential athlete podcast as well um super insightful like like I'm very excited about listening to the uh exponential athlete uh myself just because uh a lot of these things that I think maybe it'll help me up my fighting game skills like understanding like there might be some ancillary Concepts that I can Port over so yeah well I I love what you said um the way I view it is that you have you like second or first order and second order thinking and I think you can have first order and second order conversations and what I mean by that is first order is or even third order conversations or first order is you're talking about something that is not super Nuance you're talking about the weather you're talking about whatever it is uh a second order is it's a deeper conversation where you have intimate knowledge or you both have intimate knowledge of a spe specific domain and that's where Insight comes from where you can go past the the pleasantries you can go past maybe some of the the highle details and get into where um where you know topics or areas that are unique to each individual person and then third order conversations build on those second order conversations and you get to places there that maybe no one has been before maybe you're talking about a topic in a different way or combining two different disciplines or whatever it might be in this different way and I think that the longer form content allows you to go into those areas and make those deeper insights and to piece things together that might not necessarily be um you know naturally occurring and again that is where Insight happens um and that's something I really love about this also podcasts are great opportunity to talk to unbelievably interesting people you you have the opportunity to have these conversations if you have a podcast you have an a reason to connect with a bunch of interesting people if you have a podcast that's a very different thing as well is you know oh I'm trying to grow my career it'd be great if I could ask all these people who have been successful in this career in in this domain oh wait if I have a podcast I have an excuse to interview them for their time unless they're professional athletes unless they're super highprofile they'll probably give you the time of day too cuz it benefit benefits them as well yeah absolutely uh and one of this is a great way to bridge into AI because AI is not about creating anything truly novel right it's all about like taking stuff that's been fed into it and trying to synthesize something that looks novel but really is you know basic but you've talked a lot about your experiments with llms to create like social media posts and how you ultimately abandoned a lot of that because it's just derivative and it felt like you were just tweeting kind of like a copy of a copy of you know what gp4 thinks is like a good tweet um and that you think that podcasts are like almost kind of like the and it's all novel and like this particular sequence of words that I'm saying right now has statistically never been said before right like even if you look at the past 20 words I've said probably right like that sequence of words has probably never been said before so so maybe you could talk about like how we can still create interesting novel content even when we have these kind of like you know uh token predictor type tools that are incredibly powerful and useful but at the same time are not really generating anything novel yeah well it's going to sound like I'm contradicting myself but I promise I'm not so I don't think in the world now if we really view it there isn't really any new ideas necessarily like the core of ideas stays the same how they're applied across different disciplines how they're adapted are where the novelty comes from and I think the problem with aachi BT writing is that it's averaging all of these ideas into something that is similarly replicable so you're not getting the Insight from drawing from all these different disciplines and being able to create this this new application to uh uh to a similar space because of this averaging that these models are doing and I think that that's inherently what the law I think the best writing the best uh tweeting the best podcasting is borrowing for other Concepts and applying them to a new domain so that it isn't novel still but it's more complex and essentially like less average so that it can be useful I don't know if that necessarily makes sense yeah no that totally makes sense there's nothing new Under the Sun but you recombine things I mean if you look at it like there's nothing novel about music like all the musical instruments were invented most of the musical instruments were invented hundreds of years ago and we're just working with the same range of frequency the same like time signatures and stuff like that but you can recombine those fundamental things into all kinds of Creative Expressions and you know AI music is just not going to do quite what like a human composer that has also taken in a huge Corpus but also has that kind of like human instinct for applying uh I would argue that of course like there's some really good AI music out there that keeps getting better and better all the time but I genuinely believe uh as somebody who does compose music from time to time and enjoys music that like it's going to be extremely hard to compose a riff like n Rogers would compose you know and and to get that same charm yes you could feed his entire Corpus of every single Chic song in there and all his Sister Sledge everything like that and put it into a blender and try to be like a now Rogers riff erator but I just if you actually like compared that to what n Rogers sat down and played if you put the two together I think that the results would be like clear um and I think that that maybe maybe that's naive what do you think about that do you think that that is naive well I think that it's you said Nell Roger NY Rogers n Rogers rhythm guitar player from Sheik I think that if he was adapt at prompting and was telling the model what to combine could probably create something that was similar but only only he knows what outside resources he's pulling from where he's getting inspiration from all these different things and to me that is where the the magic happens in these things I mean that the problem again with a chat BT writing blog content for me is that in that circumstance if I ask it to write a LinkedIn post it has all these emojis it has all these like these weird things that are a stereo typical LinkedIn post and a stereotypical LinkedIn post is not necessarily a successful LinkedIn post and the more of the stereotypical LinkedIn posts that we get the more diluted the content is and so the further that I can actually get from a chat GPT LinkedIn post the more it will stand out in the audience's eyes because it's less uniform than the other content uh that's being produced so the more AI content there is out there the more similar the corpus of content is going to be and the more benefit that you have of being and creating original content that's one of the things I love about podcasting is that I I would argue for a normal YouTube video of mine someone could make or replicate it very easily uh they could say all the same things they could probably shoot better camera angles they could make it faceless do whatever it is uh and and replicate that really well it's very hard just as you were saying earlier Quincy to to replicate an entire conversation the randomness in which it goes the personality if it was two robots talking and we didn't have any backstory any lived experience why would there be a reason to tune in to hear that conversation outside of the novelty of two robots talking right what makes the content interesting is the individual stories and the perspectives the humans have uh at least at this point in time unless it's completely fabricated the AIS do not have this Rich backstory of of human history um I'll also say that I think really deeply deep deep research that consolidates a ton of different knowledge is something that AI does not do well at this point in time that might change that's probably more subject to change than the podcast interviews but to me that Corpus of knowledge or organizing a tremendous amount of knowledge into like a you know a 4Hour episode is something I don't think AI will be doing as effectively as a human in in the short term so for me this long form content again you also create this relationship with the listeners that I think is very hard for an AI to do yeah oh well I think that that's a great point one other place where organic conversations come up a lot that I know you're a big advocate of attending conferences for people that are getting into the space um can you talk about like your passion for conferences and how somebody getting into the field like what they should optimize for in in terms of maybe some specific conferences they should look at for specific types yeah I I think by far the most opportunities that I've had in my career have come through other people I mean after interviewing I'd say it's probably been over a 100 people on the podcast because we have repeat guests and things along those lines even though we're almost at episode 200 one of the common threads is that one or two people has made a profound impact on their individual careers and so in my opinion one of the best ways to meet people that could have a positive impact on your career is through going to conferences through doing coffee meetups through doing unfortunately these things in person if you're a introverted person yeah um fortunately for me is I'm quite extroverted and that extroversion has led me to meeting a lot of people that would help either the podcast the content my professional life uh my personal life any of these types of things and the most high leverage things that I've done uh is in collaboration or meeting uh other people I will also say my best friend um she's introverted very introverted but she has the benefit of having an extroverted friend who introduces her to a lot of different people so you don't necessarily have to be the extrovert yourself but going to conferences is a great way to meet someone who's extroverted that can all you can Outsource all of your super connector exactly somebody who knows everybody like you may know these people they like they just make it a point to like be curious about other people and go out and and meet other people and I aspire to one day be a super connector in terms of just knowing a lot of people in the data Science World the developer world and it sounds like you've you've been able to do that as well through your podcast and through your work uh just meet a broad array of data scientists if if somebody wants to just get like a really good good classic episode of Ken's nearest neighbors they're looking for an interview to listen to is there one that you'd recommend off the top of your head that you're really proud of um let's think here so one more recently that that I thought was really useful I think that the job market in data science is maybe not as great as a lot of people would like right now um I did one with Nick Singh who wrote the book uh I think it's crack the data Ace the data science interview and that has a really good perspective on the landscape and what you can do to get ahead I also did one more recently with Wes mckin who was the uh creator of the pandas library and that was a really informative one about his process and his experience and a little bit of the comparison between open source and the more private nature of some of these AI models that are coming up so I think those would be those would be uh pretty interesting ones for anyone who is new to the podcast awesome well I am going to link to both of those episodes below so once you finish listening to this uh I hope you'll go and listen to even more keni insights as he interviews some of these uh thinkers and doers in the data science space uh Ken I just want to thank you again man for giving me so much of your busy day uh I want to welcome you again to Texas I think it's so cool that you're like a three and a half hour drive away and I definitely want to hang out with you probably at some upcoming conference and and then go get a big meal with you at some point uh cuz yeah I mean I assume like did you eat a lot of good food when you were in Hawaii did you ever I ate a lot of good food yeah but you know there's like I've had enough Pokey for a lifetime uh and so I'm on my my uh TexMex and barbecue era which which I'm perfectly happy about my my waistline is not super happy about that but the my that's not as healthy as poke no unfortunately not but what can you do awesome man well it's been such a pleasure talking with you uh everybody be sure to check the show notes uh be sure to subscribe if you haven't subscribed to the Freo Camp podcast uh and be sure to look for new interviews like this every week coming straight from insightful people like Kenji and again seriously check out the show the show notes and listen to some of Ken's interviews there is one of me I had terrible mic quality I apologize for the quality of my mic before I start switch to like this nice dynamic microphone um and uh but if you want to hear you know the many questions that Ken asked of me very insightful uh I I hope you enjoy that as well and man I just I appreciate everything you're doing for making data science more accessible accessible for folks getting into the field and I appreciate your you know very candid you're not sugar cating anything like you you go there you talk about uh you know the the real challenges people have getting into the field uh the capriciousness of the job market which we're also experiencing in software development as a field but I mean the reality is I I think this field of data science it sounds like of doing machine learning of doing everything that you're doing with um you know math and computer science I I can only imagine it continuing to grow as we become a more I mean can we end on that like like are you pretty optimistic about the future the field yeah absolutely I mean think about what AI needs to be successful you need more data without a doubt I think that there's going to be tremendous opportunities particularly in data engineering to start uh you need the infrastructure to support some of the AI advancements and if you think about it a lot of people are scared about oh is AI going to take my role a lot of these types of things who is more suited who who is most suited uh to excel in a world where AI tools are prominent probably the people who are starting to build them which are data scientists machine learning engineers and these types of people so I I personally Embrace using the tools even though I don't write it for blogging I still I use them a lot to code and and for other things so you know my my thought is that people in the data science domain people who are technically inclined people who are coding are the most prepared to start using these tools for other things and that's an incredible opportunity in my opinion rather than something to necessarily be afraid of awesome thank you again cani everyone thank you and we got to have you we got to have you on uh Ken neighbors again I mean I have the little studio right here so dude I want to actually come there and be an iners episode and I I would love to interview you in person at some point as well would love it awesome well everybody until next week happy coding
