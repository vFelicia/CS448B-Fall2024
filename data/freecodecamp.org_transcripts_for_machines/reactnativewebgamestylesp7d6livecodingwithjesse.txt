hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do some styling on our react native web app so just as a quick intro this show is just about me uh coding live it's not rehearsed so i will make mistakes uh it's it's not exactly a tutorial so there definitely may be better ways to do what i'm trying to do um i set a pomodoro timer and we code for 25 minutes and then i take a little break and answer some questions in the live chat and we'll do that probably twice and i'll be live live coding and answering questions for about an hour today feel free to ask questions about anything you want i'll do my best to answer all the questions and i definitely encourage contributions so if you have ideas for the project you know go ahead and put those in the live chat as well so if you check the description to this video you can find a link to the github repo where you can see all the code that i'm using here so far uh everything is pretty much in app.js we haven't broken anything else out into separate components yet although we we probably will soon and let's see oops we gotta start it okay so we built this out using create react app uh but we're also using react native web and that means we're gonna be using react native syntax but it is rendering to the dom instead of uh android or or ios all right let's start up the timer okay uh this is the the github repo and i guess i'll throw this link in the chat as well just in case so i have a few of you saying hi so hey how's it going all right so here's what we have so far it doesn't look great so let me tell you what i'm thinking in terms of styling and then i'll get some feedback and we'll go from there so right off the bat i say since the target audience is children i'll probably approach the styling to this a little bit different than i normally would for for an app we want to keep the inputs and the fonts larger than normal um let's see probably keep the colors like pretty bright okay and other than that just like anything like play any playful elements we could add will probably be be good as well so let's let's think about these uh characters so right now this is supposed to be like the hero character and these are the enemies so i'm thinking maybe we could um use some css to style these i don't know i go back and forth so like my ideas are either like we could try to find like some like sprites to use right like video game sprites right uh and have like characters that look like real characters or we could keep it i don't know more of just like normal divs and just do some styling on it uh to make them look different so i there's some pretty cool stuff you can do with just css uh i'll let y'all think about that for a minute and let me know in the chat what you think like should we try to find you know images to use uh for our for our characters or uh should we see if we can do some some css stuff uh so i'm i genuinely am just not sure at this point what i'd what i'd rather do uh you know i imagine the css stuff has the advantage of the the overall game being smaller in terms of file size but i don't know that it'll be that big of a difference also some some other ideas i had for styling is that depending on the game mode uh the colors could change right uh potentially like the enemies could change right so the addition enemies would be different than the subtraction enemies right uh different colors at least um maybe maybe different background right i'm not right now it's very bright it's very bright and white so we could definitely go with a different background okay all right i'm gonna go to the chat really quick and just see what you all think about um about whether to go with images or just some some cool css stuff um jake knife says definitely use images vincent says yes you sprites sergey says svg actually yeah if we could find some svgs that that would be really cool um muhammad says css can be better you have more control over it that's true if if we could find svgs some like svg images we could maybe have the best of both worlds where we could still use css to manipulate the images and have control like potentially we could change colors um programmatically um sprites okay vincent says so why not use sprites yeah i'm i'm open i'm open to that okay so my next question would be does anybody know where a good place to get sprites are like right now i'd probably be looking for some free stuff but i'm i'm not opposed to like paying for for good stuff i mean um you know maybe some cool backgrounds too might not be a bad idea uh so i just don't know where the best place to get that is so if anybody has any ideas uh put them in the chat if you want to paste a link it probably won't show up but i'll still be able to see it uh just no one else will be able to see it um so i'm not going to take time to like go search for sprites right now because it'll probably be boring to just watch me do google searches so let's try to work on some of the other styles for now so i imagine let's see in web app mode positioning is not a huge deal but on different screen sizes we're probably going to run into some issues so we do need to consider that might want to maybe just like decrease the size of these at some point but probably wait until we figure out whether we're using sprites or not to actually do that um so let's check it all right let's look at maybe some some color schemes and we need to make if i want things to change we probably need to set up a theme so let's go ahead and do that now and just set up a like a css theme that can be easily changed based on state okay so currently since the entire app is just in this one app.js file this is going to be pretty easy um to set up a theme uh eventually we will have to probably pass down some things but i think it should still be okay sorry i'm yawning again i think i'm actually getting sick i had my throat really hurt so i might be a little bit more tired and slow uh today so do we have css yet i can't remember if we did it yeah we do okay cool um so we do have oh yeah we have some styles in here we have some colors um what i want to do based on our state is is switch that out so uh what kind of themes we're gonna need hmm maybe we should just base the themes off of like the edition theme the subtraction theme that i think that kind of makes that makes sense right so if we're going to do it like that then we could just use mode so we don't really need a different uh thing in state right so for now let's just set some background colors on the main container div and then it'll be really obvious just to test things out it's probably not going to look really good right now uh but it'll be a good um it'll be a good test okay so for our styles let's say we're gonna have styles equal so we'll have styles equals or styles.root but we're going to do two styles so when we want to add more than one style we're gonna just make a an array inside this this object right and then we can just separate everything with commas just like a normal array so we could also do styles and then i'm gonna do um instead of the normal dot syntax right i'm gonna do let's see i'm gonna do this style start all right i'm gonna put a variable in here so right so i don't want to put dots so i'm gonna put this state um mode and actually while we're at it uh let's let's do some um destructuring so we don't have to use this state everywhere right uh so if you're not familiar with destructuring here's what we're gonna do so we're gonna say const and we're gonna put in some of the elements of states we're gonna do mode let's see what else we have here let's just put all our state um i'm just going to copy this for now and paste it down here just so that i can see it and then we'll just get rid of it so let's do mode answer uh number of enemies one val2 uh one and operator okay if this doesn't make sense right now we'll it will in a second and then we're going to say equals this dot state okay so now that we have all of these here every place where we say this dot state down below we can get rid of so it's it's going to clean things up a little bit all right so i'm just going to use the uh multiple cursors here there we go and get rid of them all yeah so now we don't have to keep typing the state uh and it definitely cleans things up a bit selected value language uh oh what did i do did i forget hmm was that really this state uh you know what this was probably left over from the example i copied and pasted and i just never never did anything so uh selected value for this um picker is always gonna equal the mode okay all right so let's save it and just go go over just to show that you know everything still works so subtraction multiplication division also looks like uh our our selector here our picker is not wide enough so we need to change the the width of that okay but other than that everything's still still working um see there we go uh yeah still working okay now what will happen is uh we can have styles for each mode and we'll put that down here right so we can have addition and let's just say um background color and we're gonna make them just super uh obvious for now background color green and we'll just copy this for each one and change it up subtraction subtraction uh multiplication and division and pink yellow and orange i'm trying to pick different colors than we already have on the screen for other things okay let's see if that worked oh actually multiplication doesn't work yellow let me uh don't tell me i misspelled this uh let me go case multiplication i'm gonna copy and paste this so that i don't even have to worry about spelling all right let's try multiplication there we go it must have been a misspelling and division that orange does not really look orange that's kind of weird maybe it's just my screen maybe it looks different for you actually i think it's my screen because on my other screen um i can see it and it looks way more orange on my other screen uh all right okay so that this is not like the prettiest thing in the world right now um but at least we can see like how it how it could work here um okay now i did think while i was doing that i thought actually this may not be the best way to do it because i can pretty much only change the background here right um so what i could do i could actually make separate um style sheets right so instead of uh just having caught styles we could have like we could have our regular cons styles right and then i could also have a const for addition styles subtraction styles right and then up here so i'm trying to find where we have this up here instead of styles dot root styles dot mode it would be like styles dot root but then we could have addition styles or whatever um dot root and this would be the thing what would change is the name the basically the mode right so i think that's a better way to go because then we could have uh styles for a lot of other stuff right um for our our heroes and our enemies right so i think that's a better way to go let me check my time see if you have enough time to get to do that yeah we have about seven minutes so um let's see it's just checking the um chat really quick to see uh if i'd done anything really crazy okay so let's do that let's let me first just copy everything here we're not going to change every single style here but for now actually before i copy everything four times um let me copy it one time then make the adjustments and then copy that one so we don't have to keep making adjustments so our input is unlikely to change so let's take that out for now our text size is unlikely to change same way with this is just a row container um we're going to keep our hero and enemy in there because those will probably change our container will be the same our battlefield i'm going to take that out for now but you know we may want to actually have some sort of like more intricate battlefield background right and then for this we're no longer going to need addition subtraction multiplication down here what we'll have then is just a background color all right on root and then here we would say edition right all right so we'll just take that out and now i'll just copy this one and let's change this to subtraction and give this the background color okay and this is going to be multiplication which i'm definitely going to copy and paste since evidently i can't spell that consistently and we're going to give it that uh yellow background which these are likely going to change at some point but um it'll give us a nice visual indicator at least for now and one more and that's division division and orange and then okay i think it's probably complaining that we haven't actually used these styles is defined objection actually that's really weird did i copy styles again i copied too many times yeah i did okay let me get rid of that one okay so let's see if this will work i know um my my linter is not going to like that i'm not using those but let's see if this works um so we're going to switch this up so it'll say um actually can i even do this i don't know if anybody caught that this might not work um rabbitworks asks why am i copying so much code just to change the background color well because we're we're going to change more than the background color so i just copied it to save us some typing later but essentially like all those elements i copied will change all of them but now that i did this now i'm not sure it'll work because it's gonna be mode yeah this is not gonna work all right i'll just try it but i'm pretty sure this isn't gonna work yep it's not going to work oops well i have a syntax error too so it's definitely not going to work all right yeah all right how can i do this all right so if you don't realize what i just did that that was uh i really wish i would have thought of before i just did all this other stuff um i i switched around so that basically the variable part would be here but that's that does not work you can't do that so i was trying to make it so that it would work for multiple things all right let me uh timer's up so let me set this let me go to the um to the chat here and we'll have to rethink i guess how we want to do this theme um let's see i just saw michael creole says can you do a switch yeah i'm wondering if um i'm wondering if we may end up doing some sort of switch all right let me scroll up so i can catch as many questions as i can during this this five minute time period here um let's see aag says which language you use uh javascript mostly it looks like some some other people have the same question so rjs how are you i'm i'm doing all right i think i'm getting sick but it's i don't think it's serious i think it'll just be like a cold or something like that um willie says hi there for coding being this advanced is it too late for me to start oh no no it's definitely not too late uh for you to start i'm not sure if you mean like to start following this stream in which case i'd say no it's not too late or like just to start learning to code like in general either way it's not too late john paul says think crazy ideas cool i'll try um we have a question i'm not sure how to pronounce your name so sorry but uh the question is will web dev die out uh i don't think it'll die out uh it it honestly seems like people are doing more things on the web than they ever have done right there are more complicated applications now for the web than at any point so uh and and think about the companies that are the biggest companies in the world are companies who do things on the web right uh facebook uh google amazon uh those are all webbased companies and their their revenue comes through the web so i do not think web dev will die out anytime soon um in fact i don't know if you all saw the announcement from google about stadia but google's has this big gaming thing now that's basically running through a web browser so i know that's like not exactly web dev but you know that the platform is the web uh willie says i was thinking about starting with html5 css javascript java and then some app coding and maybe games um willie yeah definitely start out with your html css javascript um and then you'll be able to do a ton of stuff with just that and you'll probably have a good idea about like what what you want to do you know after that uh let's see muhammad asks what am i doing here oh um i'm building a math game for kids so just something really simple right now we're just into like single digit math uh francis says this is quite impressive but i'm still a beginner will i catch up along the way yeah yeah you can catch up and and if you always if you want to you can check out the the previous recordings uh rabbitworks says um for the styling that we were just doing um put it in an array um and object for the color let's see um jason lima says what is there other than the web i think this is in regard to the you know will web dev die out says what is there other than web mobile desktop yeah i would say like that's it mobile and desktop you could say like in terms of programming like console gaming that's programming internet of things so i mean it's you could break it down but so many things are tied into the web now it's the lines between different types of development i i think are are getting really blurred because it seems like everything at some point ties into the web so maybe like traditional web dev of like hey i know html and css i can do web development that that is probably already dying or dead right most successful websites or web apps need more than that but web dev is now it's become more than it was it we have more capabilities on the web than we've had before so web dev is not going to die it's just it just adapts and takes on more capabilities all right um let me let me take a note of where we are in the chat and so i can go back to it and i'm gonna restart my pomodoro timer and let's try to do more okay so where we ended with our coding was i just broke it so what i did let me talk through what i did and what i was trying to do and let's see if we can figure out an answer here so what i would like to do is have completely different themes depending on the state so we're going to go off of this mode okay so the mode will switch between addition subtraction multiplication and division and then based on that i've created different themes down here or at least started to for each one of those for the addition subtraction multiplication division right and these are style sheets so these are essentially javascript objects so what i need to do then is switch them out however what i had hoped i could do and then realized i couldn't do was basically make this first part here so we're using you know javascript object and here it works because i can say styles.root so styles is an object but here what i'm trying to do is use the value of mode as the object so so mode itself is a string but what i wanted to refer to is the name of huh i wonder all right so what i need is some way and we can totally rethink everything but like at this point i need some way to designate um which style sheet i want to use here so we're going to keep styles always that'll be like our base styles and then we'll cut down these um themes to be as like small as possible and only change what uh what needs to be changed but i need some way to put that in there so let me see uh michael creo says uh put it in the existing switch uh or object literal okay yeah all right let's take a look at that switch statement and see what we could do there all right so right now we are hmm you know what how did i do this i did a theme so i could toggle a theme on a project recently let me open it on my other computer really quick it's i already have it open on my other computer so let me just check it so let's see i in my other project i used like a theme.js file oh okay i see what i did okay this is uh this might work um all right let me run this by you and see what if we take these themes and instead of using um like stylesheet.create here which normally i would definitely recommend we just make them like straight objects right um and then we say like basically we just put the values in here so let me do it with um addition first just to show you what i mean and uh see if if that could work so actually think will that work do this all right yeah let me each all right so let's let's do this what if we did themes so we'll have this this themes object right within the themes object we'll have one called edition um and then within addition we could say like background color um and we could again we'll call it green okay and let's just we'll make two just so we could switch and we'll make one called um subtraction i believe subtraction was pink okay so we have addition and subtraction um and then and then we can have uh let's say active theme is going to be is going to equal let's actually let's switch that up oops and i messed this up already background background color there we go i knew that did not look right okay so we have that here now in here we'll make a let's say we'll say active theme is going to equal theme and that's where we'll put mode right that says seam is not defined what theme is defined didn't i define it down here oh themes okay so our active theme is themes.mode now in here we can say background background color equals um let's see active theme dot let's see background background color right i think that'll work okay all right let's see if that works if it works then i'll explain more about why it works okay let's try subtraction now yay and these ones won't work right because we don't have anything for them yet okay all right so this works so basically what we've what we've done then is um active theme is equal to whatever theme name is equal to the mode right which is addition subtraction multiplication division right so then we can just use active theme in here so we don't we don't ever have to worry about well what's the mode down here because we've already set what the active theme is so then down here we could add as many different things as we want like as many different attributes oops not there here right and and we will we'll add i'm sure we'll add different colors for various things but then that way that gives us a really easy way to switch themes so and now uh we can actually get rid of a lot of a lot of what we've done let me get rid of them up here too because we had um actually if i just copy these this should work yeah so let's copy that and multiplication nice all right so that'll work let's do a little bit of cleanup here okay cool so now we have our all our base styles here and then we can override any of those from here and we'll just verify that that works so everything should work awesome cool so now we have colors maybe not the the prettiest of colors but for a target audience for kids this this might actually be fun right i don't really know maybe i'll have to look at some color theory for children if i before like we really decide on what the colors should be um but for now this this is okay um probably the only other thing that i'd want to do right now is change the colors of uh like the enemies maybe um in terms of usability i i guess like the most pressing thing would just be this needs to be wider so let's make that wider so that the entire thing is visible um i don't know what it is right now let's see so that's our our picker and i don't think we have any styles for that yet um oh okay so we do we have a width set to 100 uh let's see if like 150 would work i think 150 will work see how that looks yeah for sure that works it looks a little awkward but at least that fits for all of them uh also it looks like a little bit tall i mean i want the inputs to be nice and big so that it's easy for kids to use like a touch screen but i think we can maybe go with like 40 for the height and see how that looks oops didn't mean to hit that key okay all right there we go 40 looks better all right that's good and i do have this text this battle math text let's give this a style uh style equals sorry about my typing uh i just i only use this keyboard pretty much when i do these streams twice a week and sometimes not even then so um it's totally different from like the normal macbook ebook that i use keyboard that i use so it definitely messes up my typing let's just call this title so we'll have styles.title um we want our title to be bigger so we're going to put this just in our our normal styles uh so we want font size to be um let's try 24 pixels and see how that looks and then we'll have to figure out like what kind of font family we want to font family let's go comic sans i wonder if that's like if that's will work by default nope failing to compile what did i do oops i didn't put a comma let's just have fun we'll put comic sans in there i know comic sans usually awful oh no it won't work uh yeah maybe i'll have to look up what it is um let's see uh there we go web safe fonts okay comic sans ms okay so let's try that actually that's why we're here let's just see if there's another one that i like better let's go with this i just want something that looks like you know kid kid friendly right i don't really want to go with comic sans like um as my final solution here oops all right i'm just gonna use uh back ticks that way this won't matter i could have used single quotes too but um my hand just hit the back tick first there we go okay so here's our our comic sans um i definitely want a little bit more padding between uh the top of this and the bottom of that i don't know just let's see i don't know that still looks really like large what is my am i zooming in on this i am wow okay for some reason i was super zoomed in on this so now this makes a lot more sense as to why everything looked huge so let me let me check my zoom level all right so this is the real level of zoom all right i think we have some work to do uh because now this is a totally different story all right so we got seven minutes let's try to increase a lot of of what we've been doing here okay i would like to take this these styles for the picker and move them down okay so um let's copy these and we'll actually cut them and we'll go we'll say styles.picker okay and i'm gonna uh switch this so that it's actually oops let's make it 60 and let's make the title 32 and let's make these um actually let's let's do this let's make let's make a character um style and that's where we'll put our width and height so that way we don't have to change them both all the time and i'm going to switch them up and let's give them a double the width and the height that they have right now see how that looks um and then the math text hmm all right let's let's try that out with uh 26. maybe let's bump that up to 28 for now i know it's not a lot but we'll see how it looks uh we also need to add um on our hero and enemies where are we at with those there we are styles.hero so we'll add here is styles dot character and we'll do the same thing for our enemies okay all right now let's let's see what that looks like okay not bad i made made things a little bit bigger hmm that's weird it's not it's not letting me change this there we go now that we have all the space hmm interesting okay we have about three minutes left before we go to the questions um if anybody has any suggestions now that i finally realized that i had this zoomed in a lot um let me know i'm thinking i could definitely do with some more padding like top and bottom padding let's see so we could do padding vertical and say something like um just do like 16 uh pixels for now 16 units uh react native is basically unitless okay it just felt a little tight up here and down here and we do have like so we're using flexbox so like right now this container is supposed to take up all the space that's left left over after this container and this container does do their things so what i could do is maybe make this container bigger do i not have this in an actual container interesting okay um yeah so let's say it would come up to like here and i can have this stuff come up here it just seems too far down right now you know i would kind of like to have better looking the picker's okay i maybe would like to have better looking input so i do want to look into that as well to see like um maybe there's better styled inputs that we could bring in all right what do you think let me know um berto says just think if this was for atari you would be almost completely done actually that would be kind of cool what if what if we made a um like a react native uh plugin that lets you have atari as a target like you could design it in with react native but it it compiled down to be able to play on an atari that would actu that would be really cool i have no idea what it would take but there's a guy i work with that um that used to write programs for the atari i don't know if he still does but he would know what it would take to do that all right so let me i don't really have enough time left on my pomodoro timer to do anything so let's just go right to the questions here i'm going to scroll up to where we left off um actually let me um let me commit this stuff oops okay let's do it get commit a.m so we're gonna oops we're gonna add and commit at the same time let's say we're adding a new feature and we'll say we add themes for each mode okay so we didn't add full themes but i mean that's basically what we did so let's commit that and push it okay since it's just me working on this right now and it's a small like side project i'm committing straight to master normally if you're working on like open source or a project with a team you would want to do every change on a separate branch and then submit a pull request but for your own projects i mean it's fine to do it like this once you actually launch you probably don't want to have like your master branch the one you work on all the time you want to work on maybe a dev branch all right um lubomir uh says hey why did you choose react over ujs in one sentence one sentence i know react but i don't know view okay if you want a better explanation than that let me know let's see a monster challenge all right pub g skilled okay i think i think there's a conversation going on between people in the chat so i'm gonna skip through some of those um lucas says view or react um i've heard good things about vue but i've never used it i work with react all the time so that's definitely my my goto if i need to build something but i have nothing against you okay let's see all right okay uh there's a question about where did this program where you where is the execute this program i'm not 100 sure what you're asking uh but it looks like um rabbitworks was trying to answer and say it's a react native app so native mobile app um or webview inside that app so yeah when we do go mobile it won't be a webview or it will actually like make it a real native native app so um we could also use electron uh or something like electron to make it a desktop app so right now what i'm thinking is uh web app will be first and then we'll work on android and ios and we might do electron just to give an example of how to do electron i just don't really see like considering the target audience i think they're way more likely to access it on like their parents phones as an app or on on a computer just as a website uh but i mean i could see like maybe some parents aren't comfortable letting their children on the web unsupervised which is definitely a bad idea so like potentially if they didn't have a lot of time to supervise they could just like turn off the internet but if they had downloaded the the desktop app version it would still work so i think there's uh there's probably value in that actually there's a way to do windows 10 apps too now from react native so we might try that because i'm interested to see how that works i've never i've never seen it done yet and i've never done it so that's another option julian says the yellow kind of hurts my eyes yeah it yeah definitely not set on these colors yet no face says it looks terrible again yeah they were just whatever colors i thought of while i was typing it out um rexxon ma says i'm doing android development now uh which keyboard do you normally or i'm sorry i struggle with those tags and attributes okay yeah i guess i'm not sure are you talking about the uh like the jsx syntax and stuff like that yeah if you're not used to that then i could i could definitely see is that being a little difficult um dark dark on these i'm not sure how to pronounce that says which keyboard do you normally use the macbook one yeah so i normally just use the so i have two macbooks uh my work is uh like a brand new macbook pro and then i have a 2015 macbook pro um that's my personal one so i use those keyboards most they are a little different but they're they're similar enough that there's usually not too much of a difference but then like for my pc i have this keyboard um which uh like the the distance that you have to travel like to click a key is significantly more than on like the very low profile macbook pro keyboards so it it kind of messes me up um and then like the there's obvious differences between the desktop and the mac keyboard that it's just like extra stuff that i have to think about that kind of throws me off uh so i'm kind of thinking about getting a different keyboard anyway this is just the one that came with my computer um but i i'm in the process of buying a house so i'm going to move soon so i don't want to buy anything now because i'll just have to pack it up and move it and within the next month so maybe maybe after i get all moved in and stuff i could think about getting a new keyboard that may be more kind of comfortable um rex on moss says is this recap um uh we were recapping i guess so no oh and it looks like rexxon ma was was pretty bored because i got a little sleeping emoji and a walking emoji so i guess that meant it was boring so they are walking away so apologies for that rexxon or rexion maybe next time it'll be a little bit less less boring for you all right so edwin asks so vs code over sublime why um i don't know if it's still like this but the last time i checked sublime code costs money is that true um maybe i'm mistaken uh visual studio code is free and also i may be mistaken but sublime i thought was a mac only program but vs code is crossplatform so those are my main reasons for using vs code instead of sublime if i'm mistaken about those though please let me know i probably won't switch because i'm used to this but for somebody just starting out trying to figure out sublime might be a good option as well um do you have some video about python uh no i don't have any videos about python but there are probably python videos on this channel on the free codecamp youtube channel edwin says thanks for doing this by the way you're welcome thanks for watching um dpi gaming says what game are you making uh it's a game called battle math i i played it um i played it on a white board with my son when he was first learning math problems and so i'm trying to make a an actual like computer game version of it so it's just a game where you play you do math problems if you get them right you defeat an enemy if you get them wrong more enemies show up uh dpi gaming says show please all right let me go over to uh to the actual game so here's here's the game um and i'm gonna zoom in again i need to remember to zoom back out but so here's the game you type your answer here you can change the mode right so pretty pretty straightforward for now i definitely am interested in having better graphics and themes here abdullah says what's your name my name is jesse sorry if i'm mispronouncing your name let me know how it's supposed to be pronounced says the corsair mechanical keyboards are nice you know what i've i've tried those out in a store and i did really like them so they're on my list of potential uh keyboards kim perks says i have to go thank you for this video i'll be watching the next one oh awesome uh thanks for watching um i have a question have you ever gone to a server farm in person i have not but that would be cool to see abdullah says where are you from and where are you shifting to where are you moving to um i'm originally from west virginia in the united states um i live in ohio right now and i'm going to stay in ohio so i'm going to stay in the same city of stevenville ohio i'm just moving right now i'm kind of like outside the city limit so i'm going to move like closer into town basically it's just a bigger house when i bought this house i only had one kid and it was perfect now i have four kids and they're getting bigger and it's kind of tight it just seems like there's not a lot of space for anything so this would be a bigger house right now i'm just in the corner of a basement with tablecloths hanging instead of walls um so i should be able to make like a proper office there for a while just be in a basement but eventually i'd like to get walls put up and everything and so um should be it should be nice for the for the family no face says sublime has bugs i use atom no face says sublime text they used on windows okay and sava says sublime is okay anselmo okay so evidently i am totally mistaken and sublime is available on windows and linux um was it not at one time or am i just completely off here um jubal rawls says i use notepad plus plus vs code and atom atom is slow but i try to avoid microsoft now that they bought github um yeah i i used to use atom a lot and i did notice that atom is slower than than vs code other than that i love adam um junior says i use sublime with windows 7 and with javascript enhancement plugin it's cool like ide sublime uh lambo of environment okay so evidently sublime is is better than i thought so apologies um maybe sublime is is definitely more versatile okay var uh diovoli says uh west virginia um it's beautiful yeah it is for sure um if you don't know about west virginia it's one of the poorest states in the united states but it's also one of the most beautiful over 70 percent of the land area is is forest so there's a lot of great like mountains trees um like rivers and streams people go white water rafting and skiing and great if you are really into the outdoors and camping and hiking awesome state for that if you're really into like big cities and things like that it's not a good place for you none of the cities here are big we have no professional sports teams so like um it's uh it's definitely different than a lot of the other states but it does get made fun of because um we're very poor spit state uh so it's it gets made fun of a lot but it's definitely beautiful um michael creole said did doing this help you get your new job um doing doing what sorry michael i'm not sure what you're referring to so do doing what help you get your new job um varsas i started using sublime in linux environment around 2014ish wow all right evidently i i have no idea what i'm talking about in regard to sublime so i'm i definitely how did i not know this jason says probably the last place to be touched by cyberpunk how yeah if you're referring to west virginia then yeah i'd say so west virginia is like if if like everything goes like terrible right and like there's some type of apocalypse and the cities are destroyed like west virginia is the place that will change the least right people will probably be living in the hills of west virginia and their life will barely change right so um it's not that's kind of life's not for everybody but if you're into that it's it's a great place for it uh sava says vs code is awesome i don't know why people wouldn't use it yeah i i really like vs code but i mean there are really good options out there so uh it's definitely not the only or maybe even not the best option oh michael says doing the live streams and helping other people yeah doing the live streams and like the conference talks and stuff was huge for me trying to find a job so like a couple months ago i had a big job search and went on a bunch of interviews and uh if you're interested in that check out my youtube channel i have a couple of videos about it um the links in the in the description uh in this video um i go over a lot of what what happened and what helped and what didn't help in my job search but yeah definitely i got asked in my interviews a lot about uh about this actually speaking of that i'm gonna have to end this stream in in just a minute here and do my job let's see all right just a few more questions my voice is starting to go too all right michael says uh let me introduce you to my mississippi yeah i guess mississippi is probably pretty comparable to west virginia it's a little warmer in mississippi but in terms of like economic status and stuff it's it's comparable oh wow phoenix says the free code camp watermark is over your face can you change the frame position i never knew that is it is it like that for everybody let me know i mean yeah i can definitely change it um smmq says i'm a beginner uh how or how do i start uh go to freecodecamp.org and sign up there and do their free lessons that's a great place to start um jason lima says boot camp or computer science degree if you could pick one if i had a scholarship and i could go to school for free or for very inexpensive and not have to take out loans i would do a cs degree like assuming i didn't let's say like i didn't have a family or anything like it was just on my own then i'd do cs degree if i had to pay fully for that school forget it i'd never i'd never get a regular degree um and i would go with a boot camp the loans are just so so crazy okay um michael cruz says okay so the watermark is on the youtube site but not on the roku app okay all right i'm gonna have to to finish up here because i gotta um log into my work computer and get started um at my my software engineering job uh but it was awesome um talking with you all i think we had a really good q a we we got some uh really nice ugly themes going here so uh we'll we'll fix that um if you all have suggestions for themes you know definitely send them my way um otherwise you know hopefully i'll i'll get some inspiration for themes before uh friday uh the next stream so i hope to do another stream friday morning and uh if you can make it there it'll probably be at the same time it's 8 am eastern time all right thanks again so much for watching and until next time have a great day
