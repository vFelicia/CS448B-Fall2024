hey everybody its Jesse and I'm back after being sick most of the week still not a hundred percent so today's stream will probably be shorter than normal I'm thinking like maybe an hour or less I'm gonna do my best my throat hurts a bit so I do have some tea here so if you hear a slurping noise that's me sipping my tea and I'm pretty tired so this may be equal more of a relaxed type of stream today but I guess I'm gonna start out by going over some of the pool requests that I got quickly and then we'll see I left off working on getting a logo and the title to look right so it just needs a little bit more adjustment and then I think it'll be okay so maybe we'll finish that up and see how much time we have left also I want to say thank you to everyone a lot of you either on Twitter or in the slack channel said let me know you were concerned or you're praying for me everything so I really appreciate that I was really I mean oh that was nice I wasn't feeling well and to see all that support from all of you that was that was really cool so I appreciate that and also some really awesome news the freaka camp channel now has over two hundred thousand subscribers so really excited about that that was cool I've been keeping an eye on it lately me because it was getting close to 2000 and I was just waiting for it and it it happened at some point while I was sick I just noticed that yesterday but that's really cool so thank you to everyone who who's subscribed I feel kind of proud that maybe I've contributed a bit with my with my live streams to subscribers and there's a lot of other great people that do the do videos on this channel as well and they're responsible for for most of those subscribers but that's really cool that's that's a lot of people so hopefully we keep growing because I think this channel has a lot of really great information to help people learn how to code so the more people that know about it the better off they'll be alright hey everyone I see I see some of you in the live chat now cool thanks thanks yes John John said you live streams rock thanks thanks thanks Blake I appreciate I appreciate everybody's in saying hi hey how's it goin all right so let's I'm gonna try really hard to stay focused so I guess I'm pretty I'm pretty tired hopefully the caffeine in this tea will help help me wake up a bit more as well alright so there were a lot of changes and we had to pull requests that I think we only had to yeah I don't I don't think I pulled any in while I was at home I was kind of out of it so I tried not to do that much coding so I didn't mess anything up I did work on a project for my react course which I didn't really get that much accomplished on redux is confusing me quite a bit right now I'm sure I'll get it I think keep working on it but anyway Nathaniel submitted one pull request and he added added to the get ignore which is awesome and very useful so thank you for that and then I guess the next pull request is really huge so I'm not really gonna go over it all because it would be so much I guess I just kind of really briefly summarized some of what was in it and you can check it out I'm double check on my other screen with the number of that pull request was I'm pretty sure it was 50 yeah so poor requests 50 is quite large so just from from memory I'm going to try to sum this up sorry if I miss anything and this is from Matt a lot of the data so basic strategies are less now so there's more components so you have a few more components now we have all these data files also another change is matt has switched out the regular map for lodash this map and he links you could check it out in the in the pool request he provides a link to comparison as to which one's faster which is cool the only thing I'm I just noticed I didn't notice this when I was pulling this in and I just noticed it a few minutes ago was it looks like we're in forwarding all of lodash and so it might be better since we're only using as far as I can tell yep in this component we're only using we could probably just import map I mean that's like a really really small if you look at the low github repo to import map it's I don't know like the entire file is like less than 50 lines and 80% of it or it's just comments explaining what it does so it'd be really small amount of code to import instead of everything so I'll probably change that at some point if somebody really wants to get a pull request and on your github profile maybe you know you just starting out that would be something really easy just look up how to on low this documentation how to just import that switch it over I think it's not just map though I think filter is also replaced where we are using it so we're not are we using it here we're not using it here but anywhere we're using filter then filter will need to be pulled in as well so maybe I'll if I remember maybe I'll open up a an issue kind of explaining that and then that way you all can let me know what you think about it as well okay so let me show you what I've done so I I did make sure to update the repo before before I started the stream so everything should be uptodate on github I I think I may have forgotten to update the repo at the end of Monday stream so sorry about that if I did I guess I could scroll back up through my terminal to doublecheck but anyway this basically I was just working on this this is where we left off before so you could see I right now I have resource center over here to the right we now have this menu icon is visible and working and then our logo is here the only thing that needs changes when I move this over here for some reason it just made the header a lot taller than it needs to be so I'd like to shrink this up a little bit move everything up and then I think it'll be I think it'll look all right I'm not I really like this I like I like the logo I think that looks nice I'm not exactly sure what to do with this so that's why I just put it over here and in any case we'll have to figure out what to do on a small screen because you know that's that's not what we want so still have some things to decide but I think this looks it looks good enough at this point fine you know if we have time we can always adjust that more later on okay oh cool I just checked the live chat really quickly and it looks like Matt Matt your MFC 88 right I'm pretty sure you are sorry if I'm forgetting things I am out of it I'm usually pretty good about remembering what everybody's handles are in YouTube then anyway Matt offered to help with redux Thanks oh okay cool oh I may be asking you a question i yes i really like i read through so much documentation on I think Tuesday when I was I I just sat in a recliner with my laptop and like took naps and read Redux documentation pretty much all day so yes I'll be asking about that and thanks for offering to help Sebastian set us I should add some margin left to poster resources and poster okay yep yeah I should probably have this line up on all the pages with this I'm not sure why it's not lining up right now after look I probably just don't have it within the same container or something okay so first let's get this let's get this to a point where we like how it looks and then we'll go from there so since this was when I added this that's when this got a lot taller then I'm gonna start by looking here to see what's going on with the the margins and padding and it's probably something to do with with padding let me make this a bit smaller and should be able to see as I hover over will be able to see the margins and in orange okay so we definitely have some more margin that we need going on okay and our div also has just some default default margin so I guess we could actually I think that divs autogenerated so it's gonna be a bit more difficult to get to this div so let's just worry about the h1 when I when I say autogenerated I mean this div is added in and in one of the material I components so I don't really have direct access to it cuz I don't I don't want to edit the components directly so tojust and there's no unique identifier here so it'll be a lot easier just to try to adjust this h1 which I'm passing in this h1 so I can put styles right on that it's the only h1 on the page so I can even reference that right in the sass file and I know it'll just it will apply here yeah so let's just try to get rid of all the margin and see if we'll see what it looks like okay so with margin zero that's not terrible it looks like it's not it's not exactly centered though it's a yes so I'm checking this out I'm not sure why why this div is bigger okay yes it doesn't matter if we add now I may have to actually edit this div let's see let's just shut it let's add a bit of margin on the top I want to see if it would basically what I want to happen is to push this down without making the header bigger what I think might happen is the header will just get pushed down hopefully not but we'll give it a shot oh nice awesome so cool I don't really like trying to eyeball this and just guess at it being centered I could I could probably do some math and get it a little bit closer but that that looks about right we can zoom in a bit maybe so not letting me zoom in that's weird well for some reason I can't zoom you know normally you could if you have a Mac you know you could zoom in with the track that can't do it okay well at least that that works though so if we go with margin when we end up with five okay five pics back let me do it let me do it in the code I think we had it a nap yeah so I already have some styles on that h1 so let's go with margin and five for the top top right bottom left all right awesome okay so yeah I'm still not 100% sure about this being over here but we'll go for it for now another I guess an alternative that I have seen is we probably have to really change how this this bar works and maybe make our own component but you can have so like the menu can still stay out out here on the side but the logo and the title would be within these bounds of the container so the maximum you know there's there's a max width here I can't remember what it is maybe 2000 pixels so they would stay here within those bounds that might look better yeah this looks at the very least it needs a bit more margin I think which let's add that in well what we have this up that's add 8 pixels let's see all right that's better at least it doesn't get covered up okay not bad then I check the live chat quickly just to see what you all think okay John makes a good point well several good points I'm gonna read one of them out it says because you're using the font size control on with the width of the screen that margin might align differently at different widths I actually I don't think I'm using it for this one so let me let me make sure unless you were talking about this one instead which I think I am using that I guess responsive font for that one and I actually on this page I do have this aligned so probably earlier Sebastian had mentioned that this heading was kind of outside the bounds of where all the rest of the content was on another page something on posters so you can see that here so I'm I'm almost positive now that I saw the other page is it's just a matter of where I put this H SH of whether or not I put it inside the same container so that'll be an easy fix okay well let's let's commit this and then move on we still have just have a good amount of time left or not even a half hour in so move on to something else and was my it is check it out what did we change posters yep that's what I wanted to change and see I don't know what I changed him posters touch ass oh you know what I changed some was it I changed something earlier right before I started the stream and I hadn't committed that yet so that's what it is we're gonna commit this we're going to use am flag so that we can commit and add and put a message at the same time so let's say just title margins yeah that works all right great pass all the tests made it through linting so now we can get mastered all right awesome so now but let's let's go and since since Sebastian brought it up let's fix this so if anyone has any objections to this being aligned here if for some reason you think it looks better being a few pixels to the left let me know quickly before I start changing it otherwise I'm going to proceed with adjusting it where wherever this is this problem is found mmm yeah it looks like Sebastian you're you're absolutely right that's what I was just checking out as well the h2 should be inside a column and then it will give everything the the correct alignment let's see just put this in a column actually I I usually do try to put things in columns because I have had problems with this before with similar issues I guess I just was I don't know what I was thinking there maybe I was just trying to go quickly and just get something on a page that's probably probably would happen Wow I am really and I want to start off okay oh man I can't even copy and paste today there we go all right awesome so it fixes that so just go through quickly and see if it's doing that on any other pages let's check out huh yep it's doing it on home so let's see all right logos hmm okay planning guide okay okay well I'm trying to look this is this component is really different than it was before the last pull request so kind of figure out where everything is anything guidelines all right all right great and already have an English only one more page it's a glossary page this I'm not sure I'm just gonna check that page yep it's not all right awesome okay so that should be all the pages so now we have consistency there so thanks for bringing that up Sebastian I do have a question in the live chat so I'm just going to take this question right now since I forgot to set my timer right now it would be if I had set my timer at the beginning it would be right about the time where I'd take my 5 minutes to look at the live chat so I'm gonna do that so how what says I'm starting college this year and want to get into programming I just started practicing yesterday on free code camp so I'm excited to see where I go with this Oh awesome sorry I thought it was a question I didn't read the whole thing first anyway that's that's really cool my my wife actually just started free code camp within the last week or so she's going to try to do the hundred days of code and it's kind of cool it's my wife was not released my wife's an English professor so not really into coding before but it's kind of cool to be able to go through and and help her out with some of the exercises so so she's going through the same thing you just starting out with it so I hope you stick with it and let me know if you if you need any help or encouragement with anything all right I don't think there's any other questions I'm going to scroll through quickly digital dolly game says free code camp needs to make csharp tutorials I don't know if there's any plans to do any csharp tutorials if it happens it's not going to be me because I have very limited experience with she C sharp so you can't can't really give you a much hope of that right now not there's no snow plans that I know of that maybe somebody's working on it and I just don't know oh cool Alberto says that he started recording some some coding sessions in csharp he's not not comfortable about releasing it yet Umberto's especially since I'm nowhere near the quality of Jessi dev tips traversing media and all the other already established face so I'm bear to the fact that you mentioned me in the same sentence as dev tips makes me just super happy because I because I love the deficits show and yeah so if I'm like if in your mind I'm anywhere close to to that caliber of show then that's a really big compliment for me so I appreciate that and also I would say I mean don't worry so much about whether or not something's ready to be released hmm sorry yawning getting really tired yeah don't worry so much about whether you're ready if you know I like I don't know when I started I didn't really practice if anybody goes like to my my own channel my personal channel and watch this on my first streams they're not good I couldn't get the settings right and so the quality's bad so yeah it's and I think for some of the videos that the font was so small you couldn't even see it at all so sometimes you figure that out and yeah I mean I guess I kind of feel bad if people try to go back and watch that watch those first videos the quality is bad but you know like really quickly you catch on so anyway I think it's just cool it's more encouragement if you actually have the stuff out there and you can get feedback from people and encouragement from those people then you'll be more likely to stick with it I know if I had just like recorded my my stuff and watched it myself before I actually put it out there I probably would have been too selfconscious about it to actually post it but instead just on the live stream it it doesn't give me a chance to secondguess myself because it's already out there which in my case ends up being a good thing because then I get my stuff out there and in it otherwise wouldn't be oh okay really quickly I'm going to address this I just saw some of the conversation that was happening when I was answering things previewed that were up near the top of the live chat someone trying to fun whoo chaos 2 is using next Jas with create react which I've never heard of that well yeah I would say so Sebastian said check the previous project yes if you check out the previous project that was with next jazz so yeah I've actually never heard of anyone using both before I would imagine that it there's there's probably an easier way to do that you would only really need to use one or the other depending on what you need Patrick says the difference between you and dev tips is that he edits out periods where he is stuck yeah I wonder how long my streams would really be if I edit it out all the times I messed up I would have five minute videos Umberto's says I just don't want to get bad information I want to be able to do the thing where I stress that this is it's just I am showing how to do it but it's difficult to do when I feel like there's a better correct way to do things yeah I'm Bert oh I am I definitely understand that I feel the same way too I I do really want to show so I I there are a lot of times when there's not necessarily a correct way but there are some ways that maybe better than others it depends on what your goal is in your particular requirements for that project but I I definitely understand that and I I feel bad if I say something that I later find out was not the right way to do things and so I do try to mention that but I I realized that you know not everybody watches every minute of every stream so there are going to be people who probably watch something in an earlier stream and never realize that I've corrected it later on and at this point there's just so many streams it would be really hard to go back and correct everything so I totally understand that but I think like you say if you just give I mean I frequently give the disclaimer that you know this is just me doing this you know the best way I know how with with all you help from all of you you know if people understand that coming in that that's that that's what's going on here then I may I feel better about it at least you know I don't I don't claim that this is a tutorial you know so anyway but totally up to you certainly if you feel comfortable or not but it would be cool you know to see them so let me know when you when you do release them I'd like to check them out I said not really into doing anything with csharp but we do run some things with csharp here at the University I don't work on them but it'd be cool to know a little bit more about them just to understand how things how things work because occasionally I do have to help like like right now we're we're down one developer in the department that works on the csharp stuff so I have to help occasionally if something is like an emergency and really needs done alright so let's a sh says hey can we ask questions if we don't understand something yes definitely yeah so I'm gonna do some more coding but before I end I'm gonna go back through and see if there's any questions and and I'll answer them all before I finish the stream so let's do some more I'm not let's see how about I could for about ten more minutes and then I do questions and then that way I'll be I'll be finished in about an hour which I just don't want to push it cuz I don't want to lose my voice and I'm getting tired so I think the quality of my coding is going to go down quickly I can already feel it's like it's hard to focus all right I guess I should figure out what I'm gonna change first see that talking about that focus he difficult all right let me think of something that I can get done in ten minutes I guess I could check my shell award I guess that's done I'll doublecheck it I'll put it here actually let's let's work on this because I think this is really interesting and I've never tried this before and I have no idea if I can get it done in ten minutes but I'd like to just check it out so we before we had we set up our file upload and it's giving us a list and it was someone maybe Sebastian had had got this working and I think he was the one that suggested this I'm not 100% sure so sorry if I'm giving credit to the wrong person but let me show you what we're talking about so in our upload files lists you upload a few okay so we have I guess I need more that's a lot of them ok so right now it gets cut off and you can't see the rest right you can't do anything about it so it'd be cool to scroll normally I'm not a huge fan of horizontal scrolling but in this case it makes sense it makes more sense I think than having them wrapped because that would just mess up the spacing too so let's try to do a horizontal scroll hopefully this is as simple as just setting the overflow and if that's the case we can definitely get this done so let's see there we go but hmmm let's shout out overflow no she's not working I I doubt it would work to put it on here but let's let's try it actually we did have the overflowhidden no no it's not working and not really anything else I could do about that huh okay so this is just a text input and the only it's only job is just to hold these values right now so what if we made it a multiline text input it might wrap then right so it would be what a text area instead of an input let's uh let's try that I'm not sure about it like I said because that might end up changing the spacing but if I can't get the horizontal scroll then that's the next best thing I'll have to make sure see class file path hopefully everything is referencing this class name so that if I keep the same class name it should still work but yes there's one way to find out let's just do it much use that service requests okay so yeah there's a lot to this okay here's our file upload and there we go here's our input okay oops textarea and do we need a type on the tech series and I think we do see oh goodness well that that looks really ugly I'm not worried about that right now I'm just kind of worried about if it works what we'll need to do is is use the material UI excuse me let me tear you eye component for this instead of just changing its a text area some files hmm all right well that of course is not what we want but what should happen though if we're using this type of text arias it should expand so I'm hoping that we'll get it to expand like that let's see oops let's go back and text field okay I'm just gonna copy this and remove what we don't need let's get rid of this okay Suter looks like not dopes I never removed this one okay need some adjustment but doesn't look that bad so far yay all right that's so much better all right I like that I like that and I'm not super worried about the spacing like I thought I would be basically because the odds of some of the uploading this many files are slim so not that many people will even see it but even then it doesn't look terrible below is a whole new section so it would look a lot it would look weird if let's say it was right in the middle of here where you do have a uniform spacing and then all of a sudden it would change but because this space here only happens once it doesn't really seem like it's messed up now what I would like to do is make in relation to this upload button have this aligned a little bit better at the very least I want to have the top of this lined up with the top of this button probably best thing would be to have it centered but not bad and that works and I think do you need to doublecheck where else am i I don't think I'm that will affect anything else I was just kind of wondering about when I get all the values to send out in the email and send our project management system well I think it should be fine because it's the same eating the value from a text area and from an input field is the same as opposed to like getting a checkbox value or something okay that's cool I like that my timer went off so I'm gonna answer some questions now and off probably before I leave today I'll clean this up a bit and then commit that as well as I don't think I committed this yet where we lined up all of these up so I'll do that too and then that way everything on github will be up to date okay ash asks are there any repos of these projects on github or bitbucket I want to compare with my code to see if I'm doing something wrong and Joseph did say look in the description yeah so if if you want to follow along this is on github I do have the links in the descriptions to all the videos so feel free to check it out use it I have a few people who let me know that they're using what I'm doing on this project or the last project as the basis for one of their projects and I think that's awesome so yeah so feel free and okay Sebastian I mentioned early I thought it was Sebastian that had had done the the upload thing maybe it's not maybe it was Kevin yeah it was really early on it was a while ago so I can't remember exactly but we'll say keV I don't think Kevin's in the live chat now so we'll just say it was Kevin he can't he can't let us know I think Kevin hasn't been around the live set for a while he's working on his own project and he sent me a message a few days ago telling me about it so it's cool hopefully he'll get it to the point where he can share that and if he lets me maybe I can share a link with you all let's see like we have some more question here we go ash ash hey just by the way Jesse what's your coding background like did you go to uni or are you selftaught so yeah I do have a bachelor's degree but it's in business so I I took I did complete one C++ programming course but so that's the extent of my formal education maybe I did take a class in high school where we spent a couple weeks on basic HTML but I don't know that that really counts but other than that it's just been all online and mostly free resources I think I spent maybe $30 on udemy courses and until very recently until a few months ago when I signed up for the react nano degree like I literally had spent 30 dollars or less on courses the entire time that I've been doing this so big you know years I had spent that so which I I say that because it's it's really I think it's a really cool thing about this industry that someone with very little in terms of financial resources can learn enough and get a job doing this which I think that's awesome because so many other fields are like it's just hard to break into unless you're already wealthy because the cost to get in you know I'm thinking like if you want to be a doctor or a lawyer unless you want to go into a lot of debt you just you can't you can't do it you know you need me need so much money to be able to go go to school for that many years to get that the education you need so anyway I did give a also on my channel there's a link in the description that I think there's a link in the description to my channel otherwise you can just look up Jesse Weigel and it should come up on YouTube search but I did a video kind of going through my history of learning to be a frontend developer so if you want to know more check that out it's not it's not super long I think it's like 10 minutes so it's not really indepth but it'll give you kind of a nice overview of where I came from and how I got to where I am now ooh ooh Paul says business decoding so good that's pretty great yeah actually I don't I don't think I said this on a stream before or in my video but I guess I'll take the last minute here just to say this it may it may be helpful to somebody so when I was a teenager I had thought about doing coding I was always really good with computers and a lot of people said you know why don't you do computers I have an uncle who's a programmer and you know he would talk to me about it and I had decided I didn't want to do computers because I thought if I did computers I would just be stuck in a cubicle all day and I wouldn't get to talk to anybody and that would be my life I if you've ever seen the first Matrix movie where the main character that's literally he has this tiny little cubicle and he just types on his keyboard all day and it's it's terrible so that's the idea I had in my mind of what I would do and I said no like I don't really want to do that now hopefully probably some of you were laughing when you hear that because that's not at all what this is right so I had a mistaken view of what what this was all about and I probably would have been in this a lot earlier had I had I had a better view of things you know I mean now it seems were crazy because now you have like it's well known that Google's offices are really cool and you know I don't know things have changed I think in terms of the perception of what what coding is but you know at least when I was a teenager it wasn't like that so anyway so that's why I ended up going into business and because but I really was kind of into coding and they thought about it earlier so it's kind of cool that I ended up back here in the end and although I am actually sitting in an office by myself right now I'm talking to all of you so it's not like I'm somehow chained to a cubicle or anything like that anyway so I guess the the moral of my story if there is one is especially for those of you maybe who are younger this would be more helpful but don't don't dismiss something some you know a job or anything that you have interest in you know without really checking it out you know so like see if you can get an internship or like shadow somebody who does that job you know to really find out what it's like because now that I'm doing this I love it and it would have been really cool if I could have been doing this then you know some of the other jobs that I've had if nothing so great so I would have much rather done this then then the other things that I've done so anyway I think that's I've got all the questions so I'm gonna wrap things up and probably get out of here early and go take a nap I guess if mike my kids let me feel I was thinking that but oh well it's already Friday I was gonna say I'll see you tomorrow but it's it's Friday the whole week's been messed up for me I'm really thinking about it now it is Friday right yeah I just checked my calendar okay uhhuh so I will see you all on Monday and have a great weekend hopefully I'll be back to a hundred percent by Monday and I can get some some real work done on this thank you all so much for watching for all your help and have a great weekend
