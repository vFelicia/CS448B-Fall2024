In this video we are going to talk about what is a MAC address. Let me remind you this has got nothing to do with the Big Mac or the Mac operating system! Now, before we get into the details let me give you an analogy We have three people John, Bob, and Mary in a room who want to talk. Now, John, when he wants to talk to Mary, he says 'Hi, Mary! How are you doing?' Now, when Mary listens to this message, how does she know that she has to respond to John? It's through his voice. So, she replies to John, but not Bob, saying 'Hey, John! I'm doing good.' Now, if you have three different computers who want to talk to each other they don't have any names, so to bring the analogy of names and identification to computers we have this concept of MAC address, which is unique to each computer's network interface card.
