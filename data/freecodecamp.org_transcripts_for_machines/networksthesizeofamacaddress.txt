In this video we are going to talk about how big a MAC addresses is or how is it represented. Just like humans have names which are composed of alphabets, we have hexadecimals for representing the MAC addresses. A MAC address is six bytes long or 48 bits. It is usually represented in this format. You have one, two, three, four, five, six bytes which are separated by a colon or you can write two bytes together and separated by a dot.
