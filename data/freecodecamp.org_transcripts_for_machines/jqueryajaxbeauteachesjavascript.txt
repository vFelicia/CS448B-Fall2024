ajax allows you to exchange data from a server without reloading the entire page the jquery ajax methods can be used to request or send text html xml or json from a remote server different browsers have different syntax for ajax implementation but jquery makes it simple to use ajax that works with all browsers with a single line of code now this is how you use ajax with vanilla javascript and you can see there's quite a few lines of code here i'm going to show you how to change this all to one line of code using jquery before i tell you that i want to show you this line right here so we are getting data from another website and this is the actual website we're getting the data from uh http colon slash cars.cc slash code slash ajax example.txt we have to add this part because of a coors error and because of getting data from a insecure website from a secure website this is just a course proxy that you can use in development if you're having trouble getting data from another website in a live situation you would want both websites to be secure and then you would have to add some specific headers but this proxy will be good enough for now to get this data so i'm going to comment out all of this and then we're just going to put one line at the beginning first we are going to select what which element we are going to load the ajax data into so we are going to use the demo element with the id demo up there and then dot load so pretty much all this code is being replaced with dot load i'm just going to copy this website address this is the website we're loading the data from and that's the whole line so i'm going to run this code let's test it out i'm going to click change content and it changes subscribe to the free codecamp youtube channel that those words aren't anywhere on here that's getting loaded from this website right here so you can see that ajax can really help you simplify your code with this load method you can also pass a callback which just means a function to run as soon as we get the data okay i just pasted in this here okay we're going to load the text as we did before but now afterwards we're going to run this callback function in the callback function we have the response text status text and the xh arc so if the status text equals success that just means we've successfully got in the data and then we can alert external content loaded successfully if the status text equals air we can alert what the error was you're always going to get some kind of response after you try to do an ajax call a lot of things can go wrong with ajax so you usually want to set up something that will happen if there's an error like we do here let's see an example of that so it's going to say external content loaded successfully and it's going to load the content now if i change this website to something that doesn't exist i'm just going to add a 1 in here and now let's see what happens when i click the button error 404 not found so that's what we're getting this error message down here okay i'm going to comment all this out again and we're going to add another line at the top here i'm going to show you something similar to the ajx load command but this is get just like the load method get is going to get data from a server the main difference is that load is going to load the data directly into an element and git is not necessarily going to load that data into an element here we have the get method it's just dollar sign dot get and then we're going to pass in what we're going to get so the same website from before and then we have the callback function this text is not loaded anywhere so in the callback function we're going to have to say what's going to happen to the text in this case we're just going to console.log so you can see in the callback function we have the data and the status we're showing that right here the data is going to equal the data and status is the status so let's see what happens there let me open up the console here you can see in the bottom corner click change content and the data is subscribed to the free codecamp youtube channel status is success so if you're getting data that's not text or data that has to be processed you're going to want to use the get method instead of the load method now the last one i want to tell you about is the post method so instead of get you can post now post is a way to send the data to a server i do not have my website set up to send data to it so i'm just going to show you how it works here so it's going to be similar where you're going to have the website that you're going to access this time you're going to be sending data to the server and then you also are going to have the callback function but the difference is you're going to pass in one more parameter so here's other parameter the second parameter is the data that you're trying to send so this is just some json data and then the callback function is going to happen after the data is sent so after you send the data the server can send back something it could process the data and send something back or really it could be anything that could come back from the server and then you can run this callback function and you're going to receive data back from the server like i said i can't show you an example because the the server isn't set up to receive data but that's ajax and jquery thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
