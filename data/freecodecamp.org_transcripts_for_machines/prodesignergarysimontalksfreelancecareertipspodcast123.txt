welcome back to the free C Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're talking with developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week I'm joined by Gary Simon founder of designc course.com designer extraordinaire guitar virtuoso and uh just amazing allaround uh expert on freelancing on web design on using contemporary tools just getting things done and uh he's got like more than a million YouTube subscribers on his channel he's been at this for a very long time and he's carved a path for himself and I think there's a great deal we can learn from him Gary welcome thanks for that awesome intro yeah we're so thrilled to have you here man I'm like I'm a longterm like longtime admirer of the work you do the production of the videos the level of insight uh just you know how it's great watching you do like a tear down of a website and like look at like the different design decisions that were made yeah thanks no know and and the feeling is mutual of course I mean 9 million subscribers on YouTube I mean it can't be that so yeah I'm very excited for this uh to have this conversation yeah well I want to start off by just talking like a lot of people have heard the term web design it used to be the main term that people talk about in terms of getting things on the web now you heard the term web development but the but web design and web development are kind of two distinct disciplines that you know web design still exists it's it's completely different set of skills right right right so like back in the day when I started maybe we started uh you know was like in the early '90s to to late 90s and I we had the term Web Master back then so I was like a web master I think and I think that's I think that that's the term I used I call myself a Web Master even though yeah and I was I was doing design and code back then but I for me yeah a web designer the way I give that definition it's essentially somebody who's dealing mainly with the Aesthetics uh and if to to break that down more specifically you could say UI ux designer um for me web development is a is a term that would could possibly include web design or like the design aspect depending on who you ask but uh for me if I'm talking about development I'm I'm probably talking about front end development and and backend and stuff like that yeah Okay cool so Aesthetics how would you define Aesthetics and uh as like like let's pretend okay okay there are probably a lot of people listening to this who don't even have you know the faculty of site like we have a lot of blind people in the free cocing community like how would you describe Aesthetics well unless I'm wrong about the definition of Aesthetics I you for me it would be uh the the visual aspect of building you know a digital project like a website or an app or a SAS you know and so the the tools for that for me would be figma perhaps I so when I say aesthetic even when I'm referring to like bodybuilding I'm saying what does that look like so for me if I'm talking about the Aesthetics of a website I I'm talking about the visual aspect um I'm not sure if that is consistent with the correct definition uh because I know you you you precluded that by individuals who can't you know who can't see or have a hard time you know seeing a website but that's that's how I traditionally have approached that that definition yeah that makes a lot of sense how did you build up your sense of Aesthetics over the years um right so so um I've been designing for a real long time and I've always been artistic I like to draw as a kid you know not to say that you have to be artistic for UI design uh because you don't have to be but for me um you know I've always you know we could talk about this a little bit more down the road but you know in in the late mid to late 90s I I was just fascinated by early computer Graphics back then like Photoshop 2.0 had these lightning bolt strikes and stuff and I in terms of developing my current taste and how it's transformed over years and such uh that's just a matter of experience you know once you start playing around with things and Building Things designing things you'll develop your own sense of what makes you tick you know I'm a big fan of like minimalism but also scifi and so I that I kind of work that sometimes we're appropriate but that I like that sort of stuff just kind of like we all have our own musical tastes you know in terms of we can also have our taste as well awesome yeah well let's you know let's talk about that early those early experiences oh yeah with computers because I I know you're like a big fan of kind of like retro Computing Aesthetics and uh you know there's a great video that I'm going to link to in the show notes I'll be linking to a lot of the things that Gary brings up during this conversation but uh it's it's like right before the year 2020 and it's just Gary uh jamming out on the guitar with this really cool kind of like uh I I mean if anybody's seen the movie Kung Fury like it's just got that kind of like Dusty smoke fil dark kind of like school computer yeah yeah yeah it's great yeah yeah I can't wait to utilize the new studio to do more crazy stuff but but yeah we'll talk about that but yeah how I got started with computers yeah I mean you grew up in Ohio yes yeah which is in the middle of America pretty much like it's Northeastern it's it's right under it's right attached to the Great Lakes Lake Erie and yeah yeah so like a lot of people have probably not been out there like I've never been there it's it's what is it like is it like uh you know it's just like a it's a rural you know and I've only lived like within a a 10 mile radius my entire life I've probably been four or five places but I it's it's very like where I live now I it's like I have a horse farm across the street my neighbors are far away I have eight Acres that's that's that's what we like my wife and I um we did live in the city and it of course it's not a big city there's like 36,000 people there um but people were just close together and I I like having space you know and that was kind of how I grew up as well early on yeah yeah well as I uh as listeners to the show know I grew up in Oklahoma City and it it is similar like in it's just like less dense right yeah you would drive on your way to school you might drive by right an actual Farm oh yeah yeah yeah I run past them all the time yeah so um maybe you can talk about those early days like what you were into as a kid I mean you mentioned you drew a lot yeah I was into art um I was also into baseball you know I was a pitcher and I I went I I played all the way up until about e8th grade and I stopped because I became too obsessed with computers um and so yeah I ran and I you know I was athletic and and then I wasn't because the computers took over yeah uh and and my first introduction to computers was uh my friend actually he showed me AOL um on his computer I didn't we didn't have a home computer and I was like what is this and it was dial up we didn't have cable modem back then and I just thought it was amazing those private rooms everybody's talking with each other so I begged my parents for a computer and they bought me a nice computer it was like $2,000 back then and I and and I started getting into that and then I started playing Doom I my sister's boyfriend brought over the five you know hard diss of Doom to install Doom the floppy disc you had they had this cool like Doss in your face where it would show the progress bar and so I played that and then I I I realized you can actually make levels and so that's my very first taste of any type of development creating things on the computer was making Doom too levels it had their own little apps and stuff and it was complex too it was hard and and um and then I got into uh AOL a bit more um creating programs pries as they were called The Very irritating things that where you could kick people offline and freeze their computer and like I just thought that was the funnest thing to do to my friends and in order to do that you had to learn Visual Basic and and that is my first step into actual development of any sort and that's hardcore I desktop development and you I had to learn it and and I learned a Visual Basic API programming and it it was just something that a 13 14 yearold's doing it's like what is happening I and I learned a lot from that yes I learned a lot from that CU basically these little pries as they were called or prags I they they were separate desktop applications that you ran on your computer and you click buttons and it would literally control the interface of AOL so if you had a friend screen name and they were online right now and you wanted to like freeze their computer you could send like this IM spam to them automatically and it just froze their computer and like we just thought it was hilarious uh but in doing that and being you know a terribly annoying teenager I I learned how to code actually and I liked it it was fun um and challenging I shortly after that is when I started oh designing web pages and and that's that was kind of that I left that stuff behind fortunately I and I got into designing web pages yeah yeah I remember back in the day I think my friend had something called AO hell oh yes little scripts that you could use to like troll people about five six years ago I did a video kind of showing all the old AOL prags as they are called um and yeah trip down memory lane the designs of these UI are just horrendous it's hilarious but I that's how we learned back then yeah well um let's talk about like just so you you've abandoned baseball uh and just gone deep into the underworld of trolling people on AOL building Doom wads if I recall correctly wads yeah wad files awesome and and man like the degree of artistic expression within that game it was just incredible I saw the most incredible mods for Doom cuz I played the heck out of Doom I I remember like I believe the only time I did I actually like ate up like more than one day without sleep was when I first got the Doom shareware uh and I just remember walking around and just being like this is incredible for like I don't think I slept for like two days yeah had I was having so much fun the book was like this thick of like how to make Doom levels it was amazing like there was it was such a fascinating world and I was never good like really good it was just a young kid doing it I but I knew then I was like this is so exciting just creating stuff on a computer you know and that's what got me into it um and like I said then then the web page stuff came along and we're talking about like front page 97 or front page 98 microft like you don't need to learn HTML or css anymore yeah is that funny thinking at the time yeah yeah yeah and I didn't you know I I didn't know HTML CSS not I never typed in a notepad I my friend locally did I was like you're hardcore you know I I didn't do that stuff I you know I'm talking about like 99 98 99 2000 or so mhm and and so I used front page 98 and then um and then we switch I upgraded my workflow to uh back then it was macr media Dream Weaver I think yes and uh Adobe of course bought them a while later but macr media Dream Weaver uh my workflow for designing websites used to look like this they use Adobe photosop to design it think of that like as the old school figma yeah except it was never meant for designing website interfaces but that's what people did that's all we had uh so you design your mockup in that first your website mockup and then you would step into Adobe fireworks which may have been a macromedia product as well I I forget and fireworks you import that and then you do your slices so you kind of cut up with this slice tool again there's no programming here or coding at all H and you slice it up and then you hit export and it would export your website for you in these sliced frames and then you take it into something like Dream Weaver and then you would have to kind of finetune it uh so that it makes sense on a website and not everything is image slices right if that makes sense so there was a whole workflow and that I did that for a while as well yeah I mean like early 2000s if you go back and look at like the early CocaCola website uh or other Big Brand websites they had pretty elaborate looking websites way even way back in like the late '90s early 2000s but they were a lot of images everywhere right they have this really cool typography but it's really just like a little Fir and they were all and when these tools like fireworks would export your your page it was all structured and scaffolded by tables HTML table the element so everything was based on tables back then we didn't have like divs and stuff yeah U so it was interesting and and you had your white space controlled by the cbls by the thickness of the cells and all this it was interesting entirely different way you know different times in terms of how we approach design you know right now but even in doing that I still was developing my sense for UI design because that's timeless it was all the same concept you're just designing for one screen size essentially like 800 by 600 back then it was Tiny um and so yeah even even those very early days still probably impact what I do today in some weird way yeah yeah uh that's interesting to hear that like even though the tools have changed a whole lot the uh considerations uh I mean using the web is just 100 times better of a user experience in 2024 than it was back then in the sense that everything is like you go to a website you get up you go pour a cup of coffee or something because it's going to take a while for like all the assets to load you have to be careful about what you click on because you go to a different web page and you have to wait for things to load right yeah and go ahead I was just going to say the aesthetic back in like the the there used to be like these portal websites like Yahoo which I believe still exists U where you would it's just a giant list of everything on one page because they know like right like page load takes a long time and like every click is kind of like Precious so like let's put everything right in front of and to this day if you look at like a lot of Chinese websites a lot of Japanese websites they are incredibly like content dense compared to like you know us websites right right yeah and we had some bad practices too early on like a lot of us we were doing Splash Pages you know we just had a splash page for your portfolio some type of interesting graphic you made in Photoshop enter here and you click enter here it's like the most unnecessary thing now we still have that on some of these even Awards like winning websites uh but fortunately that's not the de facto and and a lot of people did that you know a lot of our startup web designers like click here to enter it's your splash page you know you got to have the splash page it's like no you don't but but then we also had flash around the same time and Flash was real interesting because you know like you said the big companies they knew I what you were talking what you were just talking about we need to get people the information fast but back then if you were a teenager you wanted glitzy crazy Graphics you wanted crazy animations and that's what we took advantage of with flash uh and Flash you know for those of you who aren't watching maybe you're too young it was just uh it was a really fun way to create animated interactive websites uh and you could do some really cool things with flash like special graphics and effects that was just groundbreaking back then um and so in one way looking back on it you know we were approaching it probably the wrong way I a lot of us aspiring designers back then because we were really just probably utilizing way too much page load time because of the dialup modems like they didn't not afford you you know a lot of room to work with and so you had to be careful with all those the audio clicks on the UI you know you click a button you want to sound Ur you know it's like all this stuff was just taking way too way too long to load essentially yeah uh so that's something we had to grow up out of yeah well was there a period so this is one thing that I'm interested in we've got so much to talk about but was there a period where people enough people had Broadband that you could have like really fancy splashy websites before rise of like mobile phones and then you had to like think about okay people are going to be consuming this on a phone too was there like some specific period where people could just go Hog Wild and like build any kind of crazy website and was was there that kind of period of I don't have I don't have that sense of there being a specific time frame like that I do know I waited for a long time for cable modem you know like Fast cable based internet speed to come to my area and the area that I noticed the biggest like factor for that was gaming when I was playing Quake 2 so I played Quake 2 like for like 10 years the same game Quake 2 multiplayer and when I would shoot the rocket launcher on dialup I had to aim like in the virtual world like 10 feet ahead of the person yeah and because it would just take time it was a big lag uh but then when you got the cable mode and and your my my ping was like 215 back then that would be like a great that would be a great ping and then we got the cable modem and it was like 32 sometimes it was the biggest difference now of course that was a huge difference with the web as well um but for me I kind of don't really recall that time I I was slower on the uptake with mobile development like when the iPhone came out I I I kind of just waited it not not intentionally I just kind of never got involved with the early adopters of um mobile design uh cuz it was just so new and I didn't really you know I didn't really consider that very much yeah well um in terms of what you did with those skills as you were you're you're a teenager you're into building Doom Maps you're into building designs with uh some of these primordial tools Photoshop fireworks dream waver getting things live on the internet without even necessarily needing to know the HTML and CSS that of course like timately everybody has to learn you know when performance accessibility all these other things you don't necessarily want to hand that over to a tool right so right maybe you can talk about like where you went from there in terms of what the next few years of your life were like like right you went to you did you finish high school and where you went from there right so yeah once I hit High School um that's when you know the I I forget it was the counselor in the high school they they talk to every kid and they're like okay what are your plans you know do you want to go to college and my parents were old school and they just you know they didn't grow up with a rich family so they were old they didn't realize loans existed so they always told me and my my siblings I have a brother and sister who are older I you're not going to college you know that you're not going to be able to afford that we can't afford that you know so you know you're on your own you know go to like a technical school or something like that and I was like well you know what I I really like computers and I know I can make a living from this and back then like in high school early High School the way I made money is I would do these design contests that these Web Master forms would put on so design contests are a thing that uh actually still exists today this day um and they were I think probably more popular back in the day but like 99 designs.com is one of them um that's a modern example but yeah I would do design contest that people would have on forums um like design this logo winner gets $300 and you know so I would get $300 here and maybe design a landing page or something like that and get $800 here it's very sparse you know being in in high school and actually one time um to back up a little bit I think I was in seventh or eth grade and I got a job offer from a software company in Fort Knox um for because I was helping this guy with AOL API Visual Basic programming it never worked out because they were going to pay me a $30 an hour but they're human resources wouldn't allow it cuz I was just too young and so that you know that experience and then making a little bit of money online that's I was like I'm I'm going to finish high school but I'm not going to college because it's just I didn't know otherwise and I'm glad that actually happened in the long run um because I didn't have all those bills and it did work out in the end yeah and that's four years you got to spend in Industry that you would have SP right right and so parties or something I don't know do in college so then I I graduated and at that point I'm not making any type of consistent you know normal amount of money unfortunately my parents weren't the type like you're 18 you have to get out so I stayed I lived with them until I was 23 um and that whole time I had this girlfriend and we got engaged and so I when we got married I moved out like that same day it's like a a very traditional thing it just worked out that way but all the way up until that point like I was about 23 I wasn't making any consistent money I was very worried I was like I have to leave soon I'm not making good money I don't want to work for some somebody else because my father he had always been selfemployed and what did he do yeah so he he all he did and and he actually still just did it here recently after three Strokes by the way I he he serviced washers and dryers and also sell he sold used washers and dryers and so it doesn't sound glamorous at all but he was making like for a while when he was really established like you know $10,000 months which is a lot of money back then yeah and and so all the greed flation of 2022 like in the 80s $10,000 a month is like the equivalent of like $30,000 a month oh yeah yeah it's crazy yeah very very solid income so he and and he didn't it was rare that he hit that number mean usually I think it was like six or 7,000 a month but you know having seen that and also having this idea even if it was false that I can't go to college that it BW a fire under my butt but I realized it was hard to like figure out how am I going to make it in a free Lance context you know and um it it how I ended up actually making my first like my establishing a real career out of this was purely by accident you know I was um dig.com um I'm not sure if you're familiar with. y Reddit precursor yes and it's basically a social one of the first if not the first social book marking type site um I'm not sure if it was but it was real popular back then and if you made it to the if your article or your content made it to the front page of dig.com you were getting thousands of visitors to your website and so I remember thinking in my my wedding is six months away and I'm not making consistent money yet at all and like I wouldn't be able to afford our our rent for our apartment or whatever well I decided I like I'm going to rate a tutorial just to see if I can get hit front page dig.com and it was it was one of the worst tutorials ever how to design an awesome logo and it hit from page dig.com and I I got all these thousands like 13,000 visitors or something and I wasn't selling anything there was no monetization and you know I was like okay that's cool and then like five months later I just randomly check my website stats and I'm getting like a thousand visitors per day like where's this coming from and it was Google and so back then if you ranked very well on dig.com other websites were linked to you so it had a natural like SEO effect yeah where I I'm ranking like literally number one number two number three for like how to design a logo how to create a logo how to make a logo and so I thought to myself wait okay so I'm showing in this one really long like written tutorial how to make a logo most people realize they're not going to be able to so I sold I I made my own backend because I understood I PHP and and MySQL and stuff I made my own backend I and people could just click this Banner like hey I'll design your logo for you if you're not competent or something like that and the way I did it is I didn't want to talk to clients so I built a entire order system and there was an intake form for for the project um and I charged $75 for One logo design concept and that was it um and once I put that Banner on that that page I got basically one order per day I averaged so there I go and I just started a career by accident and of course over the next 5 to seven years I was doing primary primarily logo and identity designs essentially and I had to masked about 2,000 clients and I I I increased the the price up to like 300 um which you know I would have done things differently if I had the information I know now but I and then of course those people needed websites as well U some of them and so I would um offer a service where they could have a website design designed for them like like a Photoshop like a mockup for like $600 and and so that's how I started making money and fortunately right when I moved out I was making enough money and then I started making more and we could talk about you know what I did thereafter but that's how I kind of got started from okay being a teenager who's has some skills but not sure how to make money um into what was essentially an accident I and that lasted for five to seven years before the algorithm and those that that page eventually stopped you know receiving as much traffic yeah so I mean $300 a design you said you're getting like around one client per day 2,000 clients like that's a lot of work it is insane and you know what's interesting is I traditionally people think you know if you're a freelancer you have to you have to talk with the client you have to have meetings with the clients and stuff and if you're at a certain price point um and and I I know I think his name is Brett from design Joy he has this similar approach and I know there's a lot of controversy around you know him and his business or whatever but that certainly can work where you don't have to necessarily talk to the clients before they actually pay you uh so it it really comes down to having a really good landing page um that's effective on all fronts and uh you you can actually you know make a living by not having to deal with the client aspect as long as if you have really good intake form um and I did I was able to find tune Bine to get to get the information that I needed out of the client essentially so they would order fill out the form I it would tell them there's a weight period And I would design it and they would see it and then offer feedback like like if they're Happ like they could request a revision if they want for x amount and if they we would have a back and forth with like a little comment system and most clients were really cool most clients I was able to satisfy within one to two revisions and then of course you have your outliers that uh were nightmares to deal with after you know of course if you're dealing with that bulk of clients you're going to have terrible clients that you you deal with and at that point you just kind of refund them and just you know I'm sorry I can't but that was very few and far between so it worked very well yeah wow so uh that's that's really good Insight like in terms of kind of productizing your services right uh essentially getting it to where you've got a system in place that is not necessarily one size fit all but one size fits most so that yes there are people who are just incompatible with the way you want to get things done right and uh your time's too valuable to you know try to work with every client and make everything a success so you just give them the money back right and part ways and focus on the people that you can help and it doesn't sound like you had any shortage of people that wanted your help no no I I mean that website you know I I I I replicated that success with that article with a with one called how to design a website and so I actually ended up ranking for number one number two number three for those typee of keywords as well and so yeah I was making over well over 100,000 a year um for you know a good couple two or three years um and that was B basically from 2007 2006 to like 2012 2013 or so and so I was doing web design for clients all exclusive work I my only tutorial was that tutorial that I wrote you know and then my very first YouTube video was on 2010 and that was just for the fun of it um I didn't take YouTube seriously until about 2014 but we might be skipping ahead a little bit too much but yeah well let's step back and kind of like unpack some of the things that you just said so you're you didn't go to college uh you don't have to worry about paying back student debt uh you've lived very economically it sounds like staying with your parents until you got married you got married pretty young like I did I think I was like 20 five maybe when I got married okay so uh and so you've just got this kind of like and and also you didn't move to like a big expensive city like a lot of people do when they're young uh you just kind of stayed around well I I'll tell you why and and basically I think it was a year after we got married I my wife got pregnant and we realized you know we can't move from our family you know they're too much help yeah absolutely so like there was so much help and our firstborn was you know she was is still you know our our our trying child you know it requires all of our energy so I we had tremendous help here locally and like just you know better weather is it did not supersede having help from family and now we're just here you know we really love our our property so we don't feel like moving so awesome yeah well you're one of the first people I've interviewed on the show who like lives out in the open I think you said you have like seven acres which is uh for anyone outside of the US I'm not going to attempt to convert that into hectares but it's a lot it's a lot of space like I think this house this is a very standard uh you know Texas you know house uh I think it's it occupies maybe like a a quarter of an acre okay you know so the property that was our house before this in the city yeah yeah it was real small and um but you know I started to become more successful and like we just had to get a bigger place cuz we were in like a I think it was like a 12200 foot like house at that time then we moved here about three or four years ago and it's a lot better yeah yeah yeah actually this might be like an eighth of an acre it's it's pretty small uh we do have a backyard uh and one of the things I want to talk about real quick while we're talking about houses and backyards you were on the path of the eclipse uh that happened here in the United States this week as a recording uh today is April 10th when we're recording this uh just just two days ago there was a cosmic event that only happens at least in Dallas once every 300 years or so um yes it was cool yeah we we ran at a cabin uh it's about 25 minutes away from here to and my wife and my mom like they've been planning this for like 5 years since like we had a partial one in 2017 uh so theyve been gungho over it you know and I saw it and it was it was really cool it was cooler than I thought it would be um just to look up and like you see that perfect little ring there I it was very cool yeah the cricket started chirping in the middle of the day because it got dark it was really cool because we were up next to a lake it was it was so cool yeah we just watched it from our backyard and like all our LED yard lights came on yeah which is really funny cuz they're all like you know uh now we're planning we're planning on going um in 2044 to North or South Dakota because that's the next total eclipse I guess 204 20 20 years away yeah if you go to South Dakota or North Dakota that's why my wife said is that otherwise here 2099 so I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to live that long I'd be 116 yeah that'd be uh you can hold that I was like man I like the eclipse so much think I'm just going to chill in my backyard for the next 300 years and catch the next one right but yeah like it it was how did how did it make you feel no it was cool I had my family around me um and it was really cool you know I we had our glasses you know our little glasses and and I yeah it it was awesome I I did I didn't make a huge big deal about it as much as my you know I think it it it really inspired my wife and my family a little bit more than me but I knew it's just it's just the moon going in front of the sun it is cool though yeah and the fact that they can pinpoint the pr you know accuracy and know exactly where it's at as people in NASA yeah it's really impressive uh technical Fe being able to predict these things right uh given how complex you know orbits are and everything right right yeah but yeah well so you've got this I mean you're in a very you know enviable position having all this freelance business coming in you're not necessarily I mean you do Marketing in the form of publishing these tutorials that generate SEO uh essentially that generate inbound leads but yes you're not out there having to like pound the pavement and sell yourself sell clients on like hey uh I'm Gary Simon and I can do web design for you I can do what you need me to do you know like people are coming to you that's amazing right and so and I I really that was great that I had that win um but I knew in just just in the back of my mind but I didn't act on it and this is just being young and it was a it was a very difficult lesson to learn is that you can't get complacent especially with anything dealing with internet and Technology because it moves fast um and so I remember I was out there playing tennis this one day I was thinking to myself if man if you know if if I stop getting orders and and Google stops sending me traffic I'm going to be in a bad place you know because I have this $1,400 mortgage we just moved into this nice place my second daughter was just born and I sure enough you know Google made some changes to their algorithm and I only had those two pages like I didn't keep making content that was such a stupid idea and I just took it for granted that I would just rank forever and slow enough over about a sixmonth period you know my income went from like making you know like 10,000 a month down to like you know 4,000 3,000 and it was such a bad time and that was what was that that was about 11 years ago 11 12 years ago and um and so I took up you know I I started drinking a lot and like I we had to move out of our house cuz we couldn't afford it damn damn you had to like give up your house yes and so we moved to you to the city into a much smaller place more manageable uh house payment um my wife went back to work as a register nurse parttime I so that was a real big wakeup call for me that was like okay you knew this was going to happen like nothing lasts forever why were you just you know being complacent you know and that's the biggest that's a big takeaway that still applies today probably in any I aspect of a business any type of business um but especially if you're a freelancer if you're not doing enough to push yourself out there continually and and promote yourself and try to diversify the ways in which you're able to to make money I after a while you might have like a run for five years consider yourself lucky if if you're able to just kind of like maintain the status quo for five years um doing nothing essentially because that was me I was I was doing something by working with my clients but I the new leads weren't coming in because the traffic was dropping and so I I had to make some decisions at that point yeah well uh that's like a nice um terrible Parable uh as as I like to always tell my friends who are in SEO you know we always say live by the Google die by the Google right right yeah it's amazing when it's working and but when it's not it's like oh myy yeah absolutely uh and and certainly I I think you've learned a lot from that and you now got this very distributed kind of like multifaceted approach toward business um and you know I'd like to talk more autobiographically but maybe you could talk about what your your setup looks like today how you're bringing in clients uh before we get into the nittygritty of working with clients because there are going to be a lot of practical takeaways I just want to understand what you learned how you applied those learnings and what you know design course what Gary Simon uh Incorporated looks like today right so today I don't deal with clients um I guess you could call my coaching clients clients uh but that's entirely different um so you know after just to back up I won't spend much time on this yet but to back up after right right when my business was failing another opportunity presented itself and somebody emailed me asking if I would create a course for them uh because they saw a couple of the YouTube videos I did and I was just doing Photoshop tutorials and um I had only up to like a couple of them and and so I took that offer up and they paid me like $2,500 to make a course on like Photoshop or something and so I started making my money that way and so I pivoted from client work to teaching now and that happened very quick fortunately and I'm glad it did because I was able to not have to get a regular job so to speak I and I was just basically contracted on a month basis to create a course so I was making one course every month typically about 120 you know 90 to it was typically about 90 minutes long that they wanted and this was in vad network which are the people behind theme forest uh which is I think still popular but it used to be really popular familiar with their work we've oh I get their emails occasionally because I think I bought something on one of their websites a long time and so they own tou plus.com yeah and that's what I was teaching on and so I did about two years worth of work with that so anyhow not to we can go back to that but just to answer your question so I haven't really I of course sparingly maybe one time a year I'll have a client that I do actual work with I but it's sometimes that client could be me it could be a personal project um but that's one of those things you know being a creator for so long now I've been in you know being a creator for about 10 years uh and being on the teaching side of things is yes you have to continually learn a lot of new things to be be able to create new content but I'm at a point now it's like I want to start getting back into client work so that I could start changing for for one I could start getting real world experience again back with working with clients which I'm not afraid of because I know how to do it yeah um and I know the current skills you know obviously my skills 10 years ago wouldn't translate today but so I'm I'm always very current because I have to be with my YouTube channel I but I I I do want to get back into um creating you know some type of a hybrid of a a design subscription agency maybe where I only take on one client a month or so until I'm done with them and then as a part of their package they'll get featured their if they want it to be their project will get featured on my YouTube channel so it's kind of like a winwin if they want that marketing and publicity along with having me design their site and so I'm going to get if that's my plan is to get back into that sort of thing as a way to a get into client workk but also be I have new content and interesting content on the YouTube channel yeah so let's say I have like a barbecue sauce company and uh I'm like oh I can not only get my barbecue sauce website designed implemented uh potentially set up to be relatively maintainable but also I'm going to get free not free publ based in like people are going to be looking at my barbecue website as Gary explains how we built it right it's just like additional incidental publicity right right yeah yeah and I would think you know maybe it wouldn't be a barbecue uh sauce company maybe it would be you know somebody who has a business that could benefit from that type of audience that I have so something like devel design or development related perhaps because they would get their biggest bang for the buck in that that context so so like let's say some loow code tool for example or would be potentially like uh you know an AI API or something like that right right yeah so I'm excited to to start working on that sometime this year so very cool well anyway body who wants to potentially be a c of G's shoot him a message uh I'll I'll put his contact below uh but um I want to talk about freelance because freelance is how most people start their developer careers unless they just happen to go to a career affir after graduating from Stanford computer science degree like had this like nice carpet rolled out for them by like right a Fang company or something like that most people uh that are learning the code are going to get a friend or family member a local business somebody to give them money uh to develop something for them develop like some internal tool develop some sort of um you know website uh maybe even just build like uh you know a custom Shopify page or something like that right like so maybe you can talk a little bit about the skills that are important to a freelancer and I've got a bunch of questions I'm going to fire off at you first maybe you can talk about the importance of like sales and marketing skills okay as a freelancer yeah so I'm going to say um not a lot of people want to hear this probably but in my opinion at the very least understanding marketing um is just as important if not more important than understanding you know the actual skills that you need to deliver the product or the service in this case if it's it could be uiux design skills or frontend development or backend um or even internet marketing if you're doing that route but I knowing how to do internet marketing itself is just as important uh than those things as well in my opinion uh because I even even though I I satisfied like 97 98% of my clients I with the logo design business and stuff once Google stopped sending me all those you know all that traffic I I didn't know what to do really from there and and so I didn't really have good marketing skills even though I that's because I had I got lucky you know that that web page ranked very well and I got lucky with it uh so when that happened I was like oh my how do I get how do I get traffic you know and like I could design really well and you know I can do all these things but they're worth nothing if you don't have the traffic and you don't have you know the ability to sell your your services and so my my practical advice in today's you know current environment is there's many different ways to get clients um there's there's search engine optimization which is still around I don't think that's going anywhere of course you know the AI stuff has kind of thrown a wrench into that a little bit but I search engine optimization if you want to choose that and you want to stick with that um as being your goto source of like how I'm going to get clients you can completely do that and go down that rabbit hole and start learning SEO um or you can go the social media route and that's that's a route that I took for my business my education business of course I focused hardcore on YouTube um and so so you have to pick an Avenue and you have to stick with it if you try to spread yourself too thin by trying to do you know SEO on top of Instagram and Tik Tok and YouTube and x and all that stuff it's going to be probably a little bit more difficult um at the same time there's a middle ground because you don't want to just choose one like I did with Google I but the the the the the good part of the story is that it's just it's just a matter of okay you took the time to start learning your craft and your skills like if you're a UI designer that might be being really good at UI design and and you have a great eye for UI design Aesthetics well you need to take that same that same type of motivation apply it equally to okay I have to get clients now I and how am I going to do that that's through internet marketing through one of those channels yeah interesting so just to recap what you're saying take that same passion that you feel for the technology that you're using and channel it into getting clients and learning how to use marketing channels to your advantage right I can talk a little bit more specifically about how one can do that but yes yeah I mean a lot of people out there consider themselves like introverts and uh as a result they may feel very out of place going to like a you know a Toast Masters or like like a rot club or uh or going to like a just like a local American Chamber of Commerce type event or something that and trying to make friends and potentially get clients um right what would your advice be to those you have to yeah and so that that's like the same thing with my wife she's huge in introvert um and I want her to start creating an internet presence for her she's a lactation consultant now so she she helps moms breastfeed basically um and she's the only one in the tricon area and and I I told her I was like you can make a lot of money like if you were to sell like a book or something and become the influencer route and but she's like I hate being in front of the camera and I was like okay well I didn't like the idea either if you go back on my channel and you click on the videos Tab and you you sort it by the oldest first you'll see one of my first videos um where I actually presented myself on screen that was in 2014 and it's terrible you know you don't you don't feel right I about it you you feel out of place but that's an expected part of the process because it's something new that you've never done before so you look at yourself you might look at yourself and say this is so cringey but as long as you're delivering the the content and people will like it and you'll see that based on how the content you know uh how it's performing in terms of views likes comments dislikes and you know whatever platform has for for engagement factors um but the the the the short the the idea here is though is that you have to do it if you want to be successful now I'm not saying you have to get behind video camera but I'm saying whatever it is that you want to do if it requires you to do something that's out of your comfort zone you have to you have to just ignore that you have to ignore it because otherwise what's the what's the alternative the alternative is not doing it and you're going to fail no matter what um so you don't have to have the best equipment um I certainly didn't you know you slowly start to amass and increase your production value and and all that stuff if we're talking about video and uh content and St and stuff like that yeah that makes a lot of sense so just to again recap you're saying like at the end of the day you could be an amazing developer you could be amazing at understanding client requirements and everything but if any one of those different like legs of your stool is weak the stool's going to fall over right it's going to collapse over you and it sounds like being extroverted or putting yourself out there doing the uncomfortable thing is one of those things that you just have to you know right and some people will find that more natural than others CU we're all different and we're all you know you could be a type a person ity versus you know somebody who's a complete introvert you know and those people will have an easier time but you can still do it you can still get behind that camera and click record and start recording yourself uh there's nothing stopping you unless you don't have a camera of course so I and even if it's not even video related content it could be for instance if you're going to take the social media route well I say you know you need to amass a following essentially and how do you do that it's by typing out good content or if it's going to be you it could be written content it could be just pictures or infographics that are interesting maybe based on what you're learning as a uiux designer you're sharing your work grow your audience as much as possible and you do that by producing content um if you want to take that route there's a lot of routes to getting clients I and we can delve into that a little bit more but well let's talk about the clients themselves that you typically work with or that you work with when you're doing a lot more freelance work uh are are what kind of Institutions are your main clients are are they like small businesses generally or so yeah so back then when I was dealing with um those type of clients they were typically you know somebody who's just going to Google literally and typing how to design a logo or website and a lot of these are small business owners or people who are just launching a business I never got to the point where I was working with like really large businesses or or institutions because I was content with you know the amount of money I was making you know you back in like 2010 10,000 a month is still a lot of money um not so much now but I it and I and I was just content with it you know and I I did work a lot of my own like side projects I had several different Ventures and and I applied my you know my learnings that way but but in terms of the clients themselves minimal communication um mainly you know there's probably a good mix of like uh local brick and mortar businesses but also internet businesses as well because I was known pretty well in forums and stuff and um and that that was my a clientele and when you're charging less you know such a cheap amount you know you didn't I didn't really I wasn't really on the radar of like really large businesses um that's one of the reasons I want to kind of get back into it as well um I know that having the information that I know now and also my network and my audience that I could I could definitely you know charge a lot more um I and work on a little bit like a longer time frame per client uh compared to what I was doing before so uh one thing that jumped out of me that you've said in the past is that you don't like to charge an hourly rate but instead charge by the deliverable itself right how did you come on like like how did you come to this conclusion and has there ever been any push back from clients that are thinking in terms of like oh I just want you to work for n hours or something like that right right and I've always told them I was like you know it it really depends and I always felt not comfortable with take taking on a project they gave me all the information that I want and because if you're going to charge like a per project base and not hour hourly then you your intake form has to be very comprehensive it has to be it has to cover all the bases because you don't want to be a situation where they're like oh okay you you told me it would be $2,000 to make this site I and then they're they're like but I want this now and I'm like well you didn't include that so like if it's a very open like Whimsical thing where I the client may not know what needs to be done or whatever hourly would make sense but most of the time I when I dealt with clients they were able to provide me with all the information I need so that I would be comfortable enough with giving them a solid concrete price yeah and are there any red flags that you see when you're looking for a freelance client like is there like some pattern or some Persona that you're like oh no it's one of these kinds of potential clients yeah so like don't undervalue your services um don't sell yourself for too cheap uh because those type of clients typically end up being the most picky um so red flags in that context so so for me with being that most of my clients I never talked to them before they became my client I could tell you I could see red flags in their intake form in that that they hardly fill anything out and so I would sometimes respond to them like listen I need more information if I'm going to be able to accurately design an identity for you um so for everybody else though who might not take that R in in the traditional approach where clients will first contact them well it's very important to be able to read into um what they're saying and how they're saying things uh because you would see red flags potentially based on just their the words they choose the use and and the ideas that they're trying to to get across you could there there's red flags that would say I I'm not going to take on this project there's definitely those scenarios um and it it might be a situation where they seem too iffy and not certain on Project requirements uh as long as there are certain and they answer everything that you need then I think the red flags could be avoided um but if they're not able to provide you with all the necessary information you need and they seem wishywashy those might be the ones that you might want to avoid yeah and and that's just because they may not know what they want and if they don't know what they want they're you're not going to know what they want yeah it could be a situation like that as well and and it's really hard like sometimes like my mom like if she sends texts and we we text each other back and forth like she does she's just not familiar with internet vernacular and how you say things or whatever and like I for me I feel like I can read anything anybody types and get a really good sense of what they're thinking you know and what they're inferring all so having that skill is important I would say um to be able to determine like if they're going to be a good client it's the same thing with relationships some people are just terrible at picking a partner they there just like it they just lack this innate sense to really read a person well which is unfortunate I but I've always thought that I could read people well um and so I was always able to avoid the bad horrible client situation for the most part they existed and you're never going to be able to avoid them 100% I because yeah people will charge back on you um like they pay you through and that happens I mean especially after 2,000 clients people will charge back uh when you're dealing with a like a servicebased industry where you know it's a very aesthetic and a subjective idea like like what constitutes a good logo they might think it's one with like a lens flare and I'm saying that's terrible idea you know so you're going to have that um but you know as long as your skills are good and your communication skills are good and you can read people you shouldn't have much of a problem with that sort of thing and it's certainly not reason not to get into it to service based industry yeah well let's talk about pricing because I imagine you have like allart services like if you want this then it's this much this much but sometimes when you work with a client maybe you're doing something more bespoke and how do you know how much to ask for for a given project thought process yeah for me it's like that's a it's a difficult question because there's not an objectively correct answer for every business um I I suppose through testing you could find what that might be and when I say testing we're talking like AB split testing with with pricing and stuff like that to find like okay if I raise the price am I going to lose clients I is is my conversion ratio going to drop you know and that's that makes sense of course if you're doing the the type of pricing that I was doing where it's just it's upfront you know like when somebody visited that page they didn't have to contact me first to realize what the price and that's because I was doing kind of like real quick work in a way I was kind of like a McDonald's of loc Lo design because it was cheap it was really cheap and so I could get away with just you know but then again bread of design Joy I mean if he's charging four thou $5,000 per client you know it's not not necessarily that clients won't do it because it's more expensive but you have to have a really good onboarding process uh to to get people to to want to hand you the money first without talking to you first yeah um so for me like if I'm talking you your average you know like your listen anybody watching this right now you may not approach it that way because that's not your typical way to take on design clients usually they'll there'll be a contact form on your site and they'll give you'll get a little bit of details about the project but then it'll send you that email or notification of some sort and then you're going to contact them get more information and then you come to a price that's the typical way which I rarely ever did myself because I just didn't want to do a clients and client communication I wanted to to minimize that as much as possible and not to say that that's what you should do that's just how I personally wanted to handle things hands off as much as possible um and so but if you were if I were to do to take that route I the price that I chose is going to be based on my research of what other um Freelancers you know in my specific Niche are charging you know and you can really Niche down as a designer developer like if you're a uiux designer maybe maybe you may maybe you don't even have clients maybe you'll you'll sell framer templates or web flow templates or you use that to you know as a side hustle or something um but in terms of knowing what to charge I would I would get out there personally I would see okay anybody with a design subscription agency if I'm going to do something like that I'm going to I'm going to take notes of what they're charging based on the quality of the work based on what they're delivering you might even sign up uh or you might hit up another designer asking them like for you pretend just to be a client I've never done this but I think it's a good idea because you could kind of then you be able to see not to un to intentionally mislead somebody but what would their what's their first response look like after you contact them you know for you know maybe they'll give you pricing ideas but for me I would see what the market is dictating yeah and I would instead of selling myself short which is what I did initially with the logo design I would I would start higher than what I think I'm worth and more often times than not you you are worth what you think you're not worth if that makes sense are you ever afraid to like throw out a price that people are going to B at it and it's going to end the conversation well in a Moder in a context that fits my business currently um when I used to take on sponsorships on my YouTube channel that was one of those things where you have to throw out a price to these companies like indeed.com like they were one of my biggest I'm clients I and I worked with so many others like skillshare and and all them and they they hit you up in sort of the same way way like it's it's all economics you know supply and demand the their demand was they wanted um they wanted traffic targeted traffic to their their business or product um and in that that case I was just looking what other creators were doing we have a Discord server all all of us YouTube programmers and stuff we have a Discord server uh and it's private and we talk about what we charge and it's based on your views and all that stuff so the same thing can be said about um your web design business as well you have to be honest with your skills uh because obviously not all uiux designers and frontend developers are of the same caliber so you have to be honest with yourself um and and and take into consideration what others are charging and then also Implement that and experiment with split testing uh if you're you're getting traffic to your website you're trying to generate leads split test everything as much as possible um to to to find out what it is you need to do to you know know get more leads get more conversions um and then experiment with pricing that you tell people as well yeah so the website the actual stuff you can control uh by pe by the time people go to you know Gary Simon uh.com or or some comparable like uh portfolio site uh or some sort of uh I guess squeeze page is what we used to call them back in the day where your goal is to get people like down the funnel and clicking through to contacting or entering their credit card or something like correct uh before you can even get people there of course you need to get out there and the way that most people get out there these days is through like SEO or through um Google ad which is pretty expensive Facebook ads I mean that is a way you can do that if you have enough money they they used to say it takes money to make money but to some extent if you create content or if you if you're on social media or if you're good with SEO you can kind of like get free traffic yes uh but if you were starting over or maybe how would you advise somebody who's starting today and they've already got great skills let's take for granted that these people already have great skills we'll talk a little bit about how to get great skills later but let's assume that people do have great skills and it's just a question of getting clients what kind of projects or what kind of things do you think would attract clients to actually come to your website right right so um like I said earlier there's a lot of different ways to find clients and I think it's important for that individual to understand first all their options like what are the ways that you can get a client as a uiux designer and what are the ways you can get a client as a frontend developer you because there's are slightly different things there's a lot of overlap of course and once you understand the various methods um of which you could potentially gain clients and maybe even not even gain clients like if you're not even going to work with a client like I said you could sell templates for templates and web flow templates they make really good money doing that if you focused on it so once you understand what the options are then you can pair that with what you're comfortable with focusing on in terms of I like how I'm going to choose to to to build clients so when I have my coaching calls um with with people that are in that this exact scenario I've had several of them um I I have this little document and I and I tell them okay well I the modern way I would say for most like uiux designers front of developers I would focus on social media personally uh and building an audience that way I would share my work as much as possible I would follow a lot of the people who are already established and in the position that I want to be in and one little hack I have for that um you know if you go to awards.com awww ars.com there's a jury section and they have jurors there that kind of rate the best websites um and it links it list their their their their X profile and their LinkedIn profile if they have one and there are like hundreds of these people and I tell them just follow them develop a network see how these people carry themselves on social media see what it is that they're doing because these people they're they're working either with large companies uh or or design agencies or they're solo uh and they're charging like 20 $30,000 for projects or more and so they're they're they're at the Pinnacle some of these a lot of these people are and so you want to follow them and see how they they carry themselves um and then you can interact with them you can start to that's networking that's part of what it is another thing you can do like I said sharing your work is the obvious thing uh but also sharing if you're a beginner sharing tips that you learned as you go because suddenly you become the best person to teach that thing uh because being that that the Newbie problem you know was fresh in your mind um and you'll find that people will start to follow you naturally and and having a following um is a benefit icial Factor if you're trying to either get employed like in a traditional employer employee relationship but also freelance as well um I'm not saying you just want to have a ton of other designers following you uh but you'll find that if you start putting out your work consistently and you're engaged and you're you know the I am a UI designer this is what I put out today you know and mention your portfolio and stuff by by nature of having followers of perhaps other people who are in your shoes it starts to I it becomes a real really good factor in um you know other designers reaching out and collabing with you and perhaps they have another uh maybe they have a client that's not a good frit for them or you know there's so many different ways if you're able to build up your a following on social media so I think social media is like in my opinion one of the best ways to get started uh because it's something you can do while learning um and and and so I think that's a a great aspect or or a great method for yeah I trying to trying to just establish a presence online and and from that um you can you can definitely get to a point where you're you're getting a lot of client requests yeah I mean social media you hit it kind of on the head in my humble opinion uh social media is something you can do along the way it's right almost kind of free it doesn't take that much time to tweet about this project you just spent like 10 hours building it takes like two seconds to twe right um and it's you just kind of do it along the way and it's like it's almost like a a limb is kind of how I think of social media it's like a way of me expressing myself and sharing information it's like you an organ yeah and and then if you want to take it a step further and this is something I did for a while as well is you know I would you know every time I learn something you could write an article about it um so I had another site called cet.com and and I got that up to 10,000 visors a day and I was teaching angular back then I and so like I ranked very high for angular and well all I did was you know I kind of followed the Gary vanard Check route um and and and that's what got me started on YouTube actually um he's like make a piece of content every day it doesn't matter what it is and so he did that with his Wine Library TV he did like 3 years of every day doing a wine review and just went nuts on it and it was very successful because no matter what he made a video so I did that as well uh my first 100 videos were 100 videos in 100 days and I got burned out but that was huge um so if if somebody wanted to take that mentality you need to apply that mentality like if you're serious you need to apply that if it's going to be social media focusing on you need to do something it doesn't have to be every day but if you're going to determine it's two to three times a week I'm putting out content then you have to stick with that no matter what um you you have to be like for scump and that's the mindset that you have to get into whether you're trying to learn a new skill and that means learning something every day or promoting something every day uh that's where the consistency the consistency will pay off regardless of what Avenue you're choosing so for me I would write an article I every time I uploaded a video for a while and so there therefore that took care of the SEO um I started getting like longtail traffic keywords and and all that stuff and you don't have to be an SEO God to understand how to rank you just have to be absolute consistent um and pumping out content a lot um and and that's that's that's what you can do if you don't have like a big marketing budget like through paid ads all the paid ads can be very profitable but you typically have to lose a lot of money because it it requires optimization um if we're talking about paid ads like through like Facebook or Google there's like a discovery process like you have to iterate on your ads and Facebook go and you're paying money the whole way yeah and I don't that's why I personally don't advocate for for it um I'm not I mean I've done P paid ads for a while um like a long time ago so I don't know what the current I'm sure it's more competitive um so it's going to be more difficult and it requires it requires money up front and you may not you may lose to it's it's common for marketers to lose thousands of dollars early on in a campaign uh because you have to you have to really mod I make sure your ad copy is very good the the initial Banner that they click on like whether that's on Google or Facebook um and then you have to make sure your landing page is like on point uh and and so for me if you're starting out you don't have much money uh SEO organic SEO is a a really great way along with um social media awesome uh and I just want to Echo some of the sentiments uh you know free C Camp as a charity we we've never had the budget for like advertising and because free cocain is free there's not any Roi advertising so we've always kind of been uh you know limited to social media limited to uh Google SEO which for every video for every podcast I write like a short article summarizing that podcast publish that on our own website having your own website having that be optimized having that be accessible having that be fast uh you know but basically what you just said you already spent the time to create the video tutorial or the you know why not also share it on social media why not also have an article that kind of serves as a vehicle an SEO vehicle for that piece of content so yeah I just that come down to delegating too I mean it is it takes time to to write stuff um and I've always been bad at delegating it's the one thing like I have to improve is being willing to allow other people to take over parts that are kind of mundane you know uh and so I've been a bad business person in in that regard because you can only grow so much you know until you hit a ceiling which I have hit a couple years ago so I'm making changes you know in that regard but um being willing to have other people do it but yeah I mean if you're willing to hustle I mean and and you have to sometimes you you have to hustle at different times in your life you're never going to be a hustler 24/7 I don't care what anybody says it's not sustainable for me it's it's I I go through periods you know where I'm a little bit more relaxed you know I spent six months building this studio um and then my business like I wouldn't say I I neglected it but I wasn't on top you know and I so those are things that you have to to to look out for yeah and just to add to that uh I genuinely believe that just doing fewer things but doing them well is totally fine and there's there's this old saying I always heard as a kid if you want something done right do it yourself and like to some extent like I don't have any assistants or anybody that helps me with like Bo will help upload the uh the podcast to YouTube and he'll uh uh help you know add my base intro to it and make sure like do some very basic video production but Bo runs the entire you know pre YouTube channel but like like that is kind of delegated to him like some of that but uh in terms of things that I do every week my job is pretty simple in that like I've chosen to prioritize a few key things that I can do sustainably and definitely okay I think where a lot of people have problems and they burn out is they try to do too many things as opposed to doing a few things well yeah and that's one of the problems like you know they people might see me and like oh this guy's really good at UI ux design he can do front of development he can do Identity Design and all this stuff and I was like yeah well I've been doing this for like 25 years or like more you know and so of course I I I I can have these skills and be pretty good at all of them but if you're trying to start off trying to start off being like a full stack developer you're going to have a very hard time like you have to pick one thing and really focus on that um you know I have no problem if somebody wants to learn figma as a UI ux designer and then on the side they're trying to learn HTML and like a little bit of CSS so they can understand like that's okay in my opinion that's you know it's always Bor it could be really boring the opposite if you're only con you know if you're requiring yourself only to work within like one typ one tiny thing so there's other skills that you can work in but I wouldn't start trying to learn like I laravel PHP along with figma and like try to do both at the same time and try to get both of those type of clients at the same time that's very difficult I stick to one thing and then once you get pretty good with it and comfortable you know you can start to add other skills eventually and and and and also it's also I I don't want to say you can't do those things like for instance if you're trying to if you have a side project and I really believe in side projects you do have to wear a lot of hats for it to be successful if you're doing it alone so that means you're going to be doing the uiux design the Identity Design the front end development any backend stuff and the marketing and I think just going through that process uh as somebody to understand what it takes because you'll probably fail the first few times you do it it's good to have that as well under your belt because it will teach you a lesson like it's this stuff is not easy you know I if you have a great uiux design but I you know maybe your codee's terrible or more typically it's the opposite maybe you're a great coder but your UI this looks horrible well those are one of those things that you have to delegate out if your skills aren't up to par and to be able to design really good it takes years you know it's just like anything be able to play guitar it takes really well it takes years sometimes it's it's just one of those things you have to be consistent about and patient and as long as you understand those things up front you you can be successful yeah a lot of people burn out because they're like why am I not getting the results I've been lifting weights for six weeks why am I exactly yeah and it's the same like like like my course like I have a uiux design course is 16 hours and it's interactive it's all this stuff and and I you know it might take the average person a month or two but you're not going to be a great uiux designer after you take the chorus and that sounds like a bad thing for me to say as somebody who wants to promote my course and I want people to buy it but I'm being honest with you yeah you can you can have you can watch the course and follow along but then you have to start putting this stuff together in your own you know your own Rule and it's a lot different so it takes a lot of practice to build that muscle memory and what you said about what you said about projects like obviously if you're building a project and you're putting it out on like Reddit and like look at what I built and all that stuff you're going to have to have so many different disciplines you're going to have to get some degree of exposure to so many different aspects of building something publicizing something uh and and just coming up with something and designing it is a whole another series of skills but you you can have a little bit of exposure to a whole lot of Concepts it's just not that you're going to go out and build yourself as a full engineer just because you did like you put some of this stuff together for a single project like like you said it took you 20 plus years to build up the skills that you have to be able to actually like I mean logo design you were deep on logo design 2000 logo design clients right like spent a great deal of time learning the theory and the practice behind identity and probably all the color theory typography like all these different concepts that go into being a really strong logo designer and feeling confident in your work right right right yeah so like like I said earlier like I'm not always in this mode of where I have to continually get better um some times I'm more complacent than others sometimes I'm you know really trying to learn something new hardcore so I'm not saying it takes you 20 years to like be great at like uiux design and front end development um but it's not going to happen after watching a couple full stack development courses either I it's just like I said it's just one of those things and I think the best way to learn I'm going to go back to this a little bit is a side project idea if you have a side project um and you're excited about it like it's an it's an idea you think think can maybe work somehow I like I'll give you a quick example the guitar stuff like um if you've ever if anybody has ever looked at like try to learn music theory through I like learning scales and modes like you'll see on a like a Google Images you'll see um these notes mapped out on little fretboards right where it shows the six strings and stuff and they always look like pixelated and junky and so I made this IDE I was like What if I we made this app that has a an interactive guitar fretboard where it's interactive and they can quickly change so sorry I hit my microphone so I made we made fretastic decom fastic and yeah F re t s.com and it's just like an interactive guitar fretboard service oh so this is sweet and and so I was excited about it because I was like there's there's a couple other competitors but they're not doing it right and they're it looks ugly um and so once I decided that hey this idea can make money I got excited about it and so so I I even though I do have a partner who's a developer on it it it will help you learn all of these things a lot easier because then it's not a chore you're excited about the project that's the problem with a lot of like like most courses or almost all courses it's hard to get excited about something else that somebody put together like through these tutorial projects or something but if you have that excitement about some little idea some type of tiny little sass you know software as a service or something I that that's when a lot of the stuff will you you will by nature of being interested in it you will start to learn these things if you want to try to go this solopreneur route or try your hand at Indie hacking or something like that awesome yeah this is a really cool project by the way uh I'll link to it in the show notes again a quick reminder that we do have lots of links uh if you click in the YouTube if you're watching this on YouTube YouTube video description or if you're listening to the audio version in the uh like in Spotify or in apple podcast whereever listening to this so frit tastic very cool um one thing that I want to talk about before we get into building skills because I'm very excited to talk about that is just are are there any channels for publicizing your work as a designer as a developer that you think are underutilized or or like more people should know about these because obviously everybody knows about like Twitter and Facebook and uh LinkedIn and and they may have even heard of like design places like dribble for example but what are some channels if you will that you can get your work out there and potentially find an audience that people may not be thinking about right so I just recently had this one idea I haven't executed on it yet but I'm fairly certain it would work pretty well is I've had this idea it's like okay this would be great idea for somebody who wants to get into freelance like say let's just say it could be friend and development or uiux we'll just say like as a uiux designer or uh or something like that um or maybe somebody who is even like like an indie hacker almost I mean I I noticed my wife's lactation consultant business she's a part of a Facebook group of with other lactation consultants and um they they're always complaining about the software they have two software options that people have made um for tracking your clients and all that stuff and I I guarantee you if you go to any type of Facebook group on based on any type of Interest or you know career or whatever you're going to find I you you're going to see real user feedback on the existing software or solutions that exist in there um you could promote yourself as somebody like say for instance I maybe you're really into Fitness training and you go to the gym a lot and you're also a uiux designer you can completely craft a business that's geared just to that towards that industry uh and and you could promote yourself potentially you know on something like that um and get your name out there I think that would be a great way because you know what I think one thing that's over utilized is something like dribble probably and he's like I'm a designer you know I'm going to put my my project on dribble and you get two or three views out of it and you're just lost in a sea of other people uh so for me like if we're you're thinking if you're trying to think outside of the box um developing a niche is a great way U especially you know in this day and age you know it's it's it's comp competitive as it's ever going to be probably um and it's only going to continue that way as the internet is more you know popular and such so if you can Niche down a little bit in that regard I think that would be a great play um just to to find so something that you maybe you have expertise in like a secondary skill like Fitness or guitar uh you could you could you could make band Pages for perhaps you really good at designing band Pages uh and and promote yourself in in the necessary uh markets where those people are frequented or frequenting frequenting sorry and there are lots of lawyers doctors uh people who who run small businesses probably uh people that uh you know repair uh washing machines and things like that my brother took that on right right yeah that that also are interested in bands or are interested in video games or any of these other Hobbies so a lot of times you can incidentally find people that are uh potential clients uh just within those area so right like for example like when I was uh a developer i' i' I'd go running through like San Francisco a lot and uh so I would go to like running meetups and incidentally meet people who were interested in client work who were just going for run just some lawyer or something right so like don't don't uh I guess weed out those kinds of activities those even though those may be fun for you they may also be networking opportunities oh yeah exactly you're right you could to totally just pick one industry like I said and like just go hard on that like try to land some like influencer clients perhaps uh offered you to work for free yeah just if they'll use your design like that's something that you put on proof and like I that's something I could talk about as well as I this idea that you can't do work for free yeah let's talk about that obviously an open source Community like a lot of the work done within Freo Camp's Community is done by open source contributors without any expectation of compensation right right right and so yeah there's this idea that um especially like for uh UI designers and stuff like you can't don't ever work for free and I agree with that but what they're talking about is they're talking about monetarily speaking don't work for free because if you're not making actual cash then it's not worth it but I and and there's positives and negatives what I'm about to say but I for me like I did work for free for a while um and and and doing contests is kind of like working for free if you don't win because it's very unlikely but um I I would actively back when I was doing search engine optimization long time ago like 2006 or something I like I would literally do design work for other website owners if they would link back to me so like I would get back links I know it's it's a little like gry hat SEO but um what I'm talking about into context like if you're a brand new designer uh and you don't have client work well you don't have a portfolio then right that's why some designers they'll have a portfolio and they'll put their portfolio as as one of their projects like don't do that uh you need actual work and to be able to Showcase and have a portfolio so a lot of people are wondering how do I get client work if I I have no portfolio and so one of one of my like I tell my coaching clients is like there's there's a lot of ways to find clients you just have to you might have to work for really cheap or free and the value in working for free monetarily speaking because you still gained something otherwise you wouldn't do it is in having the ability to have a a project on your portfolio with a case study and that right there is the value that you'll gain by doing something for free um and that is tremendous because one of the main things that the first thing I think that most clients or and employers will look at when they hit your folio is not going to be your portfolio itself it's going to be looking at your client work so if you if you did something for somebody um or even a side hustle a side project that works as well um and you're you're not paying yourself obviously uh you're giving yourself the the ability to have client work you know making sure they used it you know you don't want to put something in there that they didn't end up using it needs to be on a live website uh so that you can have that trust Factor for you so working for free in that context I have zero problem with I and some people say you shouldn't do that it's like well how do you get a client you know you so for for me I have no problem with with people working for free in that context because they didn't work for free they G they gained something out of it and that's the opportunity to have a portfolio which then leads to money yeah and like a Counterpoint that like a lot of people might say well I'm like struggling to pay my rent like why should I pay you know work for free there is some degree of privilege or just having like laid a financial Foundation to where this is why I tell people don't quit your day job to learn to code or learn you know design or really learn anything always make sure you you have that taken care of even if it reduces the amount of time you have in your day that you can dedicate to Improvement uh it's much better to gradually learn to code over yes three years than it is to find yourself in Dire Straits because you you bid off more than you could chew and I forget you know a lot of times people have regular jobs cuz I never did and then when I when I was learning I was like in middle school and you know like I didn't have I had like 10 years where I didn't have to worry about money so it's easy for me to sit here and say work for free but like you said if you're in a situation where you have a mortgage and you have bills to worry about uh yeah don't quit your job find that one hour night maybe where you typically just sat and watch Netflix and just apply it slowly slowly but surely you're going to learn you're you'll start to develop your skills I so don't quit your day job only quit your day job after your side hustle now makes you enough money consistently you know yeah uh to to quit your actual day job yeah and it should go without saying but don't do the like screw you qu you know keep those res keep those uh because you never know you might need to go back and there's no harm in going back uh there's no harm in not making it as a freelance developer this time and having to get your old day job back and then keep keep getting more app backs and that's why like your service our free code Camp is just absolutely amazing it's it's probably the single Source on the internet that's hope that's helped that many amount of people who perhaps you know they they do have a job already already and F funds are tight like your your your courses are just insanely you know you have courses that are like hours upon hours long that are free so there's no excuse for anybody yeah to say that well I I don't have the money to learn this you know or I don't have the the time again I know some people are very busy uh and it could be very difficult just to get an hour of time but most people if they're honest with themselves they're not that busy so it's just a matter of wanting it bad enough and if you don't want it bad enough don't do it but uh don't make excuses though by you're sitting around watching Netflix all day playing games so I've always been a gamer as well up until like past like five six years like I I I worked in gaming as well so it's not like I'm one of those people you have to hustle 247 no way yeah yeah and same same here I I enjoy uh games and I enjoy relaxing with my kids and doing lots of stuff that's not work that is not productive it took me a while to get to a position where I had the time and bandwidth to be able to do that but I'm I'm proud to say that like I'm not on 247 cuz it's not sustain no it's not healthy either right I I want to thank you for your kind words about free C Camp we're very proud to have created these free learning resources for everyone regardless of their situation in life their economic situation as long as they have uh any sort of internet connection even if it's a really crappy internet connection free cocan Core Curriculum is extremely data light and that's by okay design so that people that are out in in the area where we don't have Broadband 20% of Americans don't have Broadband yet W in 20124 right and that that says nothing about the people living in rural Asia rural Africa uh you know Ral Latin America like don't take that for granted and we don't take that for granted we want to make sure but I I do want to point out that we've got some excellent Gary Simon uh stuff on Freo Camp's YouTube channel including uh this excellent video where you go through and you essentially like critique designs we published that way back in 2020 but I'm going to link to that in the show notes be sure to check those out learn more from Gary see him in action um so some of the things I want to talk about in terms of getting skills uh what skills should people learn in 2024 what are like the tools that you would recommend if you want to get into web design or you know frontend development like hybrid kind of ux UI design right yeah so you have a lot of options fortunately um it depends on what route you want to take so if we're talking about a website designer or the monit term like a uiux designer what skills do you need and what software do you need so I would say in terms of skills you have to understand the fundamentals of of UI design first and that includes and depending on who you're asking they might say there's five there's six or seven you know that's things like understanding contrast to these are in no particular order um topography understanding uh color psychology a little bit um understanding what color contrast is understanding what alignment means in UI design understand what visual hierarchy like all these fundamentals understand the basics first before you start try to getting into the fancy stuff yeah um in in in terms of the software well I the most popular UI ux design prototyping software is figma um but you can also go the um opr Source route with penot they just released um penot penot 2.0 that's pen p and that's an that is basically a direct figma competitor and they work very similarly so if you don't have you don't want to have to spend money on figma which you can get a free figma account uh it's just like they have paid plans and stuff like that if you don't want to do that you can go the pen pot route so if you're interested in designing websites and apps like the actual user interfaces that those are the tools that I would recommend um learning for that aspect alone I you don't get a website that works in your browser with figma or penot but that's the first thing that you typically want to work with because you want to get an idea of what your design looks like first before you start coding and I know that's some people prefer not to do that but my my my position on that is is if you you want to use something like figma or pen pot uh because it allows you to very quickly move things around and iterate and get and iterate over it and get quick ideas without having to type code first to try to design while and if you're doing a really basic cookie cutter landing page and you kind of have a a quick idea of what you want that's fine but if you want to be a serious UI uxer then you learn either figma or pen poot or any of the other competitor software out there yeah um and and then if you want to take if we're talking about maybe front end development then you have you have two choices today you can learn HTML CSS from scratch in JavaScript if you want some interactivity um and I I really recommend people taking the time to understand at least the basics or you can go the low to no code route with a tool like framer web flow Wix Studio I there's a couple other ones there's like dora. a I believe um and that's a that's an approach where you can design your website and you can also get it up there on you know on devices and browsers without touching code and the the ones like that I mentioned like framer and web flow they're so Advanced now um in in in the capabilities like allowing you to to create scroll based interactions and animations that it's a really good tool for people who just don't want to code but they love designing uh so that's an option as well yeah and uh so that's really cool that you're essentially presenting two paths you can start with the design and just use powerful power tools essentially like uh you mentioned framer Dora Wix web flow or right you can actually learn the fundamental skills that are like basically that are going to be the output of these power tools they're going to Output like CSS files and HTML files and JS but uh if you want to focus on design first it makes sense to go with the power tools where you can rapidly iterate and you can use that before you get into the nittygritty right right and and and of course learning the HTML CSS JavaScript and then tacking on to that you know learning maybe react or view or something like that uh you could take that you could take that route and it's going to ultimately give you more flexibility in the end to do things from scratch and some like larger client higher paying uh projects that have specific requirements where that's only possible that that's where it's going to benefit you um the most but if if you just want to frame yourself as a web flow designer which many people do you can have a career out of that alone I would be a little bit worried tying yourself to one piece of software because they can die out and you know I but it that's why as long as you have those UI design skills they're going to transfer easily from app to app because when it comes to being able to design a greatl looking user interface for an app or a website it's less about the tools it's more about your your eye and your you know and it's like a 90 10 a 90% 10% 10% tool knowledge 90% everything else that takes a lot more longer to to yeah like the actual taste you develop the of atics right um and and the creative reps that you get to be able to just come up with something that looks novel like like an artist sits in front of a blank canvas and just starts you know adding detail and they've got this Vision in their mind right most people if they haven't never done that before they don't even know what what do I paint you know where I begin it's interesting because this is I I call it I I don't know if this is a real term I call it the Observer Creator problem you know we're we're all great critics you know because we've for instance like well I'll put it in the context of I like guitar um because I play guitar I you can hear and Rec anybody can recognize a great guitar solo you know if if if a person gets one note wrong it just stands out so bad you know so we're great observers because we've listened to and we we've been subjected to music for so long but the moment you ask somebody to pick up a guitar and and do a solo even if I give gave them six months to try to learn the Eruption solo by Van but guitar solo ever include at least one bum note in it by the way he which is that I I can't remember but he he said he made a mistake when he recorded it but this was the old days they just like cool whatever we got to get this album cut time money you know like those Van Halen albums so we're talking about Van Halen one the very first Van Halen uh album and uh Eddie Van Halen of course legendary guitar player uh just created this amazing solo that uses like finger tapping which was novel at the time I don't think it was a widespread or wellknown practice and uh it's just this incredible solo um but uh those albums they would record them live like they would go in the studio everybody would be playing maybe the drums would have some plexiglass or something around them but like people just played it and they practiced so much that they could just cut an album quality version of that performance and immortalize it on the album at least for the first two or three albums they did that so so um but but he said he did actually make like a very minor mistake but it was good enough so they just shipped it yeah there's some parts in that so that are so fast it's like it's open to interpretation but um but yeah so going back to my point though it's like they're going to have they're not going to be able to do it in six months and then you asked them to to create a soul of similar caliber you're not going to be able to do it either um and and that that that exists because observing is very much different because logically speaking wait I can recognize that this website looks great now if I try to create my own why does it look way worse like why doesn't this transfer and it's because doing is very different there are different neurop Pathways um when it comes to observing because you say wow that website looks great and then you try to it's like a 10 out of 10 and then you do it it's like a three out of 10 as a beginner and that's expected though a lot of people get tripped up like this I I just suck at this I I quit you know because I look at what I I could produce and they don't give themselves enough time because they don't understand upfront beforehand that you have to practice a lot and you have to bake this stuff into muscle memory and one and one of the greatest ways and this is a great parallel with guitar players and web designers is one of the ways that I advocate to get good with guitar and design is to Simply copy others so in in Guitar World we call it covers so I learned the eruption Van Halen you know solo I and that's called a cover and I learned it because well a I I think it it sounds great and I want to be able to do that myself I but B it's also going to help transfers that style into my brain so that I can interpret it and work into my own new ideas and that's what art is it's imitation right so the same concept applies to um design so like if you see a design that looks great well try to try to reverse engineer it and create it not as a something to put in your portfolio of course but literally cop it copy it pixel by pixel as a as a practice routine and I've done videos on this this concept and you'll find that uh physically you know working in figma or pen pot and recreating a design that's maybe on your other monitor or something and you're trying to you know piece it together exactly how they did it that actually it bakes itself into your I your your own future work um and then so that you can eventually develop your your own little style and when it comes to uiux design there's a lot of patterns so you can't really be too crazy uh but you can still develop your own style and your own your own things that are unique even though you're copying initially and and as just a means for practice and learning yeah let's talk about some of the design Trends you did this great video a while back like like you do this pretty pretty frequently like you you'll review different designs you'll just have just open up your browser and you got like a bunch of tabs open and you'll talk about it like and and some of the the e curs scrolling Mouse it's triggering some sort of Parallax effect or uncovering something or there's some sort of Animation that progresses as you scroll like like I'm curious about what you think like the big exciting Trends in design are um and uh what people who are designing should look out for right yeah so right now I would say in 2024 like the current trends that I'm seeing is like well load and no code is like getting bigger in my opinion um now of course that doesn't have anything to say with actual athetics um I in terms of like web design Trends you know I try to Ju Just for the purpose of keeping up to date and fresh on YouTube I'll I'll do these a couple times a year like maybe once a year like 2024 design Trends or whatever but typically when it comes to uiux design and design Trends in general you don't see big changes in a yeartoyear basis you might have one tiny little thing that picks up like glass morphism you know where people are making some of their UI cards look glassy or whatever uh but in terms of the big macro Trends usually it's like a s to 10 year period that we see things change like largely and the what we're seeing now in my opinion is there's a there's a big emphasis on um interaction and motion design and I think those things are great when you implement them where it makes sense um you don't want that stuff on an ecommerce website for your client uh or if it's a Content heavy website you don't want to have all that but if we're talking about landing pages and portfolios which was my personal thing that I like the most like SAS landing pages and stuff and and creating those type of things then interaction and animations I are play a good role and there's a definitely a skill and being able to apply those with accessibility of mine and also speed and use your experience in mind there is a middle ground to you know some say uh just don't do anything and if you're not good at motion design then yeah just keep it static uh you have to spend time to learn these things because it's a skill um just like making the website itself look good that's a skill like with all those fundamentals uh motion design that's definitely a skill as well both in terms of how you apply it with your animation timing and eases and all that stuff but also technically how you implement it um with things like green sock animation platform or you can do some of those in a limited context within framer and let the load of no code tools so going back to that I so animation interactivity is a big thing I think topography I'm experimenting with topography and also in getting out of flat design now because back we we had Web 2.0 which I think was 29 to 2009 is to like 2014 like that seems to be the window of Two web 2 2 out I think I I'm sure some people might disagree a little bit but yeah um that's when you know everybody was using gradients and drop shadows and strokes and glows and everything was just like you know there was very little flat you know it was kind of like skew morphism essentially and so then we had material design from Google came out and that was like oh this is all flat like they're just using solid colors everywhere and that that was a great I think we needed that the pendulum swung the other way into complete flat design for a while which is great for ux but then creativity I be believe began to suffer a little bit every website almost look the same so now I think we're seeing a push back against that to where we're seeing things like more colorful websites thick um I strokes and we're doing things that we T typically didn't do before and that's just a natural progression of of design Trends um I don't think anything major is going to happen until we get something like you know um the the VR stuff and the AR stuff to take off I kind of like how we did with um the first iPhone that was a fundamental change it required a big change in how we approach design um and so until we get to that point I'm not sure if there's going to be something else outside of that but until we get to that point we'll just see small incremental changes in terms of how we approach uiux until the technology really changes and shifts awesome so in other words if I can kind of very succinctly put what what you just said mhm don't worry too much about it focus on the fundamentals and the ground's not shifting like it might seem like it's shifting yeah but right yeah right the so like learning color theory learning typography learning these like where where would people learn some of these you cover this in in some of your courses y so I have I every year I do a free uiux design C crash course and front end develop there're two separate things I and I teach that I always make it a point to teach that a little bit in the crash courses so you completely learn that stuff for free obviously there's so many other sources um outside of me uh but my uiux design course which is a paid course that covers that there's an entire like mini course dedicated to the fundamentals in that course um and I have parody pricing and all that stuff so it's pricing meaning that if somebody is from like a lowincome country y then they can it'll knock like it'll knock off like 40% but yeah yeah that's cool awesome well we can we can put a link to that below as well anybody wants to try out that course um and uh what do you think about some of the AI tools you had this great video that I watched uh where you were looking at some of framer's AI tools and I think maybe they use the term AI a little liberally when it it sounds but what is AI really we've had AI since you know early chess engines and things like that but obviously like generative AI tools coming up with quote unquote creative stuff from Whole cloth and things like that uh what do you think about those AI tools are there any that have really impressed you right yeah so of course the the the one that's really impressed me impressed everybody like when mid Journey came out um just for generating images and the main use case that I see that being used and I it's integrated into my workflow I because I I will use mid journey to create assets whereas otherwise in the past I might have used something like unsplash.com which is like a free image you know resource that these are actual photographs that humans took um and what's really cool is like the prompt that you issue within Discord to interact with mid Journey um and it just keeps getting better and better I'm able to quickly generate an asset like an abstract like website background like some type of weird gradient or something and so youed have really fun experimenting with it and you can get some really good results with it um realistic or otherwise uh if you want them in any style um so that mid journey I use that a lot I also um would Advocate using Adobe illustrators a relatively new um vectorbased I AI prompt generation platform it it's really cool because before we couldn't get vectorbased um AI assets but now you can do that of course you could do that if you if you did the uh um what do you call the bit map to Vector process but usually artifacts yeah you get artifacts it' be tough to do um just just for the benefit of the audience when we say Vector we're talking about like an SVG file or something where it's like geometry as opposed to you know pixels right yeah so like if you a good way to describe the difference between like a raster graphic or like a bitmap graphic and a vector graph is if you like you zoom up on a photograph that you take on your phone like you'll see pixelation blurriness it doesn't look like good quality that's rastered um Vector doesn't have that but Vector of course you don't use Vector for like high resolution photographs you use it for like illustration and stuff and on websites you have icons you have little illustrations sometimes and Adobe illustrators um Vector generate AI generation tool is pretty solid depending on what you're trying to get it to generate so let's say hypothetically I wanted to have like a quill uh like I've got I want to have some old timey you know uh Renaissance Era um kind of broke music website a different musical period but like let's say that I I want to have like uh you know leave a note in the guest book or something like that I have a quill like I could go to Adobe and essentially prompt it like hey I need a a vector graphic of a quill and it should be tilted n degrees and it should be you know um it should have ink dripping from it or something like that I would use that yeah and I yeah and it would come all like four variations and sometimes it's bad and and sometimes it's it's really good and they allow you specify different styles so I would I would I would use that um not as much as I use mid Journey um because there's like in icons there's already so many icons that are very welld designed and you can't really get.com icons is like a website I've used I don't know if you have something better than that that you'd recommend yeah I I can't I'm not off the top of my head these days um but so those are two like graphic based tools uh I would use AI for um but I would also use chat GPT and L Ms for in general um and that could be as simple as like trying to get website copy you know that's the obvious one so you're not using laurum ipsum everywhere um but but also to come up with with ideas like perhaps even you don't want to rely on re on on these large language models too much like for like research you know the the research as aspect of like ux design uh but it's it's certainly a tool that's available um for you to to help assist you when you're trying to build a website or something even if it's a technical question or not uh so as a frontend developer you can ask chat GPT questions but just understand that it does get things wrong you know at times but if you have basic questions it's it's a great resource in my my I use it every day I I used to learn a little bit of music theory and I I can you can ask it questions or as long as they're General basic questions you're not asking it to make like a Facebook clone you you're good to go t typically all so that's the main ways write down that I personally use AI I in in my uiux workflow awesome well uh We've covered so much ground here I I do have a question that I want to ask you uh you've often said that that uh you you live fearlessly what does that mean and and why is it that uh you've chosen to live fearlessly well I'm going to be honest with you I'm not sure when I said that specifically but I'll give you a really good uh I'll give you an answer that makes sense to me because it actually it kind of aligns with you know like a recent I guess you could say transformation of my thought process and how I approach stuff in general I you know I for me I guess I I I finally understood that you know I I was a hypochondriac and so I was always worried about like Health ailments and which was really stupid because I was an alcoholic you know it's like how why are you drinking alcohol every night when you're worried about your health or whatever and and then F finally slowly I I shed that uh because I started going down this Rabbit Hole I know this is completely off topic but of of neardeath experiences and and I chose to believe these people that are having these neardeath experiences that's like one of the greatest thing that's ever happened to them like 95% of them say it's like the greatest thing ever you know what I I I decided to stop worrying about my health because hey I'm pretty healthy now you know I don't drink anymore and I I I run and lift a lot I but even even like as recently as two years ago like I was just worried about you know like if I had one small thing wrong with me healthwise it's because I have cancer or I have this or that and I finally stopped that and I don't have hypochondria anymore and because I believe you know when I die it's going to be I it's going to be a continuation of my Consciousness and so what I'm finding now is that I am living life in less fear in general just by having that Mantra in my mind like I'm not just going to die and rot there in the ground and that's it I that gives me Comfort and so I understand atheists might be like you know because I was an atheist and I'm still kind of am but I'm more spiritual now so I don't subscribe to his particular religion uh but for me like I said I I I live life fearlessly now in that context I of where I'm not I'm not stressing over everything because I I I I think this is just I for me just to to to better myself why on this time in the planet and so that that's what I that I that my new mantra is that so I hopefully that was a sufficient answer awes different than what you're talk expecting I mean congratulations on stopping drinking uh I'm very outspoken about the fact that I haven't had a drink since my daughter was born you know eight plus years ago and I have no intention of ever drinking again I just I I love just being in the moment present unadulterated and uh you know overcoming hypochondria like that can be absolutely paralyzing congratulations to you for figuring out a way to like push past that and be able to live your life man right yeah it it's been such an amazing experience learning from you both about like freelancing design uh and of course just your ridiculous work ethic and how you've been so uh productive over the past 20 years uh again I encourage everybody to learn from this guy I I've learned a lot from him I enjoy just uh be sure to watch his video of him playing guitar just great uh great video great video production and I'm very excited when I make it out there I'm going to hang out at your studio oh yeah sure if you have like a a fender P base or something like that like I'll just grab the base and let's jam cuz uh yeah let me let me t let me tilt the camera real quick yeah let's check it out let's check it out all right so uh I'm just going to verbally describe what we're seeing we're looking at a wall anybody listen something popped up on my screen is like something about the internet connection okay no it seems fine uh and uh whoa dude I mean you've got like those Fearless flyer style guitar stands that like just hold your guitar in position so you don't have to use a strap you've got like a fullblown movie theater looking thing and you got this that's a big uh screen back there yeah I mean it is how how tall is the ceiling in there it's probably at least like 15 ft it is 16 feet 16 feet yeah it's just giant Studio it's amazing uh beautiful wallpaper yeah I might be like tilted yeah so uh Gary it's been such an amazing experience we even get a preview of the studio which you'll see a lot more of if you subscribe to Gary's website to his YouTube definitely do that I'll have a link to that and uh yeah man it's been a pleasure to talk with you for the past two hours get such a huge injection of insight from you man you as well yeah this has been one of the kind of like a bucket list thing to have an interview with Quincy Larson which is awesome uh so yeah enjoyed it very much though awesome man well everybody who's listening hope you have a fantastic week until next week happy coding
