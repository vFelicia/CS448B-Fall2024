hey everybody its Jessie and it's good to be back I have a good weekend I hope all you had a good weekend as well today we're gonna start by going over a pull request so I got a really big pull request let me bring this over and y'all can check this out it's you can see there's a lot it's lot going on here okay so this pull request 41 so if you want to check it out the link to the repo is in the description and I I went over all of it this morning but I haven't merged it yet because there's there's a lot going on here and there are some big decisions made so I thought I'd like to give all of you an opportunity to give me some feedback let me know what your opinion is before we merge it since it's such a significant change to the project so just to give you well I'll go over and let you see if you can't bring this up on your own computer right now I'll bring it up so really appreciate this pull request that definitely addresses a lot of things some things that I had kind of realized but just figured out I'll do that later and there's some other things that I didn't even realize yet like for instance I had just done this I think on Friday and didn't even notice that I was getting this warning so I don't know maybe at some point I probably would have seen that but it's nice that this was caught so soon but so some of these are I think may help with some errors that have been reported or people are trying to run this trying to you know clone the repo and and start it up and they're getting some errors so I think this this issue here is probably where some of the errors were coming from so I know I had somebody recently on I think it was Twitter messaged me about it yes I think it was Nathaniel who's in the in the live chat you know frequently had a similar issue where basically I'll show you since I have it up now so basically was saying handle close isn't defined so this seems like that would fix it would fix that problem but here's the so here's some of the things that I'm not sure about and you know if you have a chance to go through and let me know what you think I'd really appreciate that but it is it is a lot so I'm gonna try to point out just a few of the areas that I'm not sure about I don't maybe understand fully and that way it'll narrow it down a bit if you don't really want to take the time to go through all of it maybe if you could just check out the few sections that I'm not sure about that would be helpful and one of the things I'm not sure about so I'm I'm sure that this change will fix some of those errors from from what I've seen and what I've read about it after I've done a bit of research to try to figure out exactly what's what the issue was so I know before in a lot of videos before we've been using arrow functions because it helps with this right inside the the function so we get the right value for this but evidently there are some problems with using arrow functions as well that I was not aware of so I'll show you I just did something so the new way so basically and you can see how so the pull request is from Matt right so you can see how Matt redid everything to this way but I just wanted to understand it myself so I was already adding this hover effect and I figured well okay well normally I would do this with arrow functions but I'm gonna try it this other way so basically we bind this inside this constructor and then instead of using arrow functions here we just use normal functions and then we call it you know normally down here so I am checking for a prop because I don't want the hover effect to be the default but basically it's just this onmouseout or onmouseover alright see I mean you can get the you get the point let me make it a bit bigger just in case you can't you can't see so I mean if you've been following these videos or you use react on your own you could probably see what's going on here the alternative being so right now in side nav right we're not binding this in the constructor we're just going handle clothes for we're putting in putting this in the Aero function I mean we're still calling it down here the the same way right so that's one of the things I'm just I'm not sure about what are the pros and cons of each I mean the the very the obvious thing is that this is a shorter way of doing things obviously especially you start to get more of these you know can really add up so aside from from this being the shorter way you know look is there some way I guess what I'm wondering is is there some way to keep this okay just like this the nice you know just one line really easy but then still avoid any errors that might arise from this so like the air that Nathaniel was having in particular where it it won't load the page for him and keep saying that it's not found so that's the one thing I'm a little bit I'm unsure about I try to do some research but just really didn't find a definitive answer so I'm I'm fine with doing it like this but I kind of want to get I want to get to the bottom of the issue and figure out like is there one way that is recognized as the best practice I know sometimes that there's there's not a way so that's I mean that's just how it is sometimes there's it's debated and I'm okay if it's debatable then I'm fine with going this way because I'd rather you know add another line or two and make sure that there are no errors that's that's fine with me but I thought this would just be a good time to to see all right how should we really be doing this so that's one issue the other issue that I wasn't sure about let's see I guess there's two more I wasn't sure about so this is so Matt's adjusted the components to initialize state in the class constructor so we are using the constructor here we're using the constructor here but I know in other components were not let me try to find one where we're not inside I guess we are in a lot of them so maybe I don't have one that I'm using that's easy to find oh here we go alright so here's the example so instead of doing this where I've just set state very simply instead using the constructor and using this set state so from what I understand and what I've seen in the pool request everywhere that I've done this has now been changed to use the constructor is that what I should be doing and this this really is not so much me like calling into question the pool request or doubting that at all because I think it's really solid and it definitely shows like Matt knows what he's doing and he did take the time you know to explain and not even just in the pool request but in comments to previous videos and things so this is more for my understanding of how have I been doing it wrong should I be doing it better I mean I want to do it better you know for myself because I want to do good work but also if I'm going to be putting this stuff on YouTube I don't want to mislead anyone into doing the wrong thing so that's another thing I'm just I'm not sure about I had been using this and it's been working right I haven't been getting any errors but maybe there's some there's some problem with this that I'm not aware of and I should be doing this all the time instead of this so that's number two number three is there's not really going to be any demonstration I just just need to say it so matt has ejected create react app so if you remember I don't know one of the the first few videos that we did for this project we actually tried to eject it so we did it we made a whole nother project folder in clone this project into that folder we ejected and then we compared sidebyside the the structure of the folders right so the reason that he ejected has to do with the sass files so he I guess and this is where like his his abilities definitely go beyond my own in terms of setting up web pack because I'm not really that great with web pack so I'm definitely going by his explanation because I've never done this with web pack but it seems like what's going on is that the Styles can be so like there's no more CSS files when we're in development and the sass it's just sass files so I mean I guess that's cool saying basically that when you go to build then they'll be CSS files but not during the dev process which should speed things up also the the way the sass files are set up is is different so let me show you and of course you know this is all available you can check this out or on your own but everything's set up like this now and you can see there's some comments for explaining how to import files and so I guess I would I wouldn't have to import any more into my components I could just use it all so this part I'm not gonna lie I'm I'm not exactly sure how this is gonna work just from reading this I'm sure if I tried to use it you know I catch on but anyway as you can see this is a really big pull request a lot of stuff has changed so definitely didn't want to just merge this in and say hey everybody hope you had a nice weekend everything's changed so that said there's definitely some good thing I think some good things in here and then there's some things that I'm just not sure about and it might be just because of my inexperience so I'm gonna leave it all to you let me know I don't think I'm gonna make a decision on this yet I think I'm gonna you all can let me know what you think in the live chat we're gonna do some code on on some other components so I'm just gonna jump right into what I was working on I just said my Pomodoro cycle and right when I started so this is kind of nice because this has been my little break in between we'll go right back into another one and start coding and that'll give you all a chance if you want to to check out the the pool request on github and then maybe later on either in one of the breaks between coding sessions or at the end then maybe we could try to come to some sort of consensus and that might not be a bad idea in case of people that can't watch until later they can still have a chance to join in so I will take a look at what's going on in the live chat since I started and then then I'm gonna start my timer and and get to work we're gonna be working on that generic card component I'll show you I already showed you how may the hover effect so I don't really need to go over that again but I would like to show you what I've done so far and making them I would like to have the option to make them links like the entire card be a link that you could click on I know that's not the normal I mean normally with material design you have little buttons at the bottom and you click those but I think yeah I'm pretty sure I've seen in apps like mobile apps Google Apps where you can click and the entire card is a link I'm thinking in particular the news so it still might be within the parameters material design but you'll see what I if you don't order to get what I'm saying then you you'll see in a minute I had someone in here at a few hours ago giving a bunch of emojis and things so that was kind of funny to see that but no one no one was in there and I didn't really see it until the person already left so let's see aside from that let's see both are correct okay hey everybody I see people were saying hi okay all right I'm getting some good feedback already basically just to sum up just for time it seems that the way that we have been doing things is allowed with the es es2016 syntax okay so some of the newer JavaScript syntax allows what we have been doing and so some of the stuff I guess that's in this pull request works as well but it's an older way of doing things so okay well at least I know I haven't been misleading people and doing the wrong thing I still really do want to know if I guess what with the what the error was coming from and how do I avoid that using the new syntax okay all right I'm going to so far a really good feedback thank you I'm gonna keep thinking about this as well while we're doing the other stuff because to be honest with you like I really I really appreciate all the effort that this took that Matt put into this so I almost kind of wish it were split up a bit into different pool requests you know because then I could pull in just the things that I know I want for sure and then have a little bit more time to think about the other stuff so I don't know if Matt's watching or not and I'd really I'd hate to ask him to redo it and split it up because he put so much work into it but we'll see well I don't want to decide yet it will give it will give it a little bit of time to think about it okay so let me show you I'm gonna pull this over to the side for now let me show you what I've been working on so here's the the nice hover so now if you do want to add a hover to any time you're using the generic card component and I mean this is in my project or if you clone this project and you want to use it to start so I know there are some people that have cloned this project in the previous project and are just modifying it and using it as the basis for another project which i think is really really cool I've gotten to see some some of you have sent me links either to a live demo or the repo and I've been able to like clone it and run it and it's really really cool seeing how you modified what I've done made it better adapted it so anyway if anybody's going that and you haven't told me about it I definitely want to know because I think it's really cool but anyway in let me show you how to use this okay so right now I'm using the generic art component in posters j/s so I have put in the actual content that is that it's supposed to be in there got rid of all the lorem ipsum and now if you add hover Abul to the generic art component you get that that hover effect which material UI has built in this depth or it's the zdepth but it's on the paper elements you can't use it on the card you have to use it on paper so I had to wrap this in paper and the only thing I had to do I don't think I had to change anything else yeah everything else I think stayed the same yeah because we had bound the styles to get some of the other things working like our flexbox stuff too whatever the the div is that's an immediate child of our other div so like our container did here this column so when we switched it off for paper when all this gets converted to just plain HTML it's still just a div so since we set up our Styles like that it was actually kind of nice had we added the style directly to the card in some other way or you know with a class it actually would have been more work so I didn't do that on purpose but it ended up being working out well we did have to get rid of the Box shadow on the card because we were having a double box shadow so that's kind of the only thing we had to we had to change from the default behavior of the card but otherwise that's working well so what I'm what I'm using now is okay I just got Sebastian just popped into Instagram and sent me a message so all right I got a Sebastian cool thank you so what I'm trying to do now is make it so that these can be links so I'd like for users obviously when it when they get that little hover effect that should immediately say this is clickable right that's why I'm adding the the hover effect also obviously the cursor changes so I want this to be a link and you can see I've already it I've already done that here it's linking out somewhere this is also linking this one uses a regular just a tag and then this one is using the react route or link component but here's the problem that I just noticed literally two minutes before I started this stream I thought like hey I got this I'm gonna be able to commit this before the stream and then I noticed this our flexbox stuff that was giving us a uniform height for all of our cards is not working which I kind of anticipated but I was a part of me was hoping it would just work I did think it would might not work let's see so that's that's basically our first challenge and I just remember that I forgot to set my Pomodoro timer so I'm setting it now and I'll bring it over here CEO can see yes so that's our challenge we want it to be a link but we also want the Flex bug stuff to still work so here's what I'm thinking I'm thinking that I'll move instead of wrapping things in a link here which honestly kind of makes it a bit more messy why not make it an option within the component so that I can pass a prop saying you know it's like probably I could just pass the prop giving the URL and then if that URL is there then it will use the link if not it won't be a link so my first attempt at a twitch I've I've since gotten rid of because it didn't work was I I tried to put in like within JavaScript in here in a ternary just to put a beginning link tag and then put the closing a tag down here that didn't work so I never really tried it before but I got an error when it got to the the a tag that was just the closing one so the slash a and I got an error there so I guess it just it can't handle I guess having the tags within JavaScript dependent on you know whether or not in this case we have a URL so the other option I'd rather not do this but the other option would be just to completely copy this and have a version that would use that would have the link in there I'd rather not do that I actually I just thought of another option that might be better I could take all of this card stuff and make it a constant and then at least I wouldn't have to copy all of this so not really sure maybe there's another maybe there's another way to do this so I'm gonna check let's see I'm gonna check the live chat just really quickly just in case anyone has pointed something obvious out that I'm missing and someone with the the tag lol lol which I've seen before which I'm not sure if it's if it's meaning to be laugh out loud laugh out loud or not but they're saying some really like depressing stuff and that's live chat which I'm not going to share because he wants to be depressed but it's like ironic right because they're they're tagged on YouTube oh well anyway I thought it was ironic all right so let's do this tyronn says can you put your cards in a div and then call display flex well I I could so I I kind of thought of that too like okay well what if I just put a div around here like a container div but then I thought okay well that's just going to be another level of divs that I have here that's just going to kind of make this a little bit more messy so I think I kind of want to put I do want to have this option in the component itself and that was kind of the whole point of this component was we wanted to have one component that could do anything you would want to do with a card you just had to pass in the right props so that was the idea I'm actually not sure like was that a good idea I don't know I think it's useful in terms of performance I don't really know enough to know whether or not this is more performant than doing it the normal way with materiai and importing all the different parts of the card but this is kind of like a really simple react app I don't think we're gonna have to optimize for performance like a lot we're not I don't know sometimes projects that are really simple it's just not worth it to try to think about stuff like that early on you know just get it done and then go from there all right so let's some first things first I want to test it out and just make sure what I'm trying to do is going to work so I am actually just gonna copy all of this stuff and just see if it works and then we can work on refactoring it to make it hopefully a lot smaller so this is going to be our normal let's go let me get rid of that space and we'll need we can keep paper as the element that's around at all and we're gonna copy this now let's see we want to check for I think I'll have two different option because we're gonna end up either using an a tag or a length tag depending on whether it's an external link or an internal link so I'm gonna need to check yeah I'll need to check for that as well so we'll have to pass that in as a prop so they'll actually be two different props that will get passed in it'll either be for an external link I think we'll call it URL and then those you could just put the URL in for an internal link we'll call it let's call it link I guess we could I guess we call it internal link an external link that might be better okay that would be more descriptive and obvious so in turn let's see if internal link mm no I just let's see internal link or Pixar Inc No all right I'm not gonna get complicated first let's just see the do the first thing if it's an internal link then we want to whoops wrong thing there we go send its own link we want to render this with with the a tag all right so if if the internal link prop is passed then it will be the href for this a tag and if it's not present then it's gonna render what we had there already okay alright I'm gonna say that I should make sure don't get errors okay great now there is yet and let's get rid of this and we'll test out our internal internal link equals if I stood ice yeah let me grab that link address gonna put that in there and now let's save it and it should be the same great okay so it is the same you can see that's that's working and these other cards are not links we hover over them and not links great so that part is working okay so I guess for the sake of anyone who's not that familiar with reactor what we're doing I'm not gonna be able to explain everything that's going on but let me try to explain a little bit so what we've done here is basically like in NFL's statement but it's with what's called the the ternary operator so basically when we see that question mark and then here that means if internal link is is true so if it exists right if it has a value then we're going to do this this first thing else we're gonna do this second thing okay that's what we've done now this is really nice but it's not going to be enough because we want to do three things so we want to check if there's an internal link or if there is an external link the reason being I'd like to use what we need to use the link component actually what would make this really easy and I should just check this let's try this right now here's here's my idea that could just make this whole thing a lot more simple if we use the link component but we pass in this as the href will it still navigate because I think so we're doing that right here and if we inspect it we can see that we're actually getting an a tag and then this is the href so I say that's worth a shot because we'll be able to keep it really simple just really simple ternary yeah let's let's try that and in that case we won't even have to have two different props which I kind of didn't want because that's one more thing that you have to try to remember as a prop so we can change the prop to just be linked and let's change this to linked and then our age link and then this is going to be I believe it's too I have I think I have documentation for a crowd or open on my other screen I do so our link is going to be yes it is too and we need to import this so let's import have it up here yes I do great so we can remove yeah we can get rid of this here we're not going to use it here anymore but we're going to use it here so hopefully I hope you can see and I'm sure a lot of you can already appreciate this but by doing it this way and including it in this component we can use this component in a lot of different places and not have to worry about including you know these things and wrapping things so we're simplifying every single time this gets used now it will be more simple to use already we won't have to include things if we would have continued with what we are doing here and and wrapping this you know in our posters j/s component and then we'd also have to do the same thing in any other component we had so it takes a little bit more work at first not that much more work but I think in the long run it definitely helps alright so I'd like to remove this okay should we put I guess we are using is exact let's see this exact true I just can I put it like that and I was just thinking do I pass in true as a string or do I pass in true within JavaScript oh well I'm not getting any errors like this and I'm assume that there's type checking and react router so I guess this works actually not I just think about it I'm I may be getting a warning I just haven't looked at the console in a while all right so now we're gonna pass in what we had before oops link is not defined yeah it is defined now did I take it out yeah okay and what did I call that I think the slash so there's actually a page for poster videos that I completely forgot about and I hadn't shown any of you so that's one more page who have to work on fortunately we should just be able to copy exactly what we did in the tutorial page and just use it I think there's maybe four videos maybe five I don't know no more than five videos that we'll just put in a page this won't be difficult alright and that I ever changed this no let's change this oops link alright let's make sure we've saved everything let's see alright great no errors so we have this one and this one let's see so I can't click this because I haven't actually made the page yet so it's not gonna take nanny to the page great so these are actually links they work I guess I could click great the only thing that I'm not doing now that it might be nice to do is open the external links in a new window I'm not sure I don't know if that's gonna be a huge deal that would be something that would be nice I would say that's something that it could be added like to the list of things to do to finish this up and really make it polish at the end but I don't need to ship with that feature I don't know let me know maybe you disagree on that because I would need then to check assuming that I don't want people to have to put in another prop I would probably have to check to see if it's a full URL I guess that's how I would do it to make to see if it's HTTP or HTTPS and that still wouldn't be a foolproof check right somebody could enter in I don't know I'm probably overthinking this anyway basically I think that's mission accomplished right we have our our flex box stuff that's giving us the same height for up for all our our cars is working again our links are working our hovers working so I think that's good let me check I'm going to check the live chat really quick just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes before I commit this oh cool Patrick had a good thought and you had this you had this way before I did Patrick so good job on that sorry I didn't look over and see it but he said I can check I can just use one prop URL and then I can check if the value starts with a slash and that's how I can determine whether its internal or external that's better I think that would be more reasonable than checking for HTTP or HTTPS yeah I like that idea breakpoint said page not found is on the github page not the previous code with the es6 syntax github pages doesn't play nicely with react router I believe and could be the cause yes that's so reacts the routing is a bit messed up for the github pages thing okay all right cool so it looks like looks like I haven't I haven't messed this up too much so I do have some good ideas for ways to improve it but in terms of basically doing what we wanted to do at this point I think I'm safe to commit this and then possibly revisit it with some of those improvements namely making it basically setting target blank to make things open a new window if it's an external link and then open in the same window if it's an internal link which is a pretty standard behavior that users expect I think I know I'm a little bit annoyed if I click a link an external link and it doesn't open in a new in a new tab so I don't know about you but that's that's what I've come to expect and I I like it that I like that so let me let me make this bigger there we go and let's check the status okay and so we're just doing to get commits we're adding at the same time and putting our message in all at the same time and let's see should I call the ocean feeling okay I think that's about right all right great everything past it works and I will push it up to github alright awesome so now that is up on github and two minutes actually I'm gonna I'm gonna do my break right now because if you remember I did forget to start my timer so it's been longer than 25 minutes so I don't want to start something new with two minutes left anyway so we're gonna do the short break I'm gonna take five minutes I'm gonna try to catch up in the live chat after that five minutes we're gonna go back and do another 25 minute session of coding after that we'll see we might be finished at that point I do want to make sure I get done in time to go home and take my son to karate on time today so it's not gonna be a super long stream definitely like to keep it under an hour and a half today so I think if that's the goal then probably just one more appointment or recession will be all we'll be able to fit in I just got a message that the stream status is now bad so in terms of quality let me know what it looks like for you all I'm not sure why OBS which is the the streaming software is telling me that I still have good quality going through so over 5,000 kilobits per second so I'm not sure what's going on there okay let's see I'm gonna scroll up a bit so I don't miss anything let's see I say it says I'm interested in contributing to this project that's awesome thank you yeah definitely check out github check out the repo see where you can contribute if you're if you don't really know where you can contribute let me know like send me a message and I could maybe give you some ideas of things that that could be done so yeah but definitely I would I would like it if you'd contribute umberto says for all the dotnet developers out there dotnet core 2 was just released a few hours ago so that sounds cool I don't really use dotnet often I see I did have to work with net last week uhhuh just for a bit I didn't really do much with it I actually just walked into somebody's office who was having trouble with it and they just showed me what they were trying to do that wouldn't work and then it worked so I I don't I didn't really do anything but it worked so that was that's the extent of my DUT and that experience okay Alejandro says guys do you think an IQ of 106 is good enough to be a programmer let's see I'm sure you you got some responses in the live chat my response to that question is going to be well first of all assuming that the IQ assessment is accurate right because I'm I don't know like if you get an official IQ test I suppose like you could maybe trust the accuracy of that although I mean it depends on different factors everybody some people just have a bad day right so assuming it's not just one of these online IQ tests it's not official and that is really the IQ which I'm a bit skeptical of but if it is then I would say it's it's fine to be a programmer I I guess I kind of think of it in terms of mental capacity and IQ I like to make an analogy to like physical capability in sports right there are definitely been instances where people who aren't physically like really big are able to let's I mean I'm from the United States and I played football which I you say American football so I'm most familiar with that so I'm gonna say that analogy of the sorry because I know a lot of you are not from the other states you might not be familiar but basically if you're not familiar with it the bigger you are usually it's a lot easier to play football if you're bigger right so people who are bigger usually don't have to work as hard to be good but there are lots of examples of people making it all the way to professional football and they're not really that big but they put in a lot of work so I think it's possible to be a good developer even with a lower IQ but you may have to put in more work so I don't think that there's like a cutoff of like a if your IQs this don't even no it's just just you got to work right so it's Sammy with a nice boy like if you're short and you want to play a basketball well like you better really work on your shooting because you're not gonna be really close dunking the ball or anything like that you're gonna be a threepoint shooter or something you know I don't really know what sports you all are into what metaphors would work for you but I think that that works as well with with mental capacity to a certain extent so anyway and I'd say this like I'll take somebody with a low IQ that loves coding and has it really like a desire to learn and a hunger for learning I'll take that person over somebody who's a genius and thinks they know is ever they know everything and doesn't really take the time to learn learn new things right I mean that's I don't know that's my it's my opinion on it there are other things other than just IQ that go into being a good programmer so anyway I took up all my time on one question sorry about that but I don't I thought it was a kind of an important question all right okay one last thing I just saw Sebastian said I just submitted a PR a pull request adding react helmet make sure everything is okay because I have some issues when I pulled your new code okay cool thank you Thank You Sebastian actually that's really cool that you added react helmet I'm assuming that react helmet is with helmet J s right so I'm going to check that maybe it's Sun show you changed your says document heading take some attacks oh okay anyway my other screen I just checked react helmet because I was mistaken and I thought that that was just using helmet je s with react but it's not oh okay is this the same thing that we had on a previous project all right cool I'll check out that PR thanks thanks Sebastian if you're not familiar I was thinking about helmet J s which is like security for node apps so which I've been thinking about including in this project but I mean at this point I don't really need it but before we actually put it on a server I've been thinking about including that if anyone has experience with that I let me know did do you like it have you worked with it how easy or is it to work with is it effective based on the documentation it seems like it would be a good thing to have and it wouldn't really take that long to set up all right let's start the Pomodoro timer for our second coding session I'll come back to the live chat at the end so don't worry if I didn't get to your question yet I'm gonna go back through everything at the end try to get to all the questions all right so we could can we do I'm trying to think of something that would be interesting to do that we haven't done hmm actually let's let's link up this video page let's actually create the page and we'll add in some of the videos and then we'll get to show how to add a route with react router so that might be kind of cool to do I know we did it early on we added react router and did that but I imagine there's probably some people who just started watching who maybe hadn't seen that early on so maybe this will be useful ok so let's go over just just show you what we were doing with react router we can check out side nav j/s and inside nav you can see we're bringing in actually did we bring this in no we have it all in smaller components so we are we gonna have to get sidebar item nav link this time where did we put all our routes oh did we leave our routes in I'm sorry we left them an app there is all our routes okay awesome okay so here's where we put all of our routes we're gonna need another route and I think what did I mean post your videos so I think that's what I put the name is so just to give you kind of a review we're importing browser router route and switch from reactor outer dome okay so see we've wrapped everything in browser router and now we can just put we'll just copy and paste to add another route and those two videos and it's going to be the component poster videos which we haven't made yet so let's make that and okay so in the views folder that's where we're putting all of our all of our views obviously we're gonna want to put post their videos j/s so we're gonna say touch source views coaster touch is now we have posted videos Jess great so I am going to go to our videos page oh wait it was tutorial that's what we called it so I'm gonna go to a tutorial page let's move it over here and then riaf in this one there we go and since these pages are going to be pretty similar I'm just gonna copy everything and paste it over here and I am gonna be able to get rid of some of this so we're not gonna need this paragraph and we may not need so many divs since we removed that paragraph you'll see we're gonna need to change the name okay so now we have this page we should be able to navigate to it let me alright we should we've taken out the paragraph so we'll know what the page what page we're going to whoops supposed to videos is not defined should be helps did we not we do oh we did not pull it in so sorry I forgot a step so let's let's back up a bit if you remember we we copied this route we put it down here I'm not even gonna look at the live chat right now cuz I'm sure you all caught that and now we're trying to tell me but we did not import it so let's do that now and we're going to import those two videos now it's there we go it works now and if you remember we already added the link with the correct correct route so when we click this we should go to that page great and there we go so we have basically the same content as our tutorial page except we've removed the text all right so what we want to do then I don't think I've shown you the page that that actually has the videos so let me show it to you and I had I think I mentioned earlier but I had actually forgotten that this page even existed and so I happened to click on that link okay so here's the page and so we just have video videos for tutorials for each one of each one of these things and okay so right now we have them all in one card I'm not sure if I like that I think I'd rather have them be multiple cards so each one would be well not not exactly a card right it's just going to be a video with with a box shadow so let's try to do it like that and I know we have labels yeah so we'll add this I think maybe we'll put this as an h2 at the top and then these can be h threes below I have been kind of going with a left align style for for everything so I'm switching from the center line to the left align I'm not a hundred percent sure about it but we'll see how it looks it won't be too hard to go back through and and Center everything if later on we decide that it it looks better centered okay but for now we're gonna one two three four okay so we need four videos so let's let's copy some of this so the first thing I want to do is put in our headers so I can just copy the at our h3 component along with everything else just go back to poster videos let's see where we can put this that makes sense that looks looks good so actually since we did have this this paragraph down here that seemed to work and it was within this container div let's try it there so we would say h3 yeah we're gonna an h3 and that first video was PowerPoint right let's see how that looks okay that's not bad it's really some bit small so I've noticed something a little bit odd so my all of my H tags were looking really small way smaller than they normally would be with let's say like a materialized framework which we had used before so what I what I had done so I noticed on one page the H tags were not small they were much bigger and the normal size that I would expect them to be I think it was an h2 and on another page it was really small so I checked them out and the only difference was that on one page the a stag was within a component that had a class of flow text so I tried adding the flow test class to the one that was smaller and it made it look bigger I actually I looked through what was happening in dev tools with which CSS was getting applied and it it looked weird in that nothing from the flow text was actually being applied it was all crossed out you know how things look crossed out on dev tools if it's not in use so it was all crossed out but it had a very obvious effect so not really sure what's going on there maybe it's just some type of bug with dev tools that it's it's crossing it out when it shouldn't be anyway I'm not that worried about it because it works like that so I'll show you the difference you see how that that's much bigger than it was so I'm just gonna have to remember to put flow text on everything which I don't mind flow text even on H tags because it does shrink them down on smaller screen sizes if you're not familiar we imported we brought over the flow text classes from materialise which is a material design framework similar to bootstrap but with material design so material you I didn't have something like that at least I I'm not aware that they have something like that but it's basically make it makes your font responsive so depending on the width of the screen your font is a different size okay so actually I like that I think that that looks okay so let's copy this and we should be able to just copy this container right yes I think so I think I want to keep it all within this wrapper because we have some vertical alignment going on here it won't really matter that much because this is always gonna be taller than the screen but just so that I don't really have to mess with that let's keep everything within that container okay so this should just give us an idea whoops not what we wanted at all so is that probably because of the Flex that we're using so we could probably fix this with just with flexbox stuff so let's give that a shot before I get changing the markup yeah that's got to be something with flex because we're giving it a width 100% all right so let's see the line rather yeah all right so let me see in the live chat who is okay breakpoint just asked about the Instagram the Instagram live feed only they only let you do live stream for an hour so I usually just let it go for an hour and then turn it off I don't I don't try to restart it so I sorry you missed the live stream on Instagram but it's only there for an hour okay oh you know what actually I have a guide to flexbox up on my other screen that I never closed out from Friday Oh Patrick city's never been able to find the Instagram feed I'm not really sure the inst I think if you would do if you would search for my Instagram name which I don't remember what it is but it's in the description it should come up as one of the top ones right I I don't really search that much on Instagram so I'm not I'm not entirely sure but I think if you search the exact name then it should come up okay all right so on my other screen I'm looking at some of the flexbox properties because I can never remember which witchcraft via switch alright let's try this No okay what else I need to do mmm yeah okay so Berto says you can try it try with of 100 VW because 100% translates to 100% of the container that's true but it should so the container div is much bigger so I'm thinking the problem is with Flex something going on with Flex box so let's take off I guess I can I can test this out easily where's my Flex deal and after there we go see so if I take off flex see it's working it's working fine which bad maybe I'll just do that that seems like a much easier solution let's just do that there's we don't really need flex box here there's no sense in vertically aligning these because they're gonna extend that they're much taller than anyone's viewport is gonna be so let's remove the v/line wrapper which will get rid of the display flex I great that works I make sure okay this is behavior we want okay so normally I wouldn't I wouldn't do it like this so I would probably I guess each one would be its own column with the width of 100% but it looks like this is all working out fine the only reason I like to do it like that is occasionally I've run into issues where if I didn't keep the structure of like container row column like the materialized grid structure I would have some on a small screen a very narrow screen you could scroll horizontally and there's this white space and I found that if I always put everything within that structure I don't have that problem seems like I'm not really having that problem here which is okay although I guess I am this should work though because it's not like I'm going outside that structure everything is still within the column so in this case I think we'll be fine the problems that I've had when I've tried to let's say just put an H tag like right within the container and not within a row and then if it's a large amount of text and the age tag then it it goes over but I think we should be fine I do want to put an H in h2 let's see where I can put this h2 that would make the most sense maybe I can put it in this mmm I think I wanted yeah I think I can do it like this I can't remember with this page is called poster video tutorials okay and since we're not really gonna do that that verticalalign i guess we don't need this get rid of that and then we can get rid of all of this and this and we can now make this a stateless functional component so let's do that and we want to find another stateless functional component so I can just copy it button did I not make anything see the social component I thought I at least had some of them like that oh well you know I have a lot of them in that pool request which I put on my other screen I guess copy and pasting only really saves you time if you can find what you want a copy alright let's just just type it out there it is yes okay so what we want to do your student side here for now are we even yeah we're not even taking any props right all right see if I did that right hey awesome I did all right cool so I didn't really do a great job of explaining what I was doing so let me take a moment just to explain so we had had in there a little bit of JavaScript to check on the heights of things and the heights of the header and then deduct that from the height of our container okay that was to ensure that when we vertically aligned something it actually was look like it was vertically aligned on the screen and it wasn't thrown off because of the height of the container also it was on on screens where the content didn't take up the entire height what was happening was our container was extending down below even though there was no content there so you would still see the scrollbar you wouldn't see it on a Mac but on Windows and Linux you would see the scroll bar in the browser which made you think you could scroll but you could only scroll down a bit and there was nothing there so I didn't really want that so we had trying to queue it added that in was it it may have been Sebastian if it wasn't Sebastian and I forgot who really did it I apologize but we didn't need that right so well this pages has enough content that that was not necessary so we we took it out since we took it out we didn't need state anymore because you can see that was using state to have this top coordinate so we when we took out state then we no longer needed to have this as a class we could make it a stateless functional component which is a little bit cleaner you can see how we've we've done that we're able to remove a line here two lines here and then of course the few lines down at the bottom where we have all our closing brackets and parentheses so I just cleaned it up a bit so hopefully it's easier to follow with a bit of explanation and let's see once I actually don't want this margin bottom zero anymore that was also part of trying to make sure that we don't have this overflow that causes a scrollbar so that yeah there we go that added just a bit at the bottom which is nice it actually could it could do with a bit more here at the bottom I'm not really gonna mess with it now I think it's it looks fine great okay so we have our actually see this this is not really small again what happened to our flow text who for some reason our float X is not getting applied how how it was that's odd cuz here this time it actually is showing that floats X is getting applied which is different than what it was before but for some reason right like this font size should be closer to 40 for an h2 hmm all right well I'm gonna have to check that out later because our our timer is up and I'm probably going to depending on how long the question answer session is I may finish this up and commit this we'll see hopefully I can I can get the right videos in here at least and the right headers and yeah that'll be good for the for the rest of the day I'm gonna try to get this finished for now I'm gonna go over to the live chat I'm gonna answer the questions if you're just here for the coding that portion of the stream is over so if you need to de quit watching now totally understand thank you for watching and you know come back again some other time I should be doing a stream again tomorrow and mostly every weekday around 200 p.m. Eastern Time if you can stick around and you have any questions please put them in the live chat now if for some reason you can't put them in the live chat or you can't stick around to hear the answer you can also send them to me on Twitter either an or a tweet or a direct message or in any other social media that you like I'm pretty flexible whatever your favorite is just find me on it and message me there alright so I'm going to get to it I'm scrolling back up to where we left off the last time I checked the live chat and I'm just going to go down through and try to get get to as many questions as I can all right see okay kevin has a great idea so kevin says we should do a contribute MD that says the steps to prepare your environment to work in the repo so install get note clone the repo npm install NPM start but very detailed that's a really good idea so I've actually I've thought before at various times that I should do that because well before I started doing the videos I thought it'd be a good idea because I would like to get some interns or student workers in here I'd really like to help the computer science students to get some real experience and some projects for their portfolio but a lot of them have no idea how to use git or github or NPM or any of that stuff they just they don't do that in any other classes so anyway I think it's a great idea and if I thought it would be useful before this but now that you know we're really working on these projects together with all of you watching now what makes even more sense to do that so I will try I'm gonna put that on my Trello board I'm gonna do that right now so I don't forget that's also something that if if any of you like writing out like technical this would I guess be a bit of documentation if you like doing that then please feel free to to do that that I imagine it would be the type of thing that would be changed and made better and more comprehensive as time goes on so but to start with something just very basic would be better than nothing to help people out so anyway I'll put it on my list to do if any of you you're interested and want to get to it before I get a chance to then that's awesome so let's say I'm actually I'm gonna copy and paste exactly what you would you put in here Kevin cuz I don't think I could put it any better than that understood and I'm gonna give myself maybe like two Pomodoro sessions and this is just to get something there to start out with if I was trying to make it really good I would give myself more time but for now just to get it started I don't want to put a big number here and intimidate myself and then I'll never do it so anyways there I won't forget it by the way if any of you want to check out this Trello board that I'm using to kind of keep track of this project the link is in the description let's see so anyway thanks Kevin for mentioning that okay let's see okay cool it looks like refactored genetic hard cool Patrick just linked just about the the card server some refactoring there which that's awesome so check that up okay cool let me bring this over so anyway awesome thank you this is that that card that we just made but cleaned up so this is like I was saying to make all this card stuff into a constant and then that way and our actual you know return here see how much more clean that is right that's instead of having all of this in there twice right now we just we just have this really so much more clean thank you okay there's some stuff with so for the Instagram profile let's say there's some confusion so I'm looking at it on an Android app so I don't know if the iOS app is is very different but like when I go to a profile if somebody has a live stream or a recording of a live stream up there's a little icon it looks like the YouTube icon and a ring that's kind of like red purple it changes colors a bit around the users profile picture so if you click that then you'll be able to see it so there's no there's no text or anything like that it's just that ring around the around the profile that lets you know that there's something to see okay I just see Sebastian was saying that I do not need the parentheses if I'm just throwing the arrow function right so let's see what time it is yeah oh and that's since I'm not passing anything in I don't need that oh cool so I'm Bert Oh actually I'm Berto asked does float X go on the div as in float X h2 yeah that's actually a good point let's try to put flow text up up here oops and then I can get rid of this completely let's see if that makes a difference all right cool great job Humberto catching that so evidently flow text does not work if you put it directly on the div which how did it I thought it did something to that age three maybe I'm just I don't know maybe my lies are just being fooled there and in doing let's see okay yeah I guess not I actually kind of liked that better when it was a smaller so like this the font weight was lower but I can change that later awesome okay so good to keep in mind you can't use float X on the h2 which is interesting I you can use float X on P tag and it will work but evidently in the H tag it does not work cool Joseph says hi Jesse just want to let you know that I love to to hear you and listen awesome I'm glad glad you enjoy listening to the stream thanks for saying that that really means a lot to me so all the the positive comments really mean a lot so I actually recently I've had not a lot of comments but a few comments basically saying Jesse you talk too much just code and don't talk so which my first reaction is usually like just just now which is kind of to laugh at it but that's about like the extent of the negative comments that I've gotten which I feel really lucky about that but anyway my point is like the positive comments really really mean a lot and they counteract any like somewhat negative comments in terms of just my morale and my desire to keep doing this so anyway I really appreciate that thank you oh cool when I'm bear testers a hundred percent agree with us his comment oh thanks I'm bear to appreciate that oh cool Patrick has submitted a pool request for the gist that is it still up here yeah yeah yeah awesome that's cool actually I I was hoping that you would do that because I mean obviously I could have just copy and pasted this in but then you wouldn't know if it wouldn't have been credited to you it would have been my commit so I'm glad that you're gonna do that and then you know it'll be on record for all time that you submitted that and that was your work and I liked it better like that that you'll have credit for it cool alright so I've gotten to the end of the live chat which that's cool not really a whole lot of questions today which sometimes that happens not really sure what what causes is sometimes we just have like a neverending list of questions and sometimes it's it's almost nothing but it's good today because I didn't want to do a long stream anyway so we're about it a little over an hour and a half with the streams end up being a decent decent length of stream anyway so tomorrow I should be able to stream at the same time I'm actually I'm gonna check my calendar on my other screen really quickly so I can give you a more accurate let's see yeah I don't I don't have anything on my schedule right now so it should be 200 p.m. tomorrow I'll put out a tweet about it and I'll try to schedule it as early as I can tomorrow morning wait a second no tomorrow I'm not at work sorry I don't know what I was thinking tomorrow I'm not working so tomorrow there's no stream I'll be back on Wednesday and it should be a normal frame so one of the perks of working at a Catholic University is that we get extra holidays there are these Catholic holy days that we get off that no one else really gets off so tomorrow I don't work because it's the Feast of the Assumption so I don't have to work tomorrow so that's cool I'll get to hang out with my kids but I won't get to hang out with all of you which is a slight letdown for me but I'll be back on Wednesday and oh I had to add a few more things let me read the last few comments here Joseph says I think 10 positive comments will erase one negative comment in your memory yeah it's like that unfortunately that seems like it is it seems like the negative comments stick in your mind more I really try to fight against that though and stay positive about it so hopefully my ratios a little bit better than 10 to 1 but yeah that's that is how it how it is so I really appreciate all the positive comments and umberto says wait tomorrow's a holy day of obligation yes it is tomorrow is a holy day of obligation these things too Tuesday I don't really know it might depend on your particular diocese and whether or not they move it but since it's a Tuesday I doubt it would get moved like to the nearest Sunday so anyway so yeah if you do happen to be Catholic tomorrow's a holy day of obligation so Catholics are supposed to attend Mass on that day but I think that's that's it that's all I have so anyway and enjoy enjoy your break from the livestream tomorrow and I'll try to enjoy and have a good time with my family as well and thank you so much for all your help and all your encouragement and the live chat really appreciate that and I'll be back Wednesday most likely same time 2 p.m. Eastern thanks again and have a great have a great two days
