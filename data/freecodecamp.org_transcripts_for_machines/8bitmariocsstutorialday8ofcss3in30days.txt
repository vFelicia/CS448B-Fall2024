welcome back to css3 in 30 days guess what's happening today we are going to be making an 8bit super mario with just css3 i'm not joking check it out over here we got day 8 8bit super mario or 8bit mario uh what's gonna happen here is check it out that that's what we're gonna make in css and then i just have this little kind of css animation when you click the wahoo button see something like that uh the sounds you have to provide yourself uh but that's what we're gonna be doing and so it's pretty interesting how it's done the html is beautifully simple and if only that were all you had to do then that would be pretty cool but the css is a little bit interesting and i'll show you why now keep in mind this isn't necessarily a practical use of css3 i don't know how many times i've ever been paid to make super mario in css except for now whoa let's head over to our course files here and download the 8bit number 8 8bit super mario project files you'll go ahead and do that and come back right here to this part of the video and what's going to happen here is we have our index sandbox and final css as usual here in the index check out the markup i'm going to go down to the final result here all we have is a button a div with the class of mario block and final mario i always prepend uh final double underscore for the final res uh the final css so let's go up to the sandbox this is all the markup you're going to be using so we have the button and this is mario here mario block and mario two divs that is pretty cool so how does this work let's go over to the browser again and i'm just going to inspect this and show you what's going on here super mario is in a div called mario block so here he is he's in a block it's 320 by 320. pixels i have it set up as 16m by 16m and we'll get into the measurements in a moment here in there we have final mario and there's simply just one line going across it's one by one block which is 20 by 20 pixels or um as we can see here 1m now you can see that there are 16 blocks going across that's because we've set up in final mario block 16 m so this is 16 by 16 which equates to 320 and 320 pixels in this case uh and so that means the container we're working with is 16 by 16. and each block of the mario pixel i guess we could say because he's an 8 bit so he's like a 16 pixel uh sort of thing the width is 1 m so we have 1 m and 16 of those fit across so final mario is officially just 1m by 1m and what we're doing here is using a bunch of box shadows you can see his colors here look at that that is hairy but that is how we do it we just have a box shadow that has multiple values separated by comma just putting the place in the colors on a grid so for example 0 and 0 is the top left and then 1 and zero is one m over and that you know it's at the top so it goes in that sort of grid like uh fashion so that is how we make mario using just box shadows so go over to your let me show you here in the final css you can see how it works we have box shadow and then a bunch of values now i'm not going to make you watch me code all these values out i'll get started to show you the pattern and then i'm going to leave it up to you to finish it now you're going to need to reference the effect the final version pretty pretty closely but keep in mind you're working on a grid a 16 by 16 grid you simply are just kind of painting by numbers or cssing by numbers let's jump into our sandbox let's go we'll get started with the basics so we're going to style the mario block that is the container wrapping it all we're going to say display inline block position relative margin 80 pixels auto width 16m height 16m the reason why we're using m's here is because the container within the mario block which is just called mario when we use m's it's r it's referencing the the size of its parent whereas when you're using ram it's relative to the root so with m it's relative to its parent so when i say 16 by 16 m that is the height and width of the mario block container you can see here in the browser we've got a container here that is in theory 16 by 16 m's now what we'll do is we will do basic styles here for just mario display block width 1m height 1m so now officially we have one let's call them pixels just for this moment they're not actual pixels this 1m block is going to be like one big ass pixel and there's 16 of them going across and 16 of them going down so now you just have to draw mario using box shadows within that so let's just say the background color will be the that blue background we have here in the container e7 double e f1 okay this is where the magic happens let's say box shadow and i'm gonna go zero m zero m and e seven e e f one so that is the first line that's the top left zero and zero is going to be that blue so what's gonna happen here is we want this here is here is mario this is officially his size right here let me just inspect him there we go so there he is right there so this first block is going to be that blue second block blue third fourth fifth all the way to 16th is all blue then we go down 1m blue blue blue blue guess what next one red red red red blue blue mario skin color mario skin color mario skin color you gotta kind of kind of get that so now let's go here and i'm just gonna start adding some numbers i'm gonna just blast through the first row of blue fast forward it and uh and then we'll start getting into just the first little bit of mario and then we'll take it from there so first line that 1m0 m and i'm going to copy that blue color there so the next one over this is x x axis and yaxis so this means it's going across horizontally this means it's going down so we're just going one over none down next one copy this whole line and i'm just going to say 2 and 0. then three and zero then four and zero then five and zero we're going to do this all the way until you guessed it 15 because we don't need to do the 16th and let's just blast through that now all right so i've got the first row here of blue you're not going to see it at all because it's just the background color so now what we're going to do is we're going to go down one row here uh one pixel on the yaxis and we're going to go over however many blocks that is until we get to the top of his head his hat so let's start that off comma and then we're going to go we're going down now to the next level so i'm going to give another space that maybe that will work just for visual purposes and now let's say we're going to go 0m and 1m blue again copy that we're gonna do that up until the fourth m one two three four that's all blue now you're not gonna see anything yet but now if i go with the next row or the next m over we're actually going to start with this hat so that's just going to be flat red so we're still now we're at 5 m and 1 m so we're one down and we're five over red let's just save that i want a semicolon and save that and see if we have anything bam we have the first official pixel of mario's hat now watch what happens when i add more and i'm gonna go over six and then just go seven all the way up until nine so seven save that semicolon at the end if you wanna view it look at that we've got the first sliver of his hat that part right there so the next couple are gonna be blue and then three of his skin tone so let's go ahead and do those together and then i'm gonna get you to keep going by yourself here but i'll give you the colors before you go so the next one is going to be 10 it's going to be 10 and 1 and that blue color so e7 ee f1 we're going to do uh two of these so one two that's going to be eleven and now we're going to do the skin tone so let's go this will be 12 13 14 15. so that'll be 12 13 14 and 15. the skin tone that we have set here for mario uh is ffc 966. copy that paste it out a couple a few times there semicolon at the end to test save let's head over here look at this we've got the first layer so we've got first the first row and the second row which you can start to see it start to take shape that's what it will turn into this is what it is right here so let's quickly do the next one and then you're kind of on your own here i know i keep saying that but i'm just going to i'm just going to do that so we have just a bunch of red so we have from two down so we got we got we're at zero now and now we're at two so two down zero so you're at the left two m's down and red so now we're going to do this all the way up until 12 m and all red so 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12. change those numbers out real quick and now save that semicolon at the end to test to save it head over now we should be okay uh we don't you can see here mario has a few blue pixels there and i put them all the way over there so i just need to change the first few from red and to that blue color the blue brand color so it's gonna be this one's gonna be that color then number two is gonna be that color and number three is gonna be that color save it head back over now we're talking now it is more like it needs to be the last couple here it even looks like perhaps the one two three four this one has one two three i think that's three yes that's three so this tone up here is actually going to be number 15 and one it's going to be that so it should look more like this there we go and now these two have to be the skin tone so you kind of guessed it here copy this do do this is going to change to that e7e ef1 and these values are going to be 13 and 14. uh actually no that's not the skin tone the skin tone is ffc 966 and then 15 is e7 e ef1 semicolon save that now we've officially got our second row you can see that it's starting to take shape so now what you're gonna do is go through and map these out yourself because obviously this would be the longest video ever if i'm going to write you know 300 lines of box shadows so i'm going to leave that up to you do it just actually do it and try it yourself and if you get bored you can you know move on but try it it's kind of an interesting challenge to you know go through this and map mario out now what i'm going to do is i'm just going to quickly fast forward this video have it be finished and then i'm going to show you how to do the wahoo button just because so i'm going to go ahead and do that uh before i'm actually going to give you the final colors so you can obviously go to the final css but brown is just brown there is just blue and yellow okay so you are okay and i believe that there is like a black in there for his eyes so those are your final colors you don't even need me to tell you what this this is you already got these colors this is brown this is um yellow this is blue and then that's black so you'll be fine now what i'm going to do is i'm going to fast forward this and i'm going to show you how to do the animation so here we go all right there is mario there is all the styles there the final box shadows there and so now what we're going to do is i'm just going to show you real quick how to do the uh the animation this one right here woohoo cool so we've done this before i think the animations it's just keyframes and animations is pretty straightforward so let's go ahead and do that i'm going to style it up here so it's easier to see and we're going to start off with uh wahoo is the id for the button outline none because i don't want that that ugly outline there so outline none and we're going to go and say wahoo active so when you are actively clicking it sibling selector uh it's going to be mario block we're selecting that and what we're going to do is say animation we're going to give an animation we're going to call it wahoo mario it's going to be a 0.8 seconds ease in out and loop it once and then we're just going to build a keyframe so keyframes and we're gonna call it wahoo mario and then at zero percent we're gonna say left zero bottom zero transform rotate and it's going to be zero at the beginning i'm going to copy this out paste paste paste change the percentages of the timeline to 30 percent 80 percent and 100 so at these different intervals this is where we're going to at these uh kind of stops we're going to do make the animation do something so it's going to go to 200 pixels left and 200 pixels from the bottom up it's going to rotate negative 25 degrees and 80 we're going to do 400 pixels bottom is going to be zero and then zero left is going to be uh 100 left to zero bottom is zero and transform we can just take that right out now if i save that and head back over here click the button just like that there is your mario awesome good job good job uh this was a doozy of a lesson like i said not really a practical application of css3 but i mean if anything you got to see that you could do some pretty cool things and then some animations you know mapping things out on grids it's pretty cool um i don't know how often you're going to be doing this sort of sort of thing it's more so just a challenge and just to show you this is kind of a cool thing so i hope you enjoyed that lesson we've got some more great stuff coming up for day nine thanks for hanging out with me for so long and
