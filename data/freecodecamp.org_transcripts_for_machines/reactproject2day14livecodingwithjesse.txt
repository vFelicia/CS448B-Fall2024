hey everybody its Jesse and the problem that we had yesterday we were working on trying to send data to Reich which is a project management system through the Reich API from our react forum we couldn't get it to work well now it works thanks to Kevin who had a pull request and I didn't check the times exactly but I'm pretty sure that Kevin was able to get it working in less than three hours which i think is pretty amazing so just to put it in context as maybe it will help you see why I think this is so amazing so when I was trying to get this to work months ago using on the clientside in the browser using jQuery I probably worked on it for at least a week maybe more before I got it to work and I had already been using rike sosa miliar with it a little bit not necessarily using their API but Kevin was able from the time I think from the time I ended the stream yesterday to the time of the pull request was about three hours so he was actually able to set up an account with write a free account get the API key learn enough about the API to actually get it working all within a few hours so anyway just amazing so if anybody out there is looking to hire a good developer definitely recommend Kevin because that was just super impressive I mean he's been really helpful throughout the entire project but I was I was very impressed with with that especially since like I said I had so much trouble with it when I first started working with it so I've only added on just a bit to what he had had done today was actually I had a meeting like literally as soon as I got here I didn't even get into my office I still had my laptop in my backpack and everything and I just went straight to my meeting and so I haven't and then after that I was never really added a lot of time a straight stretch of time to work on anything so I haven't really gotten that much done I was I was able to do a little bit so I'll show you we're starting to get a lot in the server.js file which I think I had said that that that was going to happen so it's starting starting to get a little bit hard to find everything but let me let me see okay here's this stuff where we're doing some things with rike and I don't know what is going on and sorry sorry for that just to my train of thought it's just derailed but it smells like I don't know like gasoline or exhaust from heavy machinery in my office right now like really strongly so there's construction going on in the parking lot they're repaving everything so there's a lot of equipment there so maybe that's it but it's really weird like my I'm on the interior of the building so it's not like I'm near a window or anything so I don't know if I if I pass out during this dream then somebody called Franciscan University and tell them to come get me out of my office um Wow it's just really strong I'm gonna keep going because I just started this dream but we'll see hopefully it's not hopefully it goes away I'm gonna turn a fan on just the lowest setting so hopefully that's not too noisy for you all I also do have the Instagram stream going so I had some people stopped in there if you're watching on Instagram and you'd like to see the code on my screen that we're working on please check it out on the free code camp YouTube channel okay so here's what we're working with here see I mean obviously you can see what's been done you can also check it out on github I've already merged in Kevin's pool request if you check out the pull request it was pull requests 31 yeah it was 31 so he provides an explanation of what the issue was and how he fixed that let's see Patrick also helped out as well so he had commented on the pool request and so it was great work there's also an issue going on right now that Sebastian had had raised yesterday during the livestream and then he actually opened up a detailed issue on the github repo about the tests failing so there's a pool request open right now pull request 33 that is being worked on so Sebastian and Kevin and Patrick are all trying to figure out what the issue is so I haven't pulled it in yet because it's not if we get it to a point where I think the problem is solved then I'll pull it in but for now just know if you were getting some errors like some timeout errors on the tests that it's we might have a fix and when I say we I mean they because they're really doing a great job on it and I've I've been working a little bit on some other stuff on here okay so let me let me just go through this quickly basically this is pretty much what fix things so if you remember we were we were trying to put this data in you know same day that pretty much this these things I added and I'll explain this in a second so with the exception of these two lines all of this is from Kevin so some things that he did have to change he had to add this content type header and then also had to encode these key value pairs so if you want to see more of an explanation of this like I said check out the pull request but that's where we're at now so that's pretty much all that changed and as far as what I did so basically without these two lines this makes a new folder and Reich but I needed to make a new project which I don't even know if I said that yet but Reich has folders projects and tasks so the highest level in the hierarchy is the the project and then within the project you can have multiple folders and multiple tasks and things so I'm actually I'm not sure how it all works so we use it as a department as a whole we write to coordinate things like a high level for my projects I use Trello it seems like right can do a lot more than Trello can but I don't need that more so it's easier for me to just do things really simply in Trello since it's usually just me and you all working on the project so anyway to make a folder I actually needed to add I'm sorry to make a project instead of a folder all you need to do is add project and then assign it an owner ID and let me I'm not going to show you the the actual variables but I'm going to change them just a bit and then show you what because I had to do a little bit of a strange thing to get it to work so let me bring this over so that y'all can see okay so this is from my dot n file it's not my entire file obviously but these are what I added here this share ID and owner ID so you can see how I had to put it put it in I actually needed to make this an array in quotes otherwise it kept saying that it was invalid and for this one I had to make an object with owner IDs and then an array with the ID that's the only way would accept it I actually attempted to put all this stuff in here and then just you know had the idea within it didn't work so probably tried I don't know maybe five different combinations of ways to do this and this was what ended up working so if you are working with the right API and you're having issues with this this is how you have to do it I do remember having similar issues when I tried to get this to work with with Ajax on the client side and so I just for that I think I had to do like some escaping of quotes and things like that but basically this is the format that Reich is looking for so not sure if any of you are actually using light right you need to do this but okay so I just got some messages on my Instagram feed that they actually evacuated my building but it looks like I see some people on the hall I think we're good so evidently there was gas in the building they did evacuate nobody seems in a hurry I'm just gonna keep going I'm sure if it's that big of a deal somebody will knock on my door and maybe we'll see actually I'm gonna check the live chat now because I have and I completely forgot to check the live chat let's see okay I still had a lot chat open from yesterday so I was looking at the wrong one for a second let me close that okay so hey everybody oh cool Gavin says hey checking in from Jamaica awesome and I also says he said day five in the series alright cool you you've remembered you said you're gonna start at the beginning of the series so you've caught up with a 5 to 5 days already so that's great shyam says total newbie when it comes to react that's cool that's cool I'm still I think I'm still somewhat of the new bit myself this is a good place I'll try to explain as much as I can thanks I am says that he'll call if I do pass out so thanks okay so Gavin says his tests are also failing locally okay so it's I mean I'm not happy to hear that other people are having problems but it's good to know that at least like it can be replicated which is good because then we could probably narrow it down it looks like some people were coming back into the building so maybe it'll be alright actually hold on one second I'm gonna ask what's going on I turn on the fan and I told the people watching me if I passed out the conference okay so the evacuation is not mandatory I think um I'm good I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna keep streaming and they said the the I guess it's from gasoline oh I'm not sure what's going on but they said it should dissipate soon so I'm slightly lightheaded right now but also I've been feeling a little weird all day like tired and stuff so if you if you see me on the Instagram feed I have like my eyes definitely look like I'm really tired so anyway yeah I was up kind of late last night working on the react course that I'm taking that Udacity course you can actually do a lot of it on your phone which is cool so I was putting the kids to sleep and on my phone doing it and then signed up just staying up and doing it which is cool I guess I'm learning Redux which is awesome but I had dreams about coding all night and I actually had a coding nightmare so I'll get I'll get to the coding it I'll tell the story this will be the last thing before I get actually get to the coding so I know I know some people are a little bit annoyed by the amount of talking I do so I I'll be done in a minute uhhuh but anyway I had a coding nightmare that that last site we worked on the cata catechol institute site that I looked at the site and somehow they had managed to change it all and do the layout with tables and they had like this weird inset border thing that just looked like it was straight out of like the 90s and totally changed the colors everything the images were like all stretched and like not the right dimensions and I was like I was freaking out so actually my wife like was trying to get me to wake up anyways she like touched me I just like jumped up I'm just like wow that was it was terrible so I guess normal people have nightmares about like I don't know like scary things like what but I have nightmares about people changing my layout to using HTML tables so anyway it looks like cool there's some discussion going on in the live chat about those errors with the test so that's awesome so thanks for like I said um I'll pull it in I mean uh if I I haven't been that involved with it one because I had never gotten any errors so if I can't replicate the issue I probably not really gonna be able to contribute that much to fixing it so also it seems like Kevin and Patrick and Sebastian are getting to the bottom of it and seems like you all are close so hey not bad I have a few people in the Instagram stream that's cool they're given some given some love and Instagram so thank you alright so let's do this let me tell you what we're gonna try to do and then then we'll do it so right now where we are is that when I hit the submit button this does make a full project in Reich and I would show you what's going on but I don't want to show you all the stuff that's that my department is working on just there's probably nothing secret in there but just in case somebody would get upset about me showing it I don't want to do it but basically it is working I was able to get a project made what happens when the project gets made is that we get data back and we get a bunch of data back you can actually see what what comes back here so I can I can atleast show you an example of what we get back so this is the response that we get when we create a new folder or project in this case we've we were actually creating a project but they send back pretty much the same thing either way and what we really need is this ID so this is the ID of the project if we have this ID then we can attach files to that project so unfortunately you can't attach the files at the same time that you send the initial data so like all our form data we actually can send initially but we have to wait until we get this ID back so we're gonna get the ID back we're gonna get this value and then we're gonna use that to attach our file so we're gonna check out attachments we want to create attachments yes okay so we'll be using this folder so there's not a separate URL for projects there I guess considered the same loves folders like I said I'm not exactly sure what what the difference is really and Reich but I just know that the people that use Reich a lot said that they would much rather have them be projects and not folders so I made them project so we're going to do basically this obviously this is not in the format that we need to put it in right this is curl but this is what we're gonna do let's see mmhmm usually they give they say like what everything is that you need to put in the in the call no they're not doing at the Sun okay well basically we'll need the same thing so we need our access token like we're like we're already the language yeah no big deal we're gonna give a file name Content ID oh here we go and then here's our attachment content so I've already done this with with Ajax so I'm going to I'm gonna show you all how I did it with Ajax cuz that'll probably be way easier to read than this curl I don't know about you but like that's not really a format for me if you're using postman you can actually copy and paste this and then convert it to whatever format you like so that's I mean you could do that if you want but since I've already done that before and converted it to be able to use it with Ajax I'll just copy that over so I do need to remove my API key from this so just a second and I will I will do that okay okay so this with Ajax accomplished what we needed so the only thing okay so here's what that project ID goes so in our our URL we just need to add to the to the end actually not to the end because then we still have this attachments here so be folders then the project ID slash attachments okay so we need to okay in our headers are bearer obviously after bear this is where our API key goes okay so I've removed that but there needs to be an API key there and then we just need to add these headers and then our data is going to be so I mean obviously this is a variable from what I'm doing on the current site so let me see I just I'm looking at the code on the other screen and like I said there's API keys in it so I can't show you as well but I'll try to bring over what I can okay I don't I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this in exactly the same way as I did so let me just show you how it was getting that all right so wow this pace over so so weird let me change this to there we go at least we get some syntax highlighting so what I was doing to get the files since this was all clientside I direct Lee had access to the Dom elements so I was getting the upload the actual upload input and then grabbing the files from that to make file lists so not really going to be able to do that so I can't exactly do what I did before but you get the idea of what we're what we're gonna try to do so the first things first is we need to be able to get this ID from the response okay so let's see we already have an example of the response which let me go back to that create folder there we go okay so this is what we need to grab inside data we need to grab ID so let's try to get that and I've forgotten my timer so let's see that as well all right so right now we are getting actually let me see I'm gonna check I'm gonna check the live check because it looks like there's something in here that's definitely relevant okay Kevin says it makes more sense in this case to put the get the attachment from the server yeah well I mean we're already you know we already have it in the server we're saving it so I agree all right so let me does I think that I I will be able to show you the response let me check it really quick to make sure that my API key is not in there okay yeah oh I will be able to bring this over then oops accidentally it's smaller instead of bigger so then make this bigger so y'all can see so this is currently what we're getting back and that it would be so we're we logging this early down here okay so here's where we do the Reich folder you're passing in the what ends up being the name of the folder project okay so we're longing it here nice let me I think this is what this is right that's why we're we're logging not this but this part right our status that we're getting back okay Sebastian says oh so you might want to limit the file types that people can upload yes I'm definitely going to do that so I'm gonna keep saying that for for myself so that I don't forget and thank you for reminding me so yeah before any of this goes live definitely need to make sure we do some some things to limit what can be uploaded or you know whatever at the very least we're gonna limit what can be uploaded I'd like to whatever reasonable steps should be taken when you handle file uploads with node I would like to take those steps so I may need to maybe maybe I'll just do some research I'm sure there's there's some stuff out there about it but let's see for now so I just want to say just can I grab it like that I don't know if that's gonna work let's see let's see what we get no not gonna be able to do it like that is that actually we're kidding that's weird how did that crash oh sorry I was still like I talked about yesterday I still have not done anything to to fix the Corsair so that I was getting and now what did I do oh that's the one right check let me close that cuz we're definitely not gonna use that I'm not gonna use this are they let me just use what I'm gonna do I can't decided I was just gonna use Firefox in Harris the it's not telling me what what the air is Oh all right what did I do okay it should have started yeah she just started it let me okay Oh syntaxerror what did I do oh it's because I tried to console and I forgot to put a plus all that because I forget to put a plus sign oh well template literals have spoiled me Oh remember to put the plus sign in okay now let's see what happens okay so that that in fact is exactly what we want all right let me check I'm gonna check the live Chad okay thanks Kevin I should have checked the live chat about six minutes ago to avoid in some of this okay so the status status right now is coming in as a string that's that's why so basically we're right here see it says text so it just wasn't thinking so I need to change it it's a JSON and now let's see what we're getting so yeah let's try this data let's see what we get there we go here's what we need all right great so look I can't believe it took what like ten minutes to get to that point about most of that was spent trying to figure out why how I messed up the server but anyway this is what we needed all right so we have the ID that we need I can get rid of this trying to think if there's value in keeping the rest of the status I really have no need of anything else in that status right now so I guess I'm okay with just pulling out this this ID okay there were a few other things about the server in the live chat so let me scan through that quickly okay Patrick says you can set the accepts property input on the front end so I can in the browser client side but you should also check on the back end to prevent people from getting around it yeah for sure so actually if you've never worked with file upload inputs before that's a really good point so basically you can set on the input itself what you want it to be able to accept but people can get around that so I guess like really easily and I don't know maybe you've done this before like you can just inspect something in dev tools and then change it change the HTML and then it will change the way that that field functions so a good example of this is like a password field so if you have a password and password field let's say like you you don't remember what the password was you can just go into dev tools take out password as the type of input and then all of a sudden you'll be able to see the string instead of those little dots so a similar thing could happen so basically doing clientside checking of what the files are and restricting the files is not enough because you can get around it easily so you want to do something on the server side as well so ideally you do both because you do it on the client side so that immediately the user gets feedback that hey you can't you can't upload that otherwise they try to upload it and depending on how you set it up potentially they might not even have any idea that there that file type is wrong so you do it on the client side basically I mean it's pretty much for user experience because people can get around it if they really want to and then on the server side that's where you're checking things and that's more for security the user never sees that they don't even have to know about it but that's where you really want to make sure that you're not gonna like execute a file it's gonna mess up your server today that's my lesson on security today okay so Patrick is giving me some advice here about how I can make the server work all right so let me share this so what how's my permission denied indicating me oh well whatever okay so let's Oh I'll worry about the the server later I guess not really big deal like right now it's knowing what I needed to do for what we're working on right now okay so just try to remember where we were all right so we have our ID next up is send the files based on that ID so we need to basically we're gonna add another another one of these and so I'm like I'm gonna copy this because a lot of its going to be the same so we're going to take in actually read it we're not taking two things right yeah so we need let me think we need the ID obviously but then we also need the files and let me see how are we getting this file objects okay all right we'll just give it to file so you don't need to we don't need so in our body basically we don't need any of this stuff we need just the just the files and okay post is fine this is the same content type it's gonna be how do we have to loop through this I I mean shake it just occurred to me that it I may only be able to send one file at a time so I'll have to loop through the files and keep sending the request so I mean that only changed slightly how we do it yeah that actually won't be a huge deal so with I guess then within actually within here might not be a bad place I mean right now all we're doing is just console logging whatever the files are so that will still console.log just to make sure that it's working but within here we could probably call like add attachments and we're gonna need actually we are we're gonna need that ID I had to be careful the order here so we're not actually so within the on end we're making that first call to Reich and then we're getting the data back and then after that is when we want to send the file otherwise we're not gonna have the right ID so this is not the place to do it then here yeah not the place to do it but I still need I wonder all right I have a few ideas I don't think the first one will work let me tell you well a few my ideas are and then I'll give everyone a minute if let me know if you think they'll work and Hut so the first idea is I just do this form on file function and I put that down here so after we get the status back just run that down here I'm thinking hey if that works that's great I'm just not sure if it'll work if I put it in here but we'll see that's probably the simplest thing the alternative would be inside of this right here where it currently is I save the files yeah so I'll save the files to a variable here and then just use that down here and pass that along with the ID I mean obviously like with within a loop like I'm I'm gonna have to call that multiple times yeah okay so those are my two ideas I guess I'll give you a minute to respond to that but the first one would be so easy to test I'm just gonna do that so I'm gonna copy and paste this and I'm just gonna put two their side don't mix it up alright so basically all I'm gonna see oh I'm looking to see is do I get anything there let's see will you need to upload a few things let's upload three files so we should have that shouldn't be called three times and that doesn't know so from right here so we had it it ran the first time and it did not run the second time okay so for whatever reason that does not run in here so I mean we could try to make that work or move on to the second one my time is up for the Pomodoro session so I am going to take five minutes and go back to the live chat all right so for now I'm looking away at the bottom just to see what would you all have to say about what I was just doing and then if I have time I'll scroll up and see if there's any questions okay Kevin says loop inside the then of the right night folder okay she's saying loop inside this then correct which is what we're gonna try to do okay kevin says it didn't work because we're we would be listening for files after the request was already parsed so since we're we were trying to do this and listen for files inside this on end right it's it's already and it's already been parsed so enough nothing's happening at this point so of course it's not gonna pick up on that so this then is definitely not gonna work so let me just remove that and move to move on to plan B all right Rohan's here hey everyone how's it going Rohan asks what did I miss basically we are we're able to go from our server Jay s file and then on Form submit make a new project in Reich and then we get back the ID of that project and we can take the ID now and we're going to attempt to use that ID to send files and attach them one by one to that that particular project okay I'm scanning really quickly to see if there any questions that I missed trick ISS asks can you tell me how to group content in HTML with div and span properly so not sure if you're still watching because that was asked quite a while ago but if you are I mean I would say properly I don't know that there's a proper way to do it it depends on what framework you're using and what you're trying to accomplish in terms of what divs and spans you use generally most of what you do is going to be in divs you know your spans are more like shorter blocks of content like within like if you if you had a paragraph for instance and one line of that paragraph or even a few words you want to add some special styling to that would be a good place to use a span but the if you had larger chunks of content then you might want to use a div generally that's how how they're used if you're using a framework like an by framework I mean like bootstrap foundation materialise they're gonna have set out how they manage the layout of the page and they're usually with a div structure so a lot of how you do your your divs is gonna be based on what that framework is already laid out so if you're doing it from scratch and you're doing everything I mean you can lay out your dues however you'd like but like I said in general if it's in line like with within you know paragraph spans work well you know a small piece of content otherwise divs are usually used you know for major layout things if you're trying to make like some cards on the page those would be divs hopefully I answer the question I said not sure here you know watching still but maybe it'll be helpful to someone but anymore I always use some sort of CSS framework so the structure of the divs is basically already decided hi Gavin I just saw the comment he said it sounds weird hearing my voice at normal speed because you've been catching up it always sounds weird when I hear my own voice on these things probably it doesn't matter what speed it is it's always weird okay so my timers up I did get about halfway through checking the questions so all of them go back up we'll do another Pomodoro session here and then I'll answer some questions so hey Mark's here hey how's it going you you still still looked in the new job is it going well let me know I haven't I haven't heard about it in a while alright so it looks like cool Kevin has put some some code in the live chat that will most likely do what we're trying to try to do here let's see Kevin always has good code so I'm confident that assuming that I can paste this in the right spot it will work so let me just paste this it's really hard to like read out code so let me paste this in here so y'all can see what I'm saying so basically okay so pretty much what we were basically this is the club code to make like plan B work so we have a files where files and we're going to save the files to this so then we can access it later on even within this form on end and yeah and then we leave this leave this where it is right because it won't work otherwise all right so it's I'll put it up here at some point I'll probably remove this because I won't need the console.log the files but I it would be good for troubleshooting to leave it in at least for now okay probably actually don't need the name in there but I was even in for now okay so same thing that's going on here except instead of console logging we are adding the files to this array so files push file right okay then and since we'll have all the files in this array when we get down to here we can oh yeah okay yeah down to here so we get down to here we will have gotten the ID back right so we can get the ID from here and then we can call our function that's going to attach the file but we will want to loop over that all right yes okay files use coded files right can we do map on this I know it was confused a couple days ago about trying to use a map on things that you shouldn't use map on but it's an array right so we can use map so file add attachments and it's gonna be ID all right so now up here all right here we go yeah okay yeah that's the right order for now let me get rid of this and I just want to so I should be able to get the file name out of that so let's make sure that this works ideas not defined oh I'm sure you've already seen the mistake that I made but what I I just use ID and instead of actually getting the ID here so what I need is this there we go now let's give it a shot whoops file was not defined oh because I was saying files and we're not sending files were only sending one file at a time so better to name it file anyway okay there we go okay awesome so it's working in the sense that it is calling it the correct number of times for each file and we're getting data on a different file each time so in this case we just console.log the name but we have you know the whole object there it is correctly giving us the ID as well great so that's what we need to work with now we just need to use the right format to send this I forgot to start that again awesome so I commented out this bit here also we'll probably I mean we're not gonna want to run this like if there's no if there are no files so we'll probably want to check first to see if there's file but for now I'm not worried about that I just want to get it to work and then I can check okay so I had started to put in what I needed here and then I I don't know what got me sidetracked but I dropped down and started doing some things down below there so now we need to okay so we're sending we're not gonna send files anymore we just want the one file so in the background my music today is some really like mellow jazz it's the coffee table jazz station on Spotify so you have to let me know do I seem like more relaxed and mellow am i coating better than normal or not usually I listen to way more upbeat music like electronic music and stuff so I'm kind of interested to see what would affect different types of music have on my coding not really very scientific can't really keep all the factors the same from you know each time I code but you'll see okay so Kevin said it's it's fine to not check for their files because if there are no files the loop would just run zero times yeah that makes sense this cool all right well we have actually a really low viewer count today not sure what's going on maybe maybe I am really really boring today because I'm I'm too mellow because I'm listening to the Jess anyway I'm not really sure what if it causes people to view or not view some days there's a lot of people in some days there's not and I'm doing the same thing pretty much every day alright so we need here on the other side this is what we need so let's add in headers content yeah oops and we can get filed me contenttype oh now I remember why I went down cuz when I looked at this and these two I realized oh we're only sending one file at a time and that's when I started thinking about how we can get one file at a time okay oops I think that's what it is we'll find out awesome and okay so instead of data we have body okay and file will work all right so this looks oh we need the URL to be different so I need the ID in there so I'm gonna I'm not gonna use an environment variable I'm going to use a template literal and with the ID and then attachments great all right that should be enough actually I don't know I'm not really sure if I need these we'll try it without it but I guess we'll see we'll see how it goes okay so let's see okay so when we hit submit this time it should create a project in Reich with the title of tests it's not gonna have any data in there because I'm not we're not actually putting any data in there right now it might have actually we will it'll just say folder description as the the body of you know the project will get the ID back and then it will add probably we'll just do the same three image files will get added to that and I will verify that on my other screen where I have reich open so I'll be able oh man well yeah we actually just made a ton of test folders so I bet our project manager is wondering what's going on so anyway whoa let me delete quickly all the tests folders we have now so I don't have to search through them to find which one is the one we want to look at there's no batch delete option and that's unfortunate because I have a lot of testing so I guess Reich recently came out with a desktop app which is kind of cool but also not not really great because I had thought that one of the first desktop apps that I would try to make once I finally learned how to make desktop apps with react would be a Reich desktop client for my my department but they already beat me to it so I guess it's cool either way we have it I just thought it would be cool to do but anyway let's give this a try now so I've deleted out all the other tests that we made whoa crash what'd I do oops I put at least I remember just to check this I D is not defined where Oh why is ID not defined we're getting an ID okay that's why all right let's give it a shot all right so I've seen the project has been created and awesome let me see did the file go through Oh No okay so the project was created the file the correct file names came through but when I try to click on them it says the file appears to be invalid or broken sorry we can't load it so I did something wrong but so here's what we know is working which the good news is we know that it is actually getting the ID back and it's sending in this case three requests so it's sending a request for each file that we've we've uploaded which is great the correct file name is getting there the only thing is the file itself is not working which I didn't really check what let's see so I'm sending this okay I'm not sure why that happened let's take a look so we're getting the file scroll down here okay so here's your eating the files from on file okay so the files here all right let me let me check the live chat to see what y'all think okay Patrick says for each would be more appropriate okay cool I'll change that to four each Rohan says I need upbeat slash EDM or something similar for me to get to do anything yeah this morning I don't know what it was I was listening to some like really upbeat electronic music and I don't know I was just feeling weird and was feeling like I don't know like a little bit like I was getting a headache and I couldn't focus and I thought like I don't know like maybe I just need to chill a little bit so I so I did so I relaxed a little bit I put my feet up on my desk and just listen to some jazz for a bit and I started feeling better so that's why I went with it but like 90 probably 95% of the time I do this in the upbeat music Oh okay Kevin I just saw your message about the contenttype is that's what what's messing this up actually that makes sense maybe the contenttype is doing that so what maybe this isn't where I need to get let's see file type now actually that it that is it it is tight that's what I need it's twice oh okay that that makes sense good good either okay cool I'm I'm actually really happy about that because that that was probably our a problem and otherwise I was a little bit at a loss as to what could the issue could be all right is even another shot okay no errors let's check it out hmm actually I got the same problem as I did the last time this do the order does the order matter here I'm not sure if the order matters but I guess when I did it over here where did I have it at no I had it here so it shouldn't matter I think what's going on I just want to see what we're actually getting and we do this okay that that seems like the right type right try content type application okay let's try okay so let's check out so in the example reusing oops this is not it in the example it's using this is the content type so let's give that a shot same thing same issue okay so I actually downloaded the file from Reich just to see what would happen so yeah it won't be damn it she's a file format preview doesn't recognize okay see okay right now I'm just kind of looking over the code and seeing if I can see something and think of something that that we're missing here I wonder if they're looking for something like we had had done before so actually no we didn't end up doing that I'm sorry I was thinking about one of the possible solutions to this and I think what I was thinking I've ended up not working anyway well we we got pretty far without hitting a really serious issue so it's not bad I do want to see the times yeah I want to give this working so this stream may end up being a bit long but I have an appointment at 500 p.m. which is its Eastern time so I can definitely go for Fri another hour so let's say let's give this issue like a half hour and that would leave a half hour for questions probably won't need that long but you never know maybe we'll need it and I say that just because there's not a whole lot of viewers right now so let's let's try anyway so we got about a half hour about another we'll do one more Pomodoro session to work on this problem we'll take our five minutes to do a little some some questions and catch up in the kinda live chat I'm just right now I'm just going through right now making sure I didn't misspell anything okay just checking to see like the files that we are getting are being uploaded and they work so something something's happening and we really transfer the files then all right well yeah I figured that Sophia all right so now's a good time to take a break usually when I get stuck like this if I do take a little break it's usually I'll get some idea at least something new to try so I'm gonna go back to the live chat I'm gonna scroll up to where I left off at before and try to get to any questions or see if I missed anything and then in five minutes we'll go back to this problem at this point honestly I don't have any ideas for what to try next so hopefully I think of something now we got a few more viewers it was actually we're down to sixteen viewers I saw at one point which is crazy we're never that low so I don't know what's going on the only times we've been this little before is once the YouTube notifications weren't it just people didn't get them a lot of people didn't get them and then the other time I was trying to stream during some big tech conference and the tech conference was livestreaming and I didn't realize it so other than that we usually have more people than this all right where'd I leave love okay alright see there's still a lot of discussion about this there's Aires okay cool so it looks like Gavin was able to get the test to pass so that's that's cool good to hear that okay Patrick and Rohan I see I see everything you're saying about trying to get the the localhost 3000 to work so oh they said I'll try that out later on today or maybe early tomorrow haha now I said I see how many times you all were trying to tell me that I had contenttype in there twice sorry I didn't I didn't look over and see that thanks for continuing to try to try to remind me about that okay Joseph said that that that actually works so basically the way that we're doing it up here worked for you and postman so I wonder what's going on no page John Hanson said finally I caved and installed create react app so over the last oh I don't I don't even know how long John's been working with react but trying to set up react and web pack and everything from scratch so he finally went with create react app which if you're not familiar with that that lets you kind of bootstrap react project and get started without having to know anything about web pack so alright cool let me know how it goes then at least you can get started and start doing react stuff and not worrying about your build okay John John Hanson said that he got his YouTube notification exactly on time so maybe it's not the YouTube stuff who knows what it is oh wow okay so Patrick's and YouTube notifications haven't been on time in a month sometimes he gets notified the next day wow that's crazy kayvon I'm not I'm not sure how you how to pronounce that exactly that what syllable to put the emphasis on but I'm gonna say kayvon and then because we have a Kevin's I'm gonna try to differentiate that but is asking if I use Redux so I did not use Redux for this project but probably be using Redux in a future project because I'm learning it right now so I'm taking a course from Udacity on redux so I was working on it earlier today on my lunch break so Redux will be coming most likely as soon as I get done with this course and I get a project where it would make sense to use redux okay so that was I've gotten to the to the end of the live chat and I've also gotten to the end of that break so let's give it one more Pomodoro cycle and give it a shot try to get this to work and we'll see so basically like everything is working just how we want it I mean we obviously we need to finetune things before this would be ready to go you know in a live situation but basically everything's working except the files won't go through properly it's in terms of like it won't open we get the file name it shows up as if it's a file but when you click on it it says the file appears to be invalid or broken so let's try I'd like to try maybe this is try a different file type so I have this xcf file and see if that works mmm and actually that's weird that did not get through at all I mean let me show you again let's refresh show it one more time that's odd it's actually it is creating when I do that it's creating new projects but it's trying to add those three there we go finally for for some reason when I try that the first two times it was trying to add the same three files again really weird all right so let's see it looks like it did the same thing for this as well I'm gonna download it and open it up just just to be sure well there we go and it said it cannot open the image all right so definitely doesn't matter what type it is all right so I guess now it's time to do a little bit of research then and maybe I can try I'm sure either either stackoverflow or we're gonna go to NBN's documentation on file files let's see okay got some stuff so that's a good sign let's see I'll pull this over and let's see this so nothing obviously with Reiki API alright so I got a few up here let's see what's going on okay a lot of less ones for this let's see doesn't seem to be fixed all right let's try another one let's see if that won't ever get fixed okay so this is we are using SendGrid and our files actually might not maybe we can try I don't want to try it right now but if we can't figure anything else else out maybe we could try to send the file as an attachment to our emails that we're sending through SendGrid and see if we can get it to work through there maybe that I mean at least maybe we could rule rule some things out maybe but let's see what's the all right that's not going to be helpful all right I'm not sure okay so it was false broken okay not really anything there that's useful okay no answers for that one all right let me check and the live chat here looks like there's a few things okay so Kevin I see your comments let's try them out I'm going to try to do some debugging okay all right let's see what we're getting there that's odd which should it be I guess that's it's close enough I was thrown off by the type right but I guess that's what is supposed to be okay so kevin says formidable files don't appear to be noted buffers which note fetch handles well so maybe reading the file directly from the path with FS read file to get an actual buffer okay so let's see I'm gonna need some help so see where so where am I gonna do where am I gonna put FS da tree file are we talking like where we somewhere in here where we're grabbing the files the project managers sent me a message on slack and said dude I'm getting like a test email every minute from you yes this is happening okay so let's try to put okay so can I do something like this on this this file before we send it over or do I need to put it higher up guys this we're talking this is we're talking about here okay not there that's so Patrick had a good idea that I could just set up a free bike account to use for testing then I can show you all what's going on and I won't spam everyone else with this stuff that's a great idea she was excited that when I told her I'm working on the new version of the Resource Center so don't think it's that it's that big of a deal but it would be cool to be able to show you what it looks like okay let's see I suppose you said path to an upload directory file where all right so I see Kevin and Patrick are putting some code in the live chat for me but all right so I'm a little bit confused all let me paste this up here so everyone can see I'll get rid of this stuff all right so kevin has posted this and Patrick this and I'll have to wait a minute there's a look there's a delay on the video so I'll have to wait a second to get a response here so so I could put this okay John Hanson said I'm confused too thanks for saying that Jonah it makes me feel better I'm not the only one that's that's confused yeah Kevin and Patrick you guys are awesome and so I don't you're just like both of you are so knowledgeable and I think you're just like steps ahead of me all the time so it takes me a minute or two to catch up and figure out where you all are at okay so we it looks like we have a better way than to do this so let me show you the latest okay so if it's rifo so this is going to go then we're in in here or do I need to put this inside here instead of okay patched it inside the files thought map which should be files thought for each okay yeah I never changed the Fourier so each is it file of files or file in files I can't remember which one it is we'll see see if it works okay this in all right thanks Ron I don't know I don't smell the gas anymore here but I'm definitely feeling lightheaded maybe I'm just used to it I can't even smell it anywhere oh okay cool Patrick says I can just do files that or yeah where my follows up for each and then well let's cool all right so now I'm going to put that in here and then get rid of this portion of it and this portion yeah okay that's great okay so we have files for each ferry foul I think this is what you're trying to tell me so I mean just check this out okay so instead of the file we're sending this buffer all right okay so we need the file name header which so okay so that's not I can't get the name anymore from that so maybe I should just pass in I mean I know I can get it on the of ik so I guess I could pass in a name and tight oh this is a good sign look at that file size I'm feeling good about this one let's check it out I'm trying to find which one is the the right one cuz they're all just named test there we go all right it works yay let me see I can show you I'll show you a little bit of it basically I'll just zoom in and hide all the stuff that I'm not sure whether or not I should show just because it's exciting that it finally works so here we go check it out so anyway Liz sorry I'm putting your name out on YouTube but there we go there's our files and there's our our project tests folder description here and our files so just in time this just went off right after we get it to work so that's awesome I'm excited I'm happy let's just really quick kind of go over what we did that made it work and definitely thanks to Patrick and Kevin for figuring this one out because I was I had obviously tried everything that I could think of at the moment so let's go so basically the the what we did different then was instead of sending you know whatever this file was that we were sending and we used FS read file and we were able to get the buffer and put that in there so I'm not familiar with with this FS rifo I'm not familiar enough to explain in any more depth than that why it worked but just hang if you're trying to use a similar setup which sometimes people are sometimes I get messages from people that say like that they've cloned my repo and then they're modifying and using it for their project so if you're trying to do something similar this is the fix probably want to read up more on exactly what's going on here so I'm lazy I'm not gonna attempt to explain it because I don't I don't know enough to feel comfortable explaining how this works I've never used it but that was the solution and awesome yes I'm celebrating going on there in the in the live chat so yeah really awesome it's it's great whenever we can get things working figure it out so alright so I'm gonna go now and do some question and an answer here in a minute so if you're just here for the code that portion is done otherwise you're going to stick around for question answers put your questions and the live chat now and I'll try to answer them you could also ask me questions on any social media channels and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can I will say this I have I'm a little bit behind on the YouTube comments on getting to them all so I've just been obviously really busy between work and then some side project work that I have for clients and the Udacity course and then my wife and four kids it's it's pretty busy so I do I try to get to the comments I've seen some of them and just not really had time to give you a good answer so I I'm not ignoring you so if you're waiting on me to reply comment I'll try to get to it whenever I can so anyway before I get to the questions just quick recap of where we are and where we need to go so from this point we can get data from our form that data can then get emailed it can get sent to a project management system along with the file uploads our file uploads are also getting saved to our uploads folder so what we need to do then is actually send the data that a user uploads through the form okay so from all those text inputs and check boxes okay so we need to send that format it in a way that's somewhat decent so that it shows up in a readable way in our project management system in our and in our emails and then we need to put some sort of security measures in place to limit what gets uploaded what type of files get uploaded probably want to limit the size of the uploads as well I I suppose could get crazy if you know we get a really huge people trying to upload a lot of really huge files so probably want to do a limit on the number of files that can be uploaded at any one time and also the size that any one file can be let me think and I guess that's it for the forum the only other thing we had talked about doing that I'm still not sure about is having some sort of database to store this data or possibly sending the at least the data from the text fields and checkboxes to a Google sheet just to have a backup somewhere so still not sure about those may or may not happen we'll see and then other than that we do have one other forum that's going to be a very simple form to deal with no file uploads just a few text fields and we just have some UI stuff you know some basic things probably the only difficult I won't even say difficult the the most difficult thing that will have to deal with after this is our images because we're gonna want you'll see I'll show you in an upcoming stream but our images are using isotope so I don't if you ever worked with isotope before but a JavaScript library that's called isotope and I can't remember if it depends on jQuery or not so we'll see but we'll try to do something similar with react and see what we can get all right so now I'm gonna go to the live chat and let's see yang Jian Xiao says I'm new here it seems like I'm at the end hi yeah you are you are at the end so yeah sorry about that but you will yeah as I'm Berto says you'll be able to see the recording so you thanks for for joining in though and thanks for for saying hi in the live chat hopefully you can make a live stream in the future at some point okay so I have okay so okay Danny see Danny says thanks for answering my questions on Instagram awesome yeah you're welcome no problem so yeah as I say I'm on lots of different social media things and I'm I'm happy to answer whatever you know questions and things that you that you have let's see she she Jun says hi hey how's it going thanks for for joining in so I'm gonna scroll up a bit I did get through most of the live shot already so I won't have to scroll up too much but I want to just double check make sure I didn't miss any questions okay I'm Blair tail has some some helpful tip here it says one small editor thing that I use a lot in Visual Studio that works in Adam just different keystroke if you want to move blocks of code up or down select the lines and push control arrow keys instead of cut paste okay cool I see I'm gonna try that so I don't know if I don't know if you gave me the keystrokes to do it in Visual Studio or an atom but I'm gonna try it so ctrl arrow keys alright that didn't work this rectum I know okay so different yeah different in atom so I'll have to see what it is an atom but that yeah that actually will be helpful to me so thank you for that now billion says you sound like Remi Malik that's cool I've never had anybody say that before but I'll take it I'll take it I like I like him Umberto's says I love mr. robot yeah so Remi Malick is the the guy the actor that plays the lead character on the show mr. robot so actually I watch season 1 and then a few episodes into season 2 so yeah it was it was pretty cool it was really interesting just just I don't know to hear about all like the different like hacker stuff and how they do things it was pretty interesting although I haven't seen anybody that's watched after like season basically from the end of season 1 on is it still good like is it should I try to watch the second season then I mean season 1 was pretty good okay so maybe it's different on a Mac to do let's see let me try it again yeah and then I tried command I tried control yeah while controls doing crazy stuff on my other screens let's try option no not option no yeah not really sure it's probably some combination command command control oh cool Joseph awesome thank you so Joseph came through with the correct so if you want to do this which actually looks really cool now that I'm doing it on a Mac on Adam on a Mac you use command control and then your up and down arrow keys that's really cool I like that and for a single line you don't need to select anything yeah let's try that oh nice check that out don't even a select so that was that came from Kevin thanks Kevin that's really cool alright rohan says season two of mr. robot is good alright awesome so it is just season two season three have they had a season three yet all right well I've gotten to the end of the live chat this has been over to our streams so I'd say now is the decent place to to stop okay cool it's I guess season 3 mr. robots coming out in October alright cool good to know off to check it out and see the last time I checked on Amazon Prime video they only had season 1 but maybe though maybe they'll have season tution since season 3 is coming up but I think that's that's about it for today I'm actually pretty exhausted I don't know if it's all the gas streams that I've breathed in today if you're confused by that watch the beginning so or just in general being tired or you know exhausted from all the code but it was pretty cool we definitely accomplished what we wanted to accomplish today thanks to to your help and so tomorrow I'm not exactly sure we'll be doing tomorrow whether we'll try to polish this a little bit more or move on to something different we'll see but thank you so much for watching and for for all the help and the live chat I really appreciate that I will be back tomorrow and probably same time I haven't checked my schedule yet but probably at 200 p.m. Eastern Time and we'll work on this a little bit more so until then have a great day
