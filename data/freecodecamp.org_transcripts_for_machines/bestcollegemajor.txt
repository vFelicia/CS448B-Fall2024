I would strongly recommend studying computer science I would recommend it above other stem fields and here's why I have lots of friends who study Physics I have lots of friends who studied chemistry I have lots of friends who study life science most of them have kind of seen the writing on the wall that the actual highpaying jobs are working with software and they've had to go and learn to code you may be able to take more programming more mathematics more more things that are relevant to the actual Developer jobs that are out there that are generally the best jobs in the country in my opinion that are going to give you a good combination of flexibility being able to work remotely career trajectory you can go all the way up to CEO as a software engineer and of course compensation
