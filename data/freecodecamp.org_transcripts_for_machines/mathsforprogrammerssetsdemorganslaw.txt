in this video i'll be introducing the very last algebraic law of sets known as de morgan's law de morgan's law was founded by augustus de morgan and it states that the complement of a union is the intersection of the complements or it says that the complement of the intersection is the union of the complements so we're going to prove that the complement of the union of a and b is the in is in fact equal to the uh complement of a intersected with the complement of b so to do this we have to show that uh the complement of a union b is a subset of a complement intersection b complement and vice versa so let's get started uh suppose that x is an element of a union b complement if that's the case then by definition x is not an element of a union b and if x is not an element of a union b that is if x is not an element of the region a union b which is the red here then surely x is not an element of a and x is not an element of b and if that's the case then by definition x is not an element of a complement and x is not an element of b complement therefore x is not an element of a complement intersection b complement so if we go to the other side here we start by saying let's let's suppose that x is an element of a complement intersection b complement then by definition x is an element of a complement and x is element of b complement by definition of the complements x is not an element of a and x is not an element of b and with the same logic x is not an element of a union b because x is not an element of this region and x is not an element of this region so surely it's not an element of the two regions combined and by definition of complements x is an element of a union b complement
