hey everybody its Jessie welcome to live coding with Jessie if you're watching this recording later because you were expecting the stream to be later on at my normal time 200 p.m. Eastern I'm very sorry I I intended to stream at 200 p.m. and I tweeted that I would be streaming at 200 p.m. and then about 5 minutes ago I realized that I had set the stream to go live at 11 a.m. Eastern time so I'm not even sure how many people are gonna be watching this live because it's it's so much earlier than normal and I told everybody the wrong time so apologies again but I thought I could have either canceled that stream or made it postponed it or I could have just put out on Twitter that hey I'm in a stream right now so I chose the latter because they're already about 4 or 5 people waiting for the stream when I found out so I didn't want to leave them hanging so I mean everybody I guess would have initially got the notification from YouTube for the right time so maybe that'll help it looks like I do have some people in here so awesome hey it's actually not bad when I do it at a different time sometimes there are people who just can't watch the stream at my normal time so now maybe we'll have some new faces who watch the recordings but don't get to participate live okay so I'm I wasn't planning on working on this yet I was gonna work on some other stuff but we're gonna work more on this as you can see I've done pretty much nothing this still looks kind of broken like we left it on Friday so didn't work on pretty much anything yesterday I wasn't feeling well just stayed home well I should say that I worked on my Udacity project so I finally got that to the point where I was confident to turn it in so I don't have it ready to show you today so sometime this week maybe oh I'll show you all I don't have it up and running anywhere but I can just have it running locally and just show it to everybody let's see what else did I want to say oh okay so I don't know I'm sure you all saw that I'm sure a lot of you saw that we got so we as in free code camps YouTube channel got a silver play button from YouTube which is really cool so Quincy made a video and posted it last night and so check that out if you don't know what that is when a YouTube channel gets to a hundred thousand subscribers they get this silver play button you know framed and it's really cool so we're actually over two hundred thousand subscribers now but it's still really cool that we got that so I'm excited and also quits Quincy thanked all the YouTube people and so my name was in there too and I was just that was really cool I was I'm still like I'm still very appreciative that for this opportunity to to contribute to free code camp so anyway and I'm glad that I could help in some way and you know reaching the subscriber count that we have now okay let me let me get started yes so we got we got a decent amount of viewers right now so let's go ahead and get started so I said hello what's up take my so so I think somebody wants me to say their name on youtube so Abdul Wahab I think that's it Abdul Wahab sorry you all know I try really hard to pronounce names correctly so if I don't pronounce your name correctly let me know all right so have a lot of people saying congratulations in the live chat thank you so much I mean really it's you all that that did that right I mean you you're the ones that subscribe so yeah it's it's amazing I don't know what to think that anyway I'm gonna get to coding but I'm just really it's just really cool let's see all right so let me at least tell you what I've done I've done a lot of prep work to get ready to do this so I was just really having trouble with this design in terms of just not there's a lot of content on the page so it's it's really difficult because my design style is usually like very minimal so I was having a lot of trouble figuring out like where where everything was going to go how I could keep a lot of the content and not have it be cluttered so usually when I'm at the beginning stages of design and I get stuck I just look for inspiration so I looked at a lot of material design sites a lot of you know the Google Sites and I got some really good ideas to incorporate at least I think they look they're pretty good at least the way they were executed on the sites that I saw so I think it's gonna work out I have a much more clear plan now so let's get let's get to it okay let's build out this this the frame for all the sections first right so I know about how many sections are gonna be so I think it would be better visually to just have all those sections with some headers in there and then we can start putting things in and that'll maybe help a little bit to get what's in my head conveyed to you all as quickly as possible that's always tough I usually have but you know a vision in my head of what it's going to look like but trying to convey that to other people is not always easy my my drawing skills are not great so I try to sketch it out but it never looks the same okay so let's see we just need some we need some sections and actually we're gonna we're gonna take out a lot of this right so I I'm done with the with the Carousel idea or even the accordion so I have a different idea for this section and then for our news and events section so at first for this section we're just gonna have a few cards across and if we need to if we really want to have more than a few cards we could potentially just have a large scroller all right so that it'll it'll just shift across so we'll probably build that I don't know I'm thinking that we'll just build that from scratch maybe we use what's with materialise we'll see I'm undecided still it'll be the faster way to do it let me start my timer before I forget so if you are new you haven't seen this before I do 25 minute sessions of code and then in between I do fiveminute sessions of question and answer and then at the end I finish out and I'll answer any of the questions that are in the live chat so I always do at least two Pomodoro sessions of 25 minutes I'm definitely going to do two today and then we'll see how things go all right so let's just get some basics let's see what name I gave this class so okay so this is all in a container right now I don't want to make everything in a container I think what we'll end up doing is having sections in those sections that we want to be contained so have this space on the sides here we'll then put the container inside the section but I would like to have you know as we're doing here full width sections so so like this so right now I guess it's okay if I do these in rows and one way I do do them in sections so section there we go oops can I do that no all right so if you confuse this to what I was just going right there Visual Studio code comes with Emmet Emmet is a shorthand oops a way to kind of do shorthand and then have it automatically turn it into HTML so I'm I'm learning how to do it so far it's a really cool feature you can see how easy that was and so right now I'm just gonna put in I'm just gonna put in the text it just says column just so that there's something we can see with this structure not every section is going to have the same structure but it's going to be you know this will be kind of a nice base structure that we can work off of is a section with two columns we're gonna have yeah so some of the sections we will want that container in as well but I'm not gonna put that in there right now we'll also want see let's put a header in here as well h2 section there we go alright so this will give us an idea right now I'm thinking we'll probably have another I'm gonna start with with section but maybe like five more sections and then see how that looks okay great here's the section for now I think I'm gonna take out this banner or at least comment out the banner let's just comment it out for now okay and let's take out I didn't want to put a different image in here I just keep forgetting let's take out these for a least change it up I'm gonna go back to what we had originally which was just a card like this just three of them I I wonder I think I'm gonna try to put in the actual texts that are in some of these now on the main site that the live version of this site and see how it looks if we can get away with making the cards a little bit smaller we might be able to go with four across on a large screen so I think I think that would work out so this is what we want and all right so let's go inside this row put two more of these in oh man what was the there was a hot key there was a hot key for formatting things automatically what was it I don't remember what it was um I'll have to look back at the last video whenever I I learned what the hot key was and then fixed that formatting because right now that's terrible all right this is make sure you did that right okay great let's grab grab some of the actual text man are these is this a text it's just I think that's part of the image is it let's see I'm gonna inspect that to see if that's all just an image enough how do we have five okay okay so that's actual sex oh wow all right okay so each each line is actually in its own in its own div interesting okay so I guess I'll just type this out it seems like that'll be the easiest thing to do so I'm gonna move this over to my other screen so that I can type it easily all right I guess some answers to the Auto formatting but I have have different answers control Kennedy all right let's try this whoa okay the control k/d did not work that did not work let's try this over wish okay so for not working thanks for the advice though I let's see oh I'll figure it out I can always go back and check the last stream okay I don't know if you all noticed in the last stream but several of my coworkers were peeking in the door and doing silly things so I didn't realize how many of them were doing it and so they told me after the stream and then I went through and and saw it so I guess that'll be some nice Easter eggs to look for now okay so I'm not sure if we even want to have the card title there's not really anything now on the card that that I think would be good for the title I mean unless let's try this let's try to put the students name where the title is and then include their quote and then just have a read more link we'll see how that looks all right so Shannon and I want to put this in quotation marks so it's clear that it's a quote this automatically type server and this instead of serve okay that was good and then let's see how it looks okay yeah that's that's a really small amount of text let's try to get away with doing four cards then and so I could definitely I could see a few benefits to doing four cards I think five would be pushing it but four cards would allow us to use much smaller images as long as we keep it consistent and you know potentially even on a small screen we could drop down to two columns so that we would never have anything like as big as that right and then we'd be able to display more you know right away without having to click in one way or another and I'm open I mean I'm I think I'm gonna suggest that we just we don't have five stories like we have now I think we should just have three or four stories and then if we want to change them out more frequently that's totally fine but I don't know when it comes to like carousels like this the statistics at least that I've read show that you know barely anybody ever gets to the fifth one the percentage drops significantly after the first and you know after the second one so most users don't even get to this point so I think it would be better to just have a few visible immediately and what the user is much more likely to actually look at that and read that I definitely want to set it up so that these are always the same same height so probably won't work on that today I know we've done things like that in previous projects so I may not do it on the stream we'll just mostly we're where we get with it okay so let's let me add one more card she's gonna add one more card here and then let me change these so what we want is this to be 3 and then medium can be dropped to 4 that's gonna look weird I think we don't want that let's go with medium 3 small 6 ok so on small screens each card each column is going to take up 6 of their 12 columns so 6 of those are going to be taken up by the first column second column left 6 and then over here each one's gonna take up 3 so we'll show you what that looks like ok so you see as we get smaller at some point it goes to two okay and that's not bad I mean I don't like how long these cards are but I'm I'm okay with this this isn't really you know this isn't too bad and for right now I'm sticking with the column classes that are built in to materialise but if we really want to have more control over things we could always you know set our own breakpoints do some different things with that occasionally you know I've had to do that okay so I'm gonna leave this like this for now it gives a general idea of what this could look like and it's something that I could show my boss to show other people to just get get them thinking so normally the process goes I consult with my boss or whoever is has the information for the project just kind of talk about some things sometimes I'll scan things out get some immediate feedback then I go to work and actually build something out just usually with a lot of you know content like this right you know obviously this is not ready to go get alive but it gives you know a better visual you know something you can actually interact with then I go back to my boss or whoever and get some more feedback and it will change so what we're doing now is probably not going to be the final version of this but we just want to kind of get our ideas out you know actually kind of build out not completely but just kind of roughly all right so for the news section which will be our next section I think I may have some sections that are banners in between just to break up all the white but I'm not going to do that right now we'll get everything on here see how it looks and then see if we need that I also have another I have another idea that I might put into place I've noticed on some of Google's sites that they they don't have the cards automatically visible they're only visible when you hover over them let me show you an example and I want to see what you all think about that it's a little bit different for me I'm not I'm not really used to it but I'm not I'm not opposed to it it's interesting so here we go fine let me bring this over okay so check this out so this first this is the design Google and so you hover over this and now it becomes a card and the entire thing is clickable down here it's that it's the same is it anything I thought it was for this I guess not here it is okay so for these ones it's the same thing it's clickable now here's the the advantage of this I think this is really cool so notice that these are not the same heights but it's not obvious that they're not the same height right away but if you hover over them you could definitely tell but since they're never both visible at the same time you don't immediately get that idea that like wow these are really off right so I love that because one of the one of the big issues always when I'm doing things with cards is you know getting them all to be the same the same height and sometimes I don't have control over the content I advised that we you know try to have uniform content and try to have as little text content as possible and but I don't always have control over that so for instance here if one of these were large this card I could get the card to be the same height but there'd still be lots of white space inside it doesn't seem like it's not obviously you know so different when the white space is inside but it's still a little bit weird sometimes so I'm thinking about going with something like this I don't think this is built into materializes something we'd have to do on our own don't think it would be that difficult though so anyway let me know what you think so I'm not gonna look at the live chat right now but when the timer goes off when we do our our first five minutes the first part of that first thing I'm going to look at is that and see what you all think so for now I'm just gonna do the cards like normal but we may be switching to that that's that's definitely going to be a different it's going to be different than anything else we've done so so I'm okay with doing it because I I think there are there are a lot of benefits I think it gives us a lot more freedom doing it like this so we'll see but for the newsfeed I liked how it was done here so not every piece of news has to have an image right you we have here and we may not do it exactly like this we have one main piece of news that does have an image and then the rest of them we just have the the titles and you know just a little snippet so I like that you know we have the more news up here so I think we're going to go with something like this the news right now on the site we have so we do have images but we don't these images aren't always I think the best right so certainly some stories will have images that could be used but I don't think every story necessarily needs an image with it right I mean this if we're going to use an image it should add to the understanding of what's happening all right it should draw you know draw your eye like recive right now I can't even read this stuff down here it's hard to read this and I'm pretty close to my screen right now so now right if we add you know maybe a really wellknown person like like father Scanlon really wellknown at this university so a picture of father Scanlon would definitely be appropriate to have for a news story but logos I don't know so I like the idea that in this setup we could have something with an image and things without an image and it looks fine earlier the way I was going to do it I don't know that it would look it would look good we would be forced to always have an image and a certain and image with certain dimensions for every story so let me check my time before I try to implement this okay we got about three and a half minutes so let's try to do as much as we can here it looks like basically we'll have mm I mean we're definitely gonna have two columns see we're gonna want these columns to be inside a container okay so we're already set up for two calls we just need to add the container first and then let's make I keep thinking in terms of react component I almost said we're gonna make a component for this but we we can't we're not not using react so which we're just gonna write the markup for this for you know for something like this I'm not gonna try to match this exactly I actually really don't like doing that I feel weird copying someone's design exactly I don't mind taking some inspiration from it you know the general concept of having stories with and without images but you know I don't want to try to copy fonts spacing everything so we're gonna try to adapt it and kind of make it our own let's see so we have section right all right so this is this I think it's the section that we want you start getting names on these sections it'll be a lot easier and we can potentially break these out into components if we need to I think I mentioned that before if this component starts getting huge then probably be better for organization to break it out all right so you say news and we got to put this in a container right so what we can do then is probably the easiest way to do this I think is to make the container just add the class container on this section in previous projects I've added a container inside the section but I think maybe I had a good reason for that and I forget but I think it's unnecessary to have an extra div just to add this extra class so we're gonna try it like this I think it should be fine just to test it let's make sure this should there we go so now this does have margins on the side and let's thank God I want to quit having to load that image every single time so I'm gonna comment it out for now the big hero image I just I feel bad like continuously hitting the unsplash was unsplash thought I T sermons so my timer is up now anyway let me find that CSS file let's take that okay all right so let me go to the live chat now and then we'll we'll fill this in my my timer it's hidden there we go all right okay okay so so so Tony says I upload the Google design cards okay cool so we got one vote for the um I'm assuming you mean like this this how we how they do it here John says same hiding cards is easy with Flex CSS attribute stretch or in grid it's even easier now I know great I will yeah I know there are some ways that I have used that make the cards getting the same height in the card it's a lot easier let's see alright so that seems like it was it looks like that's that's all for the opinions about the card design so I'm going to scroll up and try to see if there are any questions Harshit says congratulations your silver play button and may free code can't progress it so it reaches more than a million subs that would be cool did they give you a gold button at a million subs I'm not sure I would have this I would imagine the next step would be gold button right that would be really cool to get a million okay Brando asked about the IDE it's it's Visual Studio code so I don't know if I would call that an IDE but that's the code editor that I'm using today okay cool no D says it's been a while because the streams are always late but glad to see it today so that's awesome I'm I'm really glad that you get to see the stream now so I like I said I know there are people that watch the the videos that don't get to stream because of the time so cool I'm glad you can gladly ask it says am i late yeah I'm I'm actually early so you are you're a little bit late maybe about a half hour I started that about a half hour ago so but it's it's my fault I started way earlier than normal without very much notice to everyone okay so nobody asks if I write unit tests when coding unfortunately I don't write tests when coding so I did have on the last project Kevin who's frequently in the in the live chat and contributes on github set up some some testing stuff and I did end up going through and editing a lot of the the tests that he set up and was learning how to do that that was what do you say it was end end testing so I would like to be able to do tests I just am not really I don't know enough about it right now I'd like to find some good training materials on testing right now I have no time to do anything else until my nano degree is finished so it'll probably happen is I'll finish my nano degree by the end of October then I'll probably have to work on my talk for November then after that I'll probably have time to learn something new in that case I think testing should be the next thing I learned we'll see unless something else comes up anyway so I really do want to do testing it's just not something that I've that I've learned all right we got one question at the end that I just have to read so says which would you rather fight this is Ruben says which would you rather fight one hundred ducksized horses or one horsesized duck is that and this is so weird cuz I just I just saw somebody else just ask this question my cousin's husband asked this question and she posted it on Facebook so where is this question from I feel like I'm missing some reference but anyway that's a good question so I'm not gonna give my answer yet if you'd like to answer in the live chat let me know and then on the next 5minute break I'll read out the answers and I'll give my answer I would hate to influence you all on such an important matter so what would you rather fight a hundred ducksized horses or one horsesized duck that sounds like a good question for my kids I gotta remember to ask him later on they'll probably my oldest son Rafael will probably just like try to think it out for you know four hours and he'll be trying to come up well maybe if you did this all right so okay cool let's build this now where to go there we go I'm like I'm gonna separate these sections out with some spaces just I can keep it straight I normally would not put this many spaces between things but I don't want to have to keep searching for it okay alright so in this section we'll have and we want to give this hh4 maybe so let's give it give it a div forgot forgot to do that I'm gonna force myself to do this I remember so it'll actually let me let me put in some of the actual news that we have and let's put this paragraph in here and then I also want to put in let's put in an image when you grab this source over here wow that's really cool that it automatically puts the source and the all text and okay actually the title is the link so I'm not worried about that right now but this will end up being a link let's see what that looks like and then I'm just gonna copy this now and paste it here and then let's remove this whoops I'm sorry I meant to remove the image and then we'll copy it a few times I see that gives us okay not not too bad at first so what we want to do I actually really like the idea of putting the date right because right now our stories don't have the date I mean that gives us the advantage of let's say we don't update our stories very often it's not obvious that they're not updated but I don't know I think I think I'd like to have the date in there I guess the problem is right now if we're not pulling the date in I'm not sure how we would pull the date in because I have no idea how to so like this would be the equip setting this up in Ektron which is the content management system that this site uses would be I don't know what it's called an extra on but like in WordPress terms it would be a custom post type so I don't know how to make a custom post type in Extron or to get data from a post siphon Ektron so I'll have to learn a lot more before that can happen so for now I'm gonna leave off the dates because I know for sure we can grab these pieces of data because I can just look and see how we're doing it now if I do figure out how to grab the date great I'll grab the date otherwise I'm just I'm not gonna worry about it I'm definitely not gonna worry about it now we're just trying it you know show something on the page all right so I'm just I want to clean this up a little bit I don't want to spend you know a ton of time on it but I think there's a few things that we could do so for now I think these these titles are way too big so we need to drop those down we definitely need to get rid of that character up I'm not worried about it right now but at some point we need to and then the image I'm not sure what we can do about so I mean ideally we would have an image that took up you know the full full space here but without editing this image I don't see how that's gonna happen so we'll just leave it all right so let's drop these down what are the age for is now let's try to drop them down this we can see what age oops what age five looks like okay I think that's all multiple cursors is so useful okay all right that's much better that's the size that I was initially thinking of okay great so that's good I would probably I mean this is pretty obvious that the title goes with this text but you know maybe we could do something add a little bit more space here and tighten this up here but for now that gives the general idea the only other thing we want to have here is you know like a read more I guess we could put it over here the only other place that would make sense is to have something down here that said read more I'm actually not sure that we even have that right now okay so we do have a more link right now and it is at the bottom I don't know why I'm thinking so much about whether to put it at the top of the bottom I think I'm gonna put it at the bottom honestly and the only reason why I'm gonna put at the bottom is as I said I don't like to copy people's designs exactly and so we are leaving out some things but you know putting putting this at the top I'm if there's something that I can try to not copy that's kind of not really important I can put that down here so I know it's a small thing but I'm just gonna put it down here for now we'll see how how it looks all right so let's get section yeah you know the bottom of this section let's put in and for now I don't want it to go anywhere okay so we're gonna have to style this a bit right so I wanted over on this side some suspect that and this might actually be pretty simple well somewhat right so I I do want it on this side on a large screen but on a small screen you probably won't look right on that side so for now I'm not gonna worry about that but I would probably want it aligned this way on a small screen below below these so maybe we can just see I don't want to do it everywhere there we go okay so if you can see what I did there so initially this was all the way over here because when you use positionabsolute on an element it is absolute in relation to the parent element that has a position of relative so if it's immediate parent element which in this case was this section then if the media parent element is not position relative it goes up to the next one so it went up to a probably this div may be further up I mean obviously like the entire window could be potentially you know it could go up to there if nothing has positioned relative so for right now it shouldn't affect anything on the page that I've made this position relative but you notice as soon as I made this parent div have a position of relative this went right back into place and now it is aligned zero pixels from the right side of that div so for now this is okay probably would not have it be zero pixels I it might look better if it was shifted in a little bit but I'm okay with it for now but that's kind of a really tricky thing with CSS positioning so if you're having trouble with absolute positioning remember relative it probably took me years before I finally remembered that without having to look it up okay so let me put I don't know if I want to make every section positionrelative so I'm just gonna put it in line for this one react is ruined me in terms of inline Styles I never did it before wait what why is he giving me a green underline don't use empty one style that it these wispy styles was wrong with me why don't I remember that yet okay for this one we actually have a unique class so we can put that in the CSS I don't know what I called it now more link okay what can we do positionabsolute and right zero okay let's try that out see I knew it was what did I do wrong yeah CEOs position I just can't spell it's my problem there we go okay a little longer than it should have taken but now it not works alright so cool so that's my my idea for the new section for the events section I'm not gonna put them in right now because I want to check there's there's been like some discussion of doing events differently so there may be an API that I can tap into to pull an events so I'd like to get a little bit more information before I put any effort into how I'm going to display events because I don't know that I think that whatever I do is likely to change based on what's decided about how we're handling events alright so next section well let me check my time all right seven minutes cool for the next section let me show you some of what my inspiration is for these sections where do I put my okay so the Google developers sites at developers.google.com also as you know material design in use here but they have so obviously you know these are normal cards you know we're going to be using those but they have these sections here where it's some some visual things so probably be an image in our case and then they just have some information and a button now acts I have done this before on several different sites so it's not something completely new to me but I like how so when I've done it before this has been very large so like a big image complete sections lots of padding but what's unique in terms of at least what I've seen is how tight this is right so this seems as if it's one section and these are just a part of that one section I really like that and I've never done that before I think this will be good for what we need to do because you know if you remember on that main site we just have so much information in each section so we kind of need a way to break that up since we're not going to use these columns you know for instance a section like this I mean academics could be the main title here but it's like what do we do with all this information so I think we could incorporate some of this and split it up so that it looks something more like this you know a lot of space but still has information still has the name links I'm just gonna pick some of this out of here to put here just as an example just to show my show my boss what could happen and then he can start thinking about okay what information is the most important in this section what information can we cut out what do we have to keep and then now that he knows the framework of how it would fit in there it'll be much easier for him to say all right this is this is what we're gonna put in here right so that's not really it's not really up to me it's not really what I like to do so I'm not I'm not gonna try to do it I'm just gonna worry about design honestly it doesn't even matter what I put in here you know anything as long any placeholder will work so I'm gonna use kind of this idea for some of the sections and it will be interspersed I think with sections that'll be you know more like just cards with information so you know for instance something like this could end up being more like you know a section with with columns so we could include if we want some more some more videos to be honest with you I don't even I'm not sure about it keeping these I really need to do some some click tracking and see how many people you know watch these because that's the section that could take up a lot of space so if it's not useful to the people visiting the site then we may as well you know just take it out of there yeah so I think each of these sections would work like that my other thought I think I'll just put it in this first design is that we don't need to have so many sections so academics and admissions I think I think we could place them together so basically our tagline is academically excellent passionately Catholic I think those should be the sections that we have because those are the things we want to emphasize to our potential students so the draw of Franciscan University it's in a niche market and the niche market is people who are who are Catholics who really want so the you know teenagers who really want to you know deepen their knowledge of Catholicism alright because this school is known for being really good at teaching that it graduates the most theology majors out of any school in the country so that's where you know we want to have such a passionate Catholic but what we want to also do is is emphasize academically excellent because our reputation in terms of being good at teaching Catholicism is established right it's established and generally it's not it's it's it's not usually questioned among our target audience but what we need to establish is our academic excellence so I think we should we're gonna do academically excellent first which makes sense it comes first in the tag line so that'll be what people see and that should hopefully give them some new information that maybe they didn't know alright because we want students to be able to feel like I can get a really good education here so that you know I can go out and get a job we never want the dilemma of somebody saying you know what I really do want to come here because of the faith part of it but I I don't know that I'll learn a lot there or maybe they aren't sure if they have you know their major or they're not sure if they'll be able to get a job when they graduate so we want to reassure people about that so I'm gonna try to split up the site into two main sections the About section at the bottom or I'm sorry it's at the top now I think we should move the About section to the bottom so right right now I don't know I don't see to be honest with you there's so much texting it's so small I'm not sure how much of it actually gets read right now so and it's not the focus here it seems like it's in between these two things that draw your eye this because it's just you know it's big the colors are there I don't I think it looks kind of odd so that draws your attention and then this is a picture all right with a calltoaction button here so I don't know that this is having any impact right now I don't think it'll be a problem and move this to the bottom all right so that's that's the idea so for now I'm gonna fill in the section names and then I'm gonna do my timer just went up but before I forget any of this to keep it all straight I'm just gonna fill in three section names right now and then I'm gonna check the time kind of see how we're doing and decide whether or not we're gonna do the third comodoro session okay here's our news section and I'm sorry I I know that the formatting right now has got to be just killing some of you every time I see that formatting like my heart hurts it's like it's terrible so I'm I'm definitely gonna fix that formatting and I'm gonna look up the whatever the shortcut is to format the before the next stream okay so let's go technically excellence excellent and this will be all right just make sure that look sorry that's right stuff okay that's what you want so we're gonna we're gonna cut this down so we're not one two basically for really four main sections this is going to be a somewhat narrow section but so not counting the hero section in this before main sections so I'm hoping to reduce the amount of scroll that needs to happen in this site because right now there's a lot of scrolling going on and I've gotten you know negative feedback for that I don't think anybody likes how much scrolling has to happen so I'm gonna try to cut that as much as possible but there's still there's still a lot of content so you know we can't completely cut you'll cut everything out all right let me I'm gonna set the five minute timer but this may end up being the last session so I want to just kind of see how many questions there are and and see what time it is I'm actually getting pretty hungry so right now I'm leaning towards not doing another session and instead eating all right so the question that I asked you Oh in the last five minute break was was from Reuben about whether you'd rather fight one hundred ducksized horses or one horse esta so you all gave your answers let me read out some of these answers a huff hopefully we have some code related questions as well but James says a hundred ducksized horses q master says one horsesized duck sounds like less work if I have a spear or something one good head and done it's a good point black bat says my 50 Cal sidearm prefers one horsesized duck that takes care of Thanksgiving supper I didn't even think about that but that would be quite a bit of duck meat if you had a horse sized duck heights John Hansen says a lot of smaller struggles are always much easier to handle than one big one so 100 duck sized horses okay James since a hundred ducksized horses build up my confidence as I defeat them and give me better ideas to approach and strategize my fight I might come across an idea that will kill all hundred and a blow ok all right so that's it for me I think I'd rather go with the giant duck sized horse or I'm sorry horse sized duck that's added backwards because I don't know that I could really fight all those cute tiny little horses right that would be tough but it would be much easier mentally to fight this like giant monster of a duck right um anyway although I think that it would probably be more dangerous to be around that giant duck all right so now back to some code hopefully hopefully I didn't upset anybody by you know having entertaining that question there there's only what maybe like a minute or two of of time we took on that okay so Oh harsh it says react sixteen is coming out with the MIT license instead of the BSD three clause who's excited yeah so that's really interesting that that happen I know we had a question I think last week about someone asked me what I thought about the license and also what I thought about WordPress deciding not to go with react anymore because of the license so I've already given my thoughts on that I'm not going to repeat them but I'm I'm actually somewhat surprised that Facebook decided to change their license I didn't think that they would so so that's cool why I think that's that reassures a lot of people that's cool for me I didn't really care one way or another for the license I didn't think it would affect my work that much at least from what I understood about it so but I like it I like that it happened because if the react community gets bigger it's only gonna benefit you know it's going to help all of us right there'll be more information out there more jobs for react developers so I think it'll be good it'll be good for the react community in general that the license changed and you know any any companies that were hesitant over it before you know maybe they won't be so hesitant now yeah so it's a good thing it was surprising but but good let's see okay cool Jon Hansen said it read more at the bottom is generally better so cool that was that's good a good call that we had this there at the bottom yeah I do agree I mean right now we can see it all in one go but on a smaller screen there'd be some scrolling so you know normally if the readmore is up here you see that first well you might not be sure whether or not you want to read more yet you haven't even seen what's there so I do agree as as you scroll you get a little taste of what's there then if you're interested yeah then you can read more so I don't know maybe you know maybe there is some data to show that you get more clicks on a read more at the top I don't I don't really know but just logically for me you know I can definitely understand if I was going through his site thinking it'd be more convenient to have the read more button at the bottom I would probably look for it at the bottom as well okay John boys says I think you typed position instead of postition instead of position so thanks for catching that I didn't look over at the live chat and see that that would have saved me a little bit of time trying to figure that out uhhum let's see John Hanson says interesting section design and for that we're talking about this design so saying interesting section design open no borders you know color image grouping and easy to see button click I like it cool yeah yeah when I saw it I was just I I did I was really kind of impressed with with this the only the only thing I thought is man I'd really love to have a color palette that would work well with this kind of thing so I'm gonna try it usually what we do is stick with on light backgrounds one color for all buttons and then another color on dark backgrounds you usually we do that inverted button on the dark backgrounds but occasionally we will do a solid color so this would definitely be different than what we normally do but I'm interested in seeing if we took you know maybe three of the colors that aren't often used from the university color palette and use them like this you know what would it look like I mean this works especially well because they Eve match you know all these things so they have the icon the title of this so it works they're all so bright you know kind of playful colors and that's Google's thing people expect that so I'm not sure that it would translate well to Franciscans color palette but we'll see I'd like to give it a shot I'm not really hopeful that it'll work out but I it would be cool to give it give it a shot okay so Tony says looks like the formatting shortcut is Shift option F all right thank you let's try that out yes thank you so much I'm so happy now look at that so much nicer so much nicer thank you again that's awesome so I I know we already went over this on a previous stream but I didn't remember so I'll repeat it again shift option F does the auto formatting in Visual Studio code okay and actually that's it for the live chat yeah so we might wrap this up unless anybody has any questions you can get in there in the next few seconds we're gonna wrap things up now I I appreciate you all watching especially at the earlier time with short notice so sorry again for the confusion on the time I'll do my best to doublecheck everything you know when I schedule the stream but anyway that's a good stream I feel a lot more confident about the design we have now or at least the plan for the design it's looking I mean it's looking really plain right now so it's not it's not great but I think we're gonna get somewhere where it'll be possible to at least show you know my boss something and get some feedback and and really start to finetune things this is sorry I'm Berto says back to pare if it's still going I'm buried so I'm not sure what you mean by that anyway let me know I know there's a delay so it might not get an answer before I in the stream but I'll probably be back tomorrow I am feeling a little bit better yesterday I wasn't feeling well I'm feeling a little bit better my throat is still pretty sore so I mean if I feel worse tomorrow there's a possibility I might not come into work or stream so I'm just I'm not not sure about it it's really tempting to stay home but I can't stream from home so that's one of the reasons why I came in today and staying home so once I got going this morning and actually got into work I did feel a little bit better so okay I'm Barrett this is Google's people plus AI whatever the R stands for oh okay that was streaming to alright I get it now I get it so anyway Umberto's said that google has something streaming about AI right now so saying we'll go back to that that's cool actually maybe I'll watch that while I eat my lunch if it's still going so thanks for that umberto alright so like I said be back probably be back tomorrow we'll see thanks for watching and yeah and thanks for getting us to over 200,000 subscribers really really appreciate that that's awesome so until tomorrow have a great day
