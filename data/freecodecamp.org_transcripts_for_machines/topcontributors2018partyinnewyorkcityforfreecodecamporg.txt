foreign right um nice is great is oh yes my all right um yeah you can hear me great don't say what the url okay vertical video how do i affect like how long it was uh oh i'm ready let's do this it i'm plugging myself into this thing so i can uh so i can add my own little subtitle here all right that should pop up quincy larson yeah i had it hey everybody watching on the stream welcome we are at the 2018 top contributor party for free coke camp super excited to be here with everybody and i'm going to be interviewing a lot of these uh top contributors to the free code camp code base and community and all of our infrastructure so be sure to tell your friends that we're live streaming here you're just kicking it having a relaxing saturday night or sunday morning depending on what part of the world you're in and uh i am very eager to start talking to all these people i think before i do any of that i'm going to address the crowd and welcome everybody so we'll do that in just a minute if you want in the meantime you can just kind of swoop around through the audience we can check out the space first we're going to be kind of moving around the whole thing all right it's a little okay it's a little quieter over here but basically this is the entryway we're at rough draft in brooklyn nyc tonight we're having a good time invite only for the top contributor party we've got lots of beverages and lots of food and lots of exciting people who i'm excited to talk to in a moment wow that worked i didn't actually have to say shh it just worked so um first of all everybody say hi to our audience on stream there are people all around the world who are watching right now and we are going to probably have a lot more people join us throughout the night and just check in and see because we've talked a lot about the 2018 top contributor party i spent so much time laboring over whom to select and i am very confident that i made the right decisions looking around the room like pretty this is pretty much a who's who of people who have made the precode camp community what it is today and what is the free code camp community all right thank you tony uh so free code camp is a global community of developers who are helping people in their communities learn to code we have a ton of free open source learning materials a ton of creative commons learning material we have a ton of videos on youtube we have a ton of articles on medium we have a ton of podcast episodes and we have an incredible curriculum that the entire community has come together and sculpted over the past three and a half years and everything is completely free and open source free code camp itself is now a 501c3 nonprofit which means that we're tax exempt and any donations to free code camp are tax deductible if you happen to have like an employee matching thing in your office or something keep that in mind uh or if you just happen to have like a killer a year and you don't want your tax liabilities to be too big so but um we're doing a lot of exciting things with the donations from our community we're powering servers that right now if i were to look uh there'd probably be four or five hundred people using the core learning platform even saturday night uh we have millions of people using free code camp every month all around the world we have a ton of people in india we have a ton of people in nigeria bangladesh china has more than 100 000 active campers and then here in the u.s of course europe latin america central america all over the world africa even australia where i was last month and australians are the most chill people i have to say so we have a lot of people from all around the world here tonight and i'm going to try to talk to every single one of you uh live on stream if you're cool with it and just talk a little bit about how you got involved in free code camp what you're interested in doing in the coming year what your own personal goals are for your career and of course why you became part of this community what what encouraged you to take your scarce free time and turn around and invest it into an open source project aimed at helping increase technology literacy so i'm very excited to talk with all of you just to give you a quick recap on how free code camp is doing we have recently launched the new curriculum about two months ago and it's been very popular so far there are a lot of ways we can continue to improve it it's never going to be finished it's always going to be a work in progress we have tons of study groups around the world many of whom the leadership of which is here today and we're going to talk about the future of those study groups and ways that we can further expand them and make it easier for people to start study groups and participate in study groups and make it easier for people to find study groups and we're we're thinking about ways we can take the hundreds of people that are using free cocoa in any given moment and raise awareness if there's a study group in their city right there on freecodecamp.org just in time like hey a study group is starting in six hours would you like to rsvp and also take the study groups and make them more granular so you don't have to go uh you don't have to commute 30 minutes to get to a study group after work there's a neighborhood study group and then there's like a city level study group that meets once a week or once a month so we'll have a much more granular spread out distributed community where people are learning to code in smaller groups and coming together for bigger events we're working on hackathon tools to make it easier for us to have big online hackathons where everybody can join in and participate wherever they are in the world our values are of course being completely free being convenient for busy people who have kids who have fulltime jobs who are going to school fulltime who have elderly parents they're taking care of all kinds of people who are all kinds of busy and we want to be a resource that acknowledges it's 2018 people are busier than ever there's no sign of people being less busy in the near future we want to make it so it's convenient for all of you to sit down and get in 30 minutes of coding today an hour of coding a day maybe just do a long weekend where you build up an app over the course of several hours we want to be here for you all so you can continue to expand your skills throughout your your career as you progress and as you transition from field to field and as you get more and more technical over time so thank you again everyone for joining me i think at this point if it's cool i'd like to pass the microphone around and have everyone briefly introduce themselves to everybody else and i think the way we can do this is your name where you're from what your nearterm goals are if you have a goal like you want to take your study group and have it be from instead of once a month have it be once a week if your goal is to open more pull requests against the free code camp guide or if you want to contribute to firefox or some other major open source projects if you want to get more freelance clients whatever your goal is i think this would be a great opportunity for you to share it with the world and kind of commit if you will no pressure and if you don't have a goal if your goal is just to continue doing more of this what you're doing fantastic you can just say so uh and if you don't want to be on stream just let me know just kind of like and walk over toward a corner where you won't be on stream all right so i think we can just start over here with billy lee um i'm billy i'm from sacramento california and my nearterm goal is just to improve on my skill set um just doing some more at least advanced you know react stuff so that's about it hey everybody i'm nicole r chambeau i'm from boston i am the organizer of the metro west massachusetts free code camp meetup and um that's a tough one quincy i think my short and nearterm goals are not only grow up my my meet up group but also to help all of free code camp students in some really unique ways hello i'm selig i'm from lima peru and my well i actually organized meetups in over there in south america and my short and medium term goals are organizing more meetups making them weekly on a weekly basis and making different not not different kind of me different kind of meetups like one meetup is just going doing the free code com curriculum the next meetup maybe a hackathon based on the stack that where okay good we're good okay yeah so i'm stuart i'm a developer for free code camp and my short term goal is to help free cal camp expand its reach around the world uh hi i'm mark i run a local group in austin since we're starting the stream okay so once again i'm mark from oslo norway and i run local uh local group uh there we have wonderful people there and we are preparing now for our second hackathon because we just finished our first one so we are getting excited about it yeah thanks so uh i'm bill sure from ottawa canada and yeah canada and uh the shortterm goal is uh just continue uh mentoring and helping as many devs as i can through articles on the free code camp blog and through my newsletter etc and probably soonish build uh build an online course to help people even more so that's the plan hello i'm george from tokyo japan i am an organizer of the tgif free code camp you can find us meetup site and we have every friday we have been meeting in tokyo thank you hi i'm tim from colombo sri lanka currently i'm working with a skills skill registration platform using blockchain so my short term goal i'm wondering whether we could register skills and certificates making free code camp in this particular platform so that's what i'm working on right now thank you hi i'm michael semko i'm from new york and i run a frico camp meetup group here on two days a week and as far as shortterm goals go uh it's really it's really hard to say because there's many conflicting ones and they keep overlapping with each other but one of the ones that popped into my head right now is i would like to do more targeted talks on different specific things like filling gaps in knowledge um fill in gaps in knowledge that people might have for example how do you how do you start using git because you need to start using git if you haven't been doing it already how do you tie react and redux together how do you transition from just being a front end to front end and back end you know things like this that i feel like i'm missing in some people um also i would like to get involved with the development of the curriculum one but you know whenever yeah medium term goal yep so i'm victoria carriolic and i'm here in new york city as well i help mike occasionally with the tuesdays and thursday meet up groups that we have every week we've been running that for three years thanks to mike uh shortterm goal in addition to what mike said possibly we'd like to get a hackathon going similar to what oslo has done they have a great medium article and i'm planning on going through that and coming up with something might as well get rid of yeah another new york person i'm megan i work with the new york city group i'm an admin for the facebook group and last year i was running saturday meetups but those weren't doing so hot so now it's just sort of like popup meetups uh and as far as my goals for free code camp it'd be same thing as mike and victoria i think we need more sort of specialized meetups rather than just generalized study groups so that we can talk about specific topics or get together and all just commit to hacking for a few hours at a time rather than just two hours on a week night so yeah same thing they said hello campers my name is jennifer bland i'm from atlanta georgia one thing that i want to contribute on is i was recently selected into the node.js mentorship program they're doing this now they're trying to get more people to contribute to open source code especially with node.js and they started it in a beta phase where they only selected four people out of 800 and i was one of the four i'm writing articles about it you will be seeing on the um publication i'm also creating videos about my experience and that so that i can share that with other campers so that they can learn as they're learning how to code how they can go back and contribute to open source and show them how easy it is to be able to do that so thank you thank you thanks jennifer hi everybody my name is abby and i'm also on the free code camp team so happy to be here with everybody and my nearterm goal is to just enjoy the remaining 48 hours with my team not often we get to get together so really really great to have a couple more days with him so just stoked on everything here i'm ariel i'm ariel leslie on the forums i moderate there and try and answer questions i'm in boulder colorado and my goal is more personal and not about y'all i start in two weeks my master's in computer science hi my name is beau carnes i'm from grand rapids michigan and i'm excited that i'm able to work full time with freecodecamp now and also one of my goals i'm currently making uh scrimba videos to go with all the challenges on the curriculum and so my goal is to finish that up and get get videos to go along with all the challenges so to help even more people um get through and learn learn the curriculum and also my second goal is that i'm um my goal is to convert a school bus into an rv hi i'm tony with coney coats from san diego via hawaii and um i think my i'm also an outreach intern i have to say this because i paid my way here and i'm proud to be a member of the medium team and um yeah we are great the editors on that medium is awesome because we are and so i i think my my current goal is to finish my outreachy program and continue learning front in libraries and just keep learning and sharing as much as i can hello i am ethan i am a student at wentworth institute of technology up in boston uh currently interning at microsoft and my shortterm goal is definitely to finish working on the python curriculum for free codecamp and getting that up and running so that everyone can start learning python on free code camp hi hello i'm johnny bissell from leeds in england what can i say i'm really glad to be here to meet everyone one of the reasons i'm here is to network with other people which is one of quincy's recommendations i think when you actually meet and talk to people in real life it stops you being stuck behind the computer behind the desk i've been working on free cop camp for um about three years now i've nearly completed it so my short term goal is to complete the course and get all the certificates i also involved in the local group in my city we have a meet up a coffee and code session every um fortnight and uh that's going quite well um what else what else are you gonna do i'll think of something like and uh i'll pass it on for now thank you hi my name is joe hill i'm from norfolk virginia um by way of canada and ireland um yay i i think my i have two goals one's professional and i free code camp led me from completing a free uh frontend certification and going right into being a sql and tsql developer professionally and um so now i'm trying to wrap my head around this whole world of data and so now i'm trying to learn python and more of sql and more microsoft stack so that's more professional what i'm trying to do in the last year by way of the meetup i started to meet up i think right when norfolk free code camp meet up right when quincy put out a call for local groups to start up so it's been about four years now i think i think that's when i started free code camp itself so um what we've been doing the last year has been we've been kind of sporadic as far as having a meet up every month and it would be on different topics like one would be like on ios development another one would be um react or something like that so we'd be getting new groups every time but it doesn't seem like anybody was getting any traction so i've been trying to do one every two weeks virtually just on google hangouts and just doing working through algorithms working through projects doing show and tells and i think that's been a big help because everybody can work through the curriculum together so that's what we're going to keep trying to do hi i'm going faraday indianapolis indiana and my goal right now is to finish working on the react native curriculum and perhaps do some of the blockchain or help with the blockchain curriculum in the future hi my name is manish i'm a i'm a grad student in university of cincinnati ohio my short term goal is to graduate in december and hopefully look for a job as a java developer and also i want to contribute more actively to the free code come back end i've uh contributed quite a lot to the front end and it's it's been interesting to move towards the back end and also i would like to be more active in the help rooms i've kind of been active there and try to help more people so yeah yeah steve james shout out to you hey everybody it's jesse from live coding with jesse and i think it'd be cool to maybe do one live stream where i don't mess anything up that would be a good goal and tell me how that goes yeah and for this for the live streams i'd really love to get to a thousand hours of streaming i think that would be awesome we're definitely i think we're pushing 300 now i haven't counted in a while and uh locally i really want to get a free code camp meetup started i forgot to tell you where i'm from originally from west virginia now i live in ohio but it's really close to pittsburgh so they all they all connect right there so anyway i think i'm the last one so i hope you all enjoy this stream all right everyone well yeah oh yeah we should all right how do you hold this thing okay thanks stewart uh yeah matthew uh from toronto um i think i uh aside from beau actually you know what no i think even i have the most content on our youtube channel i um of everything on on free quote camps youtube i have the the highest quantity the highest hours um yeah so i'm basically running the the live stream for the music and that's basically just sitting down there 24 hours a day with me doing nothing it's sitting in a closet somewhere on a computer and pumping up those hours you've got a long way to go if you're only at 300 hours uh and yeah if there's any problems with the stream tonight i'm the one to blame hey thank you so much everybody uh huge round of applause for everybody who came all the way out to new york city yeah and also i just want to thank you all for everything you're doing it's it's amazing we were looking at the analytics for free code camp recently and we are free co camp is according to similar web which aggregates all all the different uh places we're getting something like 15 million visits a month and a lot of that is to medium a lot of that is to the core curriculum to the free code camp guide we've got quite a few people who've contributed the guide here and a vast majority of the things to do in the free cocaine community are powered by wonderful volunteers like you all wonderful contributors so i just want to have another big round of applause for everybody here and i also want to have a round of applause for all the free code cam contributors who couldn't fly out to new york city uh i totally understand it's expensive to fly out and get a hotel in new york city and all the contributors who all the 2018 top contributors who are going to be at the dublin event next month and the hong kong event in november so we're very excited we just confirmed the date of the dublin event it's going to be on september 22nd in downtown dublin at a very nice coworking space just like this very nice coworking space the rough draft and it's going to be a ton of fun and everybody who's watching who has contributed to free code camp or who's considering contributing to free code camp i just want to encourage you to do so so you can be in the same room with these amazing people it's such an electrifying feeling being here so i think at this point it's worth pointing out that we have a ton of really good catered food over here we also have tons of soda and wine and beer if you're 21 or older and uh we're gonna be hanging out here until about 10 10 and then if anybody still feels energy we might go to a nearby dessert place or cafe or bar or someplace that we can still talk it's not terribly loud but if anybody's up for that i mean if you flew all the way out from uh from peru or you know from oslo or all these farflung parts of the world very far from new york city you should absolutely you should absolutely uh get the most of this and tomorrow as promised there will be a fun run we're going to run both across the brooklyn bridge and the manhattan bridge so it's a it's about 10k you can total we can totally have like a walking or walk run division as well and anybody who wants can kick it at the cafe where we're starting and ending and we'll just chill out afterwards so we've got an entire weekend of fun relaxing things for you all to do if you haven't made it to the world trade center memorial it's amazing it's pretty new i hadn't seen it before but we went there yesterday and it was just the most solemn kind of humbling experience this this memorial so it's definitely worth checking out while you're here in manhattan if you haven't been there and uh so at this point feel free to just shake your neighbor's hand we have a little badge game find somebody who has a badge that's the same color as you and give them a high five and yes there are more than one color it was a random draw and a lot of people got blue all right oh so we'll talk with if you're wondering about python uh we've got some updates on that we just published an amazing four and a half hour video which you can check out it's like a total python tutorial with code samples and everything that's on our channel you can watch that after you watch the stream or you can watch it right now if you want just watch it concurrently um and we will have an announcement about a forthcoming python curriculum in a little bit uh coming from ethan arrowood who's been working on it for the past few months so yeah exciting stuff in the pipes we've got so many exciting things coming up so stay tuned we're just going to be hanging out eating and i'm going to walk around and interview everybody in a little bit i think right now we can just let it let the camera go and let the mic go and relax for a minute my here uh foreign i yes your me take some videos yes thank you me i is ladies foreign um i'm like uh foreign um yes i it's a bit high i'll adjust it afterwards as well but it's uh yeah uh i'm a bit tall for this i think i think i'm a bit tall for uh sitting in this chair and i think quincy's gonna be a bit tall as well what do you uh what does everybody on the stream think is this a good height for me it's definitely a benefit for you all it's foreign uh whomever uh whoever looks like they're not busy i mean we can go ahead and start with the man from oslo himself mark welcome i'm gonna pull you up on here so everybody can see your information because i mean matthew built this amazing app why not make heavy use of it right um one second okay pretty cool huh yeah so i just scroll through here i find mark i hear a lot of people on here we went ahead and put all the top contributors just in case people showed up here we are so i'm here with mark uh how do you pronounce your last name drostinski i'm here with mark troshinsky and mark is uh the community organizer for free cocamp oslo which tell me a little bit about free code camp oslo and its history okay so we have a amazing group okay amazing group of people and also other admins uh very active in oslo uh we figured that mondays are the last competitive date along the week with other events which are happening more on the end of the week and during weekends so we figured that you know most of people don't have plans uh at the beginning of the week so we figured that monday is our perfect cause and we are just keeping it uh regular and you know you know the persistence is the the key for our our group so so you know like yeah yeah around a year ago there was like you know meetups with only me or just two people or three people and now we have like uh 15 16 people attending every every week so so that's that's really a progress for us that's amazing so 15 or 16 people coming to your average event how frequently do you all get together every week every week every monday every monday okay so you've got a regular schedule you've chosen to try to get a set rhythm so everybody knows hey it's monday time to go to preco camp oslo whatever happens we have a meetup and you know even when i'm here we have also richard yeah so we have also besides me uh we have also very active me admins uh like richard milton catherine and ikanova uh howie anderson who are organizing so if any one of us cannot attend the meet up we also have other guys who are who are there for people who are wanting who want to see how does it look like and how to how to get into it awesome and have very many people within uh the community over time have have any of them gotten jobs as developers yeah so we have like quite you know small successes in our in our group so you know besides you know learning uh learning purposes of community as as ours there are also uh network effect right so some some people in our community already work in in some companies and we know about you know some job offers within these companies or some internships that are up here so so we can we can connect people between companies and between themselves to to try to collaborate and you know when you are meeting people a lot of people are quite shy and delaying their uh job application right so when we see them on our meetups every week we are pushing them to to actually start applying and pushing them to those people who are actually in industry and and you know make that connection as soon as possible what are some initiatives you've done outside of just having the weekly events have you all had any hackathons or anything like that yeah we just finished our first hackathon but it wasn't like a traditional hackathon when you have separate groups working on separate projects and competing with each other to win some prize since we have like mostly uh beginners in our group we wanted to show them how actually the software is being developed now so like in teams because when you are learning you primarily learn on some your your small projects in a local in your local environment and you don't uh you don't cooperate with other people so we wanted to show them how to cooperate on using github you know how to split into teams and one team is responsible for backend one team is responsible from frontend one team is responsible for server side of the project and we collaborate together to assemble some working piece of software uh so because you know when we are meeting uh every every week we spend together like two three four hours and it's not enough time to actually build something constructive from scratch so we wanted to dedicate the whole day or whole weekend or so we just made a poll on on facebook group and we decided that we just spent the whole saturday uh coding on and collaborating on one project and it was very pleasant surprise that actually we built some actually moving living fully functioning piece of software it's not perfect it's it's still have a lot of work to do within it but it's completely complete piece of software what kind of software did you build uh it was a simple precode comp localizer so it just allows you to you have a map and you you are allowed to add your pin and add a label to it and you can just the purpose of it is that you can select your location when you are spending time and learning to cover because a lot of people are learning in cafes and stuff like that so you can just add your pin that you are in starbucks at this and this location and you are open for collaboration so other people who are visiting that website see other people pins with labels that sounds really cool the way that people can potentially opt into hey i'm here i'm going to be coding for the next few hours come in hang out with me and i i use the app and i was really impressed with how robust it was for the product of a weekend hackathon it sounds like you had a lot of time and a lot of energy also help other people who are less experienced to help them to get their feet wet right so some programming was uh was involved because you know it wasn't like all the participants were working separately we were doing pieces of the project in pairs or in in the groups of three people so you know we had like this kind of more experienced people responsible for a particular area and we were trying to assemble it with help of with other people who are involved were involved so it was it was a nice idea to try and we all of participants enjoyed it so i think we will try to do it again awesome well uh aside from doing hackathons do you all have any other goals for the near future for what preco camp also is going to try to tackle in the last half of 2018 we started collaborating with other companies that are in based in oslo so they're the startype community in uh oslo itself is quite rapidly growing because you know the norwegian norwegian industry is based primarily in oil in recent years but they are noticed they noticed the uh you know the future that is ahead of us and they are trying to switch from oilbased industry to into i.t so they are investing a lot of money and a lot of resources to uh to to uh try to support local initiatives like that so we are working with uh we are collaborating with explorer hq which is a like like community and hub of companies collaborating on uh various projects and also other hubs and and startup incubators to you know just to be in the environment and know what is happening in our city awesome well how about you personally tell me a little bit about your career trajectory and your nearterm goals okay so i i work in i.t like for 10 years but on management side so right now i'm a software project manager in one of the companies in oslo but i you know i felt constantly that imposter syndrome that i don't have enough full understanding of the things that i'm responsible for that's why i started to learning to code to expand my technical skills and to understand it better so you know and i also have some ideas for for my own projects and i can either pay someone to build it for me or i can learn that skills and build it by myself right absolutely that's the right way to think of it so uh how long have you been coding for i think like regular for around the year because when you know i i work fulltime so i can dedicate some limited time for it so just like evenings and some part of the weekends so it's not going uh very fast but i'm trying to make some gradual progress in my learning yeah absolutely learning the code is a marathon it's not a sprint and it sounds like you're approaching that with that mindset so uh have you yet had a chance to apply any of your coding skills to your i.t management job yeah like i started i got interested with that more technical skills when i tried to approach uh our developers in my previous projects and ask them for some data and i felt that like the things that i'm asking them is are very simple and i can actually grab that data if i if i learn some basics of sql so i just started learning sql to be able to dig into in our data and find the answers that i want to that i want to get so even as a technical project manager you've managed to turn around and immediately uh as an i.t manager you've you've managed to immediately apply some of your technical skills on the job yeah yeah that's the plan to you know just make it make that transition quite credible that's great and the fact that you've been able to do all this without taking any additional risk you haven't left your job you haven't taken any sort of pay cuts you're just doing the same thing you were doing before but now you're moving in a more technical direction that's just that's that's the idea well i think that uh i'm going to encourage everybody to jump on twitter and follow mark i think that he is a very inspiring person within the free cocamp community i've really enjoyed using your hackathon project i am very interested in scandinavia in general i think a lot of america is looking at scandinavia as potentially being a model of going forward feel invited and drop by whenever you're in yeah and i i absolutely hope to to visit scandinavia in the next year or two um it we have a lot of free co game study groups up there and yeah uh keep doing what you're doing it's amazing yeah we'll do uh and hopefully you will join us soon and we'll be in in europe and uh yeah because we have like the oslo group is just one of them we have a couple of other groups in in other cities in norway but there are as i try to look for other groups there are also multiple groups in whole europe so so there are definitely communities similar to ours great well we need to have some sort of preco camp wide europe summit but we're going to have an event in dublin is there any chance that you'll be able to make it to the free cooking of dublin event i'll try i think maybe richard richard nelton would try to reach it one of our mid uh admins in oslo uh but you know i i just i i'm not sure if i will be able to make it financially but you know if i would and only have an opportunity i would definitely join that great well and and just for some context richard milton he is a another top contributor who will be at the dublin event and he runs free cocaine's instagram page which if you haven't checked it out yet uh check it out instagram.com freecodecamp and a lot of the photos on there from free cocaine baslow right yeah yeah there's a lot of content from our journey and from uh middle uh richard uh richard experiences so so and he as i see he runs it with uh huge success because you know the the amount of uh uh activity there is quite quite amazing compared to other similarly uh similar topics there well thank you so much mark for flying all the way out to new york city and joining us thank you for leading the preco cam oscilla study group and thanks for thinking about all these new ways that people can collaborate in real time and learn together thank you thank you quincy thank you all right cheers welcome megan uh i'm gonna pull up your information here if anybody's interested in uh and learning a little bit more about megan so your your last name is pronounced malloy all right perfect well megan you've been involved in free code camp here in new york city for quite a while could you describe your involvement so far yeah so when i first joined free code camp it was in part because i wanted to learn how to code i had been doing a little bit of coding in visual basics already and wanted to do something that was a little bit more relevant for you know the 2000s um and i also wanted to get to know some new people because i just moved to new york city so it seemed like a good way to get some learning as well as get to meet some people so i started going to the free code camp meetups and working through the curriculum it really helps like keep me honest keep me going through because every time i go to the meetups everybody wants to check on you and see like how far have you gotten and if you're still doing the same project you were doing two weeks ago it feels a little bad to say that's other people so it's a good way to make sure that i was making progress and as well as get help from other people and then as i got more and more confident also helped to go and to talk to other people who are working through the same challenges and then have to explain the process to them as well and really solidify that knowledge so that's how i got sort of first involved in the meetups i was just going as a student and then after a few months victoria and mike were looking for somebody to run another meetup on weekends so i volunteered for that and started running a saturday meet up for the last two years but attendance is sort of mixed because people have things to do on saturdays so now i'm just kind of doing like popup meetups so whenever i have some time i'll say i'm going to be at this place in two hours if anybody else wants to meet up there and then we can just code together on whatever we're working on that day awesome and uh these these popup meetups how long have you been doing that and and how has it been so far what have you in your experiences with them so so far it's been i've only met with a couple of people for the popup ones i started doing it in march because until march i was doing just regular saturday meetups um so i think just for my schedule personally it's much more convenient for me to say like here's a time when i would like to dedicate to coding and really focus on that more rather than having a set time and i think it works a little better for other people as well because it's not the same time every day so you can get different people to come to it because they're all available at different times as well and we can change up the location and so a lot more variety for other people to potentially attend and much more convenient for my personal schedule yeah that sounds great and how about your own learning uh have you you've been learning a little bit on your own as time permits yeah so i did the whole frontend certificate through free code camp and then after that i got a little sidetracked i wasn't sure what i wanted to do i did part of a course on ruby on rails through udemy i started working through a little bit of the back end stuff on precode camp and started learning d3 at the same time this year i was able to finish the course i was doing in d3 through udemy so that was uh that felt good to get that out of the way and now at this point i'm sort of trying to decide on exactly what i want to learn because i've been sort of learning a little bit of different things still working with a little bit of d3 i picked up a book on data science so i really need to get focused still but definitely a lot more learning to be had yeah and so learning data visualization you're learning a little bit about data science do you think that's the direction you might be interested in going yeah so right now i'm a data analyst so it's sort of related to my current career and i think ultimately i'd like to do something more like data journalism like the stuff that 538 does where you can have interactive visualizations as well as some research backing it up and telling a story using data okay and for people who are watching and they're interested in finding like a really good data visualization that's really impressive and kind of highlights the power of data journalism which is still pretty nascent uh i've been looking at some amazing stuff coming out of new york times which is where d3 was created by mike bostock what would be a good data journalism piece that they could google that they might be able to get a better feel for the field from so a lot of the stuff that 538 does is really great and their election stuff they have some interactive articles the i think the new york times runs the upshot which is more data journalism focused so some of their stuff is really great and i think they have some interesting ways to really engage readers like when you're scrolling through a page it'll load like a new piece to a chart so it'll tell you about the factors that contribute to global warming and you'll see like here's carbon emissions from cars and then you scroll down the page and you're reading about carbon emissions from cars and then this other layer of the chart pops in and it's like airplanes and they tell you about airplanes so really sort of engaging the reader with some animation and in the chart as you go through the page awesome well our data visualization section on free codecamp is still pretty rough we have a lot of information on using d3 and svg and stuff like that but i think in terms of applied data visualization uh as a as a skill and some basic principles that that people should apply when they're trying to build visualizations that is definitely ripe for expansion so if you're interested in finding an area of preco camp that you could potentially contribute to in the future certainly the curriculum would benefit from your passion in that field you're currently working as a data analyst you said and a lot of people are kind of confused about the difference between doing data analysis and doing actual data science how would you describe the difference between the two fields as far as you understand them so in my experience i think data science is a little bit more on the back end doing a lot of calculations math and writing up algorithms to try to segment an audience or something along those lines and data analysis is here's all this data you have in front of us now tell us what this means to a human person and then in my personal experience it's been more like a business analysis so if you're looking at stats for different marketing campaigns how do you relatively compare how well each one did and whether you should continue that campaign if you were to hypothetically let's say you suddenly had you were really good at data visualization you were really good with this you had a strong tool set you had learned plenty of additional math beyond what you currently know and you could just go out and tackle any topic with data journalism what what area would you be interested in exploring i've been really interested in investigating crime statistics specifically since i moved to new york from chicago i really wanted to compare crime stats between the two cities for specific neighborhoods in each city because the area i lived in chicago it wasn't the best area but rent was cheap and i was willing to accept that level of risk and so i wanted to find an area in new york where it would be sort of similarly safe so that i could sort of minimize my rent price while still being comfortable in the neighborhood and it's really really hard to compare crime stats between cities because they have all these different categorizations for how they label crimes so i really like to dig more into that and try to find a way to standardize that a little better and make something that would be useful for people who are moving between major cities are there any data visualizations or any interactive ways to access data that you've built so far that you'd be interested in sharing like anything that's online that people could check out yet so i do have a website that's meghansolo.com and i have a couple small blog posts on there one of them is about visual basics code and one of them was looking at statistics on whether treaties trade off with bills in congress when like there's this massive bipartisanship that we've seen so like maybe congress would be passing more treaties because they can't get bills approved so may as well try to do something symbolic turns out there doesn't seem to be any sort of tradeoff but i wrote that up anyway because i think a lot of things that are published nowadays you only want to publish something if there's flashy findings but we really need to make a move more to publishing things that say oh actually nothing happened here anyway so that's that's on my site as well that's great night just just to completely agree with what you said i think it'd be great if i opened the news and things that were obvious but true that people had just confirmed you know complied with people's general worldview and sense of common sense if we just had more headlines like guess what you know sozo really is the case you know uh i i agree with you see do you think that uh certainly within science the the drive to find novel and counterintuitive findings has buried a lot of other important findings that just com that conform to people's expectations yeah i think there's definitely a lot of studies that just aren't as sometimes aren't even published because somebody thought that their findings weren't worthwhile and from what i've read this is actually a huge issue because that means that if you haven't published that somebody else might go repeat your work and then that's so much wasted time within the whole community that they could have spent looking at something else instead of repeating something that you already found out awesome well what are your so you're learning some additional data science stuff you have picked up a lot of additional libraries and things like that what would you say your nearterm goals are for the next 18 months so i'm trying to get a little more organized and figure out what the best process for learning is right now my thought is if i could combine into some sort of recurring format if i could learn a data science concept find a data set that i want to work with and then apply that data concept that data science concept to that data set visualize it in d3 and then post a blog post that would be the ideal workflow for me um i just need to sort of figure out a cadence that would actually be achievable and whether or not that's too much stuff because maybe i shouldn't bother with the data science concepts just yet and i should just focus on taking a data set and doing something in d3 so i need to find what the right balance is to actually make it achievable while also still learning something awesome uh as far as free code camp new york city your efforts there first of all thank you so much for your years of taking the time to help people in the community learn to code and bring them together what are your ambitions on that front do you have any ideas for how we could make the precocity more cohesive or get people coming out more regularly so i think one of the things we've been talking about for a while is having more sort of specialized meetups so we would have a certain topic that we're addressing like mike mentioned using git or if we could have a hackathon like victoria mentioned something like that where there's a specific task at hand i think that would probably garner a little bit more response i think we also need to work on reaching out through different channels because right now we're pretty much only posting things on facebook and i know there's a lot of people in the free code camp community who aren't on facebook so we need to sort of figure out where are those people how can we communicate with them okay great and even though we use facebook as kind of critical infrastructure for our study groups facebook's group functionality is pretty mature and it's well built and maintained we are hoping to have kind of like some better functionality right on freecodecamp especially for people that don't want to use facebook which i totally understand these days um are there any features that you think just off the top of your head that would that we could potentially build that would make that more likely to be a success i think you mentioned some sort of like popup alerting that would like a popup that would tell you when something was about to happen within x hours in your area i think that would be really useful um i think even for me there's so many different sections of precode camp that it's hard to keep track of all of them so like i didn't even know that the guide existed until yesterday when you talked about it so sort of that discoverability aspect definitely needs to be a focus when we're thinking about alerting for events um because if there's just a whole new section where there's just this is the event section then that might be hard for people to find and get to know um but i know push notifications can also get really annoying so yeah have to find the the right balance there yeah we're gonna we're we're gonna try to find like a good kind of equilibrium where we're not bugging people too much but we are giving them some insight into like the different sections and different contributions going on and right now what we're doing on the youtube channel i'm i'm hoping that a lot of the people who watch this both live and after the fact will realize oh wow there's a vibrant new york city group oh oh there's a data visualization section you know data journalism is the thing a lot of people aren't even familiar with that concept and it's so new so taking the time to talk with people like you megan uh makes a huge difference i'm gonna pull up your information and put it on the screen again uh everybody i strongly recommend you uh you track down megan malloy if you just google megan malloy nyc what would be a good way for people to find you out there i think i'm one of two people with this name so hopefully i think my website pops up within the first page of google so find out all right everybody check out meghan malloy i pumped her name up and thank you again megan for everything you're doing yeah welcome have a seat man uh is the sound coming through it's pretty loud okay perfect hey how's the audio everybody just messaging the chat if the audio is good okay cool oh uh it looks like it may not be advancing i don't know yeah it is awesome thank you for confirming that everybody watching uh around the world so i'm here with a very special contributor i'm gonna pull your name up uh just so everybody can see your twitter handle and everything i'm doing this manually with this amazing tool that matthew the av extraordinaire created um ethan arrowood welcome to uh the live stream and you hail from boston you are a student there an undergraduate student yes yes uh undergrad student at wentworth institute of technology tell us a little bit about your currently you're an intern yes and yeah tell us a little bit about it yes so i'm an intern um at microsoft in cambridge i am on the commercial software engineering team and it's a incredible opportunity um and a very unique internship so rather than working on a specific product or a specific service that microsoft offers such as azure or office um i work in this like almost a hackathon kind of way where we work with some of the top azure clients and if they have any sort of data sets they want analyzed or worked on or they have problems they want solutions to or new applications microsoft will assemble a crew developers from the csc team and we go out and we build something really cool with them for a week or two weeks and then when we're all done we hand it off to them we show them how to use it we provide documentation and a lot of what we do write gets open source or at least we talk about it we write blog posts about it i'm based in cambridge like i said but i actually was here in new york this past week at the new york office working on a very incredible project doing some docker and kubernetes as well as some react code um and it's been the best internship i've ever i could have ever asked for awesome well how did you get the internship yeah so um twitter actually i was i loved tweeting about tech free code camp especially and contributing to open source was what really caught the eye of my now manager he was also an alumni from my university wentworth and when he found me on twitter he reached out we connected um and through that connection i got into the interview process and then during the interview process for this team specifically they were really impressed with what i did in regards to open source as a college student and so from that they i made it through thankfully and now i'm having a very great experience that's great so just by doing what you love contributing to open source sharing information you caught the eye of microsoft did you apply for the internship or did they reach out to you and ask you to apply how did that go down yeah so i put my application in online like anyone else would and then once my application was in their system and my name was in their system um i don't know the exact specifics but i did get to go visit the office um and my manager uh his name is ben um and ben did bring me in and he showed me around and um i don't know exactly what connections he made but i don't know if it's exactly a coincidence that i wound up on his team literally working for him so um there was definitely something there that helped up but the first step if you do want to work at microsoft or get an internship there just apply online it's the first step for everybody and they have a great program for interns especially university students and even not they're always looking for new people so definitely apply and put your name out there awesome you have quite a varied uh background i have i've had the pleasure of knowing you for many years now through your involvement with the free cocaine community and among the many things you do we all we often joke about free code camp having a bunch of camp counselors that help steward the the nonprofit and the open source repo but you are a literal camp counselor yes i am a literal camp counselor i have been for three summers now um and i recommend that everyone takes an opportunity to go enjoy nature and the outdoors more specifically vermont is a beautiful state here in the united states if you ever do get a chance to visit i recommend coming through the state also new hampshire it's got the white mountains or the presidential range beautiful places to hike and canoe and definitely don't take for granted the outdoors getting a set of you know even as much as a programmer i am and the amount of coding i do i always take an opportunity to get outside whether it's a walk or a run in boston or a day hike in the mountains nearby it's definitely a thing and also summer camp send your kids to summer camp go to summer camp maybe a high to become a camp counselor it's one of the best things you can possibly do and you'll learn a lot of things and a lot of things that you can apply to your career your learning experiences your learning process it all comes from camp so yeah awesome well that is quite an endorsement of spending time outdoors and and helping kids kind of get their bearings in nature so thanks for all that you do for the next generation as a camp counselor and also uh thanks again for you know we're going to take some of the some of the terminology from camping we're going to create a bunch of badges for free cocaine we've been meaning to do this from the very beginning you know tinder foot the badge or something like that so i think that there are so many ideas from camping because camping is a fun communal experience like contributing to open source it's not super competitive generally it's just hanging out reflecting and spending time in nature and and i see a lot of similarities between the pace and the general vibe of camping and learning to code very true so on the subject of learning the code you have created a number of videos for the free codecamp youtube channel which have done very well and lots of people have benefited from them and said positive things about them you've also written some articles the medium publication and now you're embarking on the biggest adventure yet in your free code camp contributorship why don't you tell us a little bit about that i can't wait all right so my biggest adventure yet is the python curriculum it has been a little it's been an idea since the beginning but it became more into a fruition about a year ago um we tried it kind of fizzled out but we made some great you know fundamental foundational progress and then this year um due to i i forget who it was but there was some incredible python curriculum that was uploaded on the youtube channel and because of the attention from that we realized the free code community really wants it wants python and wants a inbrowser experience just like they currently have for javascript and all the other web deck web tech things so right now i am working on the learn platform of a fork of learn and making it so it can support python in the browser just like you would how how you currently run you know write the code run the test get feedback and all that and earn um earn a certification through a you know stepbystep curriculum so with all that said um i am working hard on getting that foundation set and then once that foundation is set we're going to take a lot of the aspects of what's currently there for the javascript side of things and we're going to try to convert that to python and then once we convert those javascript fundamentals and challenges over to python we will have the first iteration of a python curriculum and then from that there's some very future looking ideas like doing things like more intensive data science um machine learning ai and a lot of the things that you know a lot of people are really interested in but don't even know where to start and what what library are you currently using that looks most promising for running python clientside in the browser so we're currently using python it's a essentially it is an inbrowser python editor or at least interpreter um we're going to use the monaco editor to still get the python content for the code from the users and then we're going to pass that through the python which will run the python code that you write along with whatever tests we load in the back end and then uh it'll work very similar to how the current learning platform works with javascript and the way we kind of retrieve the js and run it the same way yeah and python is easy to remember because this browser python brython and you also mentioned monaco monaco for those of you who haven't heard of it yet it is an inbrowser editor that is a basically vs code visual studio code but it's running in a browser it's not like the full uh ide but it's it's close it's got a lot of the key functionality like tab completion and things like that at microsoft uh what have you touched any of the tech have you have you made any contributions to any of these big open source projects they have there yeah so i wish i could say yes but i haven't really made direct open source contributions yet but some of the things i have gotten to do include doing a full stack web application we use postgres database we use flask python api for the back end we used react and d3 on the front end i got to learn a lot about svgs and how those work we learned about authentication and then more recently i've been focusing on docker kubernetes and that whole that whole ecosystem and it's it really blows my mind right now what what that all is and um if you're looking to step up your game from i guess more of the basics or that intermediate level and you're like what can i do next i really encourage you to look into docker and kubernetes there's a lot of resources out there and it's really wild what you can do with it and it might seem silly at first and it might seem almost like why would i do all this extra work for something i can already do like natively but once you keep getting into it and learning some of the more verbose things you can do with it it's extremely powerful and it will be the next generation of web tech or just tech in general maybe not necessarily web so and free code camp uses docker for several of our services and we're looking into using kubernetes for some things as well so what are some of your ambitions i mean your hands are pretty full with the python curriculum ana an internship at microsoft and finishing up school how much school do you have left by the way uh one year okay so i guess it's probably hard to think even a year out with so many balls in the air but what are your nearterm goals ethan of course so i absolutely love my team at microsoft and i hope some of them get to see this video because i do want them to know just how incredible the team is and i do see a future there i would love i would love a future there but i also have some entrepreneurial ambitions i am i am involved in an entrepreneurial center um at wentworth it's called accelerate we are currently working throughout boston and we're working on some really cool things i hope to share on my twitter if you follow me on twitter you'll see all the updates from that and then on top of that so either by running the program or also coming up with my own entrepreneurial idea i definitely see that in my future but more stable at the moment i think i'm gonna keep doing the open source i really again i really enjoy microsoft and i would love to find a career there um and so yeah i think i think keeping it keeping it simple for my my ambitions at the moment you know i love boston new york city's great too but i do love boston so i'll stick around there for a little more a little while longer so just boston is one of those cities that you just have to visit if you're in the united states there's so much history there if somebody were hypothetical let's say they just had like a 10 hour layover in boston during the day when everything was open what is the one thing you would say they absolutely have to go and do in boston all right this is coming from the coding side of me but there's a coffee chain called pavement coffee you need to go there um they usually have seasonal drinks in fall their seasonal options are the best things ever they have this like fig latte so go into the city find a pavement i believe there's seven or eight of them besides pavement um definitely go to the charles river it is beautiful you can walk on either side of it the cambridge or the boston side um and you get a beautiful skyline either whichever way you look at it and um yeah i think those would be up there are my two favorite things to do or two must do things if you're in boston for 10 hours ethan it's been such a pleasure talking to you man we're very pumped about the python curriculum that you've been working on these past few months we're extremely excited about your awesome videos where you explain concepts like react which are on the youtube channel check them out and i encourage everybody to follow ethan on twitter i'm just gonna pull up his uh twitter here one more time it's arrowwood tech um this guy's going places and uh i want you all to be there to to see his trajectory if anyone does connect with me i love talking and i'll be happy to talk with anybody about anything whether it be tech whether it be about traveling adventuring camping uh diversity and solving those problems i am involved in that on my campus and it's something i am passionate about so really reach out i love talking to you my i believe my twitter messages are open so feel free to come and chat at any time and i'd love to help you out on anything you do need thank you so much ethan thank you cheers all right and next we have a very special guest coming from carlsbad california she is a long time editor of free cocaine's medium publication tony tony you have probably how many articles do you guess that you may have edited over time maybe 15 000. it seems that way yeah it's a lot it's it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles that tony has edited i'm going to go ahead and pop her information here up on the screen for everybody to check check her out um tony tell me a little bit about medium and what drew you to the platform well when i first began at free code camp i was advised to get the media in publication and i found that all the articles taught me something and those that didn't it was okay i still learned so when i was given the opportunity to edit for some of my favorite authors i just had to go for it and i'm glad i did because i'm always learning yeah and that that passion for learning that's followed you through life give us a little bit about your background and what made you such a lifelong learner and so curious about all these different topics well i've been wanting some code since i first learned that it existed um i have been selftaught over the years but i didn't have a real curriculum to go with which is why i love free code so i have some good teachers who have helped me more but there were still things i wanted to continue to do i have found that as myself as a teenager i did not believe in myself and so when i was teaching the sat classes i was able to encourage the students to learn and to go to the college of the choice and that reminded me that i should be doing the same thing and so anything that i can do to make the world better the teens better and myself i think it's just great and the fact that precode camp and the article i read was helping nonprofit organizations was just an added bonus so here i am you're somebody who has lived a lot of places in fact i think you live in two different places you live in both honolulu and carlsbad which if you're not familiar with california geography just north of san diego is that correct yeah so what's it like traveling a lot and bouncing back and forth between those locations you just flew across the us to come to new york city well i don't think i'll do that one again it was a long journey i love honolulu and someday i'm going home carlsbad is good to us and as long as my husband's happy there we'll stay there but we both have our reasons for where we like to live and as far as the travel itself it's not as much fun as it used to be but i still enjoy seeing new places and meeting new people and tell me a little bit about your husband uh is he watching right now i hope so he said he would he's great his um he's an lms administrator corporate trainer and designer for lms systems he also believes in higher education he um we went to honolulu because he wanted to go back to school and i chose ua i chose university of hawaii so he said okay then when he graduated from there he went to honolulu hpu hawaii pacific university got his master's from there and now he's pursuing his um edd so higher education is important to both of us me because i never really went to college and him because he has me loves it so that's my hobby so it sounds like he's he's quite a learned man and it sounds like he also knows quite a bit about technology in general and has that been a big driver for you and continuing your learning about technology actually no i'm the one who's driving him he just learned html he had a spell between about between contracts so he learned css and html meanwhile he'd been watching me by with simon says tictactoe and so he thought this is ridiculous but he was very proud of me every time i did something right so um he needed for the position he wanted to know my sequel so he learned it and then and then i knew and opened up now he's learning javascript so he told me today and he signed up for free code camp as a camper i think i inspired him this time that's great well i'm thrilled that he he's learning and uh you know you're able to kind of guide him to a large extent and help him with his learning as well so have you all uh considered maybe building a project together yes we do have a project we'd like to build and until it all comes together i can't talk about it okay well can you give us even hints about what that project might be about it's about helping others learn and and it's going to be really great and it's it'll hopefully be with aloha so you've you've edited so many of the articles that a lot of the people watching this have have read on the freako camp medium publication we have about 125 000 people who read the medium publication every day now um what is one article that you edited that just you're very proud that you got to be a part of that's difficult because there are a lot of them um i've had people ask me when i when i when i twitter that is that if i've done those and the truth is i have i think that my favorite one my favorite one was by one of my favorite programmers actually and his was how to buy a laptop for beginners because about the time that came out i had just started editing for you and i had already seen his articles before so i jumped on it yes this is my favorite i like this guy and he speaks so clearly to the person who doesn't understand technology and helps them to see this is what you need this is why you need it and it just felt like that was that was something i was a part of and it was in the very beginning which is probably why it stays with me so long great i think i know what article you're talking about and i'm going to reach out to him and make sure that he knows that you have such warm feelings for his article his guide to buying a laptop i thought that was a profoundly useful guide myself so what would you say your your workflow is like precode camp is completely remote we're asynchronous generally we have a trello board where you can go and and the editor team which is pretty small so it's a pretty intimate bunch tony and abby and a few other key people edit virtually every article every article that gets published in preco camp is edited by somebody like tony who cares about quality and style and wants to make sure that the article is in the best possible light what's your workflow like when you sit down to edit like what's your what's your environment like where do you edit just tell us a little bit about like okay i'm gonna go edit now what happens when you make that decision first i have to find an article i like i need to be interested in it that's not really true sometimes abby will say hey someone i need someone to do this immediately and if it looks like i can handle it i like the challenge of english as a second language because my my skill sets and grammar and um so that makes me feel good about it but i really like the ones that just reach out and say hey isn't this something you're interested in you know um you're doing a react thing that you want to read about reaction so i'll decide on the article for whatever reason and of course we have to put our avatar on it to let everybody else know and so once i grab it um i try to finish within 24 hours because i think it's important the author is waiting for this you know but also because if i'm interested enough to call on it i need to to go through it so the main thing i look for is the grammar itself the tenses whether it happened yesterday or will happen in the future basic typos and links links are really important to me so i'll check every link in the article to make sure it goes to where the author says it's going to and i'll also make sure that javascript is spelled with a capital j and a capital s that is one that like javascript would like oh and also github right everybody's followed the git uppercase git huv or no uppercase at all right right that's right it has to be spelled correctly node.js i'm still kind of confused about so yeah i generally do just uppercase nodes dot js and but some people will do node uppercase j upper kss i think angularjs is actually the proper way to do it is angularjs whereas um most of the libraries like react.js you just do a lowercase js at the end that's sort of the rule i follow too so after that i pretty much i hand it over to abby who's our final editor and hopefully she'll say yeah this is great we publish it without fixing too many things yeah do you do you find it helpful to have someone like abby like give you pointers and stuff on your editing um she doesn't actually do that very often anymore i i think that your editor guide that you put out for us i follow that still even i know we're not supposed to it takes too much time but it doesn't take too much time if you're doing it right it's incorporated properly so i follow your editorial guide and abby fortunately thinks the same way i do yeah well if abby's not like pointing out different things that probably means there's nothing to point out so i i would say that that's a testament to you and expanding your skills as an editor and also getting better at taking our style guide and interpreting it and applying it thank you thank you well tony you are so prolific and i just want to drive home to everybody who's watching this is one of the very most prolific editors on the freco camp medium publication the articles that she's edited have probably reached tens of millions of people at this point it's a lot of people who are reading these articles and using them to learn to code so everybody who's watching i strongly encourage you to uh to follow tony on twitter and also just to look out for her she writes some articles of her own tell us a little bit about the most recent article you wrote i'm an outreachy intern and outreachy.org um works with women and underrepresented tech people and places us in internships with a stipend so they pay my way here thank you very much um but as a part of the program i have to blog i have to write an article every two weeks so i've been on my outreachy journey since april and it's about to end unfortunately but but they say that you know come i'll still be able to go forward but what i've been writing lately is all about outreachy and all i'm doing in my internship and how i'm learning and how sometimes i'm not but it's it's i'm very proud of it and i have two um two of my editors actually edit them z and charlie um they'll go back and forth on who's doing it but they give me good feedback and of course abby always says give me more information please so she's teaching me how to write that's great and outreachy is just a wonderful program specifically to get a lot more women into technology and provide them with internships is it through mozilla is that right um i'm not really sure about that i do know they have me at libra health doing the ehr documentation and the reason that i received that internship was because i was an editor on medium and i used everything i knew because this is an editorial right so yeah another instance of people who are contributing to precode camp who benefit in all kinds of ways while helping the developer community so you know that's a great byproduct of your contribution that you were able to obtain these fairly competitive uh and very generous uh internship programs i just want to say one thing free code camp is awesome but the authors of the medium digest are the ones who make it work so whether you're talking on a as a beginner level or an advanced level as soon as your articles we'd love to edit them yeah thank you so much tony you helped so many of our writers really shine especially our nonnative english speaker writers i frequently hear from people that are so grateful that to have somebody who understands you know grammar really well and is you know has a background in english language and editing and things like that and so it makes a huge difference it helps them put their feet forward people get jobs all the time they get freelance gigs they get internships they get they start companies around things that they've initially written about on the precoc medium publication and a big part of that is because you take the time to really make sure that they are in the best possible life well thank you well they work hard to get there so the least we can do is make them look good all right thank you again tony have a wonderful evening and thanks again for flying out here from carlsbad california to hang out with us in new york city yeah i'm ready sorry could you grab a paper towel home for me i'm sorry i think that over i kicked over my jerky i don't want that bag to get wet oh perfect thank you tony another drink oh no i'm fine thank you all right take you anywhere i you know when i was a kid i had a lot of brothers and we'd always joked that like it it wasn't a family meal until somebody knocked a drink over all right i'm here with jennifer bland i'm gonna put put your information up on screen for everybody's benefit uh i am so thrilled that you made it out from atlanta we are so graced by your presence have learned so much from you over the past year year and a half that you've been contributing at least a year uh i don't remember exactly when we you and i first talked but uh your videos your articles people constantly cite them as being instrumental in their efforts to get jobs and to learn more about programming and just to stay motivated thank you very much i'm excited to be here excited to be part of this amazing group of people you know i'll give you a little bit of background about myself i used to be a lotus notes programmer so when i tell people that i always ask people raise your hand if you've ever used lotus notes ever a lot of people raise their hands and i'm like raise your hand if your company still uses lotus notes nobody does and that explains why i actually got out of programming many many years ago and i started working on an internet marketing business on the side and it grew and i retired at the age of 51 and i was retired for about a year and a half and one day i walked into barnes and noble picked up a book on javascript programming on the clearance rack spent a month working through it learning it and then it was like stay unemployed passion for programming and that passion for programming ran won out and i decided to become unemployed i mean unretired and go back into work and i did a coding boot camp that is so prevalent today and after my coding boot camp i graduated got a job working at cnn in atlanta and that's when i started working with free code camp because you know you can only learn so much in three months in a coding bootcamp and i wanted to greatly improve my cutting skills and so i literally in six months when you had the original curriculum went through and did every one of the certificates got to work on one of the nonprofit organizations for you know for crimes against women and that was a great experience for doing that and now what i'd like to do is be able to give back and contribute to others well what are some ways that you've been giving back to developers in progress people who are transitioning into the field the number one way that i give back is i write a lot of articles like you had mentioned earlier because i like to write articles from a perspective of i used to be a rookie programmer and i wanted to be able to read something and understand it and be able to apply what i learned from that material there are a lot of articles that are super technical and they were like be above somebody's head or they would explain it but they wouldn't cover everything and so it had those gaps in there and people were like i don't understand this so i like to write from a perspective of how i would have liked to have learned when i was learning and i think that's been very beneficial to people for them to be able to see it and to understand it then the other thing that i've done to give back is so many people are learning how to great for everybody doing that i encourage everybody to do that but then once they learn it and they go out and they start interviewing to get their first job in tech and they're not quite ready for that experience because it's so different from any job you will ever interview for in any career and they feel like you know a deer in headlights when they experience it for the first time so i created a whole series of videos that basically showed people this is what your interview process is going to be like here are actual interview questions that people have asked me others have been asked and then i just sat there on the whiteboard and answered them exactly like what you would see in an interview so that it would benefit them and help out and now after i've done that i go through and helped out being an editor on on the medium publication right now so try to do somewhere between 10 and 14 articles a week that i edit and contribute from that standpoint thank you so much for editing all these articles in addition to writing them i mean when you write the article you're in the spotlight when you're editing an article you're behind the scenes just helping people uh in the background put their best foot forward on with their own work you've spent a lot of time and energy specifically helping people with the somewhat jarring and unpredictable job application process and uh i think one of the things that surprises people the most when they go ahead and apply for jobs it's just that they have to apply for a lot of jobs and it's a pretty it's in the skills you employ in a job interview are very different from what you would employ you're actually doing the job due to the way that the job processes application processes have evolved can you talk a little bit about the things that you think are if you had just a few highlevel tips for people when they're applying for jobs absolutely the first tip that i would give people even if you have some of the skill sets they list in a job description but not all of them apply you don't need to have all of them apply every job that i've had since i came out of a cutting boot camp i didn't have a hundred percent of the skill sets but i still got the job number two would be even if you don't think that you have a skill set still apply and then get in get your foot in the door and talk to somebody and if you get a rejection from an interview write them back and do say something like i understand why you rejected me but i think you might want to reconsider because i can do this and if you show that that initiative that drive that motivation a lot of companies will will take a second chance and look at you from that perspective but the other thing is i would encourage people to also go out and start distinguishing themselves from others you know because like my coding boot camp we had you know 20 people in my class 21 people in my class 21 people out interviewing for jobs we all have the exact same skills we went through the same threemonth trading camp the people that were writing articles or doing things above and beyond that and they could put that on their resume were the first people to get hired out of that coding boot camp so it's your future it's your career you can take control of it and be able to do something on the side like that where you know the like the live streaming you know i learning how to program i make mistakes do live streaming and people will reach out to you write an article about something people will reach out to you i've i've had people that have come up to me in meetings and i mean at conferences and just say i just want to shake your hand i follow you on on twitter i read your stuff and i'm like i don't know who these people are but they know who i am because of what i've done so that those are the the recommendations that i would give to people that's some great advice jennifer about 15 percent of the people in the freco camp community they use free code camp's learning platform and are are transitioning into developer jobs are 45 and older you're someone who in her 50s learned an entirely new additional skill set granted you already knew lotus notes programming and things like that but i imagine you had to learn a lot of new stuff too what would be some advice for people who are in their 40s 50s 60s who are planning to transition who may feel discouraged by the you know the perception in many cases that it's harder for people to get into tech if if they're doing it as a second or third career um that's that's a very good question because i did attend the coding boot camp when i was 51 i actually turned 52 in the middle of that three month coding boot camp i would encourage everybody to do it you're never too old to start to learn to get into tech and a lot of people that are older or discouraged because they're like i'm too old you know i don't know this and i'm but here's my take on that for somebody that's older you've got decades of life experiences business experiences that people in their 20s or 30s aren't going to have for 20 or 30 years from now and even if you are learning to program you're going to have business experience that you can apply to any project that you're working on in a company and that is invaluable to any company to have because if you're thinking about coming out with the new product or a new app or something like that you're going to be able to provide input and direction because of that experience that nobody else has and that because of that you're going to end up producing a better product a better quality app you know something like that and it's just become better because of that experience that you're going to be able to offer up to potential employers what are some first steps you would say if somebody's on the fence about whether they should take the jump and pursue coding let's say hypothetically they are somebody who's worked in a completely unrelated field like doing accounting or business management or they've been somewhat technical like doing some i.t related stuff but they want to get more technical what would be the first few things that you would recommend they look into doing the first thing i would recommend them doing is to learn the basics of html and css go out and take a website that you like out there and see if you can reproduce it in in html and css yourself that will tell you pretty much upfront whether or not you like programming and it's because some people decide they want to go into tech and then once they get into it they're like i hate it and that's fine that's not it's not for everybody but that's always a good way to start to learn um on there um and but then also realize that that programming isn't the only job that somebody can have to get into tech you can be a project manager you can be a project owner you can be a quality analyst you could be a frontend developer you could be a backend developer you could do machine language ai you could be a scrum master there are a wide range of skills that are out there but i would recommend that everybody start off with something basic like html and css which is just solidified that you enjoy this experience before you go jump into it you know from the deep end because then if you don't like it you've saved yourself from that and if you do like it then you're motivated to basically keep learning from that point thank you jennifer and i'm curious you've made this transition over the past few years you've created an incredible corpus of uh job applications like interviewing prep material video articles what are some of your ambitions for the next year or so a friend and i are going to be starting a podcast we're going to be talking about getting more women into tech which i think is a very valuable thing that we need to do and we're also going to be creating a whole series of videos that we talk about the different roles in tech how to get into tech how to finance your career going into tech and stuff like that but that's the one thing that i'm going to be working on but the other thing that was i mentioned earlier in my introduction is go out and tell people about how to get into open source software how to contribute to open source software people think oh it's going to be too technical it's going to be too much and with what i'm doing right now with you know the node.js with their mentorship program i can be able to create videos and show what i've done and be able to look people can look at that and say oh i could possibly do that too and i can show them how they can get involved with that because if you have something like that you've contributed to open source on your resume when you're getting your first job it's one of those things that makes you stand out from the crowd and will make you get to get a job a lot quicker but i want to keep contributing and giving back to the community and i'm excited you know for what's coming up jennifer i can tell you that you're going to have at least one listener for your podcast day one i am very excited to to hear it and i i frequently encourage everybody to start a podcast because it's one of those things where people have so much time they're driving they're going for a walk that they can fill with these wonderful podcasts and we need more podcasts on women in tech especially there are a few really good ones that i listen to but it's it's just a an underexplored uh under publicized issue an area where we can make a big difference so i'm very excited about your upcoming podcast especially thank you very much i appreciate it all right thank you so much jennifer i'm going to bring up your information again everybody be sure to check out jennifer on twitter she is constantly creating really exciting stuff jennifer bland rat race grad what a great twitter handle thank you again jennifer thanks for coming yeah i just interviewed jennifer if you haven't met her she's somebody you definitely should meet okay i'll see you in a little bit all right in the egg chair we have none other than the legendary absolutely legendary stuart taylor i'm sorry i'm having a technical difficulty here could you plug in that url again i'm using i'm using firefox uh what is it called it's like a firefox browser that's like completely privacy focused so it doesn't have any history or anything like that and it doesn't allow any ads or any trackers or anything it's really cool but i accidentally hit back and because there's no history i couldn't get back to the web app that matt built oh perfect no this is great you look great man thank you thank you so much for flying out from bali castle which is a town in ireland right by belfast reasonably close to belfast right so um oh it refreshed so i can find you alphabetically uh i got it i got it so stuart and i go way back uh he has been a prolific contributor to free code camp uh my change didn't stick so i guess we discovered a bug in this app whenever you manually enter a name if you refresh the app the uh the name system seems to disappear did you not see it it should be at the bottom it's not at i inputted it initially yeah just reinput everything real quick and then we'll pop it up on the we're doing some live uh debugging here it's a really cool web app it's really intuitive um i think that like having a search field where i can just type a name and it autocompletes would be helpful so i'm not having to scroll through 250 names of top contributors but yeah overall my hat's off to you matt for uh for making this amazing app and thanks also for grabbing people and bringing them over here so i could talk to him yeah he's doing he's doing the piece and the thumbs up terminator 2 style right now okay mr stuart taylor coming to us from bally castle uh stuart doesn't need an introduction but i'm going to give him one just in case you haven't heard of this miraculous human being stuart was you know man i okay i'm gonna lean in and put my arm around him yeah come on you got this so stewart has been a prolific contributor to free coke camp if you use the preco camp curriculum in the past two months it's running on the learn application that stewart led the creation of stuart has rearchitected free code camp's learning platform completely to be a static application uh and to interact with an api and it's extremely fast it's all react it's a single page app it'll lazy load challenges if they haven't already been loaded when you're using it but as a result it's faster than ever it's smoother than ever stuart also created the free code camp guide which is an incredibly important part of free code camp it's a layperson accessible version of like the mozilla developer network would be a good way to describe it and we have 4 000 plus articles there on all range of topics you know c plus plus sql of course javascript and and little articles on pretty much every single challenge on the precocaine curriculum many of which are stubs and we welcome your help flushing those stubs out so that people can have like kind of a corresponding hint with spoilers and things like that in case they get stuck on a challenge but stuart has been building all these things he's been doing so much exciting stuff to to help us like simplify the devops flow improve site reliability you name it that's stewart and his recent contributions to free code camp stuart now works fulltime for free co camp he is the senior most developer on our team at this point he touches pretty much every aspect of free code camp he even has production access to the database in case he wants to pull a git lab and wipe out a day's worth of data i'm just i'm just kidding if you have an or forget laughter we love your postmortem on that get lab friends so um i've been talking a lot about stuart i'm gonna let stewart tell you a little bit about his background and how he came to be a developer all right hi how you doing so uh i'd say my working life started out i was uh i was in the military isn't it for eight years uh once that finished i uh i started work for a telecoms company building fiber optic network so i i built the internet around where i live it's only a small country of 1.8 million people got everyone past the internet and uh i wound up being a stayathome dad and in that time i thought well my wife she had a business and she needed a website so we went to squarespace and uh just used their website builder built our website fantastic worked great until we decided to change the header image on the the front page now originally there was a picture of a woman my wife doesn't it's an aesthetics business so the original image was a woman on the lefthand side and we had the the business name and a call to action but on the righthand side but we got some new images and the image we wanted on the header was the one was on the right hand side we didn't want the title and the call to action button over her face we wanted to move across the other side so i rang squarespace said hey look how can i get the site title and this little button over to the other side of the page and the person on the phone said look you can't do it it's not possible so i thought um that doesn't sound quite right so i went on the internet i googled around and i thought well how can i move a button to the other side of a page on a website and found a little stack overload thing and typed in some css didn't know what that was typed it in and it worked all right well that was pretty cool i wonder what else i can do can i get this so if you scroll down the page there's another image that comes in as well can i get that to slide in you know like all the other cool websites out there no clue how to do it how do i make an image slide in from the side of the page in a website stack overflow something about jquery copy and paste this code all right it worked brilliant wonder what else i can do so i i went uh searching around and found some courses on uh like coke academy and all that and worked through a few of them didn't quite like too much of it somehow found free cocamp i started working through their curriculum i thought yeah this works for me and this is really easy it was html stuff i've seen this before i'll bash that out brilliant right javascript does that like jquery i don't know but carry on going and so it got to the point where i was comfortable with what i was doing and i thought well this is this this free code camp they give back to the community as a whole i was wondering how can i make how can i how can i help them that's where i found github and when looking through all the issues and i found an issue where there was a diagram of it was describing some sort of class name on a bootstrap button and there was a typo on the image and the issue was to change the image so though it wouldn't be better if it was just code if you just have a button on the screen and have the snippet of what that code is for the button and i managed to get that implemented and after a bit of tune from we got a pull request opened and i got it merged and it was the greatest feeling in the world like somebody sort of verified my ability to code something you know so like somebody had said like yeah this is good enough for free code camp and it was accepted it was pushed live and it was just amazing it was all right well what else can i do and that sort of pattern went on from what else can i do how do i do that right that's how i've managed to do it all right somebody said it's good enough so what else can i do that sort of snowballed effectively to where i was implementing features in react i mean six months before that was happening i didn't know what react was i was getting features implemented and i was fixing bugs and it turns out then that somebody wanted to hire me to do something i was doing for a hobby and of course i said yeah all right and then here i am today knocking code out all over the place extending the reach for free cocamp making it easier for people to get there and start learning the way i did so stuart you have learned so much just in the past two two and a half years since you really dug in since that squarespace incident that was that was uh day one for you really with this new career and now you know uh we talked to developers all the time we were talking to some some people working as fulltime devs last night at a major company and uh you were basically schooling them on the the tradeoffs of implementing graphql and and why graphql was in many cases superior to just a like hacking together a rest api that has similar functionality so what has that journey been like on an emotional level going from being a fiber optic engineer from being a veteran in the uh the british air force with with tours in both afghanistan and iraq i'll add to that that transition into being on the edge of the newest web development technology and implementing it and implementing it at scale where millions of people are using it each month what has that process felt like for you it's been emotional and tiring but overall it's been rewarding even just noticing how i've progressed in tackling issues and thinking through what needs to be done what the the aim of what it is i'm doing and how my road map to get to that goal before it was just well sorry a lot of it was just googling how to do how to do make the thing do the thing i still do that now but i don't know it's the sort of humbling is the reach you can have just for fixing the smallest little thing i mean it could be the simplest like little a tweak with some styles maybe or a little tweak with some html it's maybe tiny for you and it's trivial to implement but the effect it has like you say on millions of people like so there may be some maybe it's an accessibility issue i mean myself has been an ablebodied person or an ableminded abled vision i wouldn't see the issue there but somebody's flagged it up and said look if you did this it would make it easier for us to understand the concept or to interact with the platform doing something as trivial as just tweaking some html css and having an impact on potentially millions of people it's humbling and you get it's almost wholesome knowing that everything that every feature you implement or bug you fix it's helping other people learn to do what you are doing which is the end of this that's the goal of free cocambers to get people programming so yeah it's it's i do it again right on third well thanks for sharing your thoughts on that the emotional journey where you are today we are extremely grateful to have you on our team uh i'm learning so much from you we're getting so much done things are moving so quickly free code game now a big big part of it is having you uh leading a lot of these new services and and rolling things out and helping us rapidly rearchitect things so stewart um i'm gonna go ahead and pop up stewart's twitter information i strongly recommend following him i think he's a very interesting guy who tweets some interesting stuff and just keep an eye out for new projects in the pipeline coming from stuart because they are very exciting anything else any last words for uh the audience just keep on hacking well well put thanks stuart so we're going to do some pretty quick ones i'd like to talk to you guys okay okay cool see you today hey have a seat bill you get to sit in the egg chair the men in black chair i don't know anything about this thing i just didn't want to do the whole butt in front of the camera thing yeah good good call so bill doesn't need much of an introduction if you've read the precoc medium publication you've almost certainly seen him on there he is prolific he's done quite a few podcast episodes uh as well and he's just an extremely experienced knowledgeable developer been coding for more than 20 years done high profile projects for lots of different corporations and government agencies around canada bill welcome thank you so much and no pressure that's a heck of an introduction thanks quincy phil you're somebody whom i look up to as a mentor i've learned so many software engineering best practices from you what are some areas of software engineering that you would say are the most interesting for you that you really want to drill down and continue to specialize in as your career progresses so one of the things that i come across a lot is the notion so just to for background for the sake of background and sorry i'm going to talk for a little second now i never have a problem talking so um what i do is i'm a freelance consultant and so oftentimes i airdrop into an organization when most of their apps are like seven to ten to more years old and they've got um so much technical debt that the the engineering team the dev team is spending most of their time you know dealing with that technical debt like 80 90 percent of the resources are being spent on that and the business side of the house or the clients in in there are really frustrated because they can't get much value out of this dev team so they're paying all this money for all these engineers and they're not really getting much out of it because the engineers are really busy you know living with the hell that they've created for themselves right and there are some really common things that i see from client to client to client that contribute to that around how how those apps were were built in the first place and and how they were you know basically it's a problem of architecture and so that's an area that i'm you know as i get more and more experienced i i think that's a really key vital thing and i don't think that you know i don't know that that that's the first thing you're going to learn as a pro if you're coming to free code camp and you know you haven't written a lick of javascript that's probably not the first thing you should focus on but um as as people come into organizations and and they're you know uh getting their first first job or they're in their their first year these are the kinds of things that um i want to figure out how to help people learn and understand and so it really comes down to like how how you architect your application and and the common one of the most common things is the the tight coupling of business logic integration logic and thirdparty dependencies so you've got some framework that's like you know some framework or library that's like the the hot thing of the of the moment and then you've got some uh integration of your dependencies and you've got all your business logic and it's one kind of ball of mud that's all really tightly coupled together so i see that over and over and over and over and over again and then what happens is you know fast forward several years that whatever framework or library it was is like no longer the hotness and in fact it's virtually abandoned and full of security holes the business logic that you have in there is not well documented no one understands it no one knows what to do with it and nobody wants to touch the thing because they're like well if we touch this we break like the universe and so we don't know what to do and so so trying to teach people how to tackle and solve those problems is what i'm becoming more and more interested in and i have i think a few ways into it but i still haven't like fully wrapped my mind around it sorry that's like a super long detailed answer to like that question yeah and you have a newsletter dev mastery that often delves into a lot of these more advanced i would say considerations in architecture decisions and and how to prevent the kind of toxic technical debt as opposed to the more manageable technical debt right yeah i mean you're never going to be like debt free or technical debt free but if you you know if you think about an organization like if you kind of zoom out and think about like okay they're pouring money they're investing money into like their dev team and less and less of that money is going to like generating new value because it's all being spent on like dealing with the craft of the past that that's a bad scenario right um so yeah so this newsletter um that you can get from devmastery.com that i send out um as often as i can when i have time and these are some of the types of things that i like to tackle so that and then you know just articles that i find interesting topics that i find interesting that i think would be would be helpful to others at um pretty much at all levels i think um but you really people in the first the feedback that i get is people in the first sort of five years of their career from like zero to five years tends to be sort of the sweet spot for the stuff that i put out um you know again if it's like if you written your first line of code yesterday it might not be for you yet but soon it'll be for you soon and then uh you know if you just got your first job for sure i'm gonna hit you with stuff that you you need to start thinking about um and so yeah so that's been pretty cool awesome uh so you've done so much for the free cocaine community and for the developer community at large by singing your best practices and we're very excited about you continuing to create more tools and resources for people to learn to code and especially learn advanced computer science and advanced uh you know application design what are what are some of the things that you're interested in covering in the near future so test driven development is is an area that i'd really like to get into and specifically test driven development with javascript because i think there's lots of content for tdd for a lot of other languages but i haven't seen anything yet that really nails it for javascript and that's complete enough so i i'd like to i'd like to write more about that and definitely like through the through free code through free code camp as a as a medium for that or as a channel for that um i think it would be a great avenue and so that's uh that's probably what's next on the horizon uh if we i'm kind of asking you on the spot but uh would you be open to me interviewing you on our podcast at some point of course yeah yeah for sure for you quincy anything come on i'm in i came to new york i'm at a party you gave me free food for sure all right great well we really appreciate you flying down uh from ottawa where the is that the capital of canada yes so hence like the government contracts and things like that okay great well thanks so much for coming down i i know it was it was a decent flight like how long did it take you to fly down it's actually really fast it's 90 minutes so i didn't suffer too badly but yeah it's a fast flight yeah well thank you so much for coming down and we're going to be seeing a lot more of bill on the youtube channel on the podcast on the medium publication at some point i know you know a lot about design patterns and advanced topics like tdd if you'd be interested in helping create some some guides and some introductions some primers we would share that with the entire world because these are things that people need to know that aside from like dusting off the gang of four book uh there need to be some more accessible uh entrees into these uh these topics and and i think that you're the kind of seasoned practitioner who also is good at articulating things and expressing things in a way that a relative lay person can conrock them we would love to put your talents to more use within the community yeah and i would love to contribute more i'm in you know i work as a freelance consultant and like every freelancer i have the dilemma of i'm always worried about where my next job is going to come so i always have too many jobs but uh but absolutely yeah i would love to do more and i'd be happy to and yeah the podcast anytime you want quincy i'm i'm all in and as soon as i have content around some of those topics i'll definitely look to you to to help me publish them so thanks well bill some thank you so much for coming out here everybody who's watching this uh bill sure on twitter and check out dev mastery cheers thank you bill yeah you're welcome i'll help you up with things like trap hey we still have just a few more minutes i guess are we supposed to get out of here we are yeah we should have like 20 25 minutes yes okay so i'm going to keep i'm fine i'm going to talk to this gentleman correct he's here at the beginning so i'm trying to throw him onto the camera yeah yeah let's do it and uh i'm going to try to keep these like fiveish minutes just a good idea yeah i'd love to talk to joe too yeah so yeah i'll give you warnings oh yeah that'd be helpful yeah have a seat raphael it's it's great to see you again man i saw i saw you in april um last time i came to new york city hung out with you at uh ebay's headquarters i think yes yeah welcome i should i guess you're are you from brooklyn specifically uh no i live in the bronze the bronx i always get the two b bros mixed up thank you so much for coming out tonight uh so raphael has been a major contributor to the freco camp wiki which was the precursor to the free co camp guide if you go to guide.freecodecamp.org there's a good chance that some of the articles you'll read there were authored by none other than rafael originally raphael tell us a little bit about yourself well i'm really from the dominican republic i came here 2005 looking for software engineer career but my translations were in that use so i went for computer science which was the closest and from there i finished school i started applying for jobs you know a lot of emails interviews and nothing happening so i decide i will go and study something else and i started doing let me checked python or some programming language there were a lot of jobs looking for those skills and checking different languages i ended up with javascript and i said this is my language i can use on the front end a case on the back end seems like if i learn this i'll be good anywhere i go so i started studying that i discovered free codecamp i say bootcamp seems to be what everybody's doing to learn fast get a job and this is what i named my new at the time uh my son was very young like three so i still live in my family i have a kid i finish school i'm trying to get a job soon and freako cam what's the place i said i'm gonna do this this looks promising i'm gonna do it and i start working on the challenges and because i have bad memory i don't trust my own memory i decided let me take notes but let me take good notes not like i did back in high school right so you essentially took your notes on all the challenges and that formed the basis of the wiki and i remember approaching you two years ago two and a half years ago and you had these elaborate notes with your solutions and everything on all these free code camp channel challenges and we used that as the basis for the wiki so what have you been up to i guess last time we hung out was april 2017 we hung out um what have you been up to since then i'm mostly working i started my a job um may 1st so congratulations thank you actually watch me last year so now i've been there for over a year and i've been focusing on that it is not web development per se but i decided to take a chance and not just focus this is what i study i only want to work on this so i went more into business size and working with ai but i feel like javascript full stack and i'm planning on consuming the new curriculum i actually saw region 3 and say oh this is great i should do this well if you do it we would very much welcome your detailed notes a lot of those challenges don't yet have we we added more than a thousand new challenges to the curriculum and a lot of them don't have detailed notes yet yeah so in there are a lot of things i check i have the legacy frontend certificate i never finished the back end because i wanted to master rihanna at least get to a good level before i finish the full on the full stack so i'm definitely looking forward to the react articles now have you had a chance to get your son he's like five or six now how old is he uh right now he's eight oh he's eight okay so uh has he done any coding yet are you thinking about getting him in front of a computer a little bit actually he has he asked me to teach him how to code he's a little familiar with ricochet because he will always see me in freako camp and i tried teaching him and it turns out he was more interested about the hour code and basically the video games that they had to get them interested yeah those games are great for kids and so is he doing scratch yeah he was doing scratch and i tried to have him stick to it and he wanted to go more towards just a full game where he would use play so you know it takes a little bit at least the interest is there right well free code camp is designed for adults primarily and not kids so that's not terribly surprising but i'm impressed that he's coding already at age eight i think that's great yeah i mean right now he's more into art but the interest is there so i'm planning on nurturing it whether he's planning going for actual development or just getting some code skills so he can eventually have his own website for his comics which he likes to do well rafael thank you so much for your many contributions to the preco camp community i see you're wearing a freako camp shirt this is the halloween shirt from last year with the css ghost shirt here yeah you're the ghost hey man it's been real uh stick around i'm excited to catch up and hear how things are going thank you very much thanks again raphael he was very gracious joe come on over here man it takes a little getting used to doesn't it you're getting to see why you chose this chair it establishes like dominance well i i couldn't find a chair that was a little lower i mean this is a this is a cool visual chair all right i'm pulling you up on here joe uh vintage joe hill on twitter check out joe so uh joe hails from norfolk virginia where he has been leading the prequel camp study group tell us a little bit about that well um i think it was 2015 when you originally made the call when i first found free code camp it was probably in i think you put out the call in like october or november of 2015. i was when i found free concern it was like july of 2015 and i was i was broke i was a i had been a salesman for a startup and i lost my job doing that and i wasn't making very good money of that anyway so i was a janitor at night and so i had had it being broke i was making about 800 a month at that point and i just had said i really want to learn how to code i'm tired of i'm tired of just kind of all my programming friends were traveling and they're having good lives and their social media feeds made them look very happy and i was not so one so one night you know everybody told me i needed to learn javascript so i typed in cheap javascript resource or cheap javascript coding camp or something like that because all the boot camps at the time are costing 10 15 grand and i didn't have that and i found free code camp and so it was about two in the morning as is my want because i don't sleep very much and i said oh and so i learned html in a night and i said there's something to this and i became really passionate about it because i was learning something for free i i realized i was on a path that was going to do well and all i had to do was put in the time i didn't have the brain power but kind of like lifting weights or doing anything else you just got to put in the time you got to put in the work and um so when the call came out for them you for us to start up like a local meetup i was like yes we need to do this and there was one already in virginia beach which is a city right next to norfolk but nobody was going to it i said well i have a lot of coding friends i can ask them to be speakers i'm sure they would want to contribute open source was kind of a new idea to me didn't quite know what it was it's like so how do you make money on this how do you how do you make a living at doing this and what i didn't realize is that as you build a community as you build a reputation and as you help others that that follows that follows suit so this was my way of a newbie coder not knowing how to teach still contributing and giving people who are just like me content that was going to be good and useful for them if they wanted to continue down that path so that's pretty and i've been doing it ever since um i i think i've become a lot more passionate about uh the code as well i couldn't have done any i i wouldn't be sitting here if it wasn't for like john small who was a guy who i through one of my contacts helped get him an internship as he came out of a boot camp and um he jokes he's like i don't know if the word blood oath is applicable here but he goes that's what i feel like and he's a very good programmer and he's paired programmed with me he's taught me a lot and then he just kept coming to the meetups as well and he's become kind of like a de facto admin there um arranging like meetups at nights that i can't make it helping with algorithm teaching things that i'm still not great at but he is um he's excellent and i'm really thankful that there's a part of the community that's just as passionate about teaching as i am so so yeah we've been doing that for almost four years now whether it be in virtual or in in the real trying to teach different topics um but at the same time still trying to help people as they continue on their coding journey and focusing on the free code camp curriculum has been kind of our focus for 2018 and that's really been helping so yeah yeah what do you all think of the new curriculum i i feel like i'm behind i got my i got my frontend certification in 2016 and um i got my first gig coding in 2017. so i've been learning a lot of stuff in between it like i was learning ios development for a long time and every time i went back i felt like i was falling behind and i think seeing the d3 curriculum come out now the node curriculum being more robust seeing react every time i'm clicking on an arrow and i'm seeing classes scroll down i think that's that makes me really happy because from where it was when when we started out to where it is now it's just so much of a difference um you can easily get lost in like articles and and videos and those are all really helpful um i think it's the navigating of it is is the tough bit and i think that's where the community really helps and say don't focus on this don't focus on that focus on this and you can build up to that and i think that's that's been the fun part and and on the topic of just focusing on learning fundamentals and and you are doing a job that's very different from what you originally prepared for so talk a little bit about your transition from web development to mobile development to sql focus development yeah absolutely so um i so my uh my my current job is as a sql and tsql transact sql developer and that's dealing with data uh within a uh financial framework um i had no idea what i was doing with databases how to import information and put it into a database i didn't know how to do any of that i had a frontend certification and from there i was like i like ios development i'm going to focus on that and i focus on that for about a year learning swift and i really wanted to do it and i was very passionate about it i was buying a lot of books i invested a lot of money and time into it and then i get a call from a recruiter saying hey we want you to be a programmer with us we work with databases mainly and with data so that would that's going to be your job and writing scripts for it and i was like okay and when i first got it i said well i don't know if i really want to do this i want to keep focusing on mobile but the more i started messing with the data and so are you writing python scripts and powershell scripts to okay i would there he is go on yes sorry about the camera thing but yeah i i think what i've been learning was um as you learned as if you're just starting out or if you're halfway through and you're not sure how that job is going to how that how all this is going to work out into a job it's going to work out in a job thank you thank you quincy's uh sit in that's very nice of you but like i said if you don't know how that's going to work out within a job or if you don't know if you end up in a situation where you're getting paid to be a programmer just go with it don't don't stress that it's not what you've been learning don't don't feel like it's been a waste of time because it really hasn't and and i've said this to you before but my life has been a lily pad of jobs to jobs to jobs and jobs and that's through background or education or whatever just circumstances and a lot of them haven't been the greatest but uh the universe god whatever i think the universe but will just throw these circumstances at you and you just gotta you just gotta kind of go with it and uh and in your coding journey um no matter what just try to look for the positive things look for the things that you like to do try to work on those buy a udemy course for 10 bucks to explore it more if there's no free resources do something like that and you're not going to waste a ton of money and you won't be disappointed i don't think so well thanks so much for sharing your background your very nonconventional background your triumph of going from janitor to sql developer and you know daytoday applying all these concepts and skills that you've built up over the past few years and i just want to thank you again for your stewardship of the norfolk group and everything you're doing to bring more people to coding and helping them accelerate their own careers and transition into new new careers i really want to be as involved as i can with free code camp i'm super passionate about it i'm passionate about technology and the life that it can give people and i want to thank you for founding the group of just founding the website itself and all the work that everybody's put into it as a community i think that's really important so thanks again thank you so much joe so joe joe's information is up on the screen vintage joe hill follow him on twitter this guy is exceptionally interesting and just while you're here this tattoo is so eyecatching it's so amazing i have a thing for cephalopods so i have like an octopus here and i have a squid here and soon i'll have cuttlefish and maybe a nautilus i just i like smart animals so they're very very very well done like my compliments to the artist thanks joe all right victoria do you want to hop on thank you maybe maybe we could do something different victoria mike would you like to interview one another i mean you're so you know each other so well over the years mike is such an interesting guy he's probably got a lot of good questions too so victoria has been interacting with the chat and there's somebody very special in the uh in the chat whom we'd like to recognize what's up murph we wish you were here glad to see you uh after interacting on the channel and quincy did say hi hi quincy hey so i'm here with victoria i'm gonna pull her up uh so you can follow her on twitter if she's on twitter are you on twitter i'm on twitter i don't know if you have my information it's nia skywalker nia skywalk that's a cool name and is it nancy iasky walk all right and uh as a matter of fact i do have nia skywalker great so this is victoria um carriolic karaoke you got it right all right uh carriolic and she is actually the woman who created the free code camp nyc facebook group back in the day there was a day when there was not a new york city group like one of the most popular cities in the world right uh so victoria thank you so much for joining us here tell us a little bit about your history with free code camp well when i initially went into free code camp um i was looking for javascript help i had just left a job i was doing freelancing and while everybody was okay with html css they wanted to have javascript and while i was familiar with copy paste use i wanted to know how it worked i found free code camp and started doing the challenges one of the challenges that popped up was hey if there's not a fb group and free code and for free code game why did you make it i'm like okay let's check then we had a group uh because i created that uh as for as people started joining they were saying let's all meet up let's all meet up i'm like okay it's good we had a couple people who have recently moved or had recently moved at that time uh wanted to meet up but uh nobody actually wanted to make the meet up so what ended up happening was i eventually got a couple of volunteers to come together to be leaders and we put together an idea for a coffee and code which we had run across on the free code camp group that quincy was running at the time it's still running i'm not even sure i'm so sorry [Laughter] um but we have a great thing coughing code meet a great make it a short thing meet everybody we put that together and at each of those meetings it kind of grew and grew and grew and we ended up meeting some people like megan like mike who you'll probably see later who ended up becoming our new leaders and have been holding the fort together for the last three years uh basically every so often we can get together and try to do something else like i tried to have a leader summit but then and that kind of fell through so i'd like to actually get more leaders at some point so if you're out there and you want to do something in new york city talk to me you got my information come talk to me because i want you to be a leader so that we can have one group a day studying every day of the week as long as we can okay come on in new york city is such a huge city there are so many uh people here so many neighborhoods so many bros how many different groups do you say are active right now to your knowledge within the new york city metropolitan area i've every time i find one i put it into our introduction our kind of description on new york city i think there was about 10 at last count in the metropolitan area including bronx and brooklyn and new jersey city and even something out in old bridge new jersey so if you're watching from old bridge hi that's pretty far out for and i have that listed on there yeah and uh i understand that you and mike whom we're going to hear from a moment have been considering potentially like we need better tooling around these study groups than just relying on facebook groups and and what have been some of your thoughts for uh what could make it easier for people to discover free code camp groups and to hear about them and to come to them so what my idea has been is to create something very similar to a meetup group but just for coders and have it at a website that is very prominently free code camp new york city and invite people who code to come in whether they know what free code camp is or not at the time so that they can then discover our wonderful group and continue their growth the idea was to have something that will allow us to not only have uh short once once one meeting events but also multiple events over time and maybe repeating events and then also huge events where people can discuss things very similar to how meetup group works but different in that it's a a little bit more facebooky that's the idea uh eventually we're going to get that going yeah well we're interested in building something like that we love meetup it's a great tool but it's like 15 20 bucks a month for a study group and when you have thousands of groups it doesn't really scale for a small nonprofit like rio grande so uh we're i'm very interested in getting kind of a feature set and ideas and doing some user testing with you as a study group leader who's put a lot of thought into this um and i understand that uh as far as like advancing the the web presence of frequent new york city you've actually bought a few domains too yes i bought the couple domains of freecodecampnyc.com because i want people to not be on facebook all the time and still be able to access the same stuff that we have on facebook for you as well because i know some people don't like facebook and sometimes facebook hides posts so we don't see what they are so i want you to be able to find all the same resources specifically for new york city folk i mean we have a ton of resources on free code camp as it is but not very much like within the same city as small community great well we we cheer on your we turn on your efforts to uh to create like a a unique web presence just for free co camp new york city and uh i'm hopeful that we can be linking to that and if you want to have like a slack chat or if you want to have a discord server or anything like that if you want to have your own discourse server like your own forum we're going to try to make it to where you you know each study group can link to all these different places where the community congregates and have like they can just have that wherever they want and have their own web presence because we're huge believers in the open web everybody should have some territory of their own on the on the open web not just on these massive platforms uh so victoria i uh i put your twitter information back up on there everybody who's who's here in preque in new york city check her out she's kind of the the kingpin of free cocaine new york if you will thank you thank you so much victoria here i'll help you up it's hard to get out of this chair all right and one more free coke camp new york person whom i think everybody should get to know mike mike simcoe i'm gonna pull you up here as well i feel very embarrassed because like i didn't think about how much higher this was i'm actually not that tall of a person i'm like 511 but many of the people i'm talking to are taller than me but they look shorter because of my choice of chairs sorry mike tell us a little bit about your experience uh venturing into software development so far oh wow software development well the the thing is that i uh it sort of was a passion since uh childhood uh part of it anyway not web development but software development and programming is uh so i i've kind of cheated i didn't start from ground zero i started at probably when i was like 12 writing c plus code and tinkering around with that i had no idea that was going to bring me anywhere in life that was literally just a hobby people play with trains i play with programs then way after many years later i was sitting in new york after traveling a while and i didn't have a job i didn't have anything to do and i was just i randomly stumbled upon a meetup group which was run by victoria uh for free cocamp and i found the curriculum and i really liked how it was structured just like one two three from web developer whatever because i couldn't find before this website i really could not find any concise resources i mean there was stuff you know codecademy whatever there was things that are available but they were kind of disjointed or they were in the form of just like here's a tutorial and then you're done here it was like one two three nonprofit projects all of that and it felt like it felt like exactly what i was looking for that i couldn't find before so i started going the program i realized i had a passion for teaching at that point which i didn't know before uh because uh just helping out um explaining complex subjects i guess i have a i got a knack for it just explaining things like even little things like for loops and while loops and enclosures and you know whatever and higher order functions and somehow i'm able to explain it to people in the way they don't they'll understand and another thing which is kind of weird the the best kept secret is if you want to learn something better teach it to somebody else you learn a lot by teaching people you do and i never knew that until i joined the group and i met awesome people at this group i met victoria i met some of my best friends here um and now now this is basically i'm i'm stuck with it i wanna see you know um i i even transition into web development uh fulltime freelance web development that's what i do i don't actually have a job i was going through a program and i found that i it just organically happened i learned enough through the program where i was able to start taking on clients of my own and uh just one day i woke up and realized hey i can do this so that's how that happens so describe that moment when you realize hey i can succeed as a freelancer like was there some specific i mean you woke up but was there some specific sequence of events where your confidence kind of kicked in um well yes uh but that moment probably did not happen when i was until i was like face to face with a client because my kind of teaching mode kicked in because i'm a teacher first i was a teacher first and a developer second and when i put my first ad online i was super nervous it was a completely lame ad honestly it was not i'm a developer i can build a website for you it literally was a one line thing that said um that said web programmer fixing website fixing broken websites that's what it said a fixing website problems and i got a call from uh from a lady uh who uh had a private business and she um she had a complaint that her website looked crappy on mobile it didn't work very good didn't look well on mobile at all and i was about halfway through you know i was about in the middle of the freako champs thing and the idea wasn't even finished i was like oh yeah there's this thing called bootstrap i could totally help you out and that's where the confidence happened because i realized she was looking at me for solutions she wasn't judging me she wasn't testing me she wasn't like oh you know let me see what your credentials are or whatever she was looking to me for solutions and i had and i had the solution she was looking for i was like i've done this i can do this i you know whatever and then after that it just started up i realized that clients are they're basically like students because part of what you do is you educate you educate you meet with them because they tell you what they think they want sorry sorry about that uh you have to uh they they tell you what they think they want and it's your job to actually give them what they need including the knowledge and the things so it that's when it happened for me it happened for me after a facetoface meeting not when i woke up when i woke up i was like i gotta try and i i didn't have confidence i had i had lots of stage fright i was like i don't know how i'm going to meet this person even when they contacted me and said i want to meet you at this cafe at this time i was nervous i was overdressed i was doing all that crazy crap that you do when you go on an interview and then i showed up and i was like tell me your story right and she's talking and i'm listening and i'm realizing i'm just i'm just being a friend here at this point i'm being a friend and i'm being an advisor like what can i do to this person what can i do for this person and um that's that's kind of when it hit me it sounds like you've picked up so many uh insights about freelancing over over the years and um i would encourage you to write about it or create a video series this is one of the most common questions i get is how should i get involved in freelancing and i tell people check out the freelancer show uh it's a podcast it's pretty good buy a bunch of longterm freelancers but what would be the single like if you had a single thing that you give as advice for people who want to get into freelancing who've been working through the free cocaine curriculum or have been just building projects on their own for a while and really want to start making some money as a freelancer what would be your single best advice for them the single best advice for them well how about this okay you are the expert chances are your client knows a lot less than you do about what he's asking you to do this is why he's hiring you so you are the expert and in that role this is this is a people position almost it's your job to convince the client that you can do what's best for them and i guess i want to say uh like they say in a joke they're more afraid of you than you are of them so that's you you don't need to be ashamed you don't need to be afraid whatever you think you don't know and we all struggle with this all the time we all struggle with the uh the socalled imposter syndrome they know a lot less and they're coming to you for advice and your job is to give them that advice if you're trying to get into freelancing just do it just start now start small don't uh don't worry about even if you put an ad out there and the first person you get is just not the kind of client you would want i mean there are different circumstances keep trying and just grab that first one after that first one that first assignment whether it's just do this one page for i'm not gonna you don't want to name actual money figures but here's just do this one page for not very much money just do it this is when you get your first kind of grasp of the skills that you possess you realize what you can do what you can do well so thank you so much mike uh i'm going to encourage everybody to check out do you have a twitter presence or anything unfortunately no okay yeah sure how would people track you down if they wanted to learn more about you or read more about your thoughts i'm sorry to say facebook yeah i don't meaning that i know i know that some people are you know don't like facebook or whatever i am currently on facebook that's the best way to reach me all right right on well thank you so much mike for leading the group for sharing your insights on freelancing and i i speak i think for most of the community when i say we'd love to have some more articles that lay out some of your insights because it sounds like you've been through a lot and you've learned a lot from the process all right thanks mike yeah let's change it up yeah can we uh can we so i'd like to interview both of them yeah yeah jump over here i'm gonna sit in this egg chair for a change wow just sitting in here the sound is so different it's like putting your head under water yeah so i'm here with two amazing people johnny bissell and uh and manish geary thank you so much gentlemen for flying out from your respective cities uh first tell us a little bit about yourself johnny hi everyone i'm johnny bizzle i was a csharp vb.net developer for seven years with the knowledge of sql what i found was i was working on web forms and quite old technology and i really wanted to learn new things like node and mongodb and um one of the guys that was working with recommended precode camp so i thought yeah i'll give it a try and that was about two and a bit years ago and i'm still plodding along through the massive course but don't let that put you off it's very good there's lots in there um so the the goal is to upskill basically with new technologies and get get more relevant uptodate work and along the ride i've spent a lot of time on the forum and the chat rooms helping out new beginners which has also aided my learning process so it's been it's been great and the the course has improved over the years and i've made lots of friends i encourage people to network and prepare program and meet other developers because it's difficult to motivate yourself doing stuff just purely on you on yourself um so yeah any more questions yeah yeah i got a ton of questions first let's hear from manish thank you so much for joining us thank you uh thank you for having me here my name is manish i am a grad student in uc cincinnati university of cincinnati in ohio i did my engineering from india in computer science and after that i decided to get a higher higher degree in computer science so i joined uc since then it's been a good journey i've started getting to getting into more more into software development starting with java and then recently i came across i decided to get into javascript because what's more important for me is to build something and just see it happening right in front of me that's that's where javascript is more powerful than java because you don't need a lot of things to set it up you can do it immediately with javascript just open your browser write your code and you're done so that's how i got into javascript and that's how i got into free code cam actually because uh when i was learning javascript they were just tutorials everywhere you read read read and there's no coding exercises or challenges that's where free codecam was helpful because i saw there were a series of code challenges you learn you write you see your code if it doesn't pass you ask for help and that's how you learn and uh i've been with free code camp for about two years now two three years now it's it's been a pretty good journey so far you're pretty good at helping other people uh yeah i used to i used to hang around in the health chat rooms me and there was one more camper called stephen james i mean he's a legend in the chat rooms so it was fun hanging around there and yeah i hope to continue more in this journey yeah thank you manish and and so those of you watching both of these gentlemen are tremendous contributors to the free cocaine community johnny bizzle is one of the most prominent uh people helping people on the forum i looked the other day uh i i looked earlier i was like i wonder how long johnny spent on the forum and discourse uh the the forum software we use uh which is great it's open source check it out um it said that johnny bizzle has spent the equivalent of five waking days on the forum helping people five days of his life that's not including sleeping and everything that's like five days at his computer making people's lives easier by answering their many questions and that that is so profound so johnny tell us a little bit about what drives you to help so many people would you say is there any is there some moment where somebody helped you or do you just enjoy helping people what what causes you to be such a super helpful person i would say that that probably comes from um my i realize i've got the experience of coding so i enjoy going up i think as well you used to give brownie points for people helping i thought hey i can get some brownie fires here those are coming back and then and then uh i was trying to keep the street going i got a streak going for about 194 days or something a lot easier than doing projects for 194 days so some of that was a bit of procrastination plus as well there's other people that i met through doing that uh who i now speak to on a more onetoone basis and um again that that motivates you to see people progressing through the course so yeah i guess because i've got a certain level of knowledge i want to share that and um and i think it's better to give than to receive as quincy comes from a teaching background as well and not my parents come from that background as well so um i guess so that's where i get the inspiration from uh but yeah and it is something to do so maybe maybe when i'm working on a project i just want to break from that i'll dip into the forum or dip in the chat room to see what's going on and it's just a case of breaking off from focusing on the same thing all the time as well that's another reason for doing it so yeah and manish how about you you've been such a prolific contributor to the code base what what has spurred you to to jump in and help out so much when i started learning uh when i had questions or when i had doubts the only place i used to go to was stack overflow and unfortunately people in stackoverflow are not very helpful most of the time no not friendly at all so you would feel hesitant to ask questions which you normally could ask free in a chat room or in a forum so when i joined free code camp i saw that there are chat rooms where people are willing to help it's not just it's not they're not condescending or they're not uh they don't expect you to know everything before you ask a question so it's okay to not not know everything and ask no one will scold you for it no one will think bad for it so that's how i got into free code cam and then i saw the code base on github and i realized there were a few aspects where i already knew things stuff like regular expressions or frontend framework like react or angularjs where it was previously at so i identified things where i could contribute and obviously the more you write code in uh that works in a reallife production scenario the more you learn so i thought that was a good way of uh upping my skills even more so that's how i started contributing to it and the more you do it the more you get attracted to it so it's it's always a good challenge to learn more and contribute more so that's how i got into it i'd like to add the um there's lots of people on the forums and the chat rooms who will suggest tools to you that are just fantastic like python tutor fantastic online tool for debugging code um so there's that benefit as well okay just people recommending tools and things all the time another great reason to get involved speaking of getting involved both of you have been so involved over the past few years and uh i like to think a free cocaine is still being very early days if you look at if you look at free code camp and then if you look at like wikipedia.org wikipedia has been going for about 18 years now and preco camp is tracking very closely to wikipedia's uh trajectory you know like in terms of total use usage of the the web application and the total number of articles and contributors and things like that for example wikipedia has about a hundred thousand total contributors and free code camp has thousands so we're on the same uh order of magnitude basically we're on the trajectory to to we'd like to be wikipedia for learning about technology uh and you gentlemen seem to be very longterm thinking and you've got bright careers ahead of you what are some ways that you think you might be able to contribute to the developer community through free coding and other resources going forward do you want to take that one firstly well i would just hope to continue to help people on the forums maybe also run the leads meet up so helping those guys getting through the the early stages the the very difficult thing about an online course and courses in general is keeping it up to date and there's always something new coming on on board so it's really important that everything stays relevant and uptodate because there's nothing worse than say when you buy a book and it's already talking about the old version of that code and you think well should i be learning python 2.7 when version 3.4 is out i could i'm sure you'd appreciate the frustration of that you might write a load of challenges and things already out of date how frustrating that be so hopefully i can help keep things up today and keep things relevant um i think that's that's one of the challenges for yeah of course i agree uh one more thing i can think of is free code camp has the guides recently in in github it is a wonderful resource just like wikipedia it's not just limited to react or or frontend there there are topics on a whole lot of sections like python java os operating system so what i what i think is if if we push to uh make guides a more accessible and more in a way that uh beginners who are new to free code camp they contribute more to guides that would help and what i've noticed is that even in the main free code camp repo there are sometimes issues with newcomers trying to set up their repositories and it's not working out in their local environments so that maybe we could uh contribute to that so that that in turn helps out newcomers to get set up far far faster than so that's what i think well uh thank you so much for joining us you all have the distinction of being our last interview for the evening yeah yeah go grab a beer i'm gonna i'm gonna grab some soda i don't drink beer but uh i'm i'm a uh i don't drink the big run tomorrow yeah yeah yeah take care of yourself gotta maybe load up on some carbs over here we've got all these sandwiches left but uh thank you so much for coming out we're gonna have top contributor parties every year this one's going after a great start this is our first one ever um but we're going to be in dublin and in hong kong if you can make it to the dublin one uh johnny amateur i know it's not as far from leads to dublin as it is from who leads to new york city but and then we're doing hong kong too you know you're welcome all you are all welcome at all the top contributor parties and i'm hoping that some of the people watching this right now will uh contribute to the community and we'll make the list of very elite capable people who are helping drive this community forward and helping set the course for so many people who want to become developers and who want to become more technical and break into break into tech so thank you both gentlemen and thank you everybody for watching these interviews i think we're going to do quick closing can we do a quick closing before we start cleaning up yeah yeah yeah yeah let's do that can you all right thank you again hey bring it in bring it in i want to hug money's scary too thank you [Laughter] all right hey it works it's so crazy thank you so much for helping me make it quiet in here so i didn't get a chance to interview everybody i think i was interviewing people for like three hours straight but i did get to interview a ton of people and next year you all become top contributor 2019 i'd love to continue the interviews if you get a chance to make it out to either dublin or hong kong we'd love to hang out we're going to hopefully do a fun run in both of those places the hong kong one will be very interesting breakfast every time they do a fun run yeah yeah eat a whole bunch of breakfast and then go run 10k now it's been such an honor and a privilege to share the room with all these amazing people i've learned so much about you here i didn't get to a chance to talk to jesse i didn't get a chance to uh talk to so many people that i want to but um stick around i think we're gonna we're gonna clean up real quick we've got lots of food if you want to take some home with you uh i'm gonna take a lot of food and stuff into my pockets and maybe do this the santa salmon thing from that movie if anybody remembers that movie uh dan aykroyd dressed up as a santa putting a salmon in yeah trading places thank you such a good movie do you want to go back and watch like a politically incorrect 1980s movie that's a great place to start so um i am so thrilled that everybody came and free code camp is early days we are rapidly growing in terms of people in the community the amount of things out there that we're uh creating for other people to learn from the amount of rock star developers and teachers that are that are coming through free code camp so we want to absolutely continue to facilitate as many people as possible who want to learn to code because my firm belief is that just like you had to learn to read when powerpoint type slides and things like that in the 90s if you wanted to continue to work as a knowledge worker now you need to learn to code and regardless of how your job may seem like oh i don't necessarily see where coding would be directly applicable to this i think it will be sooner or later because what we're seeing is jobs are the expectations are just getting higher and higher for your understanding of technology to be able to take these mainframes that we carry around in our pockets and put them to work for us because most of the work in society today is done not by humans but by robots and there's a very small category of people who are telling those robots what to do but we want everybody to be able to tell those robots what to do we want to have everybody empowered with the rapidly exploding computational power that is falling in price every year that we can all put to work so that everybody is you know a tony stark like superhuman who can just command the world around them and we'll get there very soon and uh so i'm optimistic that by helping more people become comfortable with technology and learn how to code and learn how to uh work with databases and use all these tools at our disposal we'll be able to you know expedite the the arrival of the singularity like a postscarcity society where everybody's just super enriched and everybody is able to live lives of leisure and lives of mind so what we're going to absolutely get there and everybody in this room is helping us get there faster so thank you and and for everybody who's watching this again i hope some of these amazing people have inspired you to get involved in the developer community and to contribute to open source and to turn around and teach all the things that you're learning and to to be utterly voracious and relentless in your personal development so we're gonna pack everything up we're gonna go if anybody wants to go uh grab a drink or grab a dessert i'm not sure where we're gonna go but i do think we need to leave this place far too late thank you again everybody for um for being here you
