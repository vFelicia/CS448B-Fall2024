hey everybody is Jessie and I hope everyone had a have a good weekend I spent all most of my weekend on on a redux reactor Redux project so I think I'm finally getting the hang of Redux which is awesome so hopefully there'll be a Redux project for the live streams sometime soon so trying to figure out what the next project will be after this one which we're almost finished with and I think I've realized that I'm actually not that at Redux but I'm bad at spelling so that's he could be more of my problem when I was trying to debug some of the stuff that I've been working on I kept thinking I wasn't I didn't understand Redux but it wasn't that it was mostly just typos alright so today's gonna be we're gonna do about an hour long stream so I have an appointment coming up a little bit later on also just a heads up if my wife calls I'm gonna have to answer it because she's not feeling well and she might need help with the kids so I might have to end the stream earlier so hopefully that doesn't happen and she's feeling alright but I it maybe an abrupt ending here so before we get started with any code a couple things I want to show you one is a bow wrote an article in medium free code camps medium about how to contribute to the YouTube channel so if you're interested in contributing in some way check this out and really useful stuff on there so actually as I was reading through this I was reading about you know what he said about having a video of of myself on the on the screen so if you notice today I do have video of myself on the screen so I try to make it as small as possible it wouldn't cover up a lot of the code I'll try this out I figure it's worth the shot and it's it's not like it it's really any extra work once it's set up the video just appears so oops I think I accidentally clicked on something but anyway I just wanted to share that with you there's a lot of different ways that you can contribute if you want to like captioning and things like that or even creating your own videos so check that out if you have a chance also wanted to just do something fun since we're kind of at the end of this project I thought it would be cool to go back and look at where we started or actually where I started so I want to show you let's start with this first so about two years ago almost two years ago this was I took the screenshot on October 10th 2015 I'm sorry October 14th 2015 this was the very first version of the Resource Center and this version never actually went live like this they were obviously a lot of changes but this was the home page so you can see some of the stuff is similar we still have a lot of the you know same options and everything the side menu was just these these buttons so when you click this it just brought the buttons in and out so definitely that's probably the biggest change other than the colors we also had the look here's the logo page so the logo page is a little bit different we had this this side instead of every all the options being at the top I had them down the side service request form similar we actually had to split onto two pages and it still had you know the cool checkbox effect that that I liked and we had the material designs style inputs also you can see definitely changed up the color scheme a bit this is a little bit heavy with the gold color here but but just be cool to kind of see where we came from and I definitely learned how to better utilize these action buttons he's floating action buttons for material design and I learned that you shouldn't have a million of them on the page just one also here's some sketch mockups that I had done as well so you could see some alternate designs that I thought of doing so here's one this was in response to some feedback that said well people might not even know that you can click in these areas right because they just have the line so I added this kind of darker background color we I used some of the alternate colors so here's that that yellow color that we've been using as an accent color but as the primary color this time with kind of actual outlines around the the fields in the same way just a little bit different this is actually somewhat close in color scheme to what we use now is you know just this yellow is the accent color here's an old green and white and here's lots of gold and then here's a blue color that's in our color palette so actually here's the I don't think I've used this on any projects on the stream but here's the dark blue and the light blue that are also in the color palette and then this is just another alternate so anyway this is sketched by the way if you're not if you haven't seen this before it's it's a cool program to just do like mockups and stuff with designs I don't I don't use it often usually just at the beginning of a project sometimes if I need to show show someone what I'm thinking and have it be a little bit better than me just trying to draw it on a piece of paper then I do it like that but anyway I found those I had those at screenshots still saved on my desktop so I just thought it'd be cool to check them out all right so let me check out the live chat and say hi to everybody before we get started let's see someone asked sorry I can't read the name but it says hi who can recommend SF SFTP / STP plugin for atom like SFTP for sublime I'm sorry I don't have I I don't know of any plugins like that I've never used any plugins for atom but maybe someone else in the live chat I may know about it peyt hey chase says hi from South Africa hey how's it going thanks for watching they have someone from India awesome thanks I I'm on says I'm too chatty yeah no I'm no I'm too chatty let's see all right cool let me get started oh cool yeah dispute some more shout outs from where we were when we said hello from Israel from Ireland awesome I'm gonna get started shriek ah s is this project towards the end yes yes it's it's almost finished really probably any day now we'll be we'll be done with it at this point I'm just kind of waiting for feedback of the official like yes this is fine we can launch this and then we'll be done we might actually start a new project before this launches because I don't want to be waiting for feedback and just doing little updates like even to be honest with you today's stream I was having trouble coming up with a title and a topic for it because there's not that much left to do so we're really gonna be I'll show you my my Trello board this is we're gonna work on today there's something there's kind of a weird thing going on with the cursor when we move over the upload button so we're going to try to fix that on small screens that icon that information icon we have on at this point only one of our check boxes overlaps the text so we need to fix that as well and then if we have time we need to fix the spacing between some elements in the form it's just it's not uniform so but you can see we're getting down to some things that are just I mean they're definitely I want to fix but they're not really like super important so so we may end up just moving on to the next project and then you know maybe I'll come back to this if something major needs to be changed but if we can get these three things accomplished I'll be happy actually if we can just get the first two accomplished in this stream I'll be fine with that let's see so let's go let me show you what the first thing is so we can get started on it I'm going to start my Pomodoro timer and we're gonna do 25 minutes of coding and then five minutes I'll go back to the live chat and answer any questions you have we'll probably do two sessions like that two 25minute sessions and then I'll I'll answer any questions you have before I end the stream so today we'll just do two sessions since I have an appointment a little bit later on see okay so here's what's what the problem is so you can see the cursor turns into the you know the pointer that's let's you know something's clickable but then once you get to the middle it changes and then it goes back so there's this whole area right in the middle right that huh interesting yes so there's there's a large area not not exactly in the middle right it's more like it starts here and goes all the way out so we just I just want to fix that it's probably going to mean easy fix I hope it's gonna be an easy fix but I just happened to see it at some point last week and figured you know may as well this will change it so I want to try to look at first and see what what is that element this has got to be something hmm button so I'm using of course dev tools Reggie this is just chrome dev tools with the dark theme on here and I'm just kind of going through the elements here trying to figure out really I was trying to see if there's some element that had that basic shape that we were seeing here with the with the cursors that we could see the change I'm not seeing anything with exactly that shape I do want to see what do we have with cursorpointer on it right now so we have that has the cursor pointer on it so let's change that let's see where that's at let's remove it and see okay so that didn't really affect interesting let's see if we put it on here as well no we don't have it on there okay cursor points are we have it on this span let's take that off mm interesting so I'm going through right now and just kind of removing it and it's interesting that there's been no change really cursorpointer okay I'm guessing that this is gonna be the one that really there we go okay so that's the one that we're really getting the the pointer from that's interesting all right so I'm gonna bring this back so it's interesting that it works but then there's something here we've already seen that these two had cursorpointer on them as well now let's go in here and see oh yeah ah so I'm not seeing it not seeing anything else here this is all oh yeah interesting what I'm going to check now then since I couldn't find anything here obviously in this div that would be coming over top of that I'm gonna check this div over here and I'll probably check this one as well I just you know what let me I'd like to change the screen size a bit and see if that makes a difference because I think that'll give me a clue as to where this is coming from if we can find it oops okay so it's still happening okay well that's interesting I was hoping it would be different on a smaller screen and then that would that would point me in the right direction here but it's not while we're here on the small screen you can see that this is that that icon that's overlapping so it should be out here but when we get down smaller it it overlaps we need to fix that as well I'll open this up a little bit again and now now after seeing what I did on a small screen I don't think we're gonna have any any luck by going to these other divs because the order since the order of everything kind of changed so this is above it you know and this one's on the side but then this one ends up being two above it and this one is above it there's nothing on the side I don't think there's anything in those dips so I'm not even going to check because that's um you know probably about 95% sure there's gonna be a waste of time at this point so I think I'd like to try putting cursorpointer on this container because there doesn't seem to be any real reason why it couldn't be because I if you click if I click this I don't even necessarily want it to where you could just click and potentially I mean I think I have it yeah you can't type in there but it looks like you could when you click it so I don't think I want it like that anyway so let's make this whole thing actually just on this one Hershey's who here let's see if we can mmm no it's the same same problem here interesting hmm I just happened to look over at the live chat again Cronus says hello from Miami Florida I'm stuck in my room upstairs wow that's that's pretty crazy how so are you safe there I know they have if you just in case you don't know Florida is getting hit with these huge hurricanes like right more it's pretty bad so I've seen pictures and video down there so I hope you're alright and you're safe down there where you're at Wow is it is it really bad in Miami right now okay coding and caffeine said maybe the zindex that's a good idea I was thinking about that earlier and then I forgotten okay yeah let's check some zindex stuff here yeah the input should actually have the interesting there we go there we go check this out this is our area where we're having the the problem right here where this says choose files so that's a problem that's a problem right there so if we couldn't see it all right so let's as long as we can move this out of the way and get rid of it somehow we should be fine let's try to change the Z index let's go this should fix it yep it does mmhmm but now we can't upload so that's no good all right so we need okay so there was something I can't remember what the property is let me think about this I use this on a project within the last few months essentially what what I'm thinking is there was some sort of property where I could pass through the clique basically through to an element that's below and maybe I'm maybe I'm remembering this wrong but I thought there was a way that I could do that essentially what I'm thinking of doing is setting this E and X back farther but then having to see what it was called let me see if anybody pointer events there we go I was thinking click events thank you John Hanson in the live chat just just put it in there thank you so much yeah so it's pointer events let's let's try this so let's put that Z index back on here now we have so we have some stuff over top of it that we want to set the pointer events let me do this just wanna do none here and then below see now I it's been too long since I've used this I can't I can't remember how this may be we have to put this one has to have four events no that's not it okay I have a link wearing shoe put a link in the live chat and so let me check this out I'd rather so I haven't looked at this yet but it says talking about styling styling inputs I don't want to I really don't want to get into styling like too much because I mean we already have the styles in here all right let me check out the live chat now because it seems like you all are putting a lot of advice in here so just thinking so embarrassed I was thinking of a way to change the div dot button label for upload try that positionabsolute was the index for one okay let's we could play with the zindex a bit and see if we could get it let's try all right now I have cursorpointer on here but it's not working on it's not working on it I wonder if there's any way to force it to work probably not yeah I guess yeah I kind of don't want to do it like this but this is probably gonna be the way to go what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put actually now I don't know if I can that's all should be on the upper layer of the C index item was a background on okay John John Hanson was giving me some advice on these pointer events let's see you should use a label before linking it to the file input okay I'm getting I'm getting two different sets of advice in the in the the live chat so let me let me pick one we'll try that out and see if it works now I've gotten a third or fourth okay I have quite a few different different paths here so I'm gonna try the simplest first and then if it doesn't work I'll move on and go down down the list okay so I'll do my best to describe what what each one is alright so it looks like the simplest suggestion to try would just be let's go back to here appearance none okay not working yes okay so that did not work I jarvez suggested that thank you for the suggestion let me know if I did I implemented that wrong but right now it's not working okay I'll move on to let's let's try this label so the next suggestion is make a label for the for the file for the input so let's try this so let me see if I can I assume that I guess I shouldn't assume it but I was assuming that one of these also has a label on here but I guess not oh well here we go but is this even doing it alright let's put this so is it possible whoops and the four the four goes with the name correct and not the alright not working good okay I'm bear to assist it does get with the ID all right I wasn't sure it's one of those things that I really I rarely do this on like by hand you know there's always some sort of framework or you just copy and paste the examples so it's been it's been quite a while feel like the only time I actually do this form inputs by hand as if I'm doing like tutorial exercises or something okay Fars ID okay all right let me try this looks like you need a label not a div yeah that's what I was thinking haha Robin says so is being a developer copy and paste not exactly it doesn't vote copy and pasting but that's not all alright let's see in class button alright let's take this off of here for now let's make those a whole nice okay so that works definitely want to okay great alright so that works now I wanted it to be so that if you clicked over here you could also upload so let's just try to put that over here yeah let's try to change that make this the label instead and see if we can get that to work mmm now it looks like that's not working let's see oh okay so when I change this to label it definitely changed some of what was going on here so let's see okay all right well at least we have the fullwidth but it's still hey there we go so it is if you saw that so I did click out here somewhere and it worked there you go so basically we have this this kind of covering things up right now so let's yeah let's go all right Susie index is not working for that now let's see see if we can go back to our pointer events all right great and let's make sure it's awesome okay so that works so my my timer just went off as well so this is good timing so let me just explain what what ended up working so we we made a label of this div here that was basically just a container div that span this entire area so we turn this into a label with a four attribute that matched the ID of our input right so that's big I mean that's nothing really groundbreaking right that's just like basic HTML how this works right you click the label and it activates the input so we did that we made sure that we put cursorpointer on this so that we got that that cursor everywhere the problem was that this was acting like a like a text area which we don't want to act exactly like a text area we don't want it to seem like you could click in there and type we wanted when you click on this for the file upload to be activated so we had to go down here to where this wrapper is for that for that text area and there we added our pointer events none so we actually ended up combining several of approaches that you all suggested in the live chat which is pretty cool and it all worked so now so far we've only done this in dev tools so let me go over to the actual code and do this and then I'll do my five minutes of answer questions in the live chat I just don't want to forget this in the five minutes that I answer questions so let's go over to the code and change this so our service requests thought I had a service request for them open here there we go so it is open here let's see where upload is here we go okay so this was what we turned into a label let's make this a label who's that there we go all right so there's our label we also needed to change this there we go we needed to change this to displayblock because when we added the label then it was no longer displayblock so we needed that we need to we need to add the upload nor the before okay upload so that's it through for this area right foot didn't we need to put cursorpointer I think we did let's do that as well there's a pointer and down here for a file path wrapper okay we already have it here for a file path wrapper we need to do pointer events none all right let's try that out save that and we'll save that and let's just give it a hard refresh make sure you clear out everything here in dev tools okay so let's whoops oops I forgot we needed to put make the zindex for this input nothing we had a negative one so if we go file field I think this is the only input so I think we're safe to just say input here there we go okay so now we have our pointer over this whole thing we click it great we get that let's awesome alright cool so mission accomplished on that one and that took it did take a little over one Pomodoro session but since I was trying to narrate what I was doing at the same time I think we'll leave it at one all right great let me turn on my fiveminute timer and I'm gonna go through the live chat and see what what questions you all have see all right so I'm going all the way up to the top taught tough fix it says wish your wife quick recovery thank you so much I if you weren't here at the beginning I mentioned that my wife's not feeling well so I may have to if she needs me I may have to end the stream and go help out with the kids but so far so good but thank you I appreciate you saying that Mau Mau Russa says you guys are awesome thank you I appreciate that oh cool I can't I'm sorry so I remember having trouble with this name last time because it's not I wanted to say Brian but I don't think it was Brian Bri a I and I'm really sorry I usually can remember but this one I couldn't remember so let me know what let me know how it was I know I eventually got it right so please let me know how to pronounce that properly I don't want to mess it up anymore but anyway he said I liked the last examples of the sketch mockups I don't remember what the last one was let me see okay so I'm guessing it's it's this one the last example with all the colors so cool thanks yeah I kind of I thought it was cool I actually think it would be cool to do to have like a little Easter Egg in the in the the site somewhere to where you could just change the colors up so it wouldn't really be that obvious that you could do it but if you if you searched around enough you'd be able to toggle all the colors that'd be cool if I had a lot of time if maybe I would do that Shandra asks which text editor do you recommend I use plugins for code editor I use atom and I would recommend atom I like it but I also like Visual Studio code so those two I have actually used and would recommend I can't personally recommend anything else because I haven't really there's nothing else that I've used in really light but I have heard that sublime is is pretty good and for people who know them it's really cool and they they really like it I when I see people use them I'm always really impressed with it but the learning curves a little bit higher than something like like atom sublime notice we have Marcus it's a loaf from Serbia hey how's it going Nova blue asked what editor are you using I'm using Adam Srikant says we'll ask the new project also be react I don't know so actually this let me know what you all think we've done so far we've done to react projects would you really like another react project you like something else I'm gonna tell you let me tell you what's what's up so I talked to my boss this morning to try to figure out what the priorities are in terms of the projects that are that I know I'm gonna have to work on at some point you know in this this year that I thought that we would have a project it'd be a good candidate for react and maybe even redux but it turns out that that's not really a higher priority I thought it was a higher priority than it was so that can wait and might not even it might be more towards like the end of the year like December so for the immediate future so basically for this month for September the main website for Franciscan edu needs some work but it doesn't need it's not gonna be react not yet I'm eventually gonna redo that site completely and react but for right now I don't think I can dedicate the time to that although I'd love to redo it so for right now it's probably just gonna be me going through we currently exists and trying to make it better so cleaning up the UI trying to make it faster where I can mainly by you know getting rid of unused code and kind of eliminating a lot of the the image it's really image heavy right now and I think unnecessarily so trying to cut down on that just making things look a lot more clean I mean you all kind of probably know my style by now that I like things to be really clean minimal but here's the thing though that's going to be on project because it's already built using a content management system called Ektron which is dotnet framework based so I'm gonna be working in like C sharp like dotnet templates and stuff and I'm gonna be working with just straight like HTML CSS it's going to be really different than what I've done before so I'm actually I'm a little bit nervous I don't know if that how well that would go down but that's probably going to be first priority for the month of September if there's some if there's some other way that I could do a project and just spend like an hour a day on this project when I did the stream and then the rest of the day I can work on the main web site that might be possible as well but I'd like to know what you all think I mean if you'd like to switch it up and do something that's not react and instead do something that's like dotnet I mean that's that's fine with me I just want to make sure that if it's possible for me to do something that's more relevant to you all then I'd like to do it you know obviously it's not completely in my control because I got to work on whatever you know my boss tells me to work on but within that the freedom that I have on my projects I'd like to show you all what you want to see so anyway let me know about that my 5 minutes is up for this for this session I'm going to start another Pomodoro session right now and then I'll get through the rest of the live chat I realized I didn't get through that much of it so I'll just have to get through some more on the next time but anyway let me know think about it and let me know the only other project that I probably could work on is I have I have to work with Salesforce so there's like an application that we have for students who are interested in coming here they want to apply to go here that's all built through Salesforce and they have I think it's called like eight basically it's it's kind of like their templating system it was described to me is like some somewhat like JavaScript I'm not really sure that I don't really know if the person on the phone describing this was a developer or if they were sales so I don't really know how accurate this is but basically there was something that Salesforce uses that's they sold me if you know JavaScript you'll be able to do this so I don't know a lot about it but I know it's gonna be mostly CSS stuff occasionally maybe I'll go in and change some of the templates but to be honest with you right now I was checking out earlier today and I don't even know where to find the template so I'm gonna need to do some more research on that that's also going to be kind of a weird project where I'm going to be working kind of inside this other system to try to do it you know I won't be able to set it up exactly like I want to I'll just have to kind of work with what's there and change it so anyway so just let me know what you all think about those projects if you're interested in anything or you know any other ideas for now though I'm gonna go back and do some work I just not realized I had this still up on the screen I wonder if anybody just tuned in and like saw these really what what is going on with change of this project how I covered that up and it means you alright so let's do another Pomodoro session let's see what's next up on here so fix the checkbox all right let's fix this one I already showed you a little bit earlier what was wrong with it I can show you again in case you didn't see it before but check check this one out in that icon when we move over it overlaps all right that's that's no good it also overlaps at another point here so we need to fix that and I may have to just come up with some other way to position this other than what we're doing now and I'll show you what we're what we're doing with it okay so that checkbox now I've made its own component and I just call it an icon checkbox so if you are following along with what we're doing on github that's in the components folder you can look at ICON checkbox j/s and that's where we're at so right now I just have some inline Styles on that and or actually just position positioning this with absolute positioning so it shouldn't have been that much a surprise to me whatever the positioning was messed up usually when you try to use absolute positioning like that and you want your site to be responsive it doesn't work quite like you wanted to unless you're positioning something like in the in the corners usually the corners worked fine but things in the middle of the page don't work out at least that's been my experience so I'm thinking there's we could either do two things I could try to work with the existing breakpoints and change these values based on that I'm not really excited about doing that that just seems like it doesn't seem to me like the best solution the other solution would be to not use absolute positioning try to use try to do it some other way so that it wouldn't matter at all what the screen size is it's always gonna be at the end of that line so let's um let's see what we can do let's mess around with it here in dev tools a bit and I mean maybe we'll have to change the markup it will change how I was working in the in HTML somebody's just zoom in a bit so we can see and I can move this off to the side here let's make it there we go so there's the overlap so I mean obviously we could like I said we could just shift it around but here's here's what I don't think that'll work it's not a good solution also because I want to keep this component reusable right so there could be it could just say photography in that case the way we're positioning and now it might not be a bad thing we'll just shift the positioner on but also it could be really long so I guess what we want then is we wanted always to appear at the end and I suppose even wrap this wrap around it does yeah so even if this wrapped around I guess we would still wanted to appear at the end it won't look great but better that's better than overlapping the only other way that I can think of changing it that I know for sure would work all the time I guess would be to move the icon to the beginning but I don't really think that would look I don't think that would look right I guess we could try it but let's see if we can do it a different way and then as as a last resort we could probably just move this up here and then we'll know that it'll always work because it'll be right at the beginning excuse me sad too heady on okay all right so let's see I think our problem yeah let's go back to here and let me show you so the problem before that we were having was that I was trying to put this checkbox or this icon inside the the label right so I was trying to pass that in as a prop so basically the the text with an SVG in line I was going to pass it all in and I think we're having trouble with that and then I think it was I think of the Sebastian submitted a pull request where he came up with doing it away similar to this and then I changed it a bit turned it into its own component and then switched to this style of positioning so I kind of figured I mean ideally I would be able to pass it all in here I but I guess I have to be honest with you I can't even remember I'd have to go back and watch the video you did this I can't remember if it just totally failed and it wouldn't work at all or for it just wasn't working exactly how we wanted it to see but in any case that's why we we have these separated out so then you see when it comes out you know here there's this whole container div you know with all this stuff in here and then next to that we have this other div that has our image display table that's interesting let's mess around here's what I'm thinking right now what if we could take these two container divs and have them display sidebyside alright let's just I'm just gonna mess around a little bit here just with some of these properties and see what we get I need to reset some of this position of my getting with this to be actually let's get rid of a lot of this stuff when it comes to this kind of thing that's just okay I don't mind that now we may still have the same problem we get that's it okay I guess not this might just might not be a bad way to fix it if I can get them both on the same line okay all right I think I'm gonna check I have an idea but I'm gonna check the live chat first see if you all have a better idea oh okay just saw one there we go thank you who's that Carlos Carlos thank you so much that's exactly what the problem was all right for a second there I thought I forgot how CSS works I had with a hundred percent that's why all this stuff I was going with position and floats we're not working awesome okay so let's try this out we're just gonna move it back and forth of bed okay not mmm not terrible let's get rid of this float all right that's better yeah I kind of like that better we just did oh yes I like that better okay this is what I'd so here's a tip you probably already know this but if you want to make your screen even smaller than it already is just make your console dock or your dev tools docked and then you can shrink it down really small like smaller than normal I wanted to do this just to see obviously not no one's ever gonna be looking at it like that but I just wanted to see what would happen if we if this went on to another line mmhmm okay not bad let's just give this a lot more text and see what happens there we go oops yeah okay it looks like it it's not bad like this but once we get down smaller then it's not great I guess I'm okay with it for now since we I think this is the longest one that we have yeah I'm okay with it it's not perfect but for our use case right now it definitely works if we end up getting longer ones that need that need this then then I can worry about that at that point okay let's see anyway Hamza says you won't be going smaller than 320 pixels with ya for sure the only reason I wanted to go smaller was I just wanted to see like let's say we had something that was really long I just want to try to simulate what would happen and then after I thought well why don't I just put the text in there so that's why I was this was a better way to do it just adding more text originally I just didn't think about that but you're right yeah nothing's no screen that I know of is smaller than 320 pixels and with all right so let's just do this in our code so you end up having this div well and my mind block should work yeah okay I'm gonna have to get to that div with with this CSS there's no I don't think there's any way just rush I wonder which style I'm passing down let's check out our service request let's find our checkboxes style star checkbox it's trying to track down where our styles are here we go okay so we do have checkboxes here let's see what that margin bottoms being applied here great okay so whatever we put there with our margin bottom should work should be fine we don't want we don't want with 100% let's go with with Auto ok Auto words so the width auto floatleft and I guess we'll do this I can't remember with the default display was an English blog so we'll do displayinlineblock with Auto floatleft alright forget that one down and now this next one whoa okay that was definitely not the right thing to do what did I do all right let's see is it the float I was further with maybe that's odd I don't think I change anything else let's see all right let's let's get rid of these for now let's see what we had okay so if it was display table before mmhmm all right and they like to think about something different all right I was checking the live chat to see if I missed anything okay all right let's see what it yeah let me see that this week this okay maybe if I move this styles into I could maybe try to move this into our icon check box component and then depending on whether or not there's an icon I can have different styles that works yeah I guess first I did I just need to test see if I could do this twice on two different checkboxes I'm guessing that it wouldn't work it like let's say I did it on two different checkboxes right next to each other and have the same weird stuff happening so I guess it wouldn't matter either way let's see if I can I've never seen this max content min content before I want to try to keep this display table now and then set the width Auto and see what happens maybe I'll have a different result than I did before what was that I'm just gonna not set the display now that that was the width thing ice I guess is what the problem is we got to give it some sort of with I guess alright let's let's do let's give it a hundred percent with but minus the width of the icon so let's see how how big our icon is so icon yeah so like 24 pixels it's just the Sade let's give it 25 so let's let's give our with 100% 25 pixels see what that does okay better now now we can do this why is it going all the way up there okay okay thank you know live jet okay flexstretch is with my default a place automatically without any descending with all right eyes huh good some said said what's this sorcery in the in the hole I've said yeah it's yes okay so John Hanson is saying we can use flex display flex and then justify content space between alright let's try that out because I I'm thinking like I ain't hurtin Lee did something right me I don't know why this is now appearing way up at the top I'm trying to do it over here because I floated everything left interesting there we go and see all right let me try out this I want to show off this flex thing that John's talking about but basically we I thought this might end up being tricky because I remember when I messed with it last time it was it was a little bit tricky which is why I end up going with what I did alright so John's saying dude display flex and then justified content space between so flex so are we putting it on here then let's try it up oops whoa okay all right let me see whoa all right I lost track of time a bit let's let's stop here so I can get to some questions and then I have to get to my appointment and let me let me check let me scroll up now but to get to the last place where I left off in the live chat so sorry we're not gonna be able to finish this right now I feel like we're really close it's just a matter of figuring out what the best way is that that is going to work for the screen sizes I think we have maybe at least two possible solutions that that I can think of right now that will work I'll just have to finish those up tomorrow I need to check I need to check on traffic though to make sure I can get to my appointment on time because they're doing construction on the highway on the way there so alright it's telling me okay it'sit's it looks like traffic's not bad right now so I should be able to answer some questions and still be alright to get there let's see it's trying to find where I left off okay I think I found it yeah it's the last thing we were talking about was what the next project would be okay so I'm ash asked about a quick briefing on what I'm building so ash not sure if you're still watching but I guess I can quick click update for Astra for anyone else that's watching and wasn't sure what we're building this is just a react react site that allows users to submit requests and upload files and then those get sent to a project management system through their API and the files get uploaded to our server which we're running a droplet on digitalocean with node and nginx is a reverse proxy and users can also just get some other resources and some basic information download some images so it's not really that involved probably the the most complicated thing we're doing here is handling file uploads and form data okay so at some point nova glow had said but aren't you only doing clientside editing the moment you refresh the pager where it goes away yes that's true and it looks like no glow got some answers as well but I'll explain this just in case anyone else is having that that can't see the live chat I was thinking the same thing when you edit things in dev tools yes they're not by default they're not permanent you can set it up so that your project files actually can be edited through dev tools it's really cool I just never took the time to set that up but for now it's just a really fast way to see what's going on make some changes and I don't like to do a lot I don't like to do more than I can remember because then you're right if you refresh the page then you lose it all so I like to do a little bit see if it works and then transfer it over to my files and then kind of go back and forth like that I just uhhuh um so just says what I see your face yes if you can see my face it's kind of odd if I keep doing it like this I might I might switch and get a different camera I'm just using the builtin camera on an iMac and the angle is weird like I just feel like it keeps getting a shot of my forehead all the time and you can't really see my facial expressions so I think it would be better if the camera angle were a little bit lower so I don't know maybe I'll keep a lookout for any webcams that are on sale rude rude rang Shu says can anyone recommend me one of among the following so amber Jas Orillia Jas and polymer Jas I'm sorry I don't have experience with those I mean I I know what they are I've read about them but I don't have handson experience I don't really feel qualified to make a recommendation so hopefully there are some other people in the live chat that can can recommend something to you oh cool Blake said said hey I like the face preview awesome cool maybe oh uh maybe I'll keep it as long as I was afraid it would block too much of the code but it didn't seem to be a problem so as long as it's not a problem I'm fine with with leaving it there okay see Daryl asks react native versus PhoneGap and got a suggestion to use react native from word rang shoo yeah I um I also recommend react native all right I got to answer the door so I'll be right back okay yeah I recommend react native as low I phone gaps been around for a while and I don't have personal experience with react native yet I will soon but from what I've from what I've read about it if I had to say I'd say good with react native but like I said I don't have handson experience with it okay so it'sit's Brean so earlier I'd asked for clarification on how to pronounce a name so it's is it is it Bria no Driscoll is that it let me know if that's I'm pretty sure that's what that's what is supposed to be okay I was I was talking about editors earlier and Nova blow says Emacs is better than them Patrick says Emacs evil mode is better than Emacs I don't know what that is oh and brains of M user as well cool çf coder says what responds to the framework are you using doesn't appear to be bootstrap it's material UI but Bharat says so is there any project on Salesforce you'll be working on yeah actually I do have something that I need to I'm gonna work on in Salesforce so maybe I'll be doing that on the the livestream I'm not sure yet we'll see I don't know we'll see how it goes I still haven't decided what project I'd like to try to stick with the project I mean I could bounce back and forth and do like two different projects at once but I don't want it to be confusing I mean I could I could put them a different playlist name them you know different things but I'm undecided yet as to exactly what the next project will be okay all right I'm kind of going through a lot and just looking for any questions especially from new people because I'm gonna have to leave here in just a minute okay all right so I'm gonna end with this John Hanson said I could put a green screen behind me so that my background would be transparent you just see me act that would be really cool I but I don't know about having a green screen in my office yet we have a video studio that's it's actually right on the other side of the wall from my office and there's a huge green screen that they use in there but they're always filming something in there so I don't think they'd let me do my streams in there I don't know I'll see maybe they have some leftover green green stuff that I can hang that would be fun all right well I got a oh actually here's one more question Hamza said have you watched noob cat on Twitch I haven't watched her live yet I didn't I didn't get a chance we I talked to her on Twitter before which was really cool she she had written an article about livestreaming and I let her know how helpful that was for me and it was really who she was really encouraging for my stream and said said nice things about it so I really want to be able to watch her live at some point I'm just the time for me just doesn't work out but anyway I think from a little bit that I've seen in the stream it's awesome so alright so I gotta take off I got a good two to an appointment now and thanks for watching I really kind of hoped we'd get more done I really I actually really wanted to like combine the sass files and organize them a bit but it just didn't didn't work out today so I'll be back tomorrow assuming my wife doesn't get any worse and then I might have to take a day off and take care of the kids but otherwise I should be back tomorrow and thank you so much for watching in for all your help I really appreciate it and have a great day
