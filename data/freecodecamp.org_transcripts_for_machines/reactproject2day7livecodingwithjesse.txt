hey everybody its Jessie and good morning if you're in my timezone or near there so this is a lot earlier than I normally stream but we all get here at the University we all get pretty much everybody gets to go home at at noon today because there's a big conference going on and they need the parking spaces for the people attending the conference so we all have to leave so still wanted to do a stream so we're gonna do one it's gonna have to be a short stream though because I I knew I had a meeting at 1130 but I had completely forgot that there was also a goingaway party for somebody that works here in the same building as I do at 1100 so I'd like to I'd like to stop into that cuz he's a really nice guy so I like to be able to say goodbye to him before before he leaves so I I was just in the middle of reviewing pool requests so kevin has submitted to pool requests they both look really good i am i've already merged one and i was just kind of testing the the second one and this is kevin AKA kevie and 60 20 in the in the chat so i'm not sure if he's in the chat or not i expect this is going to be a smaller audience since it's a totally different time and I didn't even post it on on Twitter or anything like til I don't maybe a half hour ago probably not even that long ago so hey everybody there are a few people and the chat is picking up a little bit okay so I'm just gonna finish up just checking this out I'm looking at it there's no you know don't see any errors other than our normal errors that we get so it's looking good so basically what what Kevin did was the first thing he did was refactor the side nav so there's nothing visible that happened but behind the scenes there's a lot of code that it was kind of removed moving around and so it makes it a lot more a lot more streamlined and now for the letterhead he's made it so that it's basically let me show you the code first I guess let me get rid of this and open it up again okay cool so we have the letterhead card now and that's its component here so basically he's before remember we had just copied and pasted everything which was okay just to see how the layout looks but you don't want to leave it like that so kevin was completely right in refactoring this into its own component and now let me go back to the letterhead there we go so now you know we just have you know the letterhead here and it's since there's not a lot of them it's okay like this and I probably won't make it any smaller than this but we probably could just loop over this and we could take these props and put them in an array and then we could just loop over that array so we would just do like a red dot map and put all the cards you know in here like that so that could be a further customization that we could further optimization that we could do but I don't know for is not really a big deal to me if it were closer to like 10 then yeah I'm definitely making I'm gonna make an array and look through it alright so this looks good I'm just gonna check on my other screen I have the I'll pull this over in case you haven't seen it before this shows this is the pull request pull request 10 and this is just showing the difference between it so the letterhead card is entirely new so you see this stuff on the left hand side is how it was and then on the right hand side this is how it is now after the changes from the pull request so before we didn't have it at all and now this is in the air and this all looks good and then letterhead has changed you can see you know able to remove a lot of this stuff because now it's in letterhead card also able to remove a lot of that into that repetition of all that markup replaced with letterhead called card so that looks good I'm going to merge that also let me let me paste in the address for the end Rock server so I'm gonna paste that into the live chat and let me bring it over in case you can't see what's in the live chat it's this highlight highlighted bit right here if you can see the site as as we're working on it and inspect it with dev tools and a lot nicer than having to wait for me to click on something for you to check it out also I do have the the stream open on Instagram as well so let's get started and okay I just checked the live chat so Taylor asked just 31 persons here yeah it's just because it's in such a different time than I normally do and there I didn't give a lot of notice with either the YouTube alert or with my Twitter my tweet about it alright Zanna Zanna has to go she's going on a trip and she's got it for Paris so thanks for checking in have a great time on on your trip okay let's get started so hopefully now if you want to see this you've gotten that now we're going to merge this in so I've actually merged the master branch into this this branch that I pulled on for testing which is the pull request ten so I've already merged into that just to test it with everything and make sure it all works properly and I do want to doublecheck one more thing before I merge this and that was the side nav so I want to make sure yeah I was afraid of this that this might be the case let me jump back mmhmm okay on my other screen I'm comparing that last I just wanted to make sure that when I did the merge that nothing got messed up with the last pull request number nine that I had merged in and so I just wanted to check what it should have looked like so let me let me look at this is sine MF yeah maybe this just to say okay maybe it is all right I thought I'd seen something that didn't look right but right now that I'm comparing it it looks looks about the same as it should yeah okay cool everything looks good so I'm gonna check out master branch I'm just gonna do like a basic merge I know we had we tried out different ways to merge things it in a previous stream what's this letter I'm just gonna do a really basic merge here and not go through so there's a look basically the reason I said that is there's a lot of options for how you merge and what happens when the merge goes in so you know the most basic is just merge but there's a lot of other things you can do with that all right also another thing that was added in pull requests 10 from Kevin was that the random images in fact they're random you know for each each card now which I mentioned yesterday uh I like that and that's really cool also this is fixed so before we had uneven spacing so between the first two cards we had no padding at all and we had a pretty good amount here probably double with this is and then no padding again so now that that problem is fixed so looking good let's move on now and we're gonna do is share a story yeah this is where we left off yesterday with shared story and I'll bring up the mean Logan even show you oh I also I forgot to tell you what what happened so yesterday I left you all and I had to go check out somebody's computer so it turns out the problem so basically the person could not access my website he was saying that there was just a blank screen and this has been going on like for a long time and other people from the IT department had tried to check it out and and couldn't figure out what's going on so my suspicion was correct I suspected that he was just using an old browser and he was he was trying to open it in Internet Explorer 9 and didn't realize it so you know the user was you know basically not yeah he's not really into computers so he didn't realize what was happening but he he assumed that it was opening the link automatically in Chrome because that's what he normally used but the default browser on his machine was set to Internet Explorer 9 so that there was a lot of confusion I think from that because he was you know saying and thinking that it was in chrome where it should have worked not realizing that it was Internet Explorer 9 and some people had checked out his computer before and told him that his browsers were uptodate so he assumed they were uptodate as well so I don't know if they just meant chrome is uptodate and didn't bother with Internet Explorer because they didn't think anybody would use it but in reality like Internet Explorer 9 that's pretty old I believe that came out in 2011 so really old so anyway I was i I was a little bit I'm relieved that it wasn't my project it wasn't my fault but I feel bad for this for this person because there was important information that was being conveyed through that that site and he couldn't get it for months he hasn't been able to get it and so I feel really bad about it and he was legitimately angry about the situation and I can't blame him I just wish he hadn't been angry at me since it wasn't really my fault but the unreality based on everything that he was saying and been told it seemed like it was my it was my issue so in fact he had actually been told by other people that it was it was on my end it's my excuse though so anyway I can't be mad at him I was a little bit upset about the whole situation in general of like why are we still have Internet Explorer 9 on computers and here so anyway but now I'm uh I'm over it I was I was mad for a little bit but now I'm cool so anyway just want to say that because I know you all had some of you had said at the end of yesterday's stream that you wanted the update so there's the update while Patrick says in the live chat end of support for Internet Explorer 9 was a year and a half ago Wow Wow I did forward on so I I wrote several emails to various people about what happened and I'm I'm trying to get the browser's updated or like at the very least I wouldn't care if they just deleted Internet Explorer off everybody's computers that would be fine with me too because why would you need everybody seems to have chrome on campus anyway so anyway it's not really you know my department's responsibility or my call at all I don't actually have any access to update anyone's browser even even if I wanted to so I can't really fix that but hopefully you know we'll be able to get that fixed at some point because this is not the only time that's happened some people somebody was using a really old version of Safari once and that's why my site didn't work some people continually try to log in with Firefox 3 from somewhere on campus and I can't figure out who it is because my my error tracking setup for that site also tells me their email addresses but the code can't even run the part where it grabs their email address so it gets held up even before that so I can get an IP address but I don't I don't have any ability to figure out whose IP that is so anyway enough of that hopefully I won't have to handle too many of those situations again and oops form we're gonna go to suggest a story form okay so for this form we're just gonna have some paragraphs and some form elements we decided yesterday that we were not gonna put this on a card we're gonna try to put it you know directly onto the paper and we're gonna make this font a larger size and we'll see how that looks so let me move this off to the other screen and first thing first things first let's just make a container where we got the story I thought I named it okay so let's copy some some some of the markup over from let's see posters letterhead would actually be good to copy it from because we have some P tags up at the top of the letterhead just like we'll have with this okay so I'm just gonna grab this whole container and then we'll remove what we don't need that this will save us a little bit of time typing and now we don't need to see that and we can get rid of this and I'm just gonna leave these paragraphs here because that's fine for now I don't I know how paragraphs are gonna act what I'm really worried about those I want to make sure that we get the right font size here so I am gonna pull in from materialize the responsive font so I let's see if we still have this open I think we do yep so we still have our materialized CSS file open from their github repo so I'm gonna find the the font so it's it's flow text it's not a font this is just the fontweight so you can see I'm sorry not the phone what I guess it does set the font way but the font size so you can see a different screen sizes the font size will change so there's a bunch of media queries so obviously like I'm not gonna spend my time rewriting all these media queries right so we're just gonna take this and put this in our CSS file and I'm just gonna take this for now it might be helpful to have some of these other kind of helper classes at some point but I'd rather bring in what I need because sometimes at the end of the project you never go back in and remove all the stuff you don't need so I'm not gonna copy everything in right now I'm gonna try to be a little bit more responsible about it I know the last project there was a bit of a mess in the CSS and I just ran out of time and didn't get to clean it up so don't want that to happen this time so I'm just gonna put this in the do we want to do this yeah this is I'm gonna put this in a separate file for now I think I'd like to keep my CSS in different files yeah and then that'll help keep it a little bit more clean so let's make another file or another yes I already made this aw I was thinking I'd make another directory but I think I already made it so I think we just need to touch source styles yep that's it and we'll name this all right and I'm naming it float X because that's the name of the class so I I'm immediately gonna know what that is I guess if you haven't worked with materialize you might not know what that is but at least you'll know maybe I should change it then because I do want people you know down the road to be able to look at this and see what's going on so we'll call responsive responsive text okay yeah that's a little bit more descriptive of what it what it is oops and I almost misspelled this so I didn't mean to say tough I wanted to say touch so touch is how you create a file in the command line okay now we can see that we have this file if I open up a folder here we should have that file what happened to this should be there right source styles oh I just didn't see it how did I not see that I think I was I was thinking that it would have showed up green since I just added it so that's why I didn't even bother reading it which I don't know why I didn't show up bringing normally new brand new files do appear as being green so not not really sure what's going on with that but we can finally copy this in and let's save that and then we'll bring in I'm probably gonna end up using this will it use this everywhere actually I won't use this everywhere so there are gonna be some pages where I won't even need this because we're gonna have we're not really gonna have blocks of text so I don't know that I need to pull this into every page let me check oh I have it on the other screen isolettes let's just check quickly because I think we can try to yeah I'm not I don't actually want it on this page I want to keep control of exactly what these sizes are on the home page same thing with this page and this page of text yeah and yeah the the text inside of cards I'd rather keep more control over the size just because I do want to make sure that we have cards that are the same height and I don't want to be huge if I applied the flow tech stuff in the cards that they would be really big so yeah so some of the like these pages obviously I could apply it to but yeah so my whole point point is like I don't want to have to load CSS in places where I'm not going to use it so here's what we're gonna do so we can see like on apt ass we're importing our Styles up at the top so I'm just gonna copy that and paste it into story and change this to responsive text okay now we should be able to put I should be able to put flow class or float X class here and it'll just apply to all these paragraph tags so let's see if that is the case oh okay I see let me oops you need to go out and back inside let's try this okay cool if you didn't catch that so initially I just had one dot which would have meant from where this is so from the views folder it was trying to find within the views folder a Styles folder okay which obviously is not the case okay so it worked when I had it like that within App dodge' ass because app Taj is is here within the source folder so what I had to do was put another dot and that's saying go up one level right so go to the source folder then try to look for the Styles folder so be aware if you're moving components into other other directories within your project that you may have to change some of this stuff depending on how how you've done it how are your projects set up so at some point we're gonna make a components folder and move some things into there and we'll have to take care of that when we do that as well so all right but for now it's just what we want so we have this it actually ends it's pretty large fonts you had a fonts pretty large now this is larger blocks of text then that will have so actually I think I'm going to bring in the the real text because I would like to see now that we have the the flow text applied I want to see what this would really look like so you can see it's not nearly as much the second one's going to be a bit longer and bring this in okay so this is the actual text something just looks weird to me about this what what is wrong with this I'm no does that look odd to anyone like it it just doesn't look as nice as maybe there's some conflicting styles between material you I and this bed yeah maybe that's it oh maybe it's the font am i not all right said saying the font family is just saying serif which is not what I want maybe that's what I wanted to be rubato which I thought Roboto was the default for for material UI maybe I missed a step and I have to actually pull in Roboto at some point let's check let's check on that because I'm not really gonna know if this looks good and unless I see the font nice check out usage I'm not seen anything there because there's no there's no search for the site I wonder if it's like that with everything if I'm not getting family okay so Roboto is it's here it's just not being applied here for some reason okay let me I'm about halfway through the stream for today so I do want to go to the live chat just just quickly and see if there are any questions or you know any new people to welcome before I solve this this font problem Oh Sean says connections really laggy so yeah sorry about that okay Patrick sing there's there's more to flow text than what I'm copying so let me check did I maybe I missed maybe I missed some stuff here I mean maybe I should pull in some of the baseline font stuff okay I'm not maybe I'm missing it yeah maybe I had thought that maybe the base font is different so then all those the flow tax classes and the media queries would be slightly off from what I'm used to bill says have you thought of using styled components yes I have thought of using the style components so I'm gonna look into that I would actually like to make each of the components completely selfcontained if I could so say that could be a goal for this project because then I'd like to be able to just reuse them it'd be cool actually to make like Kevin had made the letterhead card it would be cool to just make card component which I mean they already have the card component so I'd have to call it something different it could be card but basically a component that would be like it would have the card there but you could control everything in it just through props and then that way I could reuse that for all my projects just control and what I mean by what's in it like whether or not it has an image at the top a title and overlay text action buttons so all of that would be in props and maybe I'm missing something and that's how material UI is already set up and trying to reinvent it here but I think that would be really versatile and especially since I use cards and pretty much everything that I do that would be a component that would be awesome that make that completely selfcontained with everything that it needs to render and just be able to drop it into any project I just see Rowan asked about what the issue was yesterday with the project and I CEO told him that it was Internet Explorer 9 yeah this is terrible Blake asks what is docker docker is like a weighted like like you make a container and your program can run in that container and you can transfer that container so and I mean like everything can run like your entire setup the whole stack can be in this container and it can be copied exactly on to anybody's machine no matter what they're running and it's supposed to be able to run in exactly the same way and you don't even have to install all the same stuff on your machine but if you're running something in node and you didn't have node installed on your machine it wouldn't matter if you had docker and you downloaded the the container then you should be able to run it so that's my understanding of docker I haven't used it in at least a year I would start I wanted to use it more and I just got busy with things and never felt comfortable enough with it to use it for you know in production i Patrick had some and and Bill had some good explanation as well for for docker basically saying it's like like a virtual machine yeah so said it's like like a lightweight virtual machine nice Emily arsenal of color aquatics says come on guys thumbs up this yeah cool give it a thumbs up if you want I don't I mean it's cool when your thumbs up that but I don't really know if thumbs up mean it means much in terms of of anything I don't really know how that that helps other than letting me know that you like the video though they sebastian saying mature you i was designed with Roboto font mine so be sure to include it your project where is that look over okay Patrick said I did get all of the flow tech stuff so cool so Sebastian I'm let me go back so we're working on trying to get Roboto to be the font for for this which I'm it's already being applied to like H tags and I'm not sure why it's not being applied to these P tags at least inspected again yeah so you can see like on our P tags here it's it's saying that our font is just saying serif so I'm not exactly sure what the problem is and why we're not getting you know on the same page you know some things have that fun some things don't so I may just have to import the fonts in one of my main CSS files actually here's the thing I'm not sure about we can test it out but if one of you knows it'll save us a few minutes if I put in different CSS files so it's obviously any importing that font in photo Roboto exists already somewhere material UI and it's already being imported if I try to import it again in another CSS file will the browser know that and not bother bringing it in again or will try to bring it in twice that's that sounds weak the only I mean possibly if if there are different locations that it was getting it from it might think it was two different files but right it shouldn't try to pull it in again right so I know there's a delay so it'll be a minute before you all hear that and can answer so I guess in the meantime just to prepare I can look up okay so this font what a thinner bottle a regular medium bowl I don't know that I need all of these whoops okay so I rarely use bold or medium so I'm definitely not gonna use bold it's possible that if I want something to be bolded I'll use medium so I will grab that cuz not I think about it there's might be some stuff that's boated and then I do use I do like to use some of the thinner stuff if I can on some monitors though it's really hard to read the thin stuff so it definitely has to be a large font for thin to work so let's bring that and let me check this see this okay Sebastian says it's inherited but not using their about a font Roland says it's from the same if it's from the same source it's won't if it's different location versions it will try okay but since it's already imported you can just use Roboto actually I I want to see what's being imported let's see what let's check it out here see where it's coming from or might be easier just to check here wow that's a lot of stuff that when you refresh this page I don't want to see all this okay you know what maybe I won't be able to see it okay I do want to see though if I before I pull in all the font stuff if I just go into this responsive text new flow Tex are we getting robot enough here we go we've got Roboto now okay cool so anyway thanks you said that so I think it was some of the Sebastian said that made me want to do that instead so thank you oh yeah and Roland's mentioned since the age tags are using it it's obviously imported already so that should be that'll work I mean maybe maybe I could put in one of the CSS files I'm not gonna worry about it right now I just want to get this page done but in one of the CSS files maybe I will put just like globally like everything gets Roboto one of the ones that I import into the app.js file okay cool so that's it now like I said I'm still not sure I'm just not sure about the size I mean maybe I maybe it just looks weird because on my other screen I'm looking at the really small size so this is what I'm looking at and it's like a huge difference so maybe that's just the kind of the weirdness that I'm but I'm getting here all right but I do want to before we end today I want to throw in some some fields some form field so let's check out the fields sexy oh so okay so which one there we go I want the floating label that's what we have now so I need two text fields and then a multiline with the floating label okay so first things first let's import text field get that semicolon out of here I don't care if you all use semicolons but I just now that I'm not using them anymore I can't stand them let's see floating label there we go let's pull that in we're gonna need to make a little container for that so we want that to be 50% with so we're gonna get class and that's gonna be six okay so with the classes that we brought in from materialize the materialized CSS framework this means on small screens it's going to take up 12 columns which means full width and then on medium sized screens it's only going to take up 6 so it's going to be 50% width and then we're gonna put our text field in and we need two of those so and put that there and then we need a full width multiline text input and yet we want the floating they were one so actually I want to try let's see don't want to try this I want to try this I'm just curious oops now I meant to put another column let's see how this turns out that doesn't at this I'm gonna get rid of the hint text obviously I don't want the hint text but why is this this big there must be some sort of max max length set okay so that does stack like we wanted to so the thing I was saying I wanted to try out is not to make another row and just to put all these and my my reasoning was if I put another row it's gonna add in a margin and then it's gonna look Auton small screens so there won't be a uniform spacing between here so that's why I did it like that and I because I had noticed that that's how Kevin did it when he refactored the letterhead page all right so let's check this out to see if it has a max width or I guess just a width where is it getting this width from okay so that's saying a hundred percent so at some point it's gotta be setting a width I mean what'd you leave this over a bit second you see okay yeah this yeah that element with here is controlling that so let me check the docs see if I can just change it in here because I I want it to be like here I do have it full full width and that's how I want it to be fully there we go let's add four with true I wonder if I just add it if it'll if it'll go true let's see I think it might yet there you go so that's that's the answer it we just have to add full width which is awesome so full width now let's check it out awesome ok so we have our full width going on okay not bad I think on the other as it is now on the site it definitely has a bit more padding but I'm not I'm not super worried about it okay cool so let's add in let's get rid of the hint text and then we'll add in a button and time is it and then we'll uh then we'll wrap things up a hint text there we go cool this is just I don't know if you all can see this but it looks like it's just not quite as smooth like the animation for this bar it's not quite as smooth as I have it actually that's because on the only other thing that's it so I'm not actually trying to do like the the really cool animation that they have here where it actually expands and shrinks so that's that's why there's I think I was just adding a different color and and weight of border okay cool let's find our buttons amazing raise fun yeah this is what I want so I just wanted to say submit really to just need a simple simple button that says submit and we do want it to be the primary color so let's import this button and then we'll bring in this raised primary put it all right he's fun so it's style is not defined yeah okay what's we missed something then style margin 12 all right I'm not gonna worry about that right now let's just take out the style and see how it looks and then we can put our own margins in if we need to okay cool so actually I'm gonna compare this okay so this is my current effect I don't think they're the same oops okay I may change change how this is working because I don't like it as much as this I'm gonna check I'm gonna have to check the material design guidelines on this just to see but I mean this is I didn't build this a while ago but I'm assuming that I followed what was with materialized CSS for this effect and you can see there they're definitely different so in terms of I mean yes there's a color change and then a slight increase in the shadow to make it appear like it's coming forward but you can see like the increase in the shadow is barely noticeable actually now that I look at I'm not even sure that's happening and I'm not sure yeah this is happening faster it seems like there's not there's not as much of a transition okay so yeah I'll have to work on that button because I just it's not as satisfying hovering over that button as this button I don't know maybe it's just me but but realistically like if I need if I want to keep a consistent brand standard then we need to have the same thing so I'm gonna need to change how this button works then to be consistent with what we're doing across all our sites okay so I think that's it so basically this page is layouts done just need to change change some text work on this button a bit and that's pretty much it I'll probably didn't do it like a comparison to make sure that you know these this font size is correct I just wanna see what the base font size is for material you either this is going off of alright let me go to the live chat I'm gonna go through quickly and hey one of my coworkers is in Iceland right now and she just was watching the live chat and sent a message said hello from Iceland glad you're working hard so I'm not even seriously still watching enough but that was cool alright so I'm gonna scroll up I'll try to get through everything but I do need you know in a few minutes I'll need to end the stream hey we ended up getting about 50 we're up to we're up to 49 viewers now so that's not bad I was I was a bit worried no one would watch because it was at a different time let me scroll down yeah if you have any questions you throw them in a live chat but I am I won't have a lot of time to answer so if I can't get to him you just send them to me on Twitter and I will say I know that some of you have asked me to look over your code and send me messages and I've just been really busy lately so hopefully I have some time this weekend to check it out but just please be a little bit patient with me and I'll try I'll try to get to it okay let's see Rowen says it's too much text together so yeah now that it's a bigger font it does look like it's too much text so yeah we'll see we'll see what to do that I there's a good chance that some of the the text will change when everybody you know kind of reviews this again and so we might be able to get rid of of some of that text rohan says I'm partial to semicolons just feels complete to me I did it was weird not using semicolons at first it felt the same way but now it's you know it just looks nicer without them breath mesh as hey friends can I get a job if I do full stack developing and free code camp yeah I mean you you can there there are people that have definitely gotten jobs after doing free code camp so it just kind of depends on the quality of your work and you know how many places you apply to what they're looking for there's just so many factors that go into actually getting a job that I couldn't say for sure you're gonna get a job with free code camp but it's definitely gonna help you and help you increase your skills and you know the more skills you have the better your portfolio is the better chance that you do have of getting a job Oh Sebastian I see you saw a fullwidth before I did so thanks for that sorry I didn't then look over and see that now Patrick says why is the bottom field so different than the other to look where the blinking cursor ends up on the bottom once it's active yeah it's because it's a multiline field that's why so it's it's multiline and it's currently set to two two rows so if I really wanted it to be uniform I guess I could set it to one row and I'm assuming it would expand actually now I want to I want to make sure that it expands yeah okay to expand yeah I don't I guess I don't mind that I'm used to that but if it'll look better we could always just set it to initially just only in one column I just want people to know that they can type a lot in here if they need to oh and I just see Patrick already got his answer in their live shot so thanks thanks Sebastian for forgiving that answer nobody said today estring barely yeah I did I'm not gonna be in the office later on when my normally streamed so I had to do a an early stream but it might not be bad maybe some people who because of the time difference and things couldn't see the later stream maybe they can't see it so so I guess that's you know that's kind of cool and says would you recommend the beta version of free code camp or the other one and do you have any idea when the beta version will be released I have no idea when it'll be released and I I have no recommendation when we're another because I haven't gone through the beta version yet so I wouldn't I wouldn't feel comfortable giving a recommendation I'll just say you're gonna learn a lot no matter what if if you're a little bit more adventurous and want to are going to be okay if like something's a little bit buggy then I'd say go for the beta version if you're the type of person that gets really mad when something doesn't work right then stick with the regular version because you know obviously it's a beta so there's gonna be things that don't work right so that's that's my my advice some talk talk about my editor it is Adam it is the SETI theme SETI yes it does look similar to sublime Jay rec says what age did you actually start working as a dev okay let me let me think I'm gonna have to do some math in my head here I also say this I got paid to build websites when I was I don't know like 18 was probably the first time I ever got paid to do a website somewhere around there so but I definitely didn't consider myself a developer at that time so I would probably say let me think how old am i right now 30 I think I'm 31 right I'm 31 maybe around 28 I'd say I probably wouldn't really consider myself a dev until I was around 28 and at that point I was freelancing I think I was freelancing for a little while before that but it was mostly like stuff you wouldn't really consider being a dad like I don't like customizing WordPress themes like basic CSS customizations to a wordpress theme to me I don't necessarily consider that being deaf work I didn't consider dead work when I did it before so so whenever I was doing that I you know I I was getting paid to do web site stuff but real dead word probably I was maybe 28 somewhere around there give or take a year so actually occasionally I see people say something like I'm already 20 years old and I don't have a job and as a developer and like they're freaking out so don't worry about it don't worry really so yeah okay so DeMar DeMar key how I'm not sure how to pronounce that pronounce your name so let me know if I'm pronouncing it wrong but De Marchi Allen says I'm 23 with good practice could I get where you are definitely definitely for sure so when I was 23 I was I think I might have been a waiter at the time all right and then I taught high school okay demarcus okay I was like thinking it would be like the French pronunciation but Demark is cool sorry for mispronouncing it so yeah so anyway though let me give you just a brief timeline I actually did a video explaining like my timeline on my own channel so if you check out the link in the description of my channel I did a video on like how I became a friend of dev that'll give you a better idea of just like how long it took me to learn things so but basically when I was around let me think so I graduated with a business degree in 2008 I couldn't find a job for like six months I worked as a manager at a Burger King and then I quit that job and I worked as a waiter at a restaurant and then I got offered a job as a high school teacher so I took it because it was in my hometown I really wanted to move back so I took that job and I taught I actually taught Latin and religion at a high school for almost four years then I quit that job and I traded money on the stock market for a little while until I ran out of money and then so obviously I stopped doing that and I looked for work for a couple of months couldn't find anything and then finally I've started doing website stuff and for I say probably the first year of doing that I would not have considered myself a dev it was mostly like search engine optimization work writing blogs do making minor CSS changes so I was definitely in my late 20s before I really started to try to learn how to be a dev so basically within within the last like three years maybe four years I've gotten to this point because before that my knowledge of development was really like basic yeah no I didn't I did not have a formal degree my degree is in business with a specialization in banking finance and economics not related to web development although good to know it's it's good to know how to handle money and and run businesses and things but yeah so basically my point is I think you can definitely pick up web development and really quickly get to the point where you're good enough to make that really nice site it's really good thing so for me it actually took a couple of years but I had kids and you know at a family I was trying to make money so I was taking a bunch of you know I was taking work doing anything like during that time of me learning I was taking work you know doing landscaping at people's houses painting I'd like paint their basement I would take work like that were just writing writing blogs and things like that so I was taking work doing anything I could to provide for my family so I couldn't dedicate all my time to learning so if you did have time to dedicate to learning you could probably learn way faster and get better than me way faster so don't don't be discouraged at your current age it's just if you have the the desire and the talent and and the time to put into it you can definitely learn this stuff I'm not saying it's easy takes work but you can you can learn it alright so I'm gonna take maybe like two more questions and then I'm gonna I'm gonna wrap it up okay let's see I missed this question so DeMarcus asked and do you consider real dev work to be working from scratch I wouldn't say from scratch but the reason I say that about WordPress is a lot of the customizations you can do in WordPress come like just through their admin interface so you don't even interact at all with with code necessarily so that's why I kind of didn't really consider myself doing dev work I would say you don't have to start from scratch because really who starts from scratch right even you know you set up a project you install a bunch of node modules and there's stuff in there that you know there's already been thousands of hours of work put into you know what you're doing just from your build tools alone so no one starts from scratch but I think the ability to go in and build a site using HTML CSS JavaScript actually being able to write the code at that point I would say that's your developer if you can't do that then I don't know that that I don't know that I would call myself a developer I know people are different definitions and but if I wasn't able to go in and in a code editor and put out a website you know just with the you know basic markup then I wouldn't be I wouldn't feel comfortable calling myself a developer so hopefully that helps I don't want to offend anybody who who does WordPress theme customization it's you can make a lot of money in that and it's definitely needed but that's just how I felt when I was doing it DeMarcus s what are your thoughts on bootstrap yeah I think bootstraps great I think that's a great way it takes care of a lot of really basic stuff in CSS that in my opinion is a waste of time to do yourself I mean it may be like once just to see how it is and I'm thinking mainly like like a grid system you know all the different kind of things you need to make things work properly across browsers so things like that like nobody codes that by hand so that's really really useful so I think bootstrap is good to know there's a lot of places use bootstrap as well Jay says what resources are using to learn this stuff yeah free code camp YouTube videos courses on Udacity all right DeMarcus said great advice Jesse just subject channel so thanks Hank I'm glad you like the advice and thanks for subscribing to my channel as well yeah I hope that helps I thought I saw one more question that I missed but now I can't find it so sorry I okay here it is it was a question about angular four are you gonna cover anything like this for angular for I don't have any plans to cover angular right now I'm not ruling it out for the future but I have no plans at this point to do anything with angular so yeah thanks for watching everyone and I'll see you on Monday and it was great thanks for adapting to the difference in time I appreciate your being so flexible and yeah so have a great weekend
