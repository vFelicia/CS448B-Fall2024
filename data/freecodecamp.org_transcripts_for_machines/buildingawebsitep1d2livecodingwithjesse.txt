hi everybody I'm Jesse wykel and I'm a frontend developer and this is my first live stream for free code camp I've done some live streams on my own channel but this is the first one on free code camp which is has a lot more subscribers this is an awesome opportunity to hopefully help some more people the goal of this live stream is just to show you what when my job is like as a frontend developer so I I'm not preparing a lot of stuff in advance on purpose because I want you to see my mistakes and see how I work through mistakes and frustration and kind of fouled how ideas just come to you when when you're working you know sometimes sometimes you think of awesome things that you didn't even plan because of some difficulty that you're having so I kind of want to show that aspect of it so if you want to check out my other videos I have my youtube channel up on the screen now you can also reach me at Twitter it's just Jesse or Weigel the project were working on now the repos is live you can check out the code follow along and just to bring you uptodate here's the plan we're going to build a site at first it's just going to be a static HTML site CSS JavaScript the goal is to convert it into a react site so we convert everything into components I'd like to pull data from the WordPress API render it on the server side with react and then have it be served to the client already prerendered it'll be good for search engines like that but that's kind of the longerterm plan for now we're just working with the static site so I explained more in depth about why I'm doing this and what we're gonna be doing in my video yesterday so if you want to later check that out on my site I'm not going to go into it again for the people that might be tuning in that did yesterday I can see all right you guys are really positive in the in the comments they're so awesome I'm going to try to keep up with the live chat if I can I know there's some delay so I might already be talking about something else by the time I see your comments so I apologize if I'm a little slow on that so let's get started I'm going to show you what I'm working on I'm taking a site that's partially finished and I'm going to I'm going to finish it but I'm going to redesign it a little bit the goal is this is a site for a department in Franciscan University the University of self has a style guide and brand standards for websites and then this particular department has a certain style that they're trying to achieve so we need to blend those two styles together respecting the university's branch standards but then trying to really stay true to the vision of this particular department and we have a really short time frame for the site I want to at least get this the static portion of this slice done by Monday so I have a colleague of mine setting up some servers and things so that it will save us some time in a later video we might get into some of the server stuff when we need to set up node and express and react but for now right before I started the stream I'm working on a header so I'll show you let me show you the home page quickly just to recap from from yesterday I added a few things remember we added this hero image you have this picture back here we're going to change this phone at some point but for now it's it's okay it works we have the sticky knife when we scroll down and what we added were these these cards here these image cards the other side had had something similar not quite with the same effects we're trying to keep kind of like a material design feel to things that's what at the University we try to follow material design patterns it just brings a nice consistency to everything we had a question about static websites and react so the reason I'm building a static website first and then moving to react is because my timeline is so short I'm afraid it might not be possible to build it all out and react and get all the custom post types and WordPress and everything ready before we need to launch so if I can't get it already at least the static site will be ready to launch the drawback is people can't edit that content in in WordPress I'd like to use that for the content management because it's so easy for people who don't know code to edit but to kind of buy more time we're doing a static first and then there'll be something up it won't be as easily editable but at least there'll be something up for launch it will be fast and then when we change it to react from a user's perspective there really won't be any difference but behind the scenes it'll be a lot easier to to manage and update for the people that are going to be tasked with that so that's why I'm doing it like that when it comes to angular versus react I've worked with both I haven't I've just done some some fun side things with angular I haven't actually done you know productionready sites for clients with angular but I do like it I have actually launched sites with react and I like it as well so I'm a big believer in using the tool that's best for what your project is so if you know I don't take sides in angular versus react so and I'm not I don't know that I'm qualified to go into which is best for which situation but in this case since I'm Way more familiar with react and we have such a tight deadline that's you know that's kind of the only thing I could go with in such a short timeframe that I knew for sure I could get launched and a little it would work okay all right this the home page the only other thing we did from that's different from yesterday is we added these little these little background images here these were in the original site that's partially completed and the the client the people from the the department the catechetical Institute they really love these little kind of flourishes here so we're going to try to keep these in as much as we can and um these are actually done with a double background image so I'll show you that real quick because I kind of thought that was cool it's something that I really learned how to do somewhat recently so I'll show you that quickly before we move on to new stuff here's my I'm working with sass so it's not straight CSS the success so it's slightly different if you're not used to that that type of syntax so if you see we have two background images just separated by a comma and then when we go to position them we just separate the positions with a comma as well and then that's how we can get these two images to be exactly where we want them and we don't have to I think the original site had you know nested divs with background images so I think this this is a cleaner way to do it it keeps the the code is certainly more clean to look at without all those nested divs and all the div was really there for was just to have the background image it didn't serve any other purpose so I don't know that was kind of cool and new to me so maybe it'll be useful for you guys and I'm sorry I'm not keeping up that well with with the chat this is kind of difficult I usually don't have as many people chatting all at once so I'll do my best but I'd like to you know get to work and show you some of some what I'm doing so I'm going to go back to this page this interior base team dot HTML so all I did so far was I duplicated the index page and we need to make an interior header because the way that other header was set up it really depended on that that big kind of hero section and I don't want that here a section on every single page I don't know about you but I find it somewhat annoying if there's like the same big hero section on every page at some point I just want to get to the content without having to you know see that section so I don't want to have a big hero section on every page so we need to make an alternate version of the header for all the interior pages so that's what I've done so all I've done so far is just remove the hero section and now I'm just kind of working on the logo size and you can see it's we're right in the middle of this we need to make this logo I'd like to have it as small as possible and still be readable I'd love to have it as thin of a header as possible so that the content is is clearly visible we're going to keep this part of the header a kind of sticky as we scroll down just like on the home page and then that will give us a nice slim header but it'll still allow people to navigate anywhere in the site and without having to scroll all the way up we also have in place to scroll to top button once you scroll down so far so I mean that that will be useful as well it's nice to have both of those options so people can navigate really quickly okay so let's get to it I'm going to become a switching switching around a little bit here and I'm going to bring in dev tools such as chrome dev tools here for this site and right now I was just looking at this image and just kind of trying to mess with the size so I'm going to try to take this down let's try take it down to 70 pixels do have some smaller you know really thin font here so we might not be able to get away with it being that that small I Alexander just says he likes Adam better than sublime text I like Adam as well I've never used sublime text mainly just because sublime text cost money and Adam didn't and when I started to really get into frontend development I was on my own and freelancing and pretty broke at first so I always preferred the free stuff but I think both of them from what I've seen of other other developers using sublime text they're pretty similar but I can't speak to it from my own experience I've also use Visual Studio code whenever I have to work on like.net projects I usually use Visual Studio code mainly because I just it was faster than trying to get the right package for Adam to do the same type of syntax highlighting that Visual Studio code did right off the bat okay so we shrunk that down to 70 and now let's take this this navbar and we'll make it a little bit taller there we go and the brand logo I think we can get away with a smaller margin at the top and that'll save us some space so we'll take that down all the way we we've decreased that top margin by 50% there that'll buy us a lot of space and then that means we can come in here and we can make this just a bit smaller okay that's nice I name is probably about as good as we're going to get for now the last thing we need to do let's see need to figure out why this isn't going up you'll find as I do these videos a lot of it it's just trying to figure out what is going on on the page I am using a framework I'm using materialized as a framework I like that because it has the material design style is kind of built right in and that's why you see all these classes and everything a lot of that's already built in I definitely if you have a site where you need a lot of functionality that a framework can give you I recommend it it saves you it saves so much time I think it's kind of cool to make a site entirely from scratch and it can be really fast and awesome but the reality is sometimes you just have tight deadlines and you can't do it like that okay where is this coming from well let's just check this out see maybe I have it never the line oh I can't figure that out right now so let's come in here and make some of these changes here that I just made over here in dev tools all right I'm going to move their tools off to the side here for a second just so I can copy the same changes we just made over into our live our live code here and I'm using gulp to do the live reload so every time we edit this it'll automatically refresh this page okay so here's right now if we want to go down that's the original nav that's the home page but we want to go down here to interior so I've given the header tag let me bring up the HTML so you guys can see that too okay so we've given the header the class of interior so everything else for this interior thing is going to fall within this and we nest things we're using sass everything's kind of nested makes it easier to write things like this the CSS that comes out afterwards that's generated can look a little weird at times with lots of tags but the development process for me at least is a lot faster using sass okay so here's what we did we made that nav will we get 88 pixels as the height and excuse any sloppiness in the code usually I try to go and clean this stuff up after our live stream so don't spend a lot of my time just worrying about indentation and style okay we need that okay we got the margin bottom there and so I think all we need to change is the brand logo image and we drop that down to 70 pixels and then for the brand logo itself for that it's actually an a tag that contains the the image we drop that top margin down to 8 pixels from 16 okay okay I'm reading a little bit of your conversation here did I make a plan or plan my planning on the go I am planning a bit on the go so the overall plan is is set but the little details we have to take this on the go I just found out yesterday morning that I was going to be taking on this project and it needs to be done by Monday so I kind of have to plan a little bit on the go and in this case I am a little bit of a designer and a developer I don't I don't actually work with a web designer so most of them most what I do is kind of a combination of design and development that's why I do like to go with material design a lot because I don't really consider myself a designer so a lot of these design decisions I just rely on the material design framework for it saves me a lot of time and it lets me have consistency okay so great that all worked we save that and not we need to really need to figure out why this gap is here so I like to go in when I'm trying to figure that this kind of thing out to the computed tab and then that way I can see this and I just run through all my elements and try to figure out which there we go see when I did that I can see the height of the element here and then I can also see the highlight that blue highlight and I can see that's my problem there is that I have a height on my header which is the container for all the nav stuff I need to get rid of that height I need to drop that down I need to get rid of it completely let's see I think that's probably the best thing we'll just get rid of the height we don't need it on there we have the interior element here nav we have the height for the oops so let's do that let's go up we'll go here and we'll set height hmm let's try this if I can I'd like to just get rid of that height entirely and we might be able to so I'm going to go all the way up here to the original header and I'm just going to comment this up quickly and I want to look at local hoes oops okay I need three thousand one okay great so that's not really going to affect the homepage either so that was just some code left over that we didn't really need this was copied over most of this markup was copied over from a template that I created that had some of the basic Styles that the university likes to use and I created a template so that if I needed to do this like quickly I could just download the template it's available on my github profile I can download that template and get right right to work and not have to worry about a lot of you know the normal things that you do every time you do a site so there's there's definitely going to be some CSS JavaScript and HTML that are unnecessary and we'll clean that up when we get a chance before we launch okay I keep it on my time we get about nine minutes left let's see how much we can get done okay we're back here alright this headers is okay I think we're kind of boarding bordering here on unreadable 'ti with this logo here we may have to make it a little bit bigger but I think it's good enough right now to give us an idea of how it will be this section here could probably be thinner so that's another area where we could you know save on some height I think this is a yeah this this is thin enough we may add some things over here if we need to this is a great place maybe for calltoaction button so great so you see that's thinking I was working and for this page this is going to be a team page so for every page there's interior page is going to be a title I'd like to have a place where that title is going to be either right here or potentially if we have all this black area up here we we could have it here you know it might look nice to kind of tie it together if we took that same background image from the hero section and we popped it in right here on this side we have to shrink it down a little bit but I think that's worth to try to see how it looks and it shouldn't be too hard because we we already have a lot of the markup for that to be the background sums can go in here and I'm going to find that hero section and we had it we gave it an idea of hero right now my SAS is basically in the order it appears on the page that the elements here on the page when this all gets converted to react you know all this won't matter we're going to try to make the components a selfcontained as possible and break the CSS up so I'm not that worried about organization at this point so let's just grab all these background properties and I'm not going to worry about these media queries we're going to use different sizes I had to make vid sizes yet but eventually we're going to use different sizes depending on the screen width and we'll probably want to do that with this other nav as well I'm not going to do it right now since we're running a little bit short I'd like to at least get this in there so we can see what it looks like oops here we go with this interior and let's go on Ave and let's copy this all in it's gonna look weird at first I think but then oh slowly nothing at first alright let's see what's going on here let's check the nav out okay we have the image there let's see let's just start taking off some of these let's see if we can huh try to take off as much as I can just to see if we could look we can see it see why it's not working soon okay at least we can see it now so we know is there we definitely don't want that but I mean how cool would that have looked in the 90s and that would have been awesome I'm going to what I really wanted to do is just convey over here so we're definitely going to click that no repeat for the background here we can see it's on this side right now we don't want it on that side so let's go to this background position X and this make lets us move it from one side to the other so the background position X is at 183 percent right now so let's just let's just do something simple and say write great okay so that puts it on the right we'll go back to your percentage when we need to really position it you know more accurately but for now this puts it where we want it it's definitely too small so let's go back to this this height prep and nope that's not what I wanted um background size let's see what we're going to do with the size of it okay what we might need to do with the size let's go with let's just see if we can get it to look right here hmm exactly all right so I can't see that at all right now the specter background covered I had gotten the same issue with the hero section I think I did that off not on a live stream so this is kind of what happens especially when you're kind of designing and developing on the go together sometimes you just keep changing values to see what happens so oh I had it contain okay we've got three minutes let's see let's turn that fixed back on I think they don't want to fix I think I want that off for the hero section we put set a background attachment fixed property and that kind of gave us a little parallax effects you can see that that here but I don't think we want that with the header I don't think that's um I don't think that would be expected behavior for you know just that header section anyway so we're going to get rid of that let me just take that out of there right now and when we get it right we'll just copy and paste this whole thing over and let's see background sighs oh I see what we did I never took out the original background sighs property that we had for the hero section so let's remember to clean that up at some point okay but now we can change the size here and see see what's going on and then the background position why there we go okay how so I thought so now we can see we've got this this image here we just need to mess with the sizes a bit so I'm gonna bring this position back back up again oops accidentally just put that I'll just take one of them out because we have it already on that element okay so let's see I think I needs to be a little bit smaller let's see you okay all right I don't love that I think it maybe needs a little bit of work but that gives us an idea of what it might look like you know over here we'll have to check it on when it shrinks actually that that kind of even works on a smaller okay it finally starts to overlap here so we'll definitely have to do something about that when we get you notice a more narrow screen but for now that gives us a good idea kind of the direction we want to go with that header all right so we have about a minute left I okay somebody said Thanks yeah you're welcome um so I'm glad you guys watched it looks like this there's a ton of people watching so I'm super excited about that thanks for all the conversation I'm sorry I couldn't keep up with it I'm gonna go back after this and read through everything and maybe I can respond in the comments and if you have any questions just you know comment I'll try to get to them as much as I can Brian Sizemore is brought to you by G fuel he works with me and he knows that before my live streams I drink G fuel it's an energy drink so I don't sound like I'm I'm half asleep so anyway I don't want to go too far over 30 minutes so I think that's super long to try to watch a video thanks again for watching I'll be back tomorrow every day at 2 p.m. unless some emergency comes up I'm going to be streaming Monday through Friday 2 p.m. Eastern Time there'll be a recording available right after that it will automatically post to the channel so at at about 230 the recording will be there and I'll either be on this channel on free code camp or I'll be on my own channel if you just look up Jesse Weigel in YouTube it will be the first bunch of videos that come up probably I think there's one other Jesse I go on YouTube right now so I'll see you guys tomorrow I'll be back tomorrow and hopefully I'll have more of this site done because it needs to be done but I had a great time and let me know if there's any tips for me I'm still pretty new at this livestreaming thing so definitely any tips are are very welcome all right so I'll end the stream now thanks again have a great day I'll be back tomorrow
