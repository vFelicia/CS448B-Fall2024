hey everyone welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we're going to keep working on that search page that we've been working on for a while now but we're gonna move on to something new we're gonna work on the sorting which we just started to get into at the end of yesterday stream so now I'd like to spend a little bit of time and try to actually get it working I'm going to start out let's see I'll just check in analytics make sure we had some people in here before I start out and give my my usual opening statement I think the analytics is a little bit behind this I know we have more people waiting but for those of you who are new we in this sorry so if you're new in this stream you get to watch me do my daily work as a frontend developer for a small university I don't rehearse this beforehand so there will be mistakes and that's kind of the point is that you get to see a fulltime developer make mistakes and work through those mistakes my hope is that if you're new to web development or to programming in general you'll see that it's okay to make mistakes you know everybody makes mistakes at least I do a lot and you know you just work through and you keep going and we also have some very experienced developers that watch as well and they can provide some useful help in the live chat so if you can watch it live and ask questions in the chat you'll get some good answers you know most of the time we break everything up by Pomodoro sessions so Pomodoro session is 25 minutes so we'll do 25 minutes of code we'll take a fiveminute break and we'll chat in the live chat a bit and then 25 minutes of code and then at the end of the show that's when we do most of the question and answers so if you ask a question please be patient and we'll get to it at the end of the show the show is available to watch as a recording you know right after the stream so you know at any point in the future if you want to come back to it or you can't catch the whole thing now you know don't worry about it you can just watch later on whenever you have a chance okay cool so it looks like we have our normal number of viewers in here now so I'm gonna switch screens so y'all can see what I see we will be working in our search j/s file if you check the description for this video there will be a link to the github repo and the github repo is up to date let's double check and make sure we'll do a get pool right everything's up to date here I always like to start out my work by doing a git pull to make sure there aren't any changes that haven't you know made their way down locally yet it's a pain to start working and then realize that you don't have all the code I'm also going to bring the Pomodoro timer over here and we're going to start it and I'm gonna start the end rock server as well and then that way you all can see what I'm seeing on my screen and you can click around and test the site on your own so here's the end Rock link coming into the live chat right now and alright John Hanson and the chap mentioned that the chat is saved yeah second I saw at least yesterday's video had the chat saved so if you watch the replay you will be able to see what's going on the chat I think that's really nice I mean I've tried my best to try to read out things in the chat but I know I missed something sometimes so now you'll be able to keep up with everything that's going on the chat it for those of you who can't watch live I think that will really help you to be able to understand you know kind of the backandforth between you those of you in the in the live chat now okay rut Rajesh I see your question we'll get to that on the first break okay so if you could just hang on for a little bit at the end of this twenty five minutes I'll get to that question if anyone the live chat wants to address the question of how to start out learning to code and react you know please put the answers in there now for Ruud Rajesh or Rajesh I'm sorry I'm not sure how to pronounce that okay then Nicky says there was a pull request for the search page so let's check that out Melvin so the first part may just be taking care of this pull request okay let's see the notifications okay let's check that out so if you're not familiar with how to manage projects through github this will be kind of a good you know good little intro to merging pull requests so we get a pull request in and whatever usually you have a description if somebody submits pull requests in the description then not it's probably not likely to get merged so updated State in an immutable way in the only change handler for checkboxes only called creates search sites after set state is complete okay cool so Niki I'm not gonna read these right now on the chat I don't I don't know why I didn't see this PR you know now I remember when the notification came up for this and I was at a meeting this morning for a few hours so that's probably why I didn't remember it after the meeting ended so let's now that we read what it's about I always go in and check the files to see what changed exactly so on the left hand side this is what was there before the right hand side are the changes so here's our handle change function before and now before we were reading the variable for checkboxes sorry I'm not feeling well so if I'm coughing or sneezing I apologize in advance so let's see just a teeth on search alright so now I'm not as worried about explaining what we did cuz we did this on a stream so let's go okay so we're getting the previous state so when you go to do set state you you can have get the previous state here you don't usually need it but it does come in handy sometimes and now we're returning checkboxes previous state check boxes okay Nikki that's a great idea now I remember you saying that in the live chat and for whatever reason I didn't implement it then but just to explain what's going on here so we're returning check boxes so we're gonna set the state of check boxes and the new state of check boxes is going to be everything from the old State combined with one of the check boxes being checked so whatever one we just clicked on will be checked okay so you see these three dots in front of here so this is already all the check boxes here and we're just combining it so it's a way to combine in this case what do we have an object yeah it's a combined objects really easily in a concise way what is that the spread operator is that what that's called it's an es6 thing so I believe it's spread operator let me know in the live chat if that's the wrong name for it but if you look up ESX spread operator then you should be able to find a lot more info on on how to use this and when it's appropriate to use it all right and then after that we're gonna create the search types and if you're not sure what that's doing it's it's okay it's just calling off a function and then this function is actually going to run the search so if you check out the stream yesterday you can learn a lot more about what these functions are doing but for now just know that once the checkbox is checked the last thing that's going to happen is it's actually going to search okay so I am getting confirmation that it was the spread operator so that is the right word for it so it's it's really really useful so if you find yourself needing to do things with with objects with combining objects and things check it out alright wonderful you know that Niki this looks great I'm not I'm not even gonna test this out first I'm just going to merge it because it's really evident what this does and I think we're safe to just merge it you don't always want to just merge something if it's a small change like this and really you know kind of welldone and obvious to see what's happening I'm usually okay with just merging it but anything really bigger than this you'll want to test first and I do have some videos where I've tested things so if you go if you go back and search through my videos and find one on like merging pool requests that'll I think I go through the whole process of testing I'd like to make a video on on my own channel which there's a link in description for my own channel so I'd like to make a short to the point video on merging for people that don't want to sift through all the hours of live streams and they just wanted me to get to the point I'm gonna make a video for those for those people in for people who just don't have time to watch the stream so I think I'm gonna make that somewhat soon still watch out for that I'll tell you all when I when I do make it if you're interested so now since I I've decided I do want to merge this all I have to do is go here and go to merge pull request nice I'm going to confirm the merge now you can do you thinks through the command line but this is in my opinion the fastest way to do it if you know you want to merge it right away I always leave a comment I always want to show my appreciation for those of you that do submit pull requests and if you're maintaining a repository and github I also recommend that you show your appreciation and encouragement for those who who do submit pull requests I know for me like especially when I was starting out it could be very very intimidating to submit pull requests and you know kind of being ignored or having some harsh words can really did demoralize you so just be aware of that you know when you're a maintainer new people especially like really look up to you and if they care enough about your project to want to you know submit a pull request they may have put a lot of time into it even if it doesn't seem like it because if they're beginner it may taken a long time for them to do even something basic so you know a word of encouragement from you could really you know kind of give them that motivation to increase their skills but you know a mean word could kind of crush their spirit you know they may be the last straw for them so you know I'm not saying that you're entirely responsible for their their whole career but you know just be aware of that for me on both sides of it that's just you know kind of what I've seen ok we need to now pull those changes down oops let me make this bigger I'm sorry about that that was so small before all right so we're gonna do a get pool again and those changes that we just merged in on github are now local in our search that jazz file so let's scroll down just to see handle change what's going on it's not showing me it don't say let me just open it up again there we are sometimes it doesn't automatically change for me so I have to reopen the file but now you can see that here's all the changes and definitely want to verify that everything still works I mean based on what we saw in the code it should still work but it's good to get to try it out so let's go with good to know we have a theology major wonderful let's make sure that you know we have Department there's nobody with four faculty there we go okay it was working wonderful okay great so these are working now and alright here's the next step then let's now we have a check boxes you know working we definitely want to add more check boxes but for now we're just kind of getting everything working and then we can fill in you know however many check boxes or sorting things that we need later on we still don't have all the data over so I don't really know how many check boxes we need until I get all that data over so now I'd like to go back to where we left off at yesterday with our sorting I believe where did we put this sorting they we are so we have this function here it's a sort by type and let's just briefly review what we've done so for those of you that watched yesterday you know just bear with me as I repeat this because I'm sure there are people that that didn't see it so we're gonna call this sort by function whenever a user clicks on I guess it'll be will be a dropdown or radio I haven't I don't know exactly what kind of input we'll do either a radio or a dropdown so I guess so let's just think about that for the next few minutes as I'm going over this and let me know what you think would be better for this type of thing so first we're gonna do a check to see if the data that we've gotten is equal to 100 so what we're getting data from wordpress from the wordpress api they the max amount of posts that we can get from the wordpress api is 100 so we know if we've gotten 100 posts and we want to do a sort we need to actually do another search and do the sorting in WordPress and then get the sorted data you know because if our search would normally return 500 posts and we only have a hundred right now we haven't gotten the rest of them and then we sort those hundred then when it's not going to give the result that the user really expects or needs right if it's alphabetical you know and we're starting with a there's going to be a lot of other stuff that starts with a that is in that you know other 400 posts that we haven't even gotten yet so the sorting is going to be messed up and we need all right Nikki what's the end grog link all right I posted it once let's post it again sorry about that Nikki so that's why we have that check so that may or may not make sense I think I did a better job of explaining it yesterday because we were actually getting the data and things but basically we need that check to make sure that we we do end up returning the correct data to the user the other check we're going to make is if the data equals zero if the data equals zero then this probably means that a search has not occurred yet so it's very I don't even know if it's possible the search would not have occurred yet and the user is actually clicking these sorting things and there's actually something in the the search bar but I threw that in there just in case we may be able to remove this if as we build this out we realized that this is an impossible scenario we'll remove it but better safe than sorry on that it's just a little extra thing so in any case we just do another we do another search so first we set the state sort by to our type so this is the type of sorting that we're passing in and then we do this this search so we haven't added in like are sorting right so we need to do that today else so if the data if the number of posts we have in instate is greater than 1 greater than 0 but less than 100 then we come down here and we just do a sort on the data we already have and we don't make another API call which will definitely save resources it'll save time it'll save the users bandwidth ok so this is a data sorted okay and then we just changed the order of the data then state and since this is react we change state everything gets rearended so the user will immediately see all that data that they were seeing before but now it's going to be sorted the way they want it so let's let's build out this sorting function and I think we had did we find an example at the end of the stream I can't remember I don't think I pasted one the copy and paste one I mainly remember trying to find an example then I apologize again like my mind is just fuzzy I'm definitely starting to get sick so I'm gonna do my best in this stream but I know I'm gonna mess some things up what is this resources oh okay now I remember we searched in here I thought that I had some sorting happening in here but then after searching through this I realized that I didn't have sorting did we have sorting what project did we have it in all right let me check one other project if it's not in this other one then we'll come up with it on our own but we could potentially save us a lot of time if we can just use something we've used before bulletin I think the bulletin react project possibly has it let's see who not there okay all right so we're doing some searching here okay cool so we're doing a filter by dates but I don't think we're doing this clientside this project is still unfinished okay so let's let's just go over here then and I'm trying to think of so we're gonna have four different types of sorting you know what I remember where I've done this before I'm pretty sure that I've done this this exact type of sorting before I just can't remember if I did a clientside or serverside so let me find it okay let's see where they did in reducers give a set sorting alright shouldn't out sort by okay maybe I did the sorting in the component then so this is a project that's using react and redux so if you're not familiar with redux then some of this will probably look really weird all these projects that I've been searching through are completely opensource they're available on my github repo or my github profile so you can check them out if you want to know more about it this was one that I did for the Udacity react nanodegree this was project two so let's see the views let's see if I have this and you sold my bringing in the sorting sort great okay side nav sort by I know of another one yes yes all right cool all right so I found it yeah Wow I knew I had done this before with react so we're not using Redux in our current project so the way we implement this will be slightly different so instead of getting values from redux we're gonna get our values directly from state it should be fine the search page is just one page I'm okay with just using state instead of using Redux we may find down the line that we have a lot more going on and maybe we should use Redux we can always switch over that at that time or something like Redux you know something you know builtin with Apollo so we're doing we are doing some filtering here that we don't need to do and our project but here's the actual sort so we have a switch statement and this allows us to sort for multiple different types of sorting all which is one dot sort I think this is what we'll go with this is a lot cleaner than having lots of different functions to sort you know we just can have one so the switch statement takes in this prop sort by which in our case will be this state sort by well even use the same subconsciously I think I remember this because I even use the same name for it but in the case by score lowest we have dates so that date will actually be one so we can do date oldest so in this case we're returning aid timestamp minus B dot timestamp okay and that will that'll sort this by the oldest date so the oldest date is going to be the like less than right so dates being like just a big long number okay so that's the default here so we're gonna have to return a default we'll figure out what the default ought to be what the user will expect I'm thinking newest first might be what what's expected so we'll have to maybe we'll have to think about that and then replace what needs replaced and then we'll try out our sorting okay let's see okay so right reg s okay well we had a question before that Wow there were some of you were here a half hour early so Divya says already waiting last night you left at some place to explain please explain that again okay let me know Divya what I was explaining so I did go back and explain some of what we were doing yesterday but I may not have explained exactly what you needed so please let me know and I'll try to explain and then Rajesh says I'm new to react can you suggest me a way to start coding and react I'm sure you've probably gotten some other answers down lower in the livechat so sorry if I'm repeating but the react documentation is a nice place to start the if you want to pay for a course the Udacity react nano degree I took that course myself I learned a lot from it so I think that's a good one to do I think who is it west west boss I have never done any of his courses with w es BOS okay so look that up he does a lot of courses like I said I haven't done any so I can't say from personal experience but a lot of people really like his courses I'm gonna have to try stuff out one day you know just because I've heard so many good things about it those resources should be pretty decent to get you started I'm sure there's a lot of other good resources out there I just haven't seen them yet see a lot a lot of you were saying hi so hey Amit says write some code that was at the beginning when I was going over my intro so I haven't actually written that much code yet so we're gonna get to some code sometimes that's how it is though programming is a lot of thinking and looking things up and reviewing code you know what I actually typed that much some days we type a lot some days we don't let's see more of you saying hi I'm not gonna go through every one individually but I do see all of your names so hello everyone the the garv man I'm messing up his name bar Bhargav bah aaargh av really sorry I'm sure messing up your name let me know I should pronounce it says why don't you try at Google my bro I'm not exactly sure you mean like try to work at Google I did apply to a job at Google in Pittsburgh a while ago so that would be cool but I'm sure a lot of really really good developers apply it to any jobs at Google so that'd be a long shot for me okay so Ahmad also recommends West bus so the courses react for beginners so thank you for that Ahmad all right so divya says start with react tutorials from net ninja and learn Codecademy oh you know what i forgot about learning code academy that's a youtube channel I did learn a lot about react from that YouTube channel and about get and a lot of other things the channels not updated regularly anymore so some of what you see in those videos will be a little outdated but it's it's like fundamentally still pretty good so so yeah definitely check out that that channel 10 says reduce mic volume is my mic is it too loud I mean I'd hate to I mean for all I said if it's too loud then maybe just turn down the video cuz I don't want to turn it down and then mess it up for everybody else so let me know I mean if everybody's saying it's too loud then maybe I'll turn it down but I'd rather have it too loud for some and then give them the ability to turn it down on their own machines because if it's too low for people you can't you know they can't do anything about that okay so it didn't make it through everything in the live chat I will come back and finish up with all the questions in the live chat after after we finish up with this Pomodoro session so now let's grab this sort let's see we need this too Wow am I actually doing the map as well yeah I am well okay all right so where we get our swords let's put it here okay so this state data sword okay so we're sorting that we're saving it to the variable sort of data and instead of this props we want this state sort by and actually we do we need this states whereby no we don't we don't need to grab it here because we already we're pulling in the type so let's just get the type it'll save us a few characters so we can probably refactor this a good bit after we get finished with it but let's just get it working first so our cases here are gonna be different I don't want to go with these all caps I mean that's that was the way to do it with with Redux but I don't want it hopes what did I do I don't want to do it like that here so this is vote score so we don't want those four we want give an alphabetical order so actually let's just change our let's make sure we're actually getting a timestamp with this data or what it is yeah we are getting we're getting all of the data back right okay let me look here we are okay so here's the data that we're getting in the format all right so here's the date let's make sure that there aren't any other dates that would be more appropriate to use okay so here's the day should we change the date then probably we're probably going to need to manipulate this date first but at least we know we can we can get that date and then title is what we use for the alphabetical order stuff so title rendered okay this is gonna be a dots everywhere instead of timestamp we're just gonna say date for now well we're probably gonna have to change this but we'll just save it there for now we may need to yeah I'm not gonna get ahead of myself let's just keep going here so we don't have a vote score but we won't need to make this let's go with I don't rendered and then let's just put these in so I remember what it is so instead of us who are lowest this will be alpha that's ending and this is gonna be alpha descending is our default I don't want that to be our default that will change it but not right now date by oldest just call this dates newest date all the stateless okay and this is the type this should be outside the ifstatement okay because no matter what we need to change the sort that's we're tight okay actually all right I got some other ideas for how this can be refactored buzz I need to focus and not keep getting ahead of myself let's see it's for now I just want to return is this this is gonna save to data right this sort data and then it's gonna set State okay so we should be able to just check this as long as we check data to see if it's doing anything I want to check and see if any of these will work as is I don't have high hopes that they will oh let's say Nikki in the live chat has something for I so day two UNIX epoch due date for ashore I sewed a string oh cool awesome so let's let's do that now so within who I guess we just have to do it like this like so yeah thank sneaky so that we might get the day to work right now so let's test that so what we need to do is call this sore bye so let's see yes we're gonna let's manually call this and actually let's yeah let's go use this states sort by okay and then this way we'll be able to change values and state in in our dev tools so let's go was it a tortoise can you fetch the search term let's just put it after here for now what was that sort was this sort by was that what we called it yeah sort by okay let's try it alright so we say before in that part of that front let me just go up here alright only 53 awesome I'm not actually displaying the date you know it's reacts okay so here's okay so nothing happened with our search type so that's no good because it should have this sort by date oldest should have taken type and it should have used it to set the state so that's no good and data hmmm let's change some things up to oh you're right sort by I didn't change there that's good all right so let's go with date all right let's change this up a little bit so we can really test it the way I'm doing it now is is a little silly okay let's take this out from now okay it's not except tight for now and let's display let's go down here to our display for components and name title rendered item type okay so right here let's put dates so now we'll actually be able to see the date in our results area so we can see the date here not very pretty but it works so right now and then see if all right so it looks like this is giving us newest first let's let's change this so we did say date oldest is a new list you're gonna switch anything no because we're not actually firing that off again all right let's change that are we getting alright let's actually put in our to our toggle here I think it'll make it a lot easier to test I'm just I'm checking the live chat here for a second to make sure I'm not missing anything okay alright so let's put in wonder what I did for that project that we were just looking at oh I remember I didn't have a drop down or anything I just had a list and you could just click on it okay all right let's see oopss know what I want I want material UI next there we go now I only have 8 minutes not sure I'm gonna be able to get to set in 8 minutes all right I'm not I'm not gonna be able to do that in 8 minutes we're gonna have to hard code some of this so that we can make sure that it works so let's go let's hard code dates actually this let's do and ok and then here we will put the type and we'll go date not like that date which I date newest okay so swear by his date newest and so now let's try biology and let's see 3 1 1 1849 ok cool that does look like it's it's in it's showing the newest first now let's try oldest see if that makes a difference you know it didn't so we just changed this oops what happened yes sit stay oh you know what actually that shouldn't even matter because we're not we're not getting it from state anymore I was refresh yeah I'm definitely seeing no difference what am i doing well let's try this one food yeah my eyes are sorting not working go there so the second one and would be sorted let's see if there's any difference ID so we're 50 to 59 55 to 59 55 yeah it looks like there's no difference in this sordid one okay so why is there no difference let's look up a sort make sure we're using that correctly so get an MD n this is a great resource so let's see how they're using sort so it looks like mansoura automatically sorts what's it automatically sorting into okay so it's up in a corner automatically okay and then you have our default okay all right so let's see if it was less than V I someone could he return yeah this is this is how we're using it now look at these examples maybe the problem is here let's do this sorted data yes I'm gonna change this to date oldest oh yeah alright last time I'm gonna test it before I go back to the live chat just give it a refresh just to be sure no but it's 53 52 59 55 it's it's kind of weird all right let me check the live chat there are a few suggestions here okay michael says maybe try less than instead of nikki says the return value for that sort function has to be a number it has three options that it takes into account negative zero positive okay all right so let's yeah I'm gonna end it now partly because I'm just I'm really feeling super tired so I'm I'm probably gonna leave work soon but basically at this point to get this working I would probably just do some testing to see whether or not what I have in here is actually even the right stuff so I might do like even just tests in the console I guess to see if these sorts work like individually I suppose yeah that would probably be my next step maybe read a little bit more of the documentation we were just reading I don't like to read a lot of documentation on the stream this I mean obviously it's not very fun to watch see okay I am gonna commit this even though it's not exactly working so let's just say did my internet just cut out okay if the stream just cut out I'm really sorry for that my internet just completely stopped for a few seconds and now it's back that's so that's the second time today the internet just completely cut out so I'm not sure what's going on but sorry about that alright let me now we've done to get ad let's do yarn CM and a new feature not the best can be message in the world but it'll do for now you know what I have my Ethernet cable unplugged from my computer because for some reason I can't access the database the old database with it plugged in so I was doing data transfer and I never plugged it back in so that's probably why the Internet's not as good as it normally is so I'll try to remember to have it plugged in for tomorrow stream okay so let me go back to the live chat now and answer some questions this is all but everything that I've done is now on the master branch on github so if you want to check it out please feel free to check that out if you want to submit pull requests that would be awesome let's see or if you want to use the code in any of your projects you know feel free to do so so I'm gonna find out where I left off here it is and for the rest of the stream we're not really going to do much coding unless I get a question about the code what I'm just going to go through do some questions and answers and let's see Leigha sue Kim says react is jazz framework yes it is a JavaScript framework Leah sue Kim says so many files any tutorial for learning file systems so that wish free code camp had a tutorial for that for newbies to think there there is a basic Linux tutorial in a basic get tutorial on Udacity and they're both free and they're both very short so it's easy to kind of go through the tutorials in just a few hours so I would recommend those so they're on you the Udacity website Oh Nicky says check out the beta free code camp curriculum it might have a tutorial yeah I don't know for sure if it does or not I haven't checked it out and a really really long time but there may be something in there that's a good thought we did have a question about the theme in my theme and I'm using Visual Studio code the theme is SETI SETI and then for github it's the github dark theme to probably have to google that and it's a little bit of work to get it working but it's not it's not really that difficult just a few steps John says needle in a haystack you've got a good memory Jesse even when you're fuzzy thank you thank God it just came to me all of a sudden I so it kind of lucked out there Leah sue Kim says big companies div tags are like sandwich inside each other it's hard to define which one is which yeah for sure for sure when the when the actual markup is created by like a program it there are quite a few divs in there also asked by the way what is he creating now it's a react website and in this particular thing that we're creating is a search page for that website so we're getting data from the WordPress REST API and we're pulling it into this react site and you know doing some sorting and filtering so that users can get exactly what they're looking for now Leah sue Kim s if free code camp has backend course in PHP I don't think we have anything in PHP but again I really don't know what's there in the beta curriculum right now if I had to guess I'd say there's not PHP if you want something with PHP like a beginner course check out code Academy they do have some PHP courses I believe that some free courses in PHP so that that would be a good place to start for a beginner level if you're past the beginner level I don't I don't really know what's the best PHP resources let's see mahmud says semicolon stiff yeah I don't use semicolon but I'm okay if you want to use semicolons that's totally cool I don't hate on semicolon users Alexandre is saying anybody who's using MongoDB I wish to learn you know what we have [ __ ] going and some of our other projects and one of my side projects but I I didn't do a lot of handson work setting it up so I'm probably not the one to to teach anything about [ __ ] at this point I don't think Harsha is watching it's too late in his time zone but he knows about MongoDB so maybe in the future stream someone named Harshit might be in here Alexandre and he would he'd be able to tell you a lot more about [ __ ] because I'm having a lot of questions about editors and what tests editor are using if my test editor you mean like what I was testing with here this is just dev tools but it has the dark theme and then I was using the react dev tools which is a separate I think it's a plugin an extension that you can get so you know that doesn't automatically come with with Chrome and then you can just go into the settings and click on dark theme and it'll look like this dishes I wish I had a more powerful computer vs code and Chrome would work just fine then simultaneously oh yeah I guess I mean for my work computer it's it's pretty good so I never noticed that but yeah that probably could be an issue though on older computers I wonder I wonder is there another editor that takes less I don't I don't know I mean I would think Adam would be similar I don't really know about sublime whether Sublime's better or not Sublime's not electron based so maybe it would have better performance Jim trader says do you think it matters what platform someone learns to code on Windows versus Mac I was told that most employers provide Mac for their employees and that it would benefit me to learn on a Mac Jim trader I don't think yeah I don't think it would make a difference for me developing on Mac has been easier because most of the tutorials that I find assume that you have access to like the Linux commands so Mac or Linux would probably be preferable but when I was learning on Windows it was it was fun so I did I mean I've been a developer for five years maybe give or take a year and for the first few years I was always on Windows and then after that you know for like maybe six months I was sometimes windows sometimes Mac and then now for the last two years at least I've been predominantly like Mac all the time I don't do any development on Windows anymore yeah but I said the only difference that I've seen has just been the commands that I use so I I don't think as long as you know how to use a Mac it really doesn't take that long to get used to the differences so I wouldn't worry about that if anyone else has a different experience than that please let me know and let Jim Schrader note John says once you have the code inside your editor I don't believe that matters what your operating system is on your machine yes I mean that that's for sure I mean most of the which you do is going to be inside the editor and you can use the same editor on pretty much any machine you know if you're using like Adam or Visual Studio code so it should be fine no matter what you're using world's asked if I heard back from the Pittsburgh job interview yeah actually do you don't want an update on that I can give you an update on that now yeah why don't I just give you an update now so I had I don't know my Internet's cutting out again all right let me give it a second before I say anything all right it looks all right now so I had this interview a few weeks ago it went well and about a a week week and a half after the interview I got an offer from this company so the offer was pretty good it wasn't it wasn't quite as much as I was expecting so I did a little bit of you know talked with the company let him know more of like what what my salary expectations were and you know like what I was basically like what I was dealing with and why I expected a higher salary you know just in terms of you know my family my expenses and things so they they were I'm still waiting on some information so tomorrow I should get more info back on exactly what they can do in terms of compensation to give me more than their initial offer so I have not made my final decision yet as to whether I do want to work at this other place it's it's going to depend on what information I get tomorrow so basically I have my numbers in mind of what it would take for me to leave where I'm at right now so if those numbers get met I probably will leave otherwise I'll stay I've already talked it over with my family and so yeah at this point it's just you know does it make financial sense to move to go somewhere else or not so we'll find out you know hopefully tomorrow I will get the the info so they said it would be tomorrow so I'm that's what I'm gonna be able to make my final decision but after the whole process is over maybe I can make a little video and explaining more what happened I just I don't want to comment on it too much while it's happening I think I'll have a much better perspective on the whole process once it's all done with and I'll be able to give I don't like a much better explanation of the the whole thing let's see all right Julio says you can use builtin get instead of the terminal way I I guess you mean like they get stuff built into Visual Studio code I've never tried to use any of the stuff built into Visual Studio code to be honest with you I I just I mean when I learned get initially I just learned all the command line stuff and so I don't I really know how to use the other stuff I sing videos says what is the WordPress REST API exactly okay so the WordPress REST API is so you have your regular WordPress installation so any of the ones that are using the latest versions of WordPress they're really any version for I think at least the last year we'll have the REST API built in so what you can do is send a query to the REST API and they'll give you data back in JSON format right so it's just it works like any REST API so you can get all you get a bunch of data from from WordPress so by default you can't get everything but with the right plugins or you know custom PHP you can pretty much get all the data you want from WordPress so it allows you to use WordPress as a content management system without using the display part of WordPress so WordPress themes and and all that you can just get the data out and use it wherever you want on on other web sites that aren't wordpress based let me know if that explanation cleared things up for you I can go kind of in more depth or show some examples of the data if you need me to the candy gamer extreme asks in your opinion is it too late to start coding after you join your uni or is it still possible to make a good career oh yeah it's never too late to start coding no yeah I didn't start coding until after I was done with uni and my wife's learning to code right now and she's she didn't start learning to code until she's 32 so yeah never too late to start learning to code bark char so has just dropped in how often do you stream I try to stream Monday through Friday every day I don't always get there but that's that's the goal but for sure I usually stream you know a few times a week at at least Aniki says if you're really into editor performance I guess them would take the cake I didn't even think about them but yeah I suppose them would probably be the most performant one them was last time I tried them I was I was a little lost so I haven't tried it since then I'd like to try it again at some point I hear if you really do learn them it's it's good for productivity so I would I'd really need to take the time to get to learn it first so maybe someday I will okay I'm under the bottom alright I think up to the bottom there were a few comments and things that I kind of skipped over a bit mainly because there are conversations back and forth me too and other people in the chat but now that you all who are watching this recording can view the live chat as well I'll probably not read off everything like I did before that should help keep the streams just a little bit shorter maybe a little bit easier to follow along with oh we did get one more question corrington says hi Jesse what's the font you're using in your text editor I don't know let's find out where we had settings/preferences maybe settings yeah let's get rid of this alright the font family is Menlo so I'm assuming it's Menlo so there we are does anyone have a font that they really think is better for for coding I'm opening I mean I know that's gonna have a huge difference in readability and things so I'm definitely open to changing changing things up yeah no problem course and then let me know if I'm mispronouncing the name that name I want to get it right if I can all right so I see icing video says thank you for that answer about WordPress api's would you be able to use any API available at Google etc thanks for helpful oh yeah for sure you can use any API you want from from reacts or from a lot of other things for that matter but yeah we could pull in from wherever we need to get the data from and the process would be somewhat similar right you know all API is have their differences in how you're supposed to use them but you know it basically making the calls fetching the data getting back JSON format and then filtering and sorting that and displaying it on the page that that's going to be the same no matter where you're getting the data from okay so fire a code with ligatures all right is that is that a font is that a font that's like wellknown enough that I could just use it let's see where did it take my stuff copy the settings there we are so can I do so would it work like that is that the name can I get it to work or what I have to like bring it in somehow need to download it okay so maybe I need to download that what was the other one console us so John says try consoles I'm gonna leave that there in case I download it then it might it might work so let's leave that there is the first one and then we'll do ok cool for this one let's check it out huh oh I like that I might try this out for a little while then nonono that changes things okay so I can get I can get fire code on github okay cool I'll have to try that out maybe let's just check it out right now this this will probably the last thing we do on the stream but if I don't do it right now I'll probably forget cuz I don't feel a lot I'm probably gonna go home right after this maybe I can get it on vs code right away cool alright oh cool sure see cool alright so let's try it I need to let's go back here but I still I'm open huh yeah all right so let's change it up to fire code and I need I need to add these so those it's all together and then what was that ligatures they're gonna let me just change this editor font like it sure is true okay so yeah it doesn't look like it works what am I missing does work you can try restarting it or wrapping it let's make sure I wrap that properly yeah the kitchen I restarting maybe I can try that then yeah let's restart yeah I got an update coming anyway so I was well retry okay nikki says the ligatures make things like like the arrow function look like an actual arrow that's cool very cool okay nikki says check out the installation instructions so let's see now that i happily get yours on alright so not yet alright let me go back to the installation instructions then cool I will download this first I don't install on a Mac oh I can just do home bro let's do that yeah let's just run home bro all right cool now that's not supported all right fine I'll just do it this way just like the old phone calls rightclick and select open go select install font okay cool what just happened no this is not what I wanted to happen all right there's instructions all files right click open select install flaunt that is not what just happened when I followed this instructions I think like this is not how I normally install fonts alright let's open a new Finder window alright I got my stuff my windows open on another page so that's why I'm not seeing that much happening so all right so on a Mac download it right there's another way for sure to do this right isn't there a fonts folder all right insult etfs then it is going to work okay cool that's what I just did I'll tell you my angel tshirt all right cool so I took the TTF file so I'll put them in the font folder so let's see what happened wait is this it is this working huh yay cool all right so just just to show you all what I needed to do when I do my other screen so am i Mac I have like under my username I went into library which is a hidden folder and then the fonts' and then I just drove over so I downloaded there were several files that came up so one of them was the TTF file so I just grabbed everything that's in the TTF file and then I drug it over to here and then it just started working so you can see I've done this before with fonts which didn't remember I did it so all the Roboto stuff that I have in here materiai cons and things like that are in here already alright cool that that looks really cool Wow yeah a lot of stuff looks yeah you can definitely tell the difference awesome very cool all right all right well I think that's it for the stream so I hope that I don't get even more sick than I am right now and that I will come to work tomorrow and be able to strain if I can't strain tomorrow then you probably know where I'm at I'm home in bed but I will most likely be able to stream at my big normal time tomorrow I don't think I have a lot going on so I'll probably be around noon sometime thank you all so much for watching and for helping out for all your advice and for helping each other out in the live chat it was some great questions and answers today and yeah so see y'all tomorrow and until then have a wonderful day
