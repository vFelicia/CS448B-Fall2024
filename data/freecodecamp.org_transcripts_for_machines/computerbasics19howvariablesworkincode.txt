hi in this video we are going to talk about variables in code now variables just like in algebra is when you have a letter or a name or a word or something and that represents something else so here we're going to say ver x equals bana which is a string you can tell it has letters and is in quotations their x equals Briana so if we reference X later on it's going to know that means bana so if we console log X what that would print was just Bana but there is something to be careful about here if you put console log X in the quotation mark that's going to read that as another string and just print the letter X so this is a really simple example but what I want you to take away from this video is variables exist in code and you can store simple things like a string all the way up to more complicated things like a function just with a simple name all right here we have the console up again let's just show some examples of variables in code so we're gonna say ver x equals Briana and you'll notice some you know JavaScript syntax that you'll get to know more later we'll say ver y equals cheese and if we decide to go console.log and in here we say X Y I want you to think about what you think that's going to say uh what you think that's going to look like down here remember it's not going to be in here like when you do the bonfires it's going to be down here it just says Briana cheese very good because we had X and Y bana and cheese but we can add some more things in here if we want to console log a string do likes and then we separate it with commas let's see what that does it says Rihanna likes cheese very good now again remember you can have the streams you can have the booleans which are true false or you can have just numbers um really remember this lesson is all about the variables we can change up here here we can say um Chris if we change that do you think it's going to continue to console Briana nope it knows it references back up and knows that X now equals Chris so it says Chris likes cheese
