hello everyone in this video I will be showing you how to make a flappy bird type game in scratch for those of you who don't know what scratches scratch is a blockbased programming language where you can drag and drop blocks to create projects it's more of an educational type of visual programming language to teach children how to code there's also a online community where you can view other people's projects and share your own anyways to get started go to scratch.mit.edu which is the scratch website once you're there you can either create a new account by clicking the join scratch button over here or scroll down and download the offline editor which is the same thing if you're using the online version once you have created an account you can click the create button over here to start a new project so let's start by creating the bird so um I'm gonna go to the costumes of the scratch cat and I'm going to delete the second one and I'm going to clear this one and I'll draw my own bird so I'll start by creating a circle let's see about this size I think now I'm going to add a black outline to it right here to maybe a I think size five is good I'll decrease the circle a little bit though maybe to uh this big all right and since I'm making a bird I'll make it yellow on the inside so about this color all right so let's see now I'll draw the eye so um I'm drawing another Circle um I'll make it this big and I'll position this right over here okay I'll actually make this fill black and I'll keep the outline so yeah now I'm going to draw a beak so I'll draw two lines like this okay and I'll make the fill yellow actually the same color as the bird so this and then I gotta make sure the beak is under the bird so I'm going to shift it backwards like that and I think I'm going to add some legs so I'll just draw some quick lines like this and there so yeah this is a really quick uh drawing um I don't want to spend too much time drawing so that's why I quickly created a bird so yeah anyways now I am done and I'm going to go back to the code and now let's start coding the bird so I want the bird to be able to jump when I press the mouse button so to do that let's go to the events and then drag this windfly clicked onto here and now let's go to control and then grab a forever Loop and I'm going to drag and if then statement and then I'm going to go to sensing that's where the mouse down stuff is then I'll drag the mouse down into the if then so pretty much what happens is that when I press the green flag then this keeps checking if the mouse is down so now we want to actually do stuff when the mouse is down so um first of all we want the bird to be affected by gravity so pretty much when the bird falls it falls faster and faster over time so to do that we actually have to create a variable so let's go to variables and let's create one let's call this um uh y velocity and let's select for the Sprite only so pretty much this variable is only or actually a can only be used by the bird so now let's click ok and what our y velocity variable is going to do is that it's going to be the speed of the bird in the Y position which is up and down so pretty much if our y velocity is going to be 3 then the bird is going to move upwards constantly at uh three units and if our y velocity is let's say negative 10 then our bird is going to move downwards constantly by 10 units however we want the bird to move downwards uh faster and faster right we want the bird to fall faster and faster over time so we're going to actually be changing the Y velocity which means that we're going to be changing the speed in which the bird moves down over time so it's like gravity so let's first um set the Y velocity to zero when the flag is clicked and um okay let's make the birds start over here so that's like let's go to motion so negative 172 and 0 in the Y position um and then let's see so what we want is that we want the Y position of the bird to be always changing by the Y velocity variable or the speed so um actually to make this more clear I'm going to rename the Y velocity variable to uh change in y so I think that's easier to understand but anyways let's go back to the motion blocks and what I'm going to do is drag a change Y block drag it inside of the forever Loop and then I'll go to variables and drag the change in y variable inside of the change y by block so what this is is that the Y position of the bird is always going to change by the change in y so now we have to set the values for the change in y so um if we press the mouse button we want to set the change in y by let's say um nine so pretty much what happens is that when we click then the speed of the bird will be going upwards by nine and it would keep going up so let's try it out when we press then it keeps going up like that so yeah but now of course we want the bird to fall so what we can do is actually just drag a change change in y by block and put it in the forever Loop and let's change it by let's say negative zero point eight sorry negative 0.8 so since there is gravity we always want the bird to be going downwards so now let's try it out now as you can see it works um there's gravity because uh the bird keeps going down by negative 0.8 and then when we press the mouse button then the speed of the bird changes to nine so um yeah that's a really simple um jumping script we have right here and anyways that'll do it for right now uh for the bird so now let's create our pipes where the bird's gonna go through so let's click the button over here and let's create a new Sprite so um I'm just going to draw some simple pipes uh let's see I'm going to draw a rectangle like this and I'm going to make the pipes green and all right now I'm going to add another rectangle put it right here like this okay I'll make the pipes a bit thicker all right okay cool all right so this is going to be the top pipe and now we want the bottom pipe so let's create a new costume actually um let's duplicate this one and then I'm just gonna flip it so let's select the entire thing and then let's uh flip uh vertically and now we have the bottom pipe all right so we have the top and the bottom pipe so let's first name these I'll name this top pipe and this one bottom pipe and all right let's go back to the code so of course we want a winify clicked and um what we want is that we want this Sprite to be creating copies of the top and bottom pipe because we're going to have more than one pipe on the screen at any given time so just to make it easier to manage we don't want the actual Sprite to show so let's go to looks and then hide the Sprite when the flag is clicked and now um we we want the Sprite to keep creating clones so let's go to control and then drag a forever Loop and let's uh go to events um oh sorry not events of control and let's drag a create clone of myself and put it inside of the forever Loop so I'm just going to keep creating clones of the pipe and um we actually wanted to create two clones of the pipe because we have a top and the bottom pipe so if we try it right now then it's only going to create the Clones of the bottom pipe oh of course the pipes aren't shown but um anyways if we do show the pipes let's just drag it when they start as a clone and also a show then the pipes are there's like tons of clones of the pipes like that but we want the Sprite to simultaneously create the top and bottom pipes so uh let's actually first create a variable and let's name this um bottom or top pipe I guess and make sure to select for the swipe only this is very important otherwise it won't work so select for the Sprite only and then click ok and now uh what we want to do is to set bottom or top pipe and then drag it to the further Loop right before it creates a clone of itself and let's set it to top and then let's uh duplicate this and then put it under here and then we want to set bottom or top pipe to bottom and then it creates clone of itself again so I'll explain to you later what this does but pretty much the Clone is going to use this variable to know whether it is the top or the bottom pipe so anyways um let's add a weight in here so let's go to events actually a control and then let's drag a way to one second and I'll change this to maybe three seconds all right and now in the when I start as a clone we want to show it and now we want to add a if else statement so let's drag that and we want to check if it's the top pipe then it switches its costume to the top pipe costume and if it's the bottom pipe then it's going to switch costume to the bottom pipe costume so that's why we use this variable so um let's do that so let's go to operators grab an equals operator drag inside of here and let's go to variables grab the bottom or top pipe variable put inside here and if the bottom or top pipe variable is equal to bottom make sure it's uh spelled the same as how you spelled it here but if it's bottom then we want it to switch costume to bottom pipe and else if it is top then we switch costume to top pipe so it's as simple as that now let's try this out it's not going to work but let's just see how it is so far so as you can see this actually spawns the top and bottom pipe like that all right so now we want the top and bottom pipes to actually be positioned correctly we want the top pipe right here and bottom pipe right here so to do that uh for now let's just go to motion and grab a go to put it after the switch costume to bottom pipe and for the bottom pipe Let's uh let's see let's make it go like right here for now so we want to spawn at the edge of the screen right because the pipes are going to move from the right to the left so exposition 259 and Y position negative two one two all right and for the top pipe um let's see let's make it spawn let's say right here so 259 and Y position 54. all right so let's try that for now so as you can see the top and bottom pipes spawn like this and now we want the top and bottom pipes to move to the left side of the screen right so to do this is to um go to control and grab a repeat until block let's put that after the if else statement so what the repeat until block does is that it keeps doing something as long as the thing in here is true and then after the thing in here is false then it runs the code after so of course since we want the blocks to disappear after reaching the left side of the screen uh we want to grab a operator let's grab a lesser than operator put inside here and let's go to motion grab the X position uh block right here drag it inside of the repeat until operator and we want to check if the X position is less than a certain number then the Clones delete itself so let's see let's first show the initial Sprite and let's see right here so if the X position is less than negative 237 then the Clones should delete themselves so let's go to a control and let's grab a delete this clone and drag it after the repeat until so of course we want the pipes to be moving to the left until the X position is less than negative 237. so let's go to motion and let's grab a change X by block and put it inside of the repeat until and let's change it by let's say negative five so we want the pipes to move towards the left by five units until it reaches the edge here and then it hides so yeah let's try it out and as you can see the pipes work like that and we can like increase or decrease the spawn rate so maybe you can wait like one second and we can see there's the pipes like this and they also disappear um once they touch the left edge of the screen and they appear from the right so yeah the pipes seem to be working however we want spawning in the Y position so to do that we actually have to create a new variable so let's create a new variable let's call it random uh y spawn I guess random y spawn position and let's select uh for this file only and then click ok so um what we want to do is to set a random y position for the blocks to spawn from so to do that let's first drag this um into this forever Loop before it creates clones of the pipes and let's go to operators to grab the pick random and put it inside of the set random y spawn position and um let's see let's maybe okay let's deal with this later but let's see the range in which the pipes can spawn so I'm going to show the original Sprite and I'm going to do some testing so let's see um I think the top pipe should be right here around this would be the highest point it can spawn so that's why position 153 and the lowest position for the bottom pipe is going to be let's say right here so negative 284. so for now let's just put in uh one what was it again 153 I think yeah 153 to negative 284 I think let's just double check yeah something like that all right so this is going to be the range in which the pipes can spawn but oh yeah one important thing I think to make this easier let's go do the costumes and make sure that the pipes are actually positioned where we want them so let's say uh let's copy this bottom pipe and put it into the top pipe for now and let's say we want our space to be this big right then we want to make sure that the top pipe and bottom pipe are positioned like this in each of their costumes so I'm going to move this to the middle right here okay I think this is the middle all right so right here so now I'm going to delete the bottom pipe or actually not yet I'm going to first duplicate this and then I'm going to delete the bottom pipe and now I'm gonna go to my duplicate and then I'm going to delete the top pipe and now we don't need this extra bottom pipe costume so yeah anyways now we have the top pipe and bottom pipe uh where we want them and I'm going to first rename this to bottom pipe all right cool so of course you can change the space in which is between the top and bottom pipe so that's up to you but yeah let's go back to the code now and let's see let's find our range in y positions again now so um let's see for the top pipe I'd say y position 79 and for the bottom pipe I'd say y position negative 79. all right that works well so now because I repositioned these two pipes to where I want them it's now super easy so all you have to do is to go to variables and then drag the random y spawn position into the go to x y and in the Y so let's drag that into here for both the top and the bottom pipe and now let's try it out so as you can see it works however the pipes are um entirely on the screen like there's some empty space but of course we can go to the costumes and change that but at least the random y position works so as you can see they're spawned randomly so to change or actually to fix the problem let's go to costumes and all we need to do is to increase this length of the rectangle so let's drag this entire rectangle down here and I'm going to drag this rectangle upwards like this all right now I'm going to select the entire thing and then drag it back up I think it was right around here uh okay maybe a bit more downwards yeah about right all right and now let's do the same for the bottom pipe move it up here drag the rectangle down here and then drag the entire thing back down so right around here I think so yeah all right looks good um okay I think this one's positioned a bit to the left so I'll move it back maybe this one a bit to the left all right cool so now let's run it and as you can see the pipes now spawn like this they're in a random y position and the entire pipe uh covers like both the top and the bottom edges of the screen so awesome um I think I'm going to increase the Gap a bit because I don't think the bird can go through like very easily or uh if it's possible at all so let's increase the Gap and to do that it's really simple you just move the top and the bottom pipe upwards and downwards so the top pipe upwards like this and the bottom pipe downwards like this all right and make sure your Gap is equal on both the top and the bottom compared to the middle like over here versus over here so yeah it looks about right now let's try it and now the Gap is much larger so awesome um I'll make the bird a bit smaller I think so I'll go back to the bird I'm gonna go to looks and change the size or set the size to maybe 80. okay I think that's better so yeah now I think for the bird it looks a bit like too still when it jumps so I think I'm going to rotate it when it jumps so it looks like it's actually flapping so to do that let's um just go to motion and drag a point in Direction and drag it under the if Mouse down and I'm going to change it to um let's say 45 degrees and what this does is that it's going to change it to like this when it drops but of course we want the bird to rotate back to its original position which was 90 degrees so let's just grab an if statement and then put it inside of the forever Loop and let's go to operators grab a lesser than operator and we want to check if the direction which is in the motions is less than 90 which was its starting Direction then we want it to turn uh clockwise let's say three degrees so pretty much if the bird is like this then it's Gonna Keep rotating until it faces the right so let's try it out now as you can see there is some motion with the bird so when it flaps it sort of moves back like that so I think it looks better like this and I might change it to maybe turn four degrees so let's try it all right I think that looks much better so yeah um now let's make a simple lose state so when the bird touches the pipes then let's just stop the game for right now so uh let's see let's drag a if statement inside of the forever Loop and let's go to sensing and it's detect if touching Sprite 2 or the pipes then it's going to stop all so let's go to control and let's stop everything so let's try it out and yeah when it touched a pipe then the entire game stopped all right so okay I'm going to first hide all of my variables all right so now let's try it again okay and when it touched the pipe then the entire game stopped all right cool okay and it's like this okay um I think I'm going to add a simple background so I'll go to backdrops here go to costumes or backdrops and then I'm going to fill it or actually I'll convert to bitmap and then I'll fill this maybe to a light blue let's see like this and all right now we have some simple backdrop so um yeah this is our completed game we're actually not completed but a completed working game so all right cool let's see yeah this is a bit hard right now but you know you can tweak it to change the difficulty to make it easier maybe so yeah this is part two on how to make a Flappy Bird game in scratch in this tutorial I will be creating an infinite scrolling background and a scoring system so the first thing I wanted to add that I didn't do in the last video was to make the bird uh be able to lose when it reaches the bottom of the screen over here so to do that it's actually really simple let's go to operators and then grab an or statement and let's put it over here so if the bird is touching Sprite two which are the pipes or if the bird's y position is less than a certain value um let's see if it's less than negative 171 then we want to stop the game so let's try it out if the bird goes to the bottom here then the Game Stops all right so now that we're done with that I'm going to start creating the scrolling background so I was thinking of maybe adding some hills in the background and then making them moving slowly to the left to make it look like the bird is you know moving so let's do that so let's first create a new Sprite and now I'm going to draw my Hills all right so I'm done with my hill and what I did was that I just made a rectangle across the entire drawing area and then I used this vshape tool to you know add a few points and then I just moved these points around to make it curvy all right so make sure that the width of your Hill is exactly the same width as the drawing area no more no less as you can see I made this very exact so yeah and also make sure that the height of the left Edge over here is the exact same height as the height of the right Edge over here anyways uh this will do for now and let me go back to the code uh so first off I'm going to grab a one fly clicked in the events and then I'm going to make the hills go to zero zero so now it's in the center of the screen and what I want is that I want this hill to constantly move towards the left so to do that let's go to control grab a forever Loop and then let's go to motion grab the change X by block put it inside of the further Loop and let's say let's change X by negative three all right so if we try right now then the hill as you can see always moves towards the left by three units all right so um since I'm going to be testing this hill a lot I'm going to disconnect the code from the chicken and and the pipes so you know it's only the hill and I'm also going to hide the chicken all right so now this is just a hill so yeah all right cool so now that the hill moves now we want the hill to go from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen once it reaches the end over here so to do that let's grab an if statement and let's put this inside of the forever Loop and we want to check if the X position of the hills are less than a certain value so let's go to operators grab a less than operator go to motion grab an X position and let's check if the X position is less than um negative 464. so what I did was that I found the smallest possible value for this right which is a negative 465 and then I just added one so yeah so once the X position of the hills is less than negative 464 then we want it to move to the right side of the screen so since I made this hill the exact width of the screen which is 480 pixels or units then what I can do is just simply uh set X to its current X position over here multiplied by negative one so let's go to operators grab the negative one operator drag it inside of the set X2 and then go to motion grab the X position and type in negative one all right so let's try it out once the hill reaches the left side of the screen then it teleports to the right side all right so it works it's infinite like this let's see it again and all right it works so uh oh yeah one thing I noticed was that it's not very smooth as you can see here you can see that it sort of gets cut off early before it teleports to the right side so I don't really want that to happen let's say it again as you can see it doesn't completely go off the screen so that's sort of something that scratch has and to actually fix the issue I'm just going to go to looks and grab a set size to block and right before it changes X by negative three and checks if the X position is less than negative 464. I'm going to set size to 150 percent and right after the hill moves and checks for all the stuff then I'm going to set the size back to 100 percent so like this before all of your code put in set size to 1 to 50 and then right after put set size to 100 percent so this is sort of complicated to explain but pretty much what this does is that um the set size makes the hills bigger then it's actually supposed to be which is 100 percent so right before it moves it can technically go off screen but then right after it moves it changes back to its original size so you wouldn't even notice that it's 150 of its normal size so let's try it out and let's see now oh oops okay I forgot to change this to if the X position is less than negative 480 or actually a negative 479 so since the left edge of the screen is negative 240 and the entire size of this costume is 480 then half of the costume size is going to be 240 and then once you subtract 240 from negative 240 then that is the rightmost edge of the Sprite at the leftmost edge so yeah um that was again sort of confusing uh sorry but it should make sense visually so now let's try it out again and as you can see now the hill smoothly goes from the left side to the right side so let's see it again and all right so it works cool and I'm actually going to quickly add a uh dark green outline because I think the light green uh is sort of too close to the light blue color of the sky so yeah I'm just going to quickly add a line over here all right so I'm done with my outline I just pretty much added a line and then I just reshaped it using this tool to fit the hill all right so now I think it looks better let's try it again and as you can see there's the hill and then teleports back so now we need to add the second Hill because once the hill is moving then there's a lot of empty space and we don't want that so to add a second Hill all we need to do is to go to control and then create clone of myself all right and um we want to make the Clone do the exact same thing as the original Sprite however the only difference will be that the Clone is shifted to the right of the Sprite so let's grab a1sr as a clone then let's go to motion and then let's drag this go to x480 and then y0 and make sure to go to looks grab the set size to 150 put it before the go to XY and then grab the set size 100 and then put it after since uh we want the Clone to go completely off screen so yeah anyway since the Clone is going to have exactly the same code as the original Sprite we're going to create a block so let's go to my blocks and then make a block let's call this uh move then let's click ok all right now we have move and now we want to drag this um set size to 150 and stuff like that into the move and now we can drag our move block inside of the forever Loop and okay so my move block did not appear um that sometimes happens so I'm just going to refresh the page there we go so now there is the move block and let's put this inside of the fur Loop and for the Clone let's just duplicate this forever Loop and then put it under the stuff over here all right so now the original Sprite and the Clone both follow the same uh code in the move block so it's sort of simpler because if I want to change something all I need to do is change this one move block instead of you know changing to separate uh blocks like this so all right now let's see how it looks so as you can see there is now a infinite scrolling Hill background and it looks very smooth and uh yeah all right so I think there's a tiny um difference in the line I just drew so I'm just going to fix it real quick let's see it's over here okay let's try it again uh yeah you can barely tell that I have two Hills so yeah all right so now that we're done with the hill background we can add the chicken and the pipes back so let's um show the chicken then reconnect the blocks then go to the pipes reconnect the blocks also and now we can try it out and okay the hills are in front of both the chicken and the pipes so we want them to go back so let's go to looks and grab a um go backwards let's say 10 layers to make sure that it actually goes back and now let's drag this um in the when flag clicked before it creates a clone of itself and now it works like this all right cool now we have sort of some Parallax going on which is pretty much um the hill moves to the left slower than the pipes do so uh yeah um now we have our infinite background and now we're going to make a simple scoring system so let's go to the pipes and let's see we want to First create a score variable so let's go to variables then create a variable let's call this score then for all Sprites and then click ok all right so what we want to do is that if the bird goes past the middle of the pipes then we want the score to increase by one so um to do that we have to go into pipes and then we want to check if the X position of the bird is greater than the X position of the pipes so let's go to operators and grab a greater than operator and let's go to sensing grab the backdrop number of stage block and change the stage to Sprite one which is the bird and now we have our X position of Sprite 1. so if the X position of the bird is greater than the pipe X position so motion and then X position then we want to go to variables and then change score by one all right now we want to put this inside of the repeat until and now as the pipes are moving to the left it's going to constantly check so now there's uh one problem though whenever the bird is past the pipes the score goes up by a lot because it keeps checking and the score keeps going up but we only want the score to go up once so um to fix that we can just simply create a variable let's name this already scored so already scored and we want to select for the Sprite only this is very important for the Spy only then let's click ok and let's see where is my variable hmm all right so there it is already scored so um what we're going to do is to first set already scored to no because uh when the pipes spawn then the bird hasn't gone through them yet so of course the bird has not scored so let's set this to no put it um before everything in the uh if and repeat until loops and now we want to check if the bird has not yet already scored then we want to change score by one so let's go to operators grab an and and let's grab an equal and let's go to variables grab already scored and let's check if already scored is equals to no now let's drag this over here into the left side and let's put it back so of course it also checks if the bird has already scored and if it's no then it changes score by one but of course once it changes the score by one then it has scored so we don't want this to call again so we just set already scored to yes so now it's only going to call once so let's try it out all right and it doesn't quite work um the score goes up by two so let's see I think to fix this I'm going to make this um set before the score changes by one now let's try it again okay still does not work um let's see um oh yeah that is because we have both the top and the bottom pipe so it acts as two clones and they both check so what we want to do is either only make the top or the bottom pipe check so let's only make the top pipe check so to do that let's grab another operator grab an and grab an equals and let's see check if the bottom or top pipe is equal to top now let's drag this into the left side and I'll check the entire thing back in let me zoom out a bit all right and now it should work so first it checks if the X position of the bird is greater than the current pipe exposition which means that the bird went past it also checks if the bird already scored and also checks if the bottom or top pipe is equal to top then if all of these are true then it sets already scored to yes and then it changes score by one now let's try it out um first of all I'm going to set the score to zero whenever the five is clicked and now we should be good so as you can see the score changes by one every time so yeah all right it works cool let me try it again and yeah um now I have both my scrolling background and the score counter the game also ends when the bird touches the bottom of the screen like this this is part three on how to make a Flappy Bird game in scratch in this video I will be making the pipes go on screen and off screen more smoothly add a number counter for the score and add a simple blue screen anyways let's get started with the pipes so if you see the pipes right now they sort of suddenly appear at the edge of the screen and they don't really smoothly appear and they also disappear before they can completely go off screen like that so I'm going to fix that so let's first go to the pipes and then let's do the same thing we did for the background so in the last video I made the background be able to go on screen and off screen smoothly by first setting its size to a larger size than the actual size we want and then we uh position the background to where we want it and then we set the size back to its original size so let's do the same thing for the pipes so let's go to the pipes and then um right before it spawns Let's uh go to looks and then grab a set size two and let's change this to like 150 percent and then drag it right before go to x y and then let's drag a set size to 100 right after the go to XY and now let's change the uh X to like maybe 270 to completely make sure that the pipe is starting off screen and um for the top pipe let's do the same thing so set size to 150 put it before and then set size to 100 put it after so let's try it out and they still don't entirely start off screen so um okay I think it should work after we also set size to 150 percent and 100 um before and after it changes X by negative five so let's try it out so let's drag this before we change X by negative five and then drag this after the change X by negative five so now let's try it again and yeah I think that works um the pipes as you can see um Spawn from the right side of the screen uh smoothly they don't you know sort of randomly appear from The Edge so yeah and now let's uh fix the um pipes leaving the screen so right now it's still a bit choppy when they leave the screen like that let's see it again yep so still a bit choppy so to fix that all we need to do is to change this x position to a smaller number so maybe let's say if x position is less than 200 and I mean negative 260. now let's try it out oops okay let's try it again let me first reattach this and all right so let's see and cool they also leave the screen smoothly so yeah I think we uh fixed the pipes and all right now that we have the pipes fixed um now I'm going to make a number counter for the score so instead of using this variable I'm going to use actual numbers and that just makes the game look a bit better so yeah let's first create a new Sprite and just paint 10 costumes with the numbers zero through nine so yeah and yeah so now I have the numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine and then zero so the uh costume names don't matter but the order matters so make sure it's one through nine and then zero at the end so all right now let's go back to the code and let's first grab a win flag clicked then let's hide the original Sprite because we're going to be using clones for this and then let's create a variable uh let's name this I guess uh digits and then select for the Sprite only remember this is very important for the Sprite only because each clone is going to have a different value for the variable so if we do for all Sprites then it's not going to work because whenever the variable changes in value then all of the Clones are going to have the same value for that variable so we want the Clones to have separate values for the digits variable so select for this file only and then click ok all right by the way if your variable doesn't show up immediately after you created it then you can just refresh the page and it should show up but anyways um let's grab a set digits to block and let's set the digits to one and let's drag this after the hide now uh let's go to control grab a repeat Loop and then let's grab a create clone of myself and then go to variables and let's grab a change digits by one and this just creates 10 clones each with a different value of the digits so anyways now we want the Clones to do stuff right so let's go to events actually a control sorry and then let's drag a 1sr as a clone then we want the Clone to show um or actually uh not show yet but yeah so let's go to control grab a forever Loop put it under the when it starts to clone and then we want the Clones to go to a specific position based on its digits variable so let's go to motion and then drag a go to Y position sorry a go to XY position and then let's go to variables grab the digits variable and then go to operators grab the multiplication operator let's drag the digits variable inside of the left side of the operator and let's say uh let's multiply this by 10. now let's drag this inside of the X position of the go to XY and let's place this inside of the forever Loop so if I just run this what this does is that oops okay I need to show the clones for now so yep all right so if I run this then what this does is that it creates 10 clones and they are all spaced apart by 10 pixels and this is because each clone has a different digits value because when I first set digits to one and then created a clone the Clone I created the first time had the digits value set to one but then since I changed digits by one the next clone I created has the value of digits to two now and if I change it again and then create another clone then the third clone I created has the value of digits to three so that's how it works each clone I create has a different value of digits but yeah um anyways now we want the Clones to show or hide based on the score so let's say right now the score is two then we only want the uh ones place clone to show or uh this one and then we want all the other ones to hide so to do that let's grab an if else statement in the control drag that in the further Loop and then we want to check um if the length of the score is less than its own variable of digits so let's grab a lesser than operator and then let's grab a length of and let's go to variables and then drag the score variable inside of the length of drag this into the left side and check if a length of score is less than digits so if it is that means we don't need that number and then we just hide it otherwise we want it to show so now as you can see um since the score was two now only one of the digits to show so let's say the score was maybe uh like 270 now all three of them show so yeah now we want these clones to show the correct number so um to do that let's go to looks and if you want them to switch costume based on their uh digit in the score so to do that let's go to operators grab the letter operator or actually letter one of Apple and then let's replace the one with digits and then Apple with score now let's drag this inside of the switch costume tube then let's drag this under the show So based on their own digits uh one two and three they're going to show the letter of the score so one two and three so yeah as you can see this shows the correct score now let's reposition this to the top so um just change this y value to maybe uh 150 Maybe 155 and I think that's fine and now we can hide the score variable now um I think I'm going to want my score to be in the middle but however there is a problem so since the score is in the middle when the length of the score increases I still want my score to stay in the middle so right now it's not going to work let's say I set the score to um a really high number let's say like this and this score has a one two three four seven digits so let's set it and as you can see this number is not in the middle because it's still in the same X position so um I want to fix that so that this number is in the middle no matter how many digits the score is so to do that uh let's grab a length of score so length of and then score and we want this to move back based on the length of the score right so um now let's go to operators grab a multiplication operator drag this on the left side and make sure to multiply this by the same number you multiplied the digits by so in my case it would be 10 and now we want to subtract this from the original X position so let's grab a minus operator drag this on the left side drag this on the right side and oh yeah one more thing since we want the score to stay in the middle we want to divide this by two so let's put this on the left side and then divide by two all right now let's drag this inside of the minus operator and drag this back so as you can see the number is now in the middle let's try it out so let's say the score is zero then into the middle now let's try uh a hundred still in the middle let's try a thousand and it's still in the middle all right um and just to make this more clear like uh these numbers here I'm just going to create a variable and I'll just name this space between digits I guess then I'll click ok and um I'll just set this to 10 and then drag this to replace the tens all right now it's more clear and it's also easier to change because I can just change this variable to increase or decrease the space so I think I'm going to increase it to maybe 12. and all right I think that looks good so yeah now let's try it out and let's see how the score variable works all right it looks pretty good so I'm going to try to get to 10 oops okay let me try again so we have zero right now one two three four dang it okay let me try again okay um I don't think I'm gonna get to 10 but uh let's just assume that the score variable Works based on my testing so yeah now that we fix the pipes and added a number counter um now I'm going to add a loose screen so right now when the bird touches the pipes then the Game Stops and that's sort of boring I want the player to be able to maybe have an option to restart the game so to do that um let's create a new Sprite and I'm just going to create a simple loose screen all right so now I have my loose screen and this is going to show up when the game ends so let's go to the code and I actually want this to be transparent so um let's just grab a winfide clicked then let's go to looks um grab this set color effect to zero and change this to Ghost and let's change this to maybe a 50. okay maybe less so 20. and all right maybe a 15 actually and now this blue screen is sort of transparent so now I'm going to create another Sprite and this is going to be for the retry button all right so now I am done with the retry button and I also changed the loose screen by adding a crying bird so yeah anyways um let's start with the loose screen or actually oh yeah for the retry button I want it to be transparent too so let's also grab a set ghost effect to 15. let me change that to maybe a 25 or 30 all right so let's go to the loose screen so um we want to First hide this when the flag is clicked however we want this to show when the bird loses so let's go to the bird and right here in the if touching Sprite 2 or Y position is less than negative 171 we want to broadcast a message to tell the loop screen that the bird lost so let's go to control or actually uh events and then broadcast a new message let's just call this um lose and let's put this in the if touching Spike 2 or Y position is less than negative 171 and instead of stop all let's just stop this script so the bird would just um stop all of this and stop moving so yeah all right now in our loose screen we want to grab a when I receive lose then we want the loose screen to show so we just grab a show and this should be good let's also do the same thing for the retry button so when I receive lose then show otherwise when the flag is clicked then hide so yeah let's try it out right now so when the bird crashes into the pipe then there's a you lose and we see that the birds stop moving however the pipes are still moving so to fix that let's just go to the pipes and then grab a when I receive lose then let's uh stop all and change this to stop other scripts in Sprite so by doing that it just stops this block over here and this block over here so now let's try it again when the bird falls let's say then everything stops oh yeah except for the background so let's go to the background and drag a uh when I receive lose then stop other scripts in the Sprite all right let's try it out and now as you can see everything stops now we want this replay button to actually work because right now this doesn't do anything so let's go to the retry button and then let's see um inside of the when I receive lose we want to drag in a further Loop and let's drag in if else statement and then let's go to sensing let's detect if Mouse is down then let's say let's make the retry button a bit darker so let's go to looks and then grab the set color effect to zero drag this inside of the if Mouse down let's change this to brightness and let's set this to maybe negative 10. so this makes it darker let's try it out oh yeah sorry I meant if touching Mouse pointer not if Mouse down so let's actually change that let's go to sensing grab a touchy Mouse pointer and let's replace the mouse down and now let's try it out so as you can see it's now darker however if the mouse pointer is not touching the button anymore we want it to go back to its original brightness so let's go to looks grab the set brightness effect to and let's change it back to zero all right let's try it out and as you can see there's a bit of a button touching effect all right so now we want it to detect if the mouse pointer is down and then we want to restart the entire game so let's go to control grab an if statement put this inside of the if touching Mouse pointer and now we drag the mouse down inside of the if statement and if the mouse is down then we want to let's say broadcast a new message so let's go to events and broadcast a new message let's just say uh play now let's drag this inside of the if Mouse down let's also stop this entire script after it broadcasts play so that it doesn't keep on broadcasting play so let's just drag a stop all and change this to South despite or stop the script so right now it's not going to do anything and that's because we need the Sprites to restart all of their actions when the play is broadcasted so let's first go to the chicken and instead of the win flag clicked let's replace that with the when I receive play like this all right let's do the same for the pipes so instead of the win flag clicked we want the when I receive play then it does all of that and for the background let's replace the win flag clicks and for the number counter replace the win flag clicked and then for the you lose replace the one fly clicked and also for the retry button all right so now that we've replaced all of the windfly clicked with plays that means that now all of this is replayable so as long as we call the play message then all of this is going to restart however uh when we click the flag we still want to broadcast play right because we want to start the game when we click the flag so yeah I'm just going to put this inside of the chicken and now it should work so it starts the game everything works as normal until we lose and then we start and everything restarts however as you can see there are some problems so let's go to the pipes and I think the problem is because the Clones don't get deleted when um the lose message is broadcasted so let's grab a delete this clone after I receive loose so all of the clones from the previous game should get deleted now let's try it again so when the bird crashes the pipe and then restarts then it works all right cool and one thing for the number counter it's actually better to probably add a when flag clicked then um do all this stuff because we only need to do this once when the green flag is clicked so yeah now this should be good so oh yeah since there's also a clone for the background to make sure there aren't any extra clones on the screen when I restart then we want to delete the Clone so yeah uh now I think this should be good oh yeah okay I forgot to stop other scripts in the Sprite for the number counter so let's just do that just in case so when I receive lose then stop other scripts in this Sprite all right and we don't want to delete these clones because we're only creating them once when the flag is clicked so yeah now let's try it again so everything works as normal then when we lose then there's the loose screen and then if we retry then everything works as normal oops okay except for the number counter so let's see okay actually let me just still add a delete this clone after lose and then let's replace the winfly clicked with um when I receive play all right now I think this should work let's try it out so everything works as normal then we try and it works all right cool so now we have a replayable game and okay what happened here that's weird oh yeah that was because my mouse pointer was on the retry button so uh yeah but yeah this works all right let's see and you lose and then we try and then it restarts all right cool this is part four on how to make a Flappy Bird game in scratch in this tutorial I will be making some improvements to the loose screen adding a countdown text and adding a menu screen so first off our clones of the pipe and the hills don't show up when the game is over and that's because we delete the Clones when the game is over since we don't want the Clones to reappear when the game restarts however we still want them to show when the you lose screen pops up but we can't really put the delete this clone after the when I receive play because it wouldn't really work so let's just say um for the pipes for example I move the delete this clone from the when I receive lose to when I receive play then if you try it then we lose and then we start then there's these clones of these pipes and it still doesn't work so to fix this we need to broadcast a message after the when I receive lose but before the when I receive play and this way we can safely delete our clones in between the losing and the play so I'm going to first put this back and all right this also ties in perfectly with making the countdown text because the countdown is going to happen after the you lose but before the game starts so what I was thinking for the countdown is that when the game starts it's going to show up like a three two one start and then the game is going to actually start like this so when the countdown is happening the game's gonna actually be paused but yeah so let's make the countdown text uh let's first create a new Sprite and I'm just going to type in the number three all right I'll make this a bit larger like this and then I'll duplicate this I'll type in two duplicate this again type in one and then duplicate this again then I'll type uh go then I'll make sure to Center this in the middle all right so on the screen over here it's going to be three two one go so this is going to be our countdown text all right so currently when the green flag is clicked we broadcast play however we don't want to do that because we want to broadcast our countdown text to start instead so let's create a new message and I'll just call this um start countdown all right click ok and then when the green flag is clicked we want to actually broadcast start countdown so let's go to our countdown Sprite in our countdown Sprite we want to receive the start countdown and then when it receives it we want to first show it and then let's go to motion make sure it goes to X Y zero zero so it's in the center like this and then we want to go to looks and then switch costume to costume one which is the number three and then go to control let's wait maybe 0.5 seconds and then let's actually duplicate this switch costume and wait so duplicate this and then put it under then we want to switch costume to costume two which is the number two and then wait 0.5 seconds and then duplicate this again switch costume to costume one or actually three sorry and then switch costume to costume four which is the go so it's going to be like this three two one go and then at the end we actually want to hide this so go to looks and then hide it so it's like this three two one go and then hide right so if we try it right now then we have our countdown but we actually want the countdown to start the game after it's finished so at the end over here let's go to events and then broadcast play after it finished counting down so let's try it again three two one go and then the game starts all right cool however we still want the game to initialize when the green flag is clicked because right now there's like nothing right and then when the game starts then everything is put into place but we want everything to be ready when the countdown is counting down like this so to do that it's actually pretty easy we have to just go to Every Sprite and then make sure it's in the correct place when it receives the countdown message so for example in the chicken we want it to set its change in y to zero so that's not moving and then go to this position and then set size to 80. and that's going to be under when I receive start countdown so just change that and then for the rest of the actual moving script let's just drag a when I receive play so by doing this the chicken's actually in its starting position when the countdown happens like this all right cool so now time to do the pipes so let's see um I think for the pipes it's fine because when the countdown is happening we don't want any pipes to spawn so the pipes are okay but let's see the Hills so of course when it receives the countdown we want the hill to be in the middle so go to zero zero and then go backwards 10 layers so it's on the very back and I think this is fine and then we can just drag this back inside of the winning receive play and let's see how it looks so the hills in the correct position all right and now I think the only thing missing is the number counter or the score counter so let's go to the score counter and let's see let's change the winner received play to when I receive start countdown so pretty much the score counter creates all of its clones and then the Clones show and stuff like that when the score starts counting down or the countdown Sprite starts counting down sorry so yeah let's try it out now oh yeah and we also need to hide our you lose screen and retry button when the countdown starts so let's go to our you lose Sprite and change the play to start countdown and do the same thing for retry button change the whenever receive play to when I receive start countdown all right let's try it again now there's the countdown and then the game starts all right cool let's try it again there's the countdown and then the game starts all right so the countdown now works when the green flag is clicked however the countdown does not work yet when the retype button is clicked and that is because for the retry button when the button is clicked it broadcasts play but we need to change that to countdown or start countdown so when the mouse is down then broadcast start countdown all right let's try it again so countdown and then let's just say we lose the game then we try and then there's the countdown all right cool so we added the countdown and the countdown seems to work all right but however we still need to fix the problem with the loose screen because the Clones are disappearing so to prevent the clones from deleting when the loose screen starts up let's move the delete this clone into the when I receive start countdown not after when I receive lose so let's first go to our pipes and then where it says delete this clone inside of the when I receive lose let's change this to when I receive start countdown and then delete this clone and same thing for the Hills so instead of the delete this clone inside of the window receive lose we drag a we're actually in here whenever C star countdown then delete this clone all right let's try it now so there's a countdown then let's lose the game and now as you can see the pipes show up and the hill shows up and for some reason our retry button is in the back over here so I'm just going to make it go to the front layer when the lose is received all right let's try it again countdown and then lose the game and then there we go now we have a fully functioning loose screen cool so let me just try it out it's like this and then when the game is lost then essentially everything pauses and it's all good all right so now I sort of wanted to add a bird knockback animation when the game loses for example when the bird crashes into the pipe the bird sort of jumps backwards like that so I'm going to add that let's uh go to the bird Sprite and then since we want the bird to do its animation when the game is lost let's grab a when I receive lose then uh let's make the bird sort of jump so we want to of course change the or actually set the change in y a to let's say seven now we want to go to control and then grab a repeat until block put it after the change in y to seven and then let's repeat until the bird is lower than the bottom edge of the screen so repeat until the Y position is less than uh what is it I think I have it over here oh yeah negative 171 all right drag this inside of the repeat until and then after the bird is lower than negative 171 in the Y position then it's going to hide so drag the hide after the repeat until and then while it's still greater than negative 171 then we want it to um just duplicate this so change y by change in y drag inside of the repeat until and then we want to also make sure the change in y is decreasing so also copy this one change change in y by negative 0.8 and then drag this inside of the repeating two all right so let's try it out so when the bird crashes into the pipe then it sort of jumps like that all right I think I'm gonna make the bird also go backwards a bit so let's go to motion and then drag a change X by let's say negative one that's drag it in there and let's try it out oops okay and our bird is hidden that is because I hit it over here but then I do not show it again when the game starts so let's go to looks and then grab a show drag it after the when I receive start countdown all right let's try it again there's the bird when it hits the pipe then it does that all right cool let's see it again the bird when it hits the pipe let's say here it sort of jumps backwards all right um and I'm also going to make sure that the bird points in direction of 90 degrees when the game starts all right and I think it works so let's see um oh yeah I realized that the score does not reset until the start countdown finishes but we want the score to reset when you start countdown begins so let's see where the score is set oh right here all right and let's actually set the score when I receive start countdown all right now the score resets to zero when the start countdown begins and it should be fine all right cool like this okay and now I sort of remember seeing some bugs when I was play testing this game so let me just try to find them um let's see um oh yeah right there um when you press retry before the bird is finished falling it sort of doesn't work like that because the bird is still falling so let's go to our bird and let's see it stops all other scripts in the Sprite so let's put it before everything over here and that is because when the game restarts while the bird is still falling then the bird is going to keep on falling so we need to make sure that we stop the falling bird Sprite or script and then it should work all right let's try it again so when the bird is falling and then click retry then it works let's see I remember seeing something else that was a problem um I think it was the pipes so let's see um okay I don't see anything right now hmm okay that's a problem so I think when you press retry right after the bird dies then it doesn't work so let's try it oops okay it's right here so I'm just gonna spam click this and then yeah the game doesn't really work so let's see how I can fix this um see it again all right so that just stops working so I think the best way to fix this is to just go to the retry button and then adding a weight let's say 0.1 seconds before it runs the code about the touching the mouse pointer and stuff like that so I think this should fix it let me just try it again all right that fixes it so when I click it super rapidly there's no more um weird pipe issues so that's fine all right cool so I think I fixed all of the bugs for now um now I'm going to create a simple menu screen so first of all I need to create a menu button so let's um just duplicate this retry button and then let's go to costumes and I'm going to change this to menu and that should be fun all right so now I'm going to position this downwards a bit maybe right here all right so I'm just going to drag this go to x y let's say after the when I receive lose and for the retry button I'm going to do the same so go to zero zero all right so now I have the retry and menu button so when I click the menu button I want it to broadcast a new message and let's just name this menu when we click the menu button we want it to actually go to the menu so let's go to stage and then I'm going to create a new backdrop and this is going to be my menu backdrop and for now I'm just going to create a rectangle that's the color white or actually a light blue works too it's like this all right a bit wider okay and then I'm just gonna add some text saying menu and this should be fine for now all right so now in our stage we want to make sure that when it receives menu so an event when I receive menu then we want to switch backdrop to backdrop 2 which is the menu backdrop and then when I receive um start countdown which is the game starting with the countdown text then we want to switch backdrop to backdrop one which is our game background so yeah right now it should work with just the background change all right and then menu and like that the menu changes however if we go to the menu we want everything else to disappear so let's go to the Sprites one by one and then make sure the High when they receive menu so let's first go to the bird all right so let's go to events when I receive menu then you want to hide and then go to control or actually events or sorry control and then stop other scripts in Sprite all right so this ensures that nothing else in the chicken Sprite is going to run and that should be fine now let's drag this into also our pipe Sprite and let's add a delete this clone at the end to make sure all the Clones are gone and then drag this into our Hill Sprite all right drag this into our number counter Sprite also our loose screen however we don't need this delete this clone since there are no clones in this blue screen and we also don't need this stop other scripts in Sprite since there are no Loops in here so it's fine and let's go to let's say our number counter and then drag this into our retry buttons right let's take out the delete this clone because there are no clones in this Sprite and I think this should be fine oh yeah also the menu button all right and it should be good let's try it out count down and then lose the game then menu oh yeah this is another bug when you lose the game right win a pipe is spawned then the pipe still uh moves because the stop other scripts in Sprite is called right before the pipe starts moving so yeah I am going to fix this in the next part of the series though but anyways let's go back to looking at the menu so let's try it again when the bird loses then menu then as you can see everything hides and we are at the menu so now on the menu screen we want a play button so to do that let's just copy the menu button and let's go to costumes change this to play or actually start and then let's go to the code and let's see in the when I receive menu we want the button to show and actually do all this stuff so we just take this out and then change the loose to menu and it should be fine and then when the mouse is down we want the start button to broadcast play or actually start countdown and then that should be fine um let's see all right and when I receive start countdown we want the start button to hide and also to stop other scripts in the Sprite oh actually oh we already have it here so it's fine yep that's good and I think we should be good so let's try it out oops okay everything is gone or actually the hills and that's because I need to make sure I show The Hills when the start countdown is received like that all right let's try it out okay then when the bird crashed the pipe and then menu then there's our start button all right and then when we press start then there's our countdown okay everything seems normal and everything seems to work now I'm just going to reposition the start button to maybe the middle over here so right here that is y position 23 all right and this should be good menu and then menu all right now since we have a menu when the green flag is clicked we don't want it to start the game but we want it to go to the menu so instead of broadcasting start countdown we want to broadcast menu and now it should be fine so when the green flag is clicked it shows a menu and then we can start all right and our game works like normal and then when the bird crashes it shows the animation and then we can retry and we can also go to the menu all right so there we have it we have our basic menu we have a working retry button and blue screen and we also added some countdown text this is part five on how to make a Flappy Bird game in scratch and in this video I am going to make the menu look better at some sound effects fix some bugs and reexplain all the code in the project anyways let's get started so the first thing I want to fix before I do anything else is that I forgot to make it so that you can't hold the mouse button because right now when you hold the mouse button the bird sort of floats up and we don't want that because we only want the bird to jump once when you tap the button and if you hold the button the bird still only jumps once so that's what we want so to do that we just actually have to go to control and then grab a wait until block go to operators grab a knot and then go to sensing and then grab a mouse down and let's drag this after the set change in y and point in Direction inside of the if Mouse down and now what this does is that after you hold the mouse button down it runs the set change in y and point in Direction and then you have to release the mouse pointer before running this again so now this prevents the player from holding down the mouse button however we can't put this if Mouse down inside of this forever Loop anymore because while it's waiting for not Mouse down then nothing else would run so we want to separate this if Mouse down from the forever Loop and then let's just go to events grab a separate when I receive play and then grab a further loop from the control and then drag this if Mouse down stuff inside of the forever Loop all right now let's try it out all right and then if I try holding then the bird still jumps like normal let me try it again like this if I hold then the bird still only jumps once all right cool so we fixed that problem and something else that may happen when you play the game is that when you lose the game right when another clone of the pipe spawns the cloned pipe keeps moving normally across the screen instead of freezing so let's go to the pipes to see what's wrong um let's see what can we fix in here okay let me first try to recreate the bug so I have to crash into the pipe right when a new pipe spawns okay that was a bit too late let me try it again okay A bit too early now uh let me see okay still a bit too early um okay A bit too late now all right so I managed to get the bug and as you can see the newly spawned pipe keeps scrolling through the screen and we don't want that so let's go to our pipes now and I think what happens is that um the pipe creates a clone at the exact same time that the bird loses and then it's supposed to stop all other scripts in the Sprite but it doesn't stop the create clone of myself because it's the exact same time and then that ends up the newly created clone not stopping all of its scripts and then keep on going so that's the problem I think so to fix that we have to create a new variable and then I'll just call this uh lost and then yep click ok and when the flag is clicked or actually when I receive um play or actually start countdown let's set lost to no and then once the bird crashes into the pipe then we want to set loss to yes so let's go to the bird and then right here in the if touching Sprite 2 which is the pipe then we want to set lost to yes and then do all this all right now let's go back to our pipe and in the Clone over pipe we want to make sure that the pipe only moves if lost is equal to no otherwise we want the pipe to pause so let's go to control grab an if statement and then go to operators grab an equals and then go to variables grab a lost and then check if lost is equal to no then do all of this stuff inside of the repeat until oops I'm going to make sure that I also get the set size to 150 in there all right so let's try it out I'm going to try to make sure the bird loses right when the pipe spawns to see if the problem is fixed all right I'm gonna go to Project view so it's a bit easier and let's try it so let me make sure that the pipe just spawns okay that was a bit too late I think okay A bit too early now okay A bit too early again I think I need to be like one frame later okay that was too late okay so I can't recreate the exact problem that we used to have but I'm pretty sure the problem is fixed so let's go back inside of the project and okay let me first reposition the loose screen I think I accidentally dragged it so I'll just drag it go to zero zero um after the when I receive moves all right and now that I think all of the bugs are fixed I'm going to create a better looking menu all right so I am done with the menu and I separated the title into a new Sprite so instead of putting it inside of the backdrop I made it its own separate Sprite and that's because I want the title to maybe move around a bit so yeah and I also added some um sun rays and I made these a separate Sprite also because I'm gonna add some ghost effect because I want the Rays to be transparent so yeah anyways I made the button look a bit better and added some hills in the background and yeah all right so I'm gonna first go to the Sunbeam Sprite and then I'm going to go to a control or actually event and then drag a when I receive menu then I'm going to go to looks and then I'm going to set the ghost effect to maybe let's try 50. all right um let's try 40. maybe 30 not like 40 better all right and then I'm also going to make them go to the back so go to back layer all right and I think they look better and now for the title I am also going to drag a when I receive menu then I think I'm going to make the title go up and down by a tiny bit so I'm going to um I guess grab a repeat and then I'm going to repeat maybe 10 times and I'm going to change y by let's say 0.5 and then I'm going to duplicate this and then change y by negative 0.5 and let's see how this looks all right so it goes up and down like that okay so I think we can repeat this so let's go to control and then grab a farther Loop and put this around the two repeats and the C and it jumps up and down like that all right um also I'm going to grab a win I receive uh start countdown then I am going to hide the Sprite and then stop all other scripts in the Sprite so in control and then stop other scripts in Sprite and also for my uh sunbeams I'm going to do the same thing so when I receive start countdown then hide and we don't need the stop other scripts in the Sprite because there are no Loops in here so we're fine all right let's see and okay our title is gone and we have to reshow it so let's drag a show after the when I received menu and also a show for the sun beams that should be good all right let's try it out so there's the bouncing title and when we press start then the game starts as normal all right cool so I think this is going to be our title screen now and let's see okay and now I'm going to make some changes to the you lose screen all right so this is going to be our you loose screen and for the retry and menu buttons I am going to take out the ghost effect so I'm going to set it back to zero so it's fully visible all right and that should look better okay so now we have our updated loose screen so let's see it again and our loose green right here and lastly I am going to now add some sound effects so let's see of course we want a flapping sound effect for our bird so let's go to our bird and then let's go to sounds and now let's create a new sound we can actually choose the sound so the scratch 3.0 editor has a great selection of sounds you can choose from like all of these so I'm going to try to find some maybe flapping sound let me search it up flap okay nothing let me go to effects all right so low whoosh sounds pretty good it sounds like this so let's select this and I'm going to first trim this so let's click this trim tool over here and I'm just going to trim this much of it and then click save and now let's see I might make it slower okay A bit slower okay I think that's fine for now so let's go back to our code and to add the sound it's really easy all we need to do is in our if Mouse down we just want to go to sound and then add a play sound low whoosh so let's put this right after and that should be fine so let's try it out now when the bird flaps there's the low whoosh sound all right cool so I think that sounds pretty good and oh yeah we don't want the sound to play when we're selecting a button though like if we click retry then the sound still plays and we don't want that so let's see um I think in our when I received lose we can go to control and then grab a stop other scripts in the Sprite and let's put it right after it receives lose so this is where the bird sort of jumps back when it like hits a pipe or something so yeah now let's try it out okay and then when it loses there is no more sound and all right it works so our flapping sound works for the bird oops and that should be fine all right so I think I also want a button sound so when we hover over it there's the sort of button click sound effect or something like that so let's see um let's go to sounds again and let's try to find the sound alright so I found a good sound it's called wood tap sounds like this so I think this is going to be when we hover over the button let's see I might make it slower actually this is fine so yeah let's leave it like that okay this is fine now let's go back to the code and in all of our buttons we want to add that would tap sound and okay I think I accidentally added that to the loose screen so oops but we can just drop this sound into our buttons like that so let's do that and in our buttons we can now add this when it's touching the mouse pointer so let's go to sound and then add the start sound would tap let's place this after the if touching Mouse pointer or actually let's not do that because it won't work because since this if statement is constantly checking if it's touching the mouse pointer the sound would constantly play so we don't want that we only want the sound to play once when the mouse enters the button area so let's grab a separate event when I receive lose and then let's grab a forever Loop and we can just grab an if statement and then check if it's touching the mouse pointer then we want to start the sound wood tap and then let's go to control and wait until it's not touching the mouse pointer and now that should be fine so this ensures that the sound only plays once when the mouse pointer enters so let's try it out that is for the retry button so let's go to the retry button and then as you can see the button sound plays all right so let's do the same thing for the menu button let's just drag this inside of the menu Sprite or menu button Sprite and then that should be fine because the menu button Sprite has almost the same code as the retry button Sprite so we're good now let's drag this into our start button okay and then instead of when I receive lose we want this to be when I receive menu now let's try it out okay there's your start button Sprite and okay [Laughter] so this works fine like that however first thing I noticed was that the countdown Sprite showed on the menu so we want to go to events drag a winner receive menu then we want to hide the countdown Sprite all right and a second thing that I noticed was that when the game starts you can still hover over the menu button Sprite because it's still there so let's go to our start button in our menu and let's see oh yeah we have to make sure that when the start button is clicked we want to also um stop other scripts in the Sprite including the button sound effect so yeah that's why this was playing because this forever Loop was still going so now that we added the stop other scripts in Sprite it stops everything in the start button Sprite all right let's try it again so there's our sound effect and okay um let's see oh yeah okay so the stop other scripts in Sprite also stopped this so let's just drag this hide inside of the if Mouse down and that should be fine all right and there we go okay oh and I think the same thing for the mini button so we want to stop other scripts in the Sprite for the menu button and let's also drag the hide inside of the if Mouse down instead of the start countdown and let's check the retry button okay same thing so drag a stop I'll description Sprite and that should be fine oh yeah let's drag the hide inside of the if Mouse down and let's try it again okay all right okay our menu button is still there so let's see oh yeah we still have to include the when I receive start countdown because when we restart the game we still have to hide the menu button so yep my bad let's drag this back let's also drag this inside of the retry button Sprite just in case and that should be fine all right okay the money button is still running okay to fix this we have to go to um control and then stop other scripts in the Sprite win start countdown is received and that should be fine let's do the same thing for the retry button so stop other scripts in Sprite when start countdown is received and now let's try it again okay all right no more button tapping sound effects in the game I mean when the game starts all right and I think that works Okay cool so we have the button sound effect down and now I think I'm going to add a sound effect to when the bird passes a pipe maybe some like high pitched ding sound effect or maybe a bell or something so let's try to find that um let's see let's go to our uh pipe let's see yep so let's go to sounds now and I'm going to find the sound okay I found the sound effect and it's this sort of coin sound effect like that so let's add this and I'm just going to trim this to here and I might make this higher pitched let's see foreign yeah I think a higher pitch sounds better okay and now this is going to be our score increase sound effect so let's go to our code and right in here when the bird passes the position of the pipes then we want to go to sounds and then start the sound of the coin all right let's try it out all right there it is okay that seems pretty good let's try it again all right and one more sound effect I think I will add is uh when the bird crashes into the pipe we sort of need some bump sound effect so let's go to our bird Sprite and then I will find a sound alright so there weren't any small bumping sound effects but I think beatbox one will do so it's like this so I think I'm gonna only use the first part of the sound effect so when it does this okay so right around here so I'm going to trim about this much of it let's try it okay A bit more or here all right so I think this much is fine I'm going to save this all right and let's drag the sound into when the bird crashes into the pipe so right here let's drag the start sound of beatbox one inside of the if touching Sprite 2 which is the pipe or if the Y position is less than negative 171. all right let's try it out okay that sounds pretty good let's try it again when it falls off okay I think that's good and of course you can record your own sound effects if you want you can also find them online there's some good sites where you can download some free sound effects but anyways that's pretty much it so I'm just going to do some more playthroughs of the game so does the menu okay I'm going to go to the project page all right so this is the menu we have our start this is our gameplay all right let's crash into the pipe foreign okay let me retry okay let's go back and let's start again of course you can make the game Harder by decreasing the space between the pipes all right oops that was some lag right there but yeah anyways that's the entire game anyways that's it for this video and that's it for this entire series
