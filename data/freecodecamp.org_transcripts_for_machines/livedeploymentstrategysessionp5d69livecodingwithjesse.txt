hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do something a little bit different i don't think we've ever dedicated an entire show to planning but it's going to be collaborative planning so i i expect and i hope that there will be a lot of input from you and i'll start out by giving you a rough sketch of what i think we should do to deploy the various parts of this project that we've been working on for for months now um and then i want to get your input to see you know is that plan even reasonable is there something i'm missing like maybe something that could go wrong or some better way to do it and then i'd like to take each piece and come up with a backup plan because you never know what could happen so i want to have a fallback and this will all be in preparation for the upcoming launch in june and i figure once we break things down and have a plan then in future streams we can dedicate a stream to each piece of the plan deploy it all together i'd also like to maybe do some tutorial videos that aren't live that are a little bit more well thought out and don't include all my normal mistakes so after we do a stream uh then and i get it to work then maybe i'll repeat the process with a test you know version and then have that video on my youtube channel that way it'll be a little bit easier for you all to go back and and reference if you want to do it yourself okay so great looks like we're up to a good amount of viewers here so i do want to say last week i didn't stream very much i think only once that's because i was at the revolution conference in virginia beach which was an awesome conference and if anybody gets a chance to go to that conference next year i definitely recommend it one of my favorite conferences uh the people there were very nice and i i attended a whole day of workshops on the second day of the conference and learned some really awesome things like i built an alexa skill uh which actually got accepted and it's live now so it's just a basic skill called weird and weird in fact it's weirton we're 10 facts and weirdtoon is my hometown so it just gives you some you know random facts about my hometown so that was kind of my first first alexa skill kept it really simple and then in my other workshop that's where i got a lot of the ideas that i'm going to share with you today so shout out to francisca i don't remember her last name no um you know what i i gave her a shout out in the tweet my latest tweet so check it out if you want to see her name but she works for google and she gave an awesome workshop on a lot of google cloud stuff and we built a little a little node app on google cloud so you can check out that tweet if you want to know more about her and i think we're going to get started so the way i'm going to do this i'm going to set a pomodoro timer during that time we're just going to talk about and discuss things related to deployment if you have any other questions like general coding questions or really anything in general you want to know my favorite color go ahead and ask it but i'm going to save those questions for our fiveminute breaks and then i'll save it for the very end of the stream once we get through all the deployment stuff and then that way that'll help us stay focused a little bit but you shouldn't have to wait too long to get your question answered oh awesome um francisca is is here i hope i'm pronouncing your first name right let me know if i'm not i i really would like to pronounce it right and uh great so if i mess anything up in terms of google cloud stuff i hopefully uh you know you'll be able to correct me there so let me start this pomodoro session if you're not familiar with pomodoro session it's it can vary a bit but it's usually 25 minutes with a five minute break all right so i'm just gonna do this in markdown i thought about opening up uh google doc or something to kind of mark down my my plans or write up the plans but i thought hey like we do coding why not do it in vs code and markdown uh so um it'll look prettier on the right hand side so if you follow along you can check that out and here's i'm gonna go down through and just give you my my vision for how this is going to deploy so let's take that react part first so we have our react project which is you know node we have express running uh we we built that out with next js um we're using apollo for graphql so if you all seen any of the streams you know you know how that is we've already successfully deployed it using now which is from the same company that makes js it's zeit so that's a really easy deployment it scales it's fast i want to use that because then that takes away the burden of server maintenance i love the fact that it scales so it should be able to handle whatever traffic and updating things is super easy there's no downtime so that's the the strategy now so let's go and do a small heading for all these subplants so let's just call this the the react app we'll do a small heading and then we're just going to do a list we're going to say now is is going to be our deployment so that one's pretty simple uh i think that one is is not really going to be where the debate's at although uh nikki says is your mic pointed at your pc okay you know what my mic did fall down a bit it came loose so i didn't notice it until you just said that let me there we go i hope that's better i'm gonna move it a bit closer to me as well and away from my my computer all right cool so that should be better sorry about that um i'm going to do my best to keep my eye on the live chat to see if there's anything related to our deployment all right so now the next part we're gonna do uh so let's do react the next part is gonna be our our database so my so we have a mysql database and i'll go in and fill out the rest here files okay so this is a good layout for kind of the structure of what we'll need so for our mysql database right now it's linked up on a digital ocean droplet so we have one droplet it's just a cheap five dollar droplet and it has our wordpress installation any files associated with that and then it also has the mysql database all right there so i don't want to keep it like that the reason being uh well obviously a five dollar droplet is not going to do it we'd have to increase the size of the droplets significantly but then that also provides us with a single point of failure we could stay in digital ocean and one option that i have thought of and this could probably be our backup is to use multiple droplets so we would have multiple instances of my sequel and wordpress and load balance between them and then somehow make sure they're all in sync at all times to me that's a lot of work for some and it's something that i've never attempted before so that's why i say probably better for a backup um oh no i'm not showing my screen i'm sorry anyway here's what i've been typing so sorry i'm just i'm really excited about this so i i'm forgetting little things okay so here's where we're at so for our react app we're gonna use now as our primary and uh we'll we'll also come up with some a backup for that as well so there we are thank you for saying something who said steven said i can't see the layout uh who can't see okay so it looks like a lot of you said you can't see the layout oh so sorry um it's been a while since i've done that one uh forgotten to show the screen but it happens you think after a year doing live streams over a year now i would remember that but still don't okay so to solve the complexity issues of having multiple databases and trying to keep them in sync i thought why not go with one of these cloud hosted database services so there are several options out there because i did a workshop with google cloud i think it would be easier for me and i'd be a little bit more comfortable if i went with google's uh cloud sql uh stuff so let me show you what i'm talking about and i'll paste the link in for you because i have this up at least i did have it up where is it at i hope i didn't close it out oh no here it is uh let me go back i'm actually in the console to start setting it up so i want to back up and go to just kind of like the sales page and info page for it so here's what what i'm talking about when i'm talking about the cloud sql okay so it's a part of google cloud and i'm going to paste this into the chat the live chat so you all can check it out if you want and if if you click on that and it doesn't take you the right place please try copying and pasting it there's often some issues with the links if you paste them into the live chat so this would definitely work we're obviously going to go with the my sequel option but here's what i a few of the parts that really stood out to me as to why i want to do with with this um fully managed right so automatic backups right that's that's awesome automatic updates right those are two big things that we need to have that i won't have to worry about anymore and uh you all that have been watching for a while you know that it i get pulled off projects and onto other projects and have deadlines so it's very easy for me to forget stuff like that that really nobody else is gonna nobody hire up and is gonna say like make sure you do those updates they're not even gonna realize we need updates or we need backups or anything the only time anybody is gonna be worried about that is if something wrong happens and then they'll say well didn't we have any backups so having that taken care of is going to just free up so much time and worry from me so that alone i think makes it worth it but also the performance like i doubt i'm going to be able to match that performance if i just stick with setting up my own droplets same way with reliability i love this so digitalocean as far as i know i haven't researched myself but a colleague of mine here has researched the security certificates on digitalocean and they are okay but they definitely don't rise to this level of security so i mean look we we're not going to do anything hipaa related but if we wanted to we'd even be good for hipaa if you're not familiar with that here in the united states at least uh if you're doing anything with people's medical data you need to be hipaa compliant so it's it's kind of a pretty high level of security that's required so basically we have all these certificates and more if you dig into the documentation there's even more certificates that i can present to auditors when they come in or let's say like the head of the it department here and say you know if there's ever any question about well how we set this up i can say listen all of the data we have for this site is in a secure place you know it's these certificates are provided so that's it's not always a big deal depending on who your client is or what you're working on but here in this setting we do go through uh data security audits and things so it's it's definitely important for me to have that okay so that's just a little overview i'm going to check the live chat see if there's any questions all right i don't see anything yet which i mean which is okay i guess it's good so i guess that means what i've been saying so far makes sense so we're gonna we're gonna go over here and i'm going to say google cloud sql will be our option one whoops click in the wrong place okay so that's going to be our option and i want you all to think of some backups because i told you a backup that i thought of doing but realistically i i don't want to have to do that with with the short amount of time we have until launch i'm not confident that i can get that working reliably in that amount of time um okay now we also have wordpress right so for wordpress it's currently on that same digital ocean droplet that we talked about a few minutes ago um okay we did just so phoenix just said you tweeted that you want to discuss something from revconf here yeah so the ideas that i'm getting for the cloud sql database and then also down here for the files and images which we haven't gone over yet i got those ideas from um francisca's workshop at revconf so that's what i want to talk to you mainly about if anybody has any other questions about refcoff let me know we can get to those later i'm thinking about maybe doing a recap video from revconf and putting it on my youtube channel links in the description so i'd love to do that as soon as i can realistically though uh i will be very busy until the site launches so i can't promise you that that will come out soon but i'd like to i'd like to at least make the video while it's still fresh in my mind uh okay so for the wordpress here's what i'm thinking alright i've never done this before but as far as i know it is possible to host wordpress with now so if you're not familiar with now essentially all right from from my perspective from a user's perspective with now a user being like the developer right who's using now as a service you type in a command on the command line and your site is launched that's it it's that easy if you want your site to use a custom url which we will it's just another command super easy deployments right so that's the benefit of now and then you don't have to worry about the server uh managing a server or anything like that it takes care of scaling all that so we're already using this successfully for a react app but for wordpress what we need though is to decouple from wordpress not only the database but also the files okay so to be honest with you i'm not a hundred percent certain that we have to decouple the files but i assume that you would have to uh and i want to i've wanted to anyway um so our my first idea here to go with this is plan a is going to be used now and i'm just going to say uh backup our backup plan is going to be digitalocean and if you all come up with any better backup plans please let me know but we can still take out the files the database and everything and go with digitalocean and uh just do load balancing on digitalocean they set up so you can do automatic load balancing we did that for way back for project one last year and that that worked we didn't use it with wordpress we used it with react but it did work so at least we know how to set up the load balancing there so i think this is a decent backup but not ideal due to some of the things that um that i mentioned earlier okay so that leaves our our final our final thing here are the files so there's two big reasons why i think we should host the files somewhere other than you know on a droplet uh tightly coupled there to our wordpress install number one we need to migrate a ton of files from the old system which is based on ektron and is currently hosted on campus here just a few buildings away so i need to be able to store those somewhere else and keep the file structure it's i could do that on digital ocean i would have to get extra storage for the droplet though um and then again there's the the whole management of it right i still have to manage that number two is when i want a user when a user is going to upload a file to wordpress right so whether that be me or somebody else in my department or even users from other departments that we're going to train over the course of this next year after this launches we're going to train go department by department do training give them their own wordpress accounts limited access so they can update their own content they're going to want to upload documents and images i don't want those to just go on the droplet you know let's say it gets out of hand people start uploading a ton of really big things it could take up the space on a droplet quickly i don't want to go overkill and pay for a ton of space but i also don't want to get taken off guard and fill up all the space in my droplet so something like google's cloud storage buckets i think would work better it would give us more flexibility in terms of storage and it would have availability so let me show you what i'm thinking with google's cloud storage so again i have the documentation open and not like the sales page so let me go back to the sales page here the sales page has like the main points that you want and the nice looking graphics so that's why i'm going with that um products let's see storage cloud storage i think i'm still partially in the documentation part of it these cases features good features no all right i was kind of hoping for a different page let me see oh well i'll just go back to the page i was on i i think it's fresh enough in my mind that i can explain this a little bit more without it and i did actually have a storage bucket that i created from the uh from the conference from the workshop that we could go to if i need to get into it a little more i don't really want to get into technical stuff but just say like um essentially you could see the prices think of like think of dropbox or google drive or microsoft onedrive right think of that but being able to drop all your files in there and have them available for consumption at a url for websites that's that's kind of like what we have here and we're paying a price per gigabyte per month okay which i love that so that means we pay for what we have in there if we put more in there we pay more but we're not we don't have like this fixed limit which is what i was afraid of i don't want to overpay and i also don't want to get stuck so this will allow us to scale nicely uh i can come in on a regular basis and clean things up if i need to and say like yeah we don't need five of these images or so and so uploaded like this gigantic 5k video or something crazy uh and we definitely don't need that uh so i i love that and i love the fact that i don't have to worry about like backups i don't have to worry about um like providing for that on my on my own like maintenance to that server it's it's taken care of so this is since i work with this already at revconf i feel more confident working with google's product i know amazon offers similar uh product i assume microsoft does i'm not 100 sure though but i think given the timeline i could probably set this up more quickly than i could otherwise my department already has a google account set up with billing attached so i just need to make sure and talk to some people who understand how the billing process works here i try to keep myself out of that because it's just a lot of extra paperwork so i got to talk to my colleague and make sure that uh we don't get in trouble first for setting up this account but i'd like to set that up soon and i'd like to do that on the live stream coming up soon uh so i'm just going to go with on here i'm going to say google cloud storage okay so these are mostly just like the plans plan a right we still need our plan b's our backup plans so that's kind of what i want to discuss whether or not number one whether or not these plan plan a's are any good or if there's something i'm missing and then number two what should plan b b especially if any of you have used any of this stuff for something similar on a real project i definitely want your uh your input i'm gonna check my timer too so we got about five minutes and then i'll get to some of the questions that are unrelated uh let me scroll up a bit make sure i haven't missed anything let's see six all right so so far i haven't had any comments on this um outline okay so uh arunesh says aws s3 should be good s3 is the storage stuff right you know how aws is and you don't you don't know what anything means if somebody already hasn't made a browser plugin that translate aws's names into something more reasonable then you should somebody should make it maybe i'll try to make it but i did work with some aws stuff as well when i did that alexa skill workshop um realistically though i think if if i'm gonna use google cloud sql and google cloud storage that's fine if i'm gonna switch and do something with amazon with aws i'd rather do aws for both because that's just one less account that i have to worry about managing so i'm open to it i just want to know what are the differences between going with aws and that that's amazon web services if you're not familiar with the uh with the name so going with amazon versus going with google what are the differences uh is there any good reason to go with one or the other let's see okay nikki says uh nikki doesn't have experience but heard uh westboss uh and scott tolinski talk about cloudanry for image storage on the syntax podcast uh nikki also says that's a great podcast you know what i haven't listened to that one yet i'll have to add that to my podcast actually i do want to give a shout out to um the tales from the script podcast uh so the guy who does that podcast i got to meet him and hang out with him at revconf and super nice guy so check that out also there's a podcast called dark net diaries if you're interested in like hackers and things like that in security check out darknet diaries podcast i binge listened to that on the way back from revconf and i listened to every episode it was that good so definitely check that out okay arnesh says aws s3 which is their storage has a good backup strategy okay all right that's cool definitely need to look into that steven says westboss likes cloudnary a lot i wonder now i'm just saying i i have no proof of this but if they mention cloudnary a lot on their podcast are they getting referral credit or something for cloudnery um that doesn't mean culinary's not good it just makes me wonder okay back we got another suggestion called backblaze arnesh says aws s3 is the cheapest oh nikki says yes they are they are sponsored and are upfront about it okay okay let me uh mark down some of these suggestions for our storage here so we're going to add as potential options aws s3 we're also going to add cloudinary and then the last one that was mentioned i've never heard of before uh back blaze back blaze okay so these are gonna be our options that we need to look into i don't have a ton of time to spend on researching this so i'm just going to look into them a little bit more so if you all have some reasons why you would recommend one over all the others let me know that would be very helpful let's see oh let me i'm going to do the five minute break right now so during this five minute break i'm going to answer any questions that are unrelated to our current topic after that we're going to reset the timer we're going to get back to the discussion make sure we have backup plans for each one of the things the pieces that need to deploy all right so we have a lot of people saying hi i'm not gonna go through everybody but if you did say hi i'm saying hi back to you right now i do see all the hellos let's see oh nikki uh said uh just published uh part two of uh fresh dev environment blog post so cool everybody check that out if you can michael says you remember when your boss used to go away to team building conference i've got a feeling this is going to be like that who some asked if i would make an algorithm course uh i could i tell you truth i might not be the best person to make an algorithm course i mean i've i've done them successfully but uh i that wouldn't be top on my list of things i would feel confident that i could contribute something but i'm open to it i'll uh definitely add that to the list of potential video tutorials and things that i could make let's see uh okay michael's uh michael who's with us frequently on the live stream is having trouble with his internet which that's that really stinks sorry about if you're still with us sorry about that michael if you if you can't watch it now but you can watch it later on uh you know definitely just put your input into the comments or dm me or something and uh i i would still appreciate you your opinion on these things okay uh rick adams says which book and or video titles uh are recommended for a thorough base of software development regarding object oriented programming sql or sql depending how you like to say it um rbdb design and scripting in java oh i don't i don't really know uh you know because i don't deal with like java at all and i minimally deal with sql and realistically like you know uh with react we're not really doing objectoriented programming so i don't really know does anyone else have any suggestions for books or videos on those topics if you do please let us know in the live chat or if you're watching later on please throw it in the comments to the video phoenix said i once listened to that meaning the dark net diaries podcast and never again since i started having thoughts about the dark about darknet bad thoughts yeah well if you've ever been tempted to be uh you know a bad hacker then um maybe that's not the show for you it'd be too tempting uh lawson arts3 asks what's the question uh basically our question now is what are the best ways to handle these different pieces of the deployment that we need to do for our current project that's project five in this video series um so in particular if you have any opinion about any of these products for file storage you know please let let me know francisco says as far as i know on standard products like stores the large providers are all equally good and similarly priced it's probably simpler if you have one provider for all your services okay cool yeah i definitely agree on having one provider for all the services so uh and thank you for that let's see okay so cloud storage uh azure is expensive okay so azure is maybe we didn't even have that as an option so i'm not going to add it in right now nobody really suggested it but that would be microsoft's version of this joshua asked why i'm using wordpress for the front end we're not using wordpress for the front end react is the front end wordpress is just handling our content management i needed something that uh was very user friendly for the people that are gonna have to edit this because we're going to have a lot of people that have no coding experience editing this uh so wordpress does provide that i think a pretty pretty simple user experience and it also has a huge uh community of developers you know that i can reach out to if i need help to customize some things i do have somewhat of a background in wordpress as well when i freelanced i used to do a lot of wordpress sites because it seems like every small business has a wordpress site all right let's go back and we'll do one more pomodoro session we may not even take the whole session and then i'll go back and make sure i've answered all the questions here uh but i want to to go back and fill this list out a little bit more so keep it coming with all the ideas definitely appreciate it i've already had a few ideas that i never thought of because i've never heard of these services let's see let's see all right uh lawson says all i know about them is aws seems aws is the most solid choice not considering price or firebase is from what i've seen okay yeah so firebase being a google product i don't think we'll need firebase though uh i mean we're because we definitely already have the data in a sql database so i would don't i don't want to convert you know i don't want to switch it over but um so that's why i'd rather go with a you know cloud sql amazon does have something similar as well so we could go with that okay harsh it's here hey how's it going harsh it uh as you can see on the screen these are uh some of the options that we're going with for deployment for each part of our of our project so if you have any opinion on any of these please let me know okay so keep the suggestions coming i think i've gotten through all of them i want to talk a little bit about backup plans for some of these so for our react app we may be able to go with if we can't go with now for whatever reason i'm i'm not going to speculate on why let's let's just say it we can't go with now our backup of course could be load balanced digital ocean droplets okay why digital ocean well we already have an account with digitalocean so that would be faster but realistically could we do something with a different provider yeah we definitely could um you know amazon google microsoft or any other number of providers we could probably do the same thing for i like that digitalocean has a really easy load balancing built in i don't have enough experience with other options to know if their load balancing is as easy okay but this takes a little bit more work we would have to keep up with the updates and maintenance on all these servers so that's why that's definitely a backup plan if anybody has any other options for backup plans that may be better than that please let me know it says let's see okay bo bo's here i didn't see uh so bo karns who does uh a ton of stuff for the free code camp youtube channel is here uh so good to have you here and we have some more uh opinions on what we should do here so um quinny's says digitalocean has spaces with backups as data storage as well doesn't it you know what i believe they do so i i do believe digitalocean has the data storage uh backups and things too so maybe you know what maybe we should add digitalocean here as well as an option makes sense we already have an account with them and i believe someone else in my department has used the storage in digitalocean so i'll be able to talk to them and see what they thought of it uh bovin says are you looking uh also looking for network latency problem many times we experience in some regions of the world websites load very slow due to network latency uh well yeah i'm i definitely want to avoid latency as much as possible uh i'm not sure other than trying to make my site as small and fast as possible i'm not sure what else i could do in in terms of helping with network latency matt duchess says perfect timing for this topic working on mine thanks you're welcome i'm i'm glad hopefully this will be helpful to you oh okay stephen has a in a very reliable kind of old school uh method here steven says how about a couple of thumb drives and dvdr archives yeah we could add that in the mix right you know it'll def it'll be totally offline we don't have to worry about hackers getting in stealing or corrupting our data right that would be actually hilarious just to have like a little piece of artwork hanging in my office that are like the entire website and thumb drives or something like that maybe i'll have it in glass that says break in case of emergency just harshit says by the way you will be working using docker for wordpress now yes so that's let me let me just show you a little bit of the details about how this would would need to work so i've already forked the example um for how to use wordpress with now so if you check out this fus marcom here i'll give you a link to it uh so our organization that we've been building our all our stuff and now has a fork of this so that we can modify it if we need to but basically yes we we have a docker file and that's where uh things things run so if you see like this is where we get all the wordpress stuff right and they actually have send grid built in if we need to do emails we aren't we aren't going to need the send grid part of this or at least we aren't going to use it i'm not sure yet if we need it uh so that wordpress will still work there are some parts of wordpress that auto send emails you know to like people when they sign in as users or uh to whoever the admin is which would probably be me whenever new users users sign in so we may need the email just for that sort of thing so might keep it but essentially you know for those of you who know docker this will make more sense to you uh but these are all the instructions to get wordpress up and running within that docker container um so i need to spend more time kind of studying this to figure out because there are a few things in use here that i've never used before so harshit mentions uh hhvm i've never even heard of that before much less used it so that's one of the things i want to research more about harshad says it will be two times faster than php5 hey well i like that anything to make it faster is good so so if anybody knows a little bit more about docker and can kind of see what's going on or you want to use the link to um you know to check it out inspect it a little bit more depth you know if you have some some input for me that would be great but this is the official example if you go to the now documentation and you look up wordpress this is where they point you uh so it's um it's at least trusted by the now team to use with wordpress uh so i'm kind of basing my confidence on on that uh michael creel has a good point says not sure how wordpress works when you finally hand it off you're going to need a lot of validation rules uh if they're going to be less experienced people working on it i paraphrased a bit but um yeah yes you're right uh we're def that's why we're holding off on giving other people access right now and we're gonna slowly roll it out and train people over the next year one of the one of the big reasons other than just the time it takes for training is making sure that we set it up in a way that users have as much freedom as possible without really the ability to mess things up too much so we're definitely going to be working on that okay let me go back here and say so basically we have our plans and then backups for everything except this um google cloud sql um and i'm gonna put here as a slash slash aws because you know as we mentioned earlier you know if we decide to go with google here we're gonna go with google you know down here as well if we decide to go with aws it's going to be aws you know pretty much across the board but as a backup let me know what you think about you know essentially doing something like this right load balance situation droplets and actually i let me change this to say load balance situation droplets here okay now if you're not familiar with with how we've done this in the past essentially what you do is have droplets that are exactly the same so let's we run a few droplets that are exactly the same and then we would use digital oceans load balancing service which is an extra 20 a month and then they would handle a lot of the technical details of it we would just have control over a few settings and then they would you know they the load balancing would be handled so for each time we do this for the react app that adds an extra 20 for the database extra 20 for wordpress and extra 20. uh so that's an extra 60 a month that potentially we wouldn't really need uh just for the load balancing and then on top of that we need the droplets so we'd have to pay for each one of the droplets so i believe that using now and some sort of cloud service here would end up being easier to manage and also less expensive uh also easier to scale let's see we have a few more opinions on this as well so let's see uh harshit says aws rds is also good easy to set up uh use docker for my sequel with volume but i guess that would be overkill francisca says i have to run thanks for the stream watch we'll catch the rest offline thank you so much for watching and lending your opinion i really appreciate it and again thank you for the the workshop i love the workshop and i learned so much it's going to help me with with my job so again thank you that's uh that's awesome okay all right so at this point i still want to hear your opinions either now on the live chat or um later on in the comments uh if you don't want to say anything publicly you can always dm me on twitter if you want but i'm going to go now and start reading some of the other questions that aren't directly related to deployment i did have a comment from harshit harshit says add aws rds to that list so we're talking about the sql list then anyway i'm sure there's a little delay but our should let me know i couldn't remember what the aws equivalent of cloud sql was uh so let me scroll up a bit so i don't miss any of these questions so scan through them let's see okay chris uh asks if i've done anything with css grid yet i've just done a little bit with css grid so uh it's something that is definitely on my list of things to research more i i would love to know more i've i've actually found some tutorials that i i've like put in my the links to in my google keep like hey i want to do this and then i just haven't really had time to get um to kind of do it so definitely want to learn more about grid because from what i've heard from other developers like that's that's where it's at oh okay so harshit says the aws rds stands for relational database system cool that act that's an aws name that actually makes sense right relational database system definitely makes sense harshit says i will catch up the stream not sure why you need digital droplets on top of those services oh these aren't the digitization droplets this is the these are the backup plans in case for some reason i can't do the primary so on each one of these the first option is what i want to do but if that doesn't work out for some reason the other options are potential backups so i'm not intending on doing all of these things just one in each category i keep i keep moving my mouse on the wrong side this is the side that you're probably looking at joshua says what would you recommend for a geolocation api that could tell if you're standing next to someone i was thinking google places but was looking for some feedback um i'm trying to think uh i've used like google google's geolocation stuff before but it's been a really long time trying to tell whether you're standing next to a person might it might be a little bit difficult to get that accurate like trying to tell if you're within a certain range of a person is definitely doable i i suppose assuming that person also has the location services enabled and you have access to theirs but like let's say if there's like five people that all have that enabled i mean i don't know i guess it could yeah now i think about it i i think that's definitely possible uh with with google's geo location services harshit says you could easily spin up rds cluster that will give user and password added wp config and database done yeah yeah definitely it's uh harsha that's what i'm hoping for uh the only is like i um i'm pretty sure you do the same thing with the cloud sql so i'm kind of like just wondering which one should we go with i also want to talk to the other developer that works in my department to see what he thinks and he handles the accounts like the billing for the accounts so i want to see like in his opinion what would be easier to set up billing wise right now so that may that may be a big factor as well because i don't want to i don't want any trouble in this process of getting all the accounts set up i wanted to go as quickly and smoothly as possible so i like i i think either one of these aws or google will work just kind of not exactly sure which one to go with at this point okay well i've gotten to the end it seems like i've answered all the questions if you have any more questions throw them in here if you get them in in the next minute or so i'll see them and i'll be able to answer um otherwise i think i'll finish up with this stream and uh probably do a little bit more research on this and our our streams coming up over the next week we'll assuming i can get the billing and accounts set up soon our next streams will be basically deploying all this stuff joshua says thanks a bunch yeah no problem uh mad duchess responding to someone else says csstricks.com has awesome tips for all css but also on grid there are a lot of articles about css on that site yeah definitely i've i've definitely used some of the articles on csstricks.com before that's a great resource robocop says nice stream thanks thanks i appreciate that all right well i think i'm gonna finish up now and um yeah if if any of you watching later on or watching right now think of something or some options um or warnings for me for this setup later on please let me know dm me comment whatever you want um but you know definitely would like all the input uh that i can especially for those of you who have actually used these projects before uh can give me some you know kind of good uh input that i may not be able to read anywhere else okay i think that's it uh i'm gonna do my best to try to stream as many days as i can this week and so hopefully i'll be seeing you a lot this week to make up for all the times i didn't stream last week and so in until probably tomorrow's stream uh have a great day
