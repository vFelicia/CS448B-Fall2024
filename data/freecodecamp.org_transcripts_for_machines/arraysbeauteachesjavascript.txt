with javascript array variables we can store several pieces of data in one place you can start an array declaration with an open square bracket and end it with a closing square bracket and then you put a comma between each entry so you start an array declaration with an open square bracket and you end it with a closed square bracket and then you put a comma between each entry so these are all strings but you can also store numbers you can store objects you can store booleans and any data type you can store in an array you can also nest arrays within other arrays so one of the things you can store in an array is another array these are called multidimensional arrays here's an example of that so inside this first array there's two other arrays so this is the first item in the first array which is an array and this is the second item in the array which is another array and inside those arrays there are two items there's a string and a number an array can have multiple different types of data types in the array you can access elements of arrays using indexes if i use these brackets after the name of the array then i put the index of the element in the array now indexes start at zero so peanut butter is zero jelly is one and bread is two let's run that and we can see jelly in the console here you can also change array elements using indexes okay i actually like peanut butter and banana sandwiches better than peanut butter and jelly sandwiches so i have access array index one which is jelly and i set that equal to bananas and then you can see i log the sandwich array and over on the console we have peanut butter bananas and bread you can also access elements of multidimensional arrays with indexes you can change the elements too let me show you how you do that so you have to use two set of sets of brackets the first set of brackets refers to the entry in the outermost or the first level of the array and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside so index one is going to be here this is zero right here and this is one and then the next index is index zero so within this array right here we have index zero index one so that's going to console.log white socks and there we go at the end white sox you can also change the elements just like that so if i take the same thing here i'm going to put red sox and then we're going to console.log teams and you can see the array is now balls 23 red sox 45 instead of the white sox one of the methods that all arrays have is for each let me show you how that works so here is the array with a for each method on it so we have sandwich dot four each that means for each element in the sandwich array we're going to do something and you have to pass in a function to show what you're going to do with each element so in the function whatever you put inside these parentheses here are is that each element of the array so we're going to pass in each element of the array into this function and we're going to console that log the element so we're just going to print each item in the array so if i run that see at the end you can see on each line there's peanut butter bananas bread now you can do a lot more complicated things this allows you to just do something with each element of an array check out my common array methods video to learn more about array methods well that's the basics of arrays thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
