this week I'll have two moments in order to focus on the next projects that's why I want to focus on their design and how they should be built first making s list is important when you care about the order in this leaderboard I care about the order however in the recipe box well not so much the order isn't so important and when it comes to the recipes however what's important is how they finally look how they taste that's why that I would go for grge and in leaderboard I would go for a list I used to say I was I used to say I was the leader board does this to build a list that is talkable a user must be able to talk between uh the leaders uh depending on the time period whether it's all time or whether it's just only the last 30 days in order to toggle I would use the tub and I'm still wondering whether to keep the place number to the right if you put the number on the left still from the design perspective the Avatar which is the face will bring the fast attention so maybe it'll be better to keep the aat first and so to the left because people read like f pattern or left class in the lists so they read uh in the line later they go down they uh scan another line so at the end of each line they will see the number like one two three four maybe that would be better I will prepare some varieties because of the fact that it is the free code scan board I will use their color their greenish color and this will be my main uh theme color in this leaderboard design generally I would like to keep it clean and as wise as possible because it gives the impression of space especially if you have a list that's really homogeneous and the items repeat each item on the list will have to be a link so we have to be clickable I want to make it as interactive as possible so I want to redirect the users whenever they click any reader whenever they touch any leader uh on the list and I want to redirect them to this leaders who was chosen to to their Freo Camp account this is the first version of the design of fre Camp leaders board and the app uh should allow for toing between leaderboards according to the time span so by default I will have displayed uh less 30 days and a user can also go to alltime leaders where the total points um will be highlighted on the right there's additional information which is the number uh on the list um so I was wondering whether to put them to the left this is just the Prototype I want to make um the whole item here the whole line clickable and redirecting to a given user so whenever I click some James uh here in this line whether it would be an avatar or the line here um I want to make this whole um area clickable so to make this whole area the whole line clickable for a user to be redirector to to be redirected to free code Scamp um users um profile and uh this way this app should be more more interactive because then they can go to this uh Twitter GitHub LinkedIn they can see their activity right now I have the design on mobile um horizontally vertically um and also on uh tablet screens as well as on desktop I was considering the option of putting two columns on the wider screen such as on tablets or on uh the desktop however um scanning patterns of a list is like from top to bottom and the numbers uh should go from one to this 100 down therefore I decided to keep one column but Center it and simply make it very similar on all devices generally what changes on iPads tablets and desktops is that uh I keep two lines with the information next to the Avatar not free as on mobile phones um vertically this is the first draft and um let's start with it later we will see what happens during the codes implementation I love it rating over the projects and this is what I did with this one uh with free Cod Camp leaderboard um because the first design like these numbers on the right well finally I decided that uh they are important enough to be kept but not as to be big as the avatars that's why I kept them Smalls uh small as you see here uh so I will put the relative position and later later absolute it should work and I will put the numbers uh to the left corner of the avatars so this way the position in the leaderboard would be pretty visible but not more important than the faces than the avatars of the people H and um what I did also in this red design is that I would put the if it's like last 30 days so the last 30 days points will be here uh to the right this way it rating um you can reach better result I believe that's better solution I added the italic style to the points that aren't the most important in a given tuab so if we are in the last 30 days the total points so the points from all time they're in italics the reason for that is to still keep them um but to diminish their importance it's Friday I start the day with looking for the inspiration so I'm looking for the inspiration for the design and looking how other people do different cookbooks some recipe apps and I started with codeb and looking what other co campers did in the final code I don't want to use bootstrap again because it's a pretty simple thing to do I will try to practice my flexbook skills once again and it will be more challenging for sure but more much more fun I will want to do it not just on eMobile first but this time I will also have a look maybe at this offline first I'm also a fan of cooking and you know I'm really a foodie this is also one of the reasons I live here in Spain right now that's why this project seems also more exciting than the rest and I ran the food book um so I keep my recipes also online I don't have a lot of time right now to do it but I love culinary photography that's why this project is pretty fun for me so let's get back to work back I used to say I was I used to say I was I used to say I was I used to say I was I used to say I was I used to say I was sin this is the design of the recipe box this time I focus mostly just only on the mobile because uh the um wider screens will be pretty simp aot so I focused uh on the material design here on the cards and on the specs additional specs that I built so in um experience design I also added the user stories uh that this project will have to meet um the resour stores come from fre Cod Camp of course I tried to define the user and the technology um but also the extra stuff that can be done about this app probably in the first situation I'll just introduce um some of them and then let's go to the design I want to make it in a great system uh this will be the home screen with the uh with the index so the recipes should be visible as you see them alphabetically uh they should be distributed this way so we have bread chocolate camon roll scumble whenever you click the uh whenever you click the recipe you go to detail view when you scroll you go to the bottom of it so you have the ingredients you have instructions and later you can edit it or you can delete it uh when you edit it uh you will go to uh to the addit view you can also delete the recipe uh and there will be Rance for user if they really want to delete it or not if they click delete they will deleted from the list it was here so crumble was here after cins but right now uh it's deleted because I um deleted it uh from the home view they will be able to add the new recipe uh and save it so on the phones um horizontally I want to do one more column and on tablet I want to add one extra column which will be also kept on desktops but here um I want to move the Fab um to the top that's why I also changed the color to differentiate this FB from the rest I also designed the home screen empty state so I'm not sure about the I'm not sure about this text yet but uh whenever there's no recipe there should be some hand for a user uh to to use the button and to do something maybe I will add some um some nice picture here um plus the text to make it more juicy next week I'm going to start one of these projects probably it will be the leaderboard keep on doing and see you next week and stay tuned because there will be a big news coming to this channel really soon
