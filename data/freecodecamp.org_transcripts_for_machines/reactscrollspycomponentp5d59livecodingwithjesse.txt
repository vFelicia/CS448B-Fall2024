hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today i have a new webcam and i also have sunglasses on so you might be able to see in the reflection the webcam is really bright so bright that i was thinking about wearing sunglasses because it's super bright but the lights are nice they i have the lights off in my office but my face is lit up before the only lighting that i had was a small lamp that didn't really do anything and then on my other screens that you can't see when i'm streaming i tried to make them um be white so i'd use like the white theme on youtube and try to put basically just windows like chrome windows with all white backgrounds uh all around my main screen so this should be a much better solution than uh just trying to use my monitors although i'll probably end up taking the sunglasses off because they they do help with the brightness but i can't really read my code that well it's too dark but i haven't streamed for a while i had pretty crazy end of the week last week had some kind of like emergency things that needed to um needed to be fixed so i had to basically my boss and his boss had to do a presentation to a bunch of members of the board here on saturday and so i had to type something up for them and make sure that there was a fully functional demo site uh so i got all that working and i also added a proper url and ssl certificate to our wordpress installation so if you have the code locally on your machine definitely do uh do a get pull get the latest well if you have a fork then do what you need to do to get the um to update your fork and then um make sure it has the new url because it may not work to grab data from the old ip address and the reason i needed to do that is because i was running the demo site with an ssl certificate when it tried to grab the data from the ip address which of course was just http it couldn't get that data without an error popping up that hey you're trying to load you know http data on https so it took way longer to get that all set up than i thought but it's all running now and today we are going to create a scroll spy component i had a nice meeting earlier today with one of the students uh who is working on one section of this site and it would benefit them if they had a scroll sky scroll spy component so we're going to make the basic functionality for them and they can adjust it as needed also they were just offered a job which is really awesome so he's going to graduate in may and already has a job lined up so that was pretty cool and helping out on this project helped him to to get the job because although the job doesn't deal directly with frontend development they were really interested in the fact that he knew about javascript because that's something that they they need i guess they needed more people that knew about that so it may be something they add on to his job after he starts so i thought that was kind of cool that somewhat like indirectly uh you know that this project kind of helped him out in getting a job so that was really cool um let me think uh it looks like we have a decent amount of people i'm gonna take off the shades for now um so i'm gonna try to get started uh i don't think there's anything else to update you all on in terms of you know things that have happened in the site uh there's one weird thing going on with my tests my unit tests were failing so i messed around a little bit with it and now for some reason the um the index test uh the snapshot is huge like we're talking like over 50 megabytes huge so i messed something up so i may just end up removing the the test for the index page for now because it's taking forever to load uh and then just trying to figure out what was wrong with it you know sometime later so if you're having trouble with the test it's something i did i don't i don't know and uh let's see yeah so let's get into it i should probably start up ngrok before we start so some of you may remember that i was having some issues with the builtin camera so hopefully i will not have the same issues with this other webcam for some of you are asking why i have the sunglasses on it's because my new webcam has a really bright like ring light around it so i can't remember who it was but somebody recommended to me to get the uh the razer uh keo uh webcam and i did get that and so far i really like it the quality is definitely better than the one that's built into an imac or a macbook pro and the fact that it has the builtin light is really nice for me because i'm always coding in the dark so i didn't really want to invest in in extra lighting and i'm not really sure how the best way to set that up anyway so this is simple i mean obviously it's not like you're the best you can get but you know really it's not it doesn't really make sense for me to invest in all this equipment you know i'm just kind of doing this on the side i don't get any money for this so uh wouldn't necessarily be the the smartest investment all right uh world says the only thing is that the audio is out of sync okay i'm gonna have to look into how to fix that then let me um all right so i just did a google search on that and that way when the stream's over i will remember that and i'll check out that uh the search results yeah so i don't really want i don't want that to happen all the time i'm gonna try to fix that because i know it can be annoying when it's out of sync whenever i put the code up on the screen it you know you probably won't be looking at my face anymore so it won't be as big of a deal let's see so i'm switching now and let's go over let's start this pomodoro timer and so i'm going to do one pomodoro session and then we're going to take a break and we'll do some uh answer some questions in the live chat and then i'll go back and do another pomodoro session we'll see how much we can get done uh probably two pomodoro sessions is you know all i'm gonna do today you know at that point we'll probably be getting close to uh 6 p.m my time and then that's that's definitely time for me to get home and and help get the kids ready for bed all right so uh first thing i'm going to do let's see yeah let me just get rid of this index unit test for now let's delete that and then i'll get rid of the snapshot since i don't really have time to figure out why that's that's not working properly so and i don't want it to take to mess up our um our process of testing and just take forever so we're just going to get rid of that for now and uh we need to grab let me go over here on my other screen so that we can get some code because i know we've done something like this before let's check out i'm gonna pull this over on the other screen as soon as i get it get it working all right let's pull this over so i just want you all to have a visual of what this is going to look like it's going to be really simple just a little menu on the side which let me zoom out that is going to you know have a position fixed and as we scroll down the page it highlights the area that you are in the page and if we wanted to just skip to an area just press the button and it skips to the area okay so that's what to do this one's a little bit buggy actually like it's not exactly there we are we may have to improve upon that because this is not working exactly right so but this is basically how it's going to look and i need to find the github repo for this as well so let me pull this over and where are we at resource center yeah that was it let's go into our source and our views and planning guide and we'll figure out what we call this uh i i don't think we put this in a separate component so did we active section hmm okay yeah it looks like we're tracking scroll position and everything in here okay but then we we do have this planning guidelines component all right so that makes sense so i guess the first thing we'll do is add what we need to to the actual page and then we'll check out what's here in our our planning guidelines component that we'll need to bring in and use to create our own component so i'm going to move this off to my other screen so i can can look at it and then we're going gonna go in here to oh yeah it's the missions.js page so the the student who's who's been working with me um so basically they're doing like uh an internship uh with with me and then they're also working with another department on a project and so we we have uh at um this university a whole department uh dedicated to missionary work so like uh they go into places all over the world like you know really really poor areas and help with like to teach you know kids and at orphanages and you know feed the poor do a kind of stuff like that on spring break which is really kind of cool you know a lot of people on spring break they go party well our students go and um uh you know they they help the poor so it's definitely it's good but right now on the website the section for that isn't spectacular so the uh the head of that department is really nice guy he's always wanted something nicer for that and we really didn't have you know the capability or the resources to do that on the the old website uh but on this website i think it's gonna look a lot nicer and so um a group of students has been working on on doing that and uh they've been i've been kind of collaborating and just you know checking in and uh basically giving them like the whole framework and like here's what what you need to work within and i started them out on building the page with just basic html and css because that's what they're comfortable with and i said once you build it out and you like how it looks then we can convert it into react so that's where we're at right now is converting that page into react so we did some work on it this morning and i i think it's it's looking kind of nice so we should be able to see um yeah let me go to that page so we can see what's happening so we're at localhost 3000 and you all should see this page too missionary outreach so if you have that ngrok link that i uh pasted in there a little while ago and um you type at the end of it slash missionary hyphen outreach then you'll see this page and so i think it's really you know not bad like this student that has done this work is a computer science student and doesn't really have a whole lot of experience with javascript and frontend development at all so uh and just you know just this semester has gone from basically having zero experience with react at all you know to being able to build this out and um i think it's it's certain it's looking pretty good i'm not sure about this header right here let me know what you all think about this so i i told him to leave it in because i'm just not sure about it i know it's it's like i didn't want to say no automatically because it's a new design element so i want to get over that like shock of like hey i've never seen that design element in this site this particular site before and just kind of uh give it a few days and look at it but i would like your opinion on what do you think for sections having you know this kind of thing instead of like a full you know across the page strip just kind of a half you know i don't know i'm not sure about it but i would definitely uh like some some input on that but the idea is is that each one of these um these cards and uh he had a nice adaptation of the cards that we were using on the home page um each one of these you'd be able to click learn more and it would have its own page that would have videos from that particular trip pictures and then kind of maybe like a story of what happened on that trip and more information um yeah and then we'll have it on the other end on the wordpress side of things we're going to make it really easy for the people that work in that department to edit that so all the fields will be marked out so that if as soon as they add a new post it'll automatically appear in the right section on this home page and it will create its own its own page so that's what we have so far i mean i can already see a few things that maybe i would adjust just little things font size you know here and there um let me check i see a few you are bringing in or you're uh adding some some opinions here so i'm going to check it real quick while we're while we're on this page okay some some advice here on this uh this side thing frankie's saying um you know maybe it should be centered um swap swapnil says need more margin and maybe make it bigger so it's more prominent um okay so frank you saying make the the tech center oh okay you can make more margin bigger yeah i could see it being bigger would be good all right thank you i appreciate that um that feedback there so it'll probably get adjusted a bit you know at least it'll get adjusted a bit my thought was you know i'd just have text right there as another header and it wouldn't it wouldn't have any background or anything but i i do want to give this this a chance all right so what we want to do then on this page is make that that side uh navigation and it's going to be a little tricky right because it's not as simple as what we did on that last page that i showed you uh we can't just put it right here it's going to look terrible right so we need you know basically as we scroll down you know at maybe it starts to appear here so let's say it it scrolls with the page until you get here and then we go to position fixed and then it'll scroll down with you and if you scroll back up it would stop here and not go up any higher i think i think that's what we need um you know we definitely need you we definitely don't want it to to be up here so it's gonna have a little bit of different functionality but first things first let's just get some of the code over and then we can adjust it uh as as we need to so let's go in oops i've already moved it over here so look we're in this missions.js page and let's scroll down here we are so i did um let's see get initial problems yeah so i had some things in here that i had commented out for uh for the student that i'm working with just to say like here's here it is if you need it right uh at some point we'll probably we'll be pulling in data so that's why i kind of want to leave this in here even though we're not pulling in data yet so let's bring in what we have from this other component okay so we have quite a bit and i'll bring it in but then we'll uh we'll definitely need to go over it a bit okay so this is what we have and we definitely would need to bring in throttle from low dash which we are we are using elsewhere so we won't need to um uh to bring in this uh npm package and then right now we're not using this log page view so let's get rid of this and what's up with this why each is not defined i'm like thinking didn't didn't we do something similar to this already i guess we didn't i just uh have this feeling like we've done this before maybe i'm just thinking of the other project okay all right so there's definitely some things that we will need to change or at least adjust all right since we have this here are we not yeah okay so we we don't most of our markup is actually going to live in this component and not being another component uh so you can check out let me give you the link to this github page that i have on my other screen so you all can see that as well um if you click the link that i just pasted in and it doesn't work try copying and pasting it uh that'll usually work so i need to go to a different component uh in this other repo to planning guidelines and see what we're doing here there's prosthetics hmm scroll to item all right so in our component did mount for the the other component in that other repo that we're we're checking out the resource center repo um for the planning guidelines.js component we do have something extreme component did mount and um we're bringing in four slice headers from get top coordinates so we're actually bringing quite a bit more than i even realized i'm planning on dating wow this is way more complicated than i imagined i definitely didn't remember it being this complicated probably it's because uh one of you did most of the work for this component and not me that's usually uh what what it happens whenever i go back and i'm like well i don't remember doing that okay so let's add this in once i get everything on this page we'll go through it more closely and see like what does it do and what do we need to change but for now ref title id id okay um trying to find where that spring mission trips okay um um what are you gonna do is spring oops spring what am i thinking okay there we go so spring and let's give it an id of spring as well what am i use of string literals and ref attributes is deprecated okay um all right so we have it there let's just give it let's throw in another one here uh at the bottom i guess we don't need it all the way at the bottom do we let's put it down here put another one down here and let's just call this summer just so we have another one for our menu so for right now i'm okay with hard coding this uh because there's only going to be four sections uh and there's not like we're not going to add more seasons to the year right it's going to be spring summer fall and winter otherwise i would you'll probably be looping over things and adding more we will do that eventually but for now we you know that we don't need to mess with that it's just going to add some complexity that we don't really need right now okay so since we're doing that we will be able to get rid of a bit of this up here but let's let me make sure i have everything over here first also if you're asking questions and you're wondering why i'm not answering them i will answer questions in just about two minutes i like to break things up and do some code and then go and do some questions you know kind of back and forth all right so i think i have almost everything we just need this planning guide nav component okay so i'm going to bring in the markup section i'm gonna bring this mark up in here and i'm gonna put it down here where it'll probably end up being on the page so really we're gonna want this i guess right here um so some things that we're going to need to bring over things that we won't need i don't think we're going to need this or this and class names and we're not gonna be mapping over anything right now i think we're gonna hard code this uh at least while we're just getting it to work we're gonna hard code it okay so that's mostly everything that we need there are probably some styles you know living somewhere that we could bring over as well but um i think we have all our functions and all our markup this is actually not a bad place to stop we're going to do a short break i'm going to get some questions uh i'm going to scroll all the way up to the top and just work my way down the live chat matthew said nice shades jesse welcome to the rockstar coder club if you weren't here for the beginning of the chat i had sunglasses on so um smilers asked where's your beard yeah i shaved no more beard my wife always hated the beard so once it started to get warm it was god sorry about the yawn i'm i'm pretty tired uh i've been sick really the last week i've been getting worse and i finally went to the doctor yesterday and got an antibiotic and so hopefully i'll start feeling better just like doesn't matter what i do if i help doesn't matter how much i sleep or if i work out or don't work out i'm exhausted all the time michael asked if i had a hangover no no hangover oh i forgot to tell you all earlier i was invited to speak at career day for my son's third grade class so i did that today and it was awesome and i told the students i built websites and they they thought that was cool but as soon as i told them how to youtube show they all got really excited and wanted to know how many subscribers i had and they wanted to subscribe to my channel and so that was really fun and then i told them that i made some like little video games uh you know just just some html5 games and they all wanted to know about the games but they made me a card if you could see the card so they made me a nice card they all signed it and they gave me some chocolate chip cookies so those that was a cool experience uh sans car says i have a problem in android studio would you help me i've actually never used android studio so i mean i'd love to help you but i don't know that i'm gonna be able to help you that much so if anybody else in the live uh chat has used android studio you know maybe reach out to sam's car and and um maybe figure out what's what's going on frankie says why does our sensei look like an aviator pilot today uh cool that's funny you call me the sensei um uh desarolo says the scroll spy with react sounds good cool cool uh dennis asks uh should i spend my time to learn jquery or react uh i would learn react i mean it definitely depends like for your current job do you need to know more jquery or react or are you just learning and you could learn either one i would learn react i think you're gonna find more jobs and higher paying jobs knowing react but there definitely are still a lot of places that use jquery so you can there's work for both uh but i i think that react is it's a little bit more challenging but i have more fun with react than i than i did with jquery uh i'm really sorry if i'm mispronouncing that let me know how i should pronounce it but anyway they say i think we are in a situation where we have a lot of framework frameworks and it's going to be a little trouble about which framework i have to choose to work with which i just want to talk about uh react node.js and angular yeah i mean that's definitely a big decision for a developer like what framework am i going to use um some don't really have a choice because they have to use whatever their boss says they have to use but if you do have the choice it can be a difficult decision right you could try to learn a little bit about all of them or you could try to really become an expert at one so that's you know that's definitely a decision that needs to be made at some point but if you keep learning javascript just regular javascript it'll be easier and easier to switch into a framework at some point so don't feel like you have to make that decision too early uh if you're not sure just you know keep learning and uh it's once you learn a framework it's it's not that hard to switch a lot of the concepts are similar um even if the frameworks you know really different just the ideas behind frameworks in general can can transfer so you know don't be too worried about it it's not like the end of the world if you pick one framework and then switch a year later or something but uh i mean it's a legitimate choice you know but you know don't stress too much about it just as long as you're getting better with with coding like you'll learn these skills that help you pick up anything you know more quickly okay let me i'm going to write down where i have left off in the chat and we're going to do some more coding so let's find i leave off okay let me know what you all think about me streaming this late i probably can't do this every day but um you know i'm always trying to figure out what time of the day is the best to work with everybody's time zones i know this is like really late or really early in the morning for those of you in in india and in that time zone uh so this this may not be the best and then for a lot of you you know this is probably dinner time you're maybe doing your commute home i mean if that's the case you're not even watching you know but if you're gonna if you watch the recording of this later so uh do let me know how this works out for you i mean we have about an average amount of viewers maybe a little less than we had the last couple of streams but so it seems like it is working out but let's go we'll start this pomodoro session see how i've broken things because we don't have this get top coordinate um and that should be in where am i getting that from do i have a utils folder yeah nope where's my components gigatop coordinate okay wow hmm okay you know what let me bring over i'm going to create this component and we're going to import it so i kind of think this should be in our utils folder in my other project it was just in the regular component folder but i think it makes more sense here so let's make a new file and let's call this get top coordinate dot js and i'm going to copy and paste everything that we need okay so one thing that we don't have right now is low dash map values so i now i know for sure that i didn't write this because i usually don't pull in low dash stuff if i'm going to map values i just i use you know.map um but i don't really want to get into refactoring this right now so i am going to bring in uh low dash map values so um sorry i'm gonna do yarn add blow dash and it's not gonna be slash is it it's gonna be let me look up i can't remember what the uh yeah something gets dot yes it'll be low dash dot map values and actually is it all lowercase i think it is um and then we will have to change missions dot js to bring in our get top coordinate from so let's go um you two okay all right let's see if that fixes our error key is not defined where do we have this yes all right so now it's just a matter of figuring out all those things that i brought in that aren't really uh that aren't really gonna work so let's check out where i brought in key yep there we go um yeah and we don't need we don't need a key right now because we aren't going to be mapping over this but i would like to have more than one li so let's figure this out active section equals key and active maybe we will need a key um scroll to item title item let's figure out what we're naming this um and then we don't have title so instead of title we're just gonna make right now it'll be spring missions for now and class name active section equals key and active oh i'm sorry why is it all right i'm gonna have to go back and see what i have going on we're just planning god nav before okay so we were using before we were making the key just um a number so whatever number it was so we were mapping over this and we were just using like the iterator as the key so um don't really i'd rather not do that right now so basically we're saying if the active section um which was being passed down i guess from the state of the parent component so if the active section equaled key so it equaled whatever number then we would add the class of active that would give it a border to the left and uh increase the font weight um so we need to change this a bit because we're not going to we're not passing down these values from parent to child component it's all living in the same component for now so we need to change these uh to be named what you know what they ought to be named so let's scroll up a bit and check out our state and see what we've named these this is a little bit different than we usually do state usually we don't use this constructor but that's how we copied it over so we'll just work with it as is right now so it looks like all right so we can do this state active section we can do better positions so we do this state active section and then handle scroll yeah i guess we'll do this handle scroll let's go down here and we'll change this to this state active section and let's see what we're passed just to pass handle scroll hmm next scroll to item okay header um scroll into view so we don't even have a scroll into view we don't have that i'm assuming what's supposed to happen is the handle scroll oh wow um scroll into view is actually um a separate component that's wild sorry i'm just trying to make sense of this of where where this stuff is coming from so we have this scroll into view but i'm pretty sure this does not exist anywhere else in our component no it doesn't let's see hmm that's wild all right so this scroll into view we're not importing anywhere we don't have it anywhere else in this component and we're not actually i don't know what's going on so check this out so in this other um react project we're using scroll in the view here but we're not pulling it in anywhere and it doesn't exist anywhere else uh so if we do you know control fine you know we don't get it so scroll i n t o so it's just there i'm i don't know let's let's see let's do a search in the whole repo for everywhere we're using scrolling to view so we do have a component name scroll into view 10 routes oh wow okay so this then is um a container component wow okay you'll see um okay john hanson says scroll into view is a native uh js command oh okay that makes so much sense i did not know that i'm sorry to everybody who knew that and was thinking like what are you talking about okay um that makes more sense it threw me off that we had a component name this as well but now that i look at it that was capitalized so it definitely wasn't the same thing anyway so i wonder if this will work if we leave it out i'm gonna leave it out for now and um just trying to continue on see if we can get just like a working something working here key is not defined i thought we took key out did i not save it that's not what i wanted is this a different spot let me give it a refresh here and see key is not defined 261 oh yeah because i'm still using key right there um if this state active section equals um i don't i think i'm not gonna i think i'm gonna use title let's see did we have reserve state active section yes i'm not going to put title i'm going to say it does it spring scroll to item spring okay that makes more sense now i'm going to put in another li and we're just going to change this to summer so you see we're hard coding a lot of this we'll probably end up going back to something that's closer to what we originally had uh but for now this will just simplify things oops want this to be capitalized okay all right we need to probably do yeah we need to say this uh dot scroll to item so we're having that red squiggly line there this dot scroll to item section okay all right let's see is prop set headers is not a function okay where are we at then let's find set headers you're right it's not it's going to be this dot set headers hey no error ah we we got one each is not defined you know what are we i bet each is some sort of i bet it's using like low dash each or something like that and that's where we're getting this uh i'm check on my other screen um this other component and see what we're pulling in where did we get this from handle scroll i don't know where we got handle i we got it from the the page we did you know now we did pull in low dash each so let's let's bring this in as here as well and we're going to have to go yarn add couldn't find package low dash each so now what it's called okay i think it's called low dash for each maybe anybody that familiar with lodash uh all right let's do all right you know what i can i think i can probably see where we're getting this from if i just check out the package.json for this uh resource center project so if you want to check out that resource center project on github i pasted the link a little bit earlier i'm going to paste it again for those of you that have come in a bit later on so you can search through this as well right now i'm going to look at this package json file and see i'm hoping we didn't bring in all of blowdash actually i don't see i don't see low dash anywhere how is this possible we're definitely using lowdash in a lot of components but replace ludos underscore imports with required functioning i guess we have all of lodash being imported hmm all right i'm not sure if four each will work but it's worth a shot so let's see no i still did that hmm i guess not all the pieces of load ash are available in different modules i wonder if i could just replace the each with a normal for each hey what is it in hmm all right let me my timer went off so let me do another five minutes and uh go back to the live chat and then i'll come back to this and figure out what's going on so let me scroll to where i left off last time all right frankie says just curious and this may be trivial however is the text going to be justified all right so we were talking about well we can't see now because i messed it up but um that section header um and then the the text in there so i don't know i i haven't really thought about the text in that particular section maybe i'll have to mess around with ways to align the text see which which one looks the best uh frankie says that's totally cool feeding the less affluent yeah it is i think that is one of the really cool things that the university does is to you know encourage students to take part in in a lot of work like that um especially and it really reflects well on the students that they're willing to give up you know spring break that's more like a vacation and a party and instead like use that time to serve other people so that's that's really cool i think they do a lot of good there's gonna be a lot of great content for that section of the website you know great images videos and stories so i i think it's gonna end up being one of like the really kind of the better parts of this site once it's finished all right frankie was given advice on the uh the heading and what to do with it um uh and then said but what do i know play around with it you're the expert and i'm learning um i don't know i'm the expert and uh i definitely value your opinion and your contributions to the stream so uh i don't know i i see it as us helping each other to get better so i mean i hope you can learn from me but um you know i don't want anyone to think that uh that i'm somehow you know the the expert at this you know and we're all just trying to do good work right um and if we can help each other then that's great because we'll all end up doing better work together than we could separately so i always welcome questions and i try my best to help but i also really really appreciate when you all help me uh even if it's just offering your opinion about how something looks that's really really helpful i was talking about shaving my beard earlier and i said that my wife hates the beard and frankie agrees uh with my wife all right so she'll be happy to hear that i know i did um on instagram a while back i did a poll and asking people if i should shave my beard or not and it was overwhelming that everyone wanted me to keep the beard and i joke with my wife and said like you should have recruited people to vote shave it you know so i have to let her know there is somebody else out there that thinks i'm i'm better without the beard frankie also said hopefully you'll feel better soon thank you i appreciate that i'm i'm hoping too it's the doctor asked me yesterday if i wanted an antibiotic prescribed or not and i said yes i know people worry about getting antibiotics prescribed too much and i understand that but i thought you know what i've been sick for a week and i don't have i got a busy week coming up i don't have time to come back to the doctor i don't want to mess with it i was worried i had an ear infection too and it's like i don't want to mess with that i already couldn't hear out of one ear and i'm like you know what i don't want to mess with that i don't know if it could really happen but having an infection that close to your brain kind of freaks me out like i'm not sure if an ear infection can get into your brain but i don't want to i don't want to find out you know so i thought hey we'll just get it um get it taken care of you know what i'm going to do my fiveminute timer went up but i'm going to go through and answer all the questions right now and um then i'm gonna see what time it is and how tired i feel and that'll determine whether or not i we we have time to finish this component we might just do part two tomorrow and finish the component then i kind of think at this point if i just installed all of lodash that would solve the problem um so we'll see maybe maybe i'll do that but there may be other problems right after that so i i don't really know if this is something that i can get working in in just a few minutes and hey i have a spam caller calling me right now uh okay so let me keep going uh rohit says uh use the bootstrap scrolls fire or build your own um yeah well we're trying to build our own here um and this i guess is partly my problem you know how i like to do things i don't like to prepare i like to just show you like in reality what happens when i try to do uh you know something uh at work so i didn't take time beforehand to check out that other repo and see and i didn't remember how much work was involved in making this happen the last time so i underestimated the amount of time it would take so i i assumed that i could do this in one stream but i think it's gonna have to be a two stream thing so um yeah so i guess uh at the beginning of the stream maybe i was a little bit uh optimistic about how this would go but i i looking through this i i definitely think there's some refactoring that can happen to do this um a little bit more simply so maybe we'll maybe we'll get into that tomorrow but i always like to make something work first before i worry about refactoring you know because that's the most important part like the user doesn't care what your code looks like um you want to get it to work at some point you definitely want it to look good and if you have time to do both then definitely do both but um i'm trying to keep the user in mind first uh and then you know i always you know can go back later and do it i don't always do it but i could do it all right so adrian has a question how to find an internship with only basics of react what website should i look at um you know what i don't really know of any websites for internships uh does anyone know of any internship websites i know there are definitely good internships out there and some of the bigger tech companies actually pay really well for interns i've i've seen some things online they claim that um interns at you know facebook and google actually make more than i do um which is is pretty cool but i'm i don't know where those are listed at i mean probably somewhere on the sites for those companies but it'd be nicer if you go to one place and find everything listed from lots of different companies unfortunately i don't i don't know of a site like that if anybody knows something like that please put it in the uh in the live chat uh frankie did say be proactive send your email out or go directly to the companies that's that's definitely good advice frankie's been emailing all day that's the that's the way to do it frankie that's i mean you got to be proactive about that okay don xavier says that this is actually a good time for streaming right after dinner okay cool uh destroyer of world says what's the name of the color scheme um what is it seti that's it uh seti that's my i'm assuming you're asking about my uh visual studio code scheme so it's the seti for for the text and for the ui all right john hanson says could handle scroll just keep track of unchanged values of scroll y uh john says sorry not much experience on my part with low dash all right let's let's check it out uh let's see handle scroll could handle scroll just keep track of on change i used to scroll hmm yeah there's gotta be a better way we can do this all right i'm gonna think sorry i said i was gonna get through the live chat first let me i'm gonna stop myself let's get to the live chat first um let's see let me see oh it looks like something happened with the stream because we dropped yeah we dropped a lot of users i mean it's entirely possible that uh most of you just got bored with me but it it looks like i missed it but something happened and um the stream data was like terrible for a second and then it got better so i apologize if the stream cut out um let's see all right let me know if if you all can see yeah actually i i see the point where everything just just totally dropped off all right sorry i didn't notice that at the time uh yeah let me know if y'all can see and hear me right now uh i'm down to the last question in the chat though um dinanji says hey jesse nice to see you right back i missed these sessions they actually helped me in my last terms uh computer science project awesome i'm really glad that they were they were helpful to you um yeah definitely i'm back uh i want to try to stream more regularly now and so i've taken some steps to make that happen more so i've got the new webcam and i think it'll make it easier for me to stream at home uh because the i was just worried about the quality of streaming with a laptop in my lap of it kind of shaking and getting people motion sick um so um hopefully i can i can be back and i would like last week i just wasn't feeling well when i don't feel i don't exercise i feel more depressed i just don't feel like doing much so um that's also part of the reason why i wasn't streaming so much uh last week so i'm gonna do my best to keep up with my health my exercise and my mental health so that i can keep doing streams for you all and do good quality streams um let's see all right so i'm at the bottom of the chat it looks like i'm still not sure about the video quality uh i didn't i didn't get any response if in terms of if y'all can can see and hear me anymore and we're still at a low count for viewers so i'm gonna i'm gonna be on the safe side and assume that there is something going on with the stream and so i'm gonna stop working on this right now uh i'll i'll probably commit what we have here so that you all can check it out if you want even though it's not working and then we'll pick up with this sometime tomorrow uh and hopefully get it working then um so let's just uh let me just commit this now so i don't forget so we're gonna do a git status we're gonna see what what we have here lots of stuff um and then we'll do a git add we'll add everything and let's do yarn you're in cm and we're gonna do feature and let's say add functions in markup for scroll spy nav to to mission page actually now i think about it i probably shouldn't have changed that i shouldn't have said mission page because i think we have a mission page for mission statement uh what just happened oh it's not gonna let me use this reps huh all right uh so let me let me get rid of some of these i'm just gonna comment some stuff out here that's giving us errors right now actually let's just comment out a lot of what what we just added because really it doesn't work i just want it to be in there so i can you know have it available um for me to load on my laptop so let's grab uh yeah i'm assuming this section's not gonna work oops normally i do not recommend just commenting this much code out but uh i do i want this committed um just don't have time right now to make it work because i'm most likely going to be working from home tomorrow on a different machine okay um all right okay cool so we brought this back no errors this time um let's go get let's go with the yarn cm and then we'll give it a retry flag so we won't have to type everything in again no why is it making me type it in again did i need two flags all right there we go no still have more errors on throttle is defined but never used like throttle slice headers in each okay all right hopefully this goes a little better all right this unit test went pretty quickly that's good news and then tess yes all right wonderful good push this and this might have been a better idea to do on a uh on a branch on a side branch instead of master oh well um okay cool okay frankie just said cool so uh it looks like something's still working all right so a lot of stuff's been commented out but it's all um available on github so you can check it out if you want to if anybody wants to take a shot at trying to make some of this work feel free uh do not feel obligated to do anything but if you're interested you know hey pull requests are always welcome and we're going to tackle this tomorrow i'll tell you what at this point i'm trying to decide between make what we have work or just completely redo it from scratch i'm not sure what i want to do i this is kind of a problem that i think would be really cool to try to do from scratch especially on a stream and figure it out i don't know but realistically like is it worth it to for that time i'm not sure what would take longer at this point so it's possible that might happen but for now it's after 6 p.m where i'm at i bet my wife's wondering where i am so i'm gonna go thank you all so much for watching i'm really sorry about whatever happened in the stream uh when everything dropped off um thanks for those of you that hung in there thank you thanks for all the advice uh i will do my best to be back for a stream tomorrow until then have a wonderful day
