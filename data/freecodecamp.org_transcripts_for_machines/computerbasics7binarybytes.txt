hi I'm Brianna with free code camp and today we're going to be talking about the very most basic level the computers can understand other languages like JavaScript the most basic thing like we've already talked about is a bit up or down 1 or 0 on top of that we've got the biked 8 bit put together all letters numbers and symbols can be broken down into bytes that the computer can understand the most basic level so that means all of the letters and symbols that you're using in your JavaScript can be translated into byte now there are a lot of languages that the computer uses at the most basic levels to run just the operating system but what I want you to get away from this lesson is that everything in your computer boils down to binary bytes
