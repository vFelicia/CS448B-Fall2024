thank you do you want me to do some testings oh we're live all right hey everybody welcome to the free code camp 2018 top contributors party in dublin yeah here we have amazing people from all around europe and africa thank you everybody for coming out it's great uh and we're thrilled to welcome you all and to celebrate your many contributions to the freco camp open source community and to your own city's local developer communities so many of you are so critical in helping people in your communities realize that they can become developers and giving them actionable advice as to how they can do that so i just want to give a big round of applause for everybody here yeah all right well uh we're going to be streaming for the next three hours or so uh two hours and 45 minutes we started a little late thanks for your patience everybody who's tuning in um and it should be really exciting we'll talk about a lot of exciting things before we get started i have some very quick announcements uh things that are coming up very soon that i think everybody who's interested in free code camp should know first of all just like last year when free co camp participated in hacktoberfest and hacktoberfest is the month of october it's a big push to get people to contribute to open source last year free code camps guide was the number one most contributed to open source repo as part of hacktoberfest and since then the the repo's gotten 700 7 000 7 000 pull requests yeah so i'll be completely candid it was a lot more than we were ready for and we're still closing all the way like we're back to like october 25th we've been working backward but if you made pull requests back in october don't worry we're gonna get to those soon and we are going to get that all the way down we're working very hard to do that and we're going to make it much easier to contribute to free code camp in october 2018 for the hacktoberfest so the way we're doing that is we're taking a lot of the existing repositories we've got learn we've got curriculum we've got the free codecamp slash recoding at the main repository and then we've got the guide we're working to unify these repos into a single repository that will make it easier for everybody to get the local freeco camp running and to put him on the spot i'd like for stuart to come up and say a few quick words about that let's give it up for stuart stewart taylor he's he's from right just uh three hours away from here near belfast oh yeah so um the idea that the current situation of contributing free code camp is uh if you wanted to have the curricular map up and running and uh that's really sorry yeah so the curricular map if you wanted the curriculum and you want to interact with the server um locally you have to have at least two command prompts open so the idea is we're gonna have just one command that will run the curriculum app which is learn.3.com.org we're going to have the api server running as well and you'll be able to once again edit the curriculum and see the changes live in your browser locally so so hopefully that'll make it a lot easier for everybody to contribute to and we are looking forward to your pull requests thank you so yes it will be much easier and our efforts will be focused on a single repository this oktoberfest the core freecodecamp repository which should simplify like we'll have a single contributing.md file that has instructions ideally we'll have a single script that bootstraps your local environment so that you've got your database running and you've got your npm install taken care of and so you're not having to click back and forth and input a whole bunch of commands yourself so that way it will just be much easier to to do the first step to contributing to open source which is cloning the repo and getting it running locally so we're very excited about that effort a couple other announcements since you are watching this on the youtube channel according to like the youtube analytics we looked at free code camp is now the fastest growing programming youtube channel yeah and we're getting about 50 000 new subscribers a month so if if you see like a little subscribe button and it's like red and it doesn't it's not it should be gray and it should say subscribed so just click it and it should do that and you can turn on the little bell thing too and that'll notify you when when we publish new videos which is almost every day we've been publishing comprehensive indepth tutorials on java c plus plus we recently published uh kind of an anthology video by brianna who's here who who flew in uh from berlin today and it it covers basically how computers work how networks work how how the internet works it covers all that in a nice 25 minute very concise video but we also have videos that are you know eight nine hours long that go into depth and show you how to build full projects and bootstrap developer environments for you know everything from csharp to java to node.js and ruby on rails and things like that so we're going to continue to publish incredible comprehensive substantial tutorials all of which will be completely free we're not showing any commercials if you create compelling videos about programming and you're interested we would love to help more people see your instagram content your videos so just reach out to us and we can make that happen but for us we want to put as many amazing videos on youtube as we can so we're here in dublin we're at i've got a cool sign for it the huckle tree which is a really cool hipster name and uh it has a hashtag i just noticed that so this is a very cool venue um and they've been really cool and cooperative when you have to wire money from america and coordinate catering and all that stuff through email it can be challenging but i just want to do a shout out to the huckle tree for being very uh helpful and and uh having this beautiful venue that has lots of irish tea which is like super caffeinated kind of english breakfast tea that i've been drinking all night to counter the jet lag um so we're gonna go in a big circle we've got a lot of people here and everyone can take a moment to introduce themselves and where they're from and what they do for the free coke camp community and the first person we're gonna hear from is teemo aka systematic he has contributed so much to the free code camp guide anyway i'll let you introduce yourself thank you yeah my name is stevo i am from the netherlands from veda and and i've contributed a lot to the free code chem guides and the free curriculum repository as well um i haven't been contributing that much for the past year but i hope to get back into it more now i got an internship and then i got a job and i had to get used to it i'm stuart and i am a developer for free code camp everything i do every day is for freak out it's good i like it i'm ben i'm from just down the road ish in dublin um i am one of the old hats who can choose a free code camp i think i'm still number six in the repo so i need to uh get that pushed up again um again another person who's got life in the bit in the way but i'm hoping to get back on it this year see ya hi everyone i'm sam um i started by writing a couple of articles and sent one of them to quincy who i was just asking for some advice he said that's brilliant and i actually stuck it on the free code camp medium publication since then i've written more and more articles and trying to give tutorials to the kind of people that want to get into writing code and possibly taking up as a career hey guys i'm jonathan i'm from belfast northern ireland and uh i haven't been too active the last year but um mostly contributing to the code base and some of the guide as well so hello my name is pete i'm a data scientist based in london and i write and help edit the medium publication for free code camp hi i'm matt i'm a software developer also in london and i organise the london freako camp meetups hi i'm gergai from hungary and i wrote articles to the fico medium publications hi i'm david kopal from czech republic i live in pardubitsa and i write articles to free code cam publications mainly about javascript and now in re about reason mls so definitely check out reason ml hi i'm alefteria i'm from greece i know it's difficult name to be pronunciated and i'm making uh youtube videos so i'm honored that free concum has published some of my videos hi i'm evides from portugal i was a civil engineering and in six months i've rebooted my career and nowadays i'm a remote developer working from portugal to the netherlands in react and redux hi i'm richard sitolo i'm from south africa johannesburg i and with others organize meetups from johannesburg and i'm a software developer and thanks to free code cam's curriculum i i've managed to you know break into the industry which i um you know at the beginning i thought was impossible to do um but yeah i'm very grateful to quincy and the team and meeting all of you guys it's just been fantastic i'm learning a lot and i continue to learn in my daytoday job and yeah i'm looking forward to the rest of the evening yay hi i'm brianna um i have made some videos for free codecam's youtube channel i'm from kansas city originally but now live in berlin as much as i'm grateful to be able to contribute to free code camp i feel like as many people in this room free code camp has really contributed to me into my life and i'm really grateful for that hi i'm andrea i'm a student and my contributions to freecod camp were mainly writing articles on the medium publication and flooding the guides repository of pull requests hi i'm juan for from portugal i started free code camp i changed my career and we decided with eduardo to create a study group in portugal to help other students get there on the way hi good evening i'm johnny from leeds i spend a lot of time helping out beginners on the forum plus i help with a coffee and code that we regularly host here in leeds uh well not here in lee's but back in leeds in england okay thank you hi my name is robert i'm from norway live in austria i started a local fico cam vienna group in austria three years ago there was nothing so i was like okay i'll start it um people started turning up when we started meetup groups i've had monthly meetups for about three years um long story short i've written an article for the publication the talks are recorded since last two years and some of the talks have made it to the youtube channel which is awesome including which is the best part i did a talk with my other coorganizer daniel deutch who couldn't be here tonight but he's saying hi to everyone um we did a talk on going from um learning to code to get your first job as a selftaught developer and it's also on the youtube channel uh so yeah that's the most amazing part like i started free code camp and studying it because i wanted to get my first developer job and i did which is awesome so yeah thanks hi everyone i'm richard from also from leeds where johnny johnny bizzles from the icon that is johnny vissel and i now live in oslo actually i've come from your neck of the woods so i'm one of the local leaders still in leeds uh i'm one of the local leaders in oslo i also won the free code freecodecamp instagram so if you're on instagram that's me who's posting uh and wrote some articles for the medium post and there's a youtube video on the freecodecamp youtube of mine as well um and yeah that's about it that's that's a lot awesome well thank you everybody for coming out here uh you all have given up your time you get up your energy you know free code camp's a small nonprofit we don't have the resources to fly everybody out and put them up in a nice hotel so you all have figured out ways to come out here and stay and that means an incredible amount to me and to the rest of the free cooking community as well so it's wonderful to be here together in dublin and to be able to mingle and to learn more about one another so i think at this point what i'm going to do is i'm going to get some more english tea all right i'm sorry irish tea i dodged the bullet there right that was that's particularly hazardous um so i'm going to get some more irisd and then we can sit down here on this beautiful couch overlooking this beautiful evening um and i'm going to try to talk to as many of you all as possible and just interview you and learn more about you so anybody who wants to be interviewed uh just kind of when you see that an interview is ending come over and jump on the couch i'll talk to you be assertive [Laughter] don't be shy this is this is gonna be so much fun and uh i see tons of people in chat all of it's super supportive thanks everybody for tuning in and uh yeah we'll we'll make a highlight video like we did with the new york city event and then we'll share that with the community too which should be able to so all of you are able to help give people some context into what they can expect striking out on their own uh trying to learn software development and trying to get their first developer job and i think pretty much pretty much everybody here has their career has directly benefited from taking that jump from saying i can learn software development i can do it i can go out i can get a job i can i can freelance uh i can have a career as a software developer and it's just that that faith in yourself and that willingness to reach out to other people in the community and ask for help and then turn around and help other people in the community do the same and that's precisely the spirit we want to capture and convey to the rest of the free cocaine community which at this point is millions of people around the world um many of whom have never coded before and are eager to get started so we can provide a lot of guidance for them so i'll be right over here in just a minute i'm just going to grab some tea i want to have a special thank you for this gentleman whom i'm going to rotate the camera here he's like in shock that i'm thinking him directly there he is look he's got a stylish blazer yeah so i'm worried that might fall over so this is matthew potter uh come over here just stand up here with me matthew uh braved the airlines and the airports coming over and he arrived this morning with me on separate flights in dublin and matthew's going to be doing our av he is a seasoned uh av guy and streamer and he streams regularly on twitch he has a he has a saturday morning cartoon check it out if you ever wake up super early just google you know saturday morning cartoon switch and you'll probably pull up his his stream you can eat some breakfast cereal and watch 90s cartoons like xmen and uh gem and heman and stuff like that right thundercats yeah thundercats is on there it's a lot of stuff so uh matthews thanks so much i'm going to give you the mic while i get the t awesome uh yeah so essentially um what i do with free code camp is um i help out doing uh having a computer that's sitting in a closet that's running headless and stride drives the music channel so i can officially say i have the most content on youtube for free code camp even though nobody's seen my face except for new york in here damn it i'm sorry for your loss i'm also canadian so that's why the story is there um but yeah so we're going to be setting up here momentarily for the interviews uh the camera i'm going to cut it for a quick second because i want to make a minor modification anybody on the stream is probably seeing a bit of a stutter i'm going to fix that i swear i'll do my best um and we're going to make sure that quincy's all teed up because of his flights and if you knew how long it was for him to get here you'd be like oh here's more tea send them tea but yeah we'll be uh we'll be right back and as i did used to say on saturday mornings after these messages we'll be right back hey i'm here with brianna swift let me pop her information up on the screen for you so brianna welcome you flew in uh today from berlin yeah yeah thank you yes thank you we only have one mike so brianna you have been involved with free code camp since basically the beginning maybe you can just give us a high level overview of your involvement with free code camp and and your transition into being a developer yeah so i found free code camp uh while i was an elementary school music teacher i was trying to learn how to code um i love kids i love teaching music but i knew it wasn't a career that i wanted to do forever so i was like what can i learn how to do without having to quit my job and go back to school because i couldn't afford to do that and i thought the people that make the internet are probably the first ones to put all of that information for free on the internet um so i did code academy mostly javascript type stuff and found my way on to free code camp i was really involved on twitter that was my only community because i was really kind of alone while i was learning and went through the free code camp challenges and as soon as i started doing that i started to get involved more in the chat room which there was no forum at that point and started doing some pair programming and streaming that um so free code camp really not only taught me the fundamentals that i needed for you know for development and for software but also gave me a community and a place to you know commiserate almost with how hard it is to learn how to code yeah and so you said you were a teacher can you talk a little bit more about like where you were teaching what you were teaching yeah so i taught elementary school music which was kindergarten through fifth grade um so like you think recorders or like xylophones that kind of thing and it was in central illinois so pretty rural illinois um which i love there's so many things about it i loved um but the thing as i reflect back on it teaching from my perspective in an elementary school music setting was generally going to be the same thing with of course you know some changes over the years but what really drew me to tech is that i can work from home sometimes you can't work from home when you're teaching kindergartners you kind of have to be in the room and um and then it's always changing you know i always am going to be challenged to learn something new in a hurry and i think that's really exciting yeah and so you said early on you were communicating with other developers on twitter and kind of working to build your own community and your own support network there that you could commiserate with and uh how did you discover free code camp because i think it launched right when you found it you're one of the first few people to find it if i remember right i feel like you tweeted at me i think i was tweeting i was like hashtag like women who code women and tech i was just putting anything out there and i could be misremembering but i feel like you tweeted it and you're like hey you should try free code camp and i was like okay and i did and then i stuck with it i got lucky awesome yeah i saw your energy and i don't remember exactly the the tweet i sent but you know at the time i was reaching out to people who i thought would be good um citizens within the community and who seemed really passionate and energetic so yeah so you joined the free code camp community and i remember early on we were doing like these live coding sessions every tuesday and you quickly took kind of charge on those and you would regularly stream yourself coding can you share a little bit about that yeah yeah so i think my first one was with tarakilabyte with nathan um shout out terry kilbyte um and i was super intimidated at first i was like oh everybody's gonna see how dumb i am everybody's gonna see that i don't know what i'm doing i'm gonna you know talk weird which i'm sure i did but it was really addictive not only because it was really motivating so once you're showing up and people are watching you you have to kind of finish what you're doing but also it's so energizing to see that other people can relate and i found out i'll tell people now if you're ever working on something and you can't you're stuck i think the best thing you can do is live stream because and then there's people here like ben and jonathan specifically and nathan tara kilobyte i would be streaming i don't know why people would be watching me because i was a mess i didn't know what i was doing and they would get so frustrated watching me stream that i wasn't doing it right that they would be like just let me can i can i call with you like can i help you do this and i learned so much in those times like the community of developers is so generous with their knowledge everybody wants to help you so instead of feeling intimidated about streaming like oh they're going to think i'm dumb instead it was like they want to help me learn and get better and they really did it was it was really inspiring and helpful and you took a lot of this inspiration and a lot of your early insights as a new developer and you were able to turn around and teach a lot of other people and the main medium we used for that was video you talk about some of your early videos that we put on uh freako camp's youtube channel yeah yeah so those those are fun i think it's a really fun challenge to take something that is thought of as complex and make it sound really simple uh one of my favorite professors dr robinson at umkc when i was studying music said that you should say anything in seven words or less you can't say it in seven words or less you're not saying it well enough and i know my videos are more than seven seven words but applying that concept to things like what is the internet you know like how do how do all these things work i think it's an exciting challenge for me just intellectually but it also makes these really important tech concept concepts so much more approachable and it's like hey you actually can do this these aren't so complex you don't have to go take you know take a fouryear degree to understand this it's a pro you can do this it's okay yeah and based on your videos on youtube and the skills that you were able to build up just learning to code on your own and through different communities you were able to eventually get a job can you talk a little bit about your job and how you got it yeah yes i work at github which is not where i thought i would be working when i started learning to code i'm a trainer so most of the time i'm talking to developers about how to use git and github so regardless of what language they're programming in regardless of what type of projects how big their team is everybody should probably be using version control and git is not the simplest thing to wrap your head around so it's a similar challenge to these computer science concepts like how can we make this simple and approachable um this you know that transition was weird because going from elementary school music teacher to working at github is kind of a jump but but i think working with those videos specifically and saying how can we take these difficult concepts and make them approachable to anybody is something that really primed me for working at github so i think even if somebody's going through free code camp and if you're going through free code camp and you're like i don't know if i necessarily see myself as a fulltime developer that's okay like there are so many places for you that are perfect for you that you might just not know exist like i didn't know that this job existed but i love it right and as a trainer it's a combination of doing development and also figuring out ways to teach different mechanics of git and github and and coding best practices things like that can you what would a typical day for you be like it could go a couple different ways um usually it's so if we break it into one or one of two either i'm on site you know with a customer so somebody that their company uses github their company says our developers need to know how to use git and github so i show up let's talk about getting github for the next couple days and we go through some projects and get everybody as up to speed as possible but on the other days um it's resting from travel or what i really love is working on projects of scaling that kind of knowledge um so a really exciting project that we're working on now is called github learning lab that's itslab.github.com and it's free tutorials on how to use github but it's a probot app so it's a github app that will walk you through the process on github so you don't have to go through like all the different rabbit holes which i know i experienced when i was learning to code you go on one tutorial it links you to another tutorial and that links to this other thing before you know it you're reading about something completely different right we try to keep it native to github so you can stay focused on what you're actually trying to learn so we're working a lot on developing new courses for that and i think it's really exciting awesome and one big change going from an elementary school teacher in illinois is now you work for github and github is primarily a remote focused organization can you describe what that means yeah yeah so most of our the majority of github's employees work remotely so we don't have to show up to any specific office the professional services team that i'm on is 100 remote i actually work from berlin now from my home which is amazing working from home is awesome but also a challenge you have to be really organized and keep your own schedule you have to know what you want to accomplish in a given day you know make sure that things are prioritized but it also gives you so much freedom i can work pretty much distraction free in the hours that work for me of course i still have to work with my team it's i'm the only one well there's two of us now on the training team in europe and the rest of them are in the united states so there's a lot of things to work around but i think free code camp in many ways prepared me for that because we were working really asynchronously we weren't in the same office i think things are moving that way in general and technology yeah and i'm a huge proponent of remote working and asynchronous especially i think the ability to to sleep in and if you if you don't feel like getting up and and then just working later or uh you know really drilling in and using your best judgment about when to to say this is a priority i need to finish this even if it means working through the weekend just having that agency and being able to make those decisions for yourself i think that's a really powerful thing for a 21st century knowledge worker and it really empowers them to manage themselves much more than in a traditional office setting where you have a manager and they have a manager and i mean github has embraced managers i know initially they didn't even really have that much in the way of managers but what are some things that uh so i guess what are some things that excite you most about github in the direction that the organization is going that's an exciting question cause i think there's so many things that i'm excited about um anyone i talk to whether they work at github or they work with github is developing something awesome there are so many amazing projects being built on github so many amazing minds using github as a tool you know as a product as a platform really about where they can share ideas and collaborate i think even someone that you know works at github what i envision for the tool is probably only a small percentage of what it's actually capable of once it's in the hands of the brilliant developers that are going to be using it um so i i don't even know if i can imagine it you know even in my wildest dreams i don't think i could really see what's going to happen um things like you know detroit water project you know things that people are building with open source taking it beyond our traditional understanding of open source software open source education open source you know social you know social growth and how can we work better as a global community it's it's so exciting i hope i hope to see that leveraged soon what are your nearterm goals for both your time at uh your career github and of course just general projects that are of interest to you so learning lab that i mentioned earlier is a big one um i think there's a there's a lot of potential there to just help help people learn how people teach how people understand same as free code camp right open sourcing education making things more accessible to people that i think if somebody wants to learn something they should be able to learn and it's hard it's not that easy and it should be so i think whether it's at github or something greater than that that's all that's where my goals are at awesome well brianna thank you so much for flying in from berlin and uh you recently got married so i hope your husband is thanks to him for letting us borrow you for a weekend and i am excited to see what you do and certainly we would welcome additional videos on getting github and and other concepts as time permits for you to create them because uh i just sent out a video anthology of it's about 25 minutes and it's a we put together uh i think maybe 20 different videos that you've created over the past few years about how computers work how the internet works so everybody be sure to check that out i think that's pretty prominent on the youtube channel and uh be sure to follow brianna on twitter because she she shares a lot of exciting stuff i'm just gonna pop up her twitter information again real quick it's just briannamarie 132. so thank you so much brianna for joining us awesome thank you quincy thanks everybody hi frico camp bye awesome thanks again thank you quincy hey come on over man have a seat yeah good to meet you in person i'm gonna pull up your name and information i've got this great app that matthew potter put together uh yeah so just have to scroll through here these are in alphabetical order by first name yeah um so while i'm doing this why don't you just tell us a little bit about yourself pete sure uh so my name is pete and i'm a data scientist based in london and i uh write for and help edit the medium publication i've been doing that since about october uh last year so almost a year now and it's it's really fun it's really interesting to see what articles we receive and and you know sort of curating them and helping them to you know the high standards we would like to put up yeah and you have written some incredibly exhaustive articles on different aspects of data science and math and machine learning what got you into the field uh so that's a good question so i originally started out as a as a biologist um and i learned a lot of statistics and a lot of uh you know machine learning concepts but it was really interesting to when i began looking into learning the program it was really interesting to see how there's a lot of overlap between some of the skills i'd learnt and some of the skills i wanted to you know start start working with so yeah it's a field of sort of it's it's it's very fast moving it's it's always something new to learn um it's just thing i find really interesting i've always enjoyed statistics yeah so how do you keep on top of all the rapid changes in the field of machine i mean it's probably one of the most dynamic and rapid growing corpus of knowledge how do you stay on top of that um so i think it's constant reading really um i i always look for new articles which come out um a few of my friends work in research as well so i talk to them and hear you know the latest ideas um but mostly it's it's about reading the documentation as well there's a balance between understanding the theory of machine learning and also seeing how it works in practice and i find for example the scikitlearn documentation is really good when it tells you how to use the the you know the techniques but also explains the background of it as well which i find really interesting so scikitlearn i believe is a python library do you do a lot of your data science work in python uh so mostly python yes i also use r um and sql for uh sort of database of data engineering style work uh so yeah i really really like python that's probably my my you know favorite language um i also know a little bit of javascript i started learning that on the free code curriculum um i soon decided that web development i found i found css too tricky that was my problem so yeah i chose to specialize in data science instead well i would encourage you to um look at into data visualization i think you probably i i haven't read every single one of your articles recently but uh i for a long time i was the one who was actually proofreading and editing them before we published and now we've built up this amazing editorial team uh which led by abby and you're one of the major editors there and it's just so amazing having somebody with so much domain expertise who can really go in and take a good look at these articles and kind of fact check them and make sure that they they look good and representative of the state of the field what is your editorial workflow like about how frequently will you check in and find articles that you're interested in editing and publishing i see so we do receive a lot of articles there's always something to work on um i i try and check in daily i actually take my lunch breaks at work as an opportunity to you know see what there is and review some of the articles and if i see one i think i can i can help you know edit and get to you know the standard we want then i'll you know i'll claim that article and in that evening i'll work on it and send it to abi for you know final review and publishing so it's yeah it's good i think the main bulk of the work is is is fact checking just being sure about what what the author's written is is 100 aok to put out and a lot of formatting as well it's one of the things uh i learned from from yourself actually from when i used to publish my articles uh for free when you were running the publication uh the writing style keeping things really you know concise and easy to read there's a lot a lot of our uh readers are international they don't necessarily speak english as a first language so it's very important to make sure what we put out is accessible yeah and what are your favorite types of articles your favorite topics to edit uh it's a good question i i really like uh some more general articles like really sort of like overviews of like why topics i think i think there's a balance as well i mean i really like indepth tutorial articles as well where you can really see you know at the start what you're going to build and follow them along and see you know how something works in practice so yeah i mean i guess it's hard to pick an exact type of article i really like i think yeah we receive a lot of very varied and very interesting articles aside from contributing to free code camp and editing and writing so many great indepth articles on statistics and data science and machine learning what are your goals for the rest of 2018 and 2019 um so the company i'm working up uh we're a startup and we've recently announced and launched some really exciting products we actually teach kids how to code and we produce computer kits and uh we've got some really exciting products coming out so yeah we're looking to ship those and that's that's why i'm working on 2018. awesome and tell me just a little bit more about like do you have like hardware products or yeah yeah so uh we produce the hardware so we have computer kits and a one kit and we also have a software ecosystem as well so people can go in and they can learn to code and they can share their creations on this online community we have uh and it's it's really interesting there's a lot of synergy between you know what i work on for my day job and you know what free cocam is setting out to achieve as well so yeah i really really enjoy spending all my time doing that basically awesome if if people were interested and i'm not sure how whether the product is totally ready for people to go and buy for their schools or for their kids but if they wanted to learn more about the uh the company and and what you all are up to what's the name of the company and where can they find it sure uh we're kano um we're at kano.me and uh we're also in retail in the us so yeah kano dot me okay great kano dot nene dot me okay kno me okay great and thank you again so much for everything you've done for the community it's always a pleasure you know you're you always take such a detailed nuanced look at articles and it really shows and your articles have been so indepth and i i often pull them up and and when people submit articles and i'm like well take a look at this this is a good example of on our of what works on medium and what works with the developer crowd so uh thank you again for kind of setting like really trailblazing and and setting a really good example for other technical writers and developers thank you thanks peter so i'm gonna pop peter's uh information back up okay thank you and we're joined here richie how's your last name pronounced yeah yeah it's easy enough right yeah richie sitoli have a seat richie bring my yes yeah welcome so you're joining us from johannesburg awesome well thank you so much for flying out man i mean that i think you may have traveled i don't know you you may have traveled even farther than i did yeah i think it's um well all in all it was about 14 hours um with about four hours layover and um and at his uh ababa um so yeah but just over 10 hours but it felt like 12 days [Laughter] yeah i was slightly exhausted when i arrived but it was all good it's so far it's been amazing i'm you know i love the atmosphere i love the uh four seasons in one morning which is what we experienced yesterday when i arrived um yeah so like i landed around 6 30 in the morning and on my way here on my way to where um the the guesthouse is um you know it was nice and cloudy it was a little bit cloudy it was comfortable and the clouds opened up it was nice and sunny and then shortly after that it just started raining out of nowhere i was like what the hell what's going on here and then after that it was like massive winds and and stuff um yeah so it's yeah and it's it seems to be like you know people are used to this stuff so yeah i'm just taking it in as as i go along how was your flight it was arduous uh so i woke up at 6 a.m friday morning u.s time then i flew to newark which is like new jersey and then i waited there all day and then i was able to fly to reykjavik in iceland i hope i'm pronouncing that quickly and then uh flew here and i just arrived a few hours ago so i slept on the plane i took a little power nap and it was really funny because matthew potter was joking i was like i was like yeah wake me up before you go and he said oh you want me to wake you up with wake me up before i go go you know the the wham song and he has this super powered laptop i don't know what it is it's incredibly loud so i'm sleeping and all of a sudden i hear jitterbug jitterbug and he starts playing the song really loud and i was like wait i mean it was the perfect way to wake up because i swear like there was like a party outside the room so i am yeah so i just took a shower and i was good to go but now i'm drinking my irish uh tea and that's helping wake me up yeah but uh yeah man thanks so much for flying out so tell us a little bit about what you do you do many things within the free code camp community just give us an overview of some of the things you do yeah so i mean you we met a couple of years back you know free call came was still in its early days and stuff so um so what i do currently is basically run meetups um i'm a core admin um for free call cam johannesburg there's a couple of other guys that some came and went and some are still there but some are dormant some are active when needed when needs be um but i'm generally like you know organize stuff and host the the meetups themselves and it's quite funny and it's very interesting like i mean we've got a community of about 1500 people and we get at least one um someone asking to join like on a daily basis it's just insane which is amazing so which means that you know the word is getting out there and people are recognizing what we're doing and they actually see the value in what we're doing which is fantastic um yeah so like i mean the funny thing is this so you you'll put up like a create an event on facebook and our facebook group so it's free called cam john is back on facebook uh go check it out you know uh we're having our next meet up at the end of this month uh 29th of uh august yeah um anyway so like you'll have a couple of people just like rsvp and they all get all hyped up and excited like yeah i'm gonna do this and then next thing you get like five or eight people to turn up um but it's for me personally like it's it's those sessions that i really appreciate and really enjoy because you sort of like see through um you know like the i don't know how to put it but like it's the people that end up coming eventually coming it's people that are truly passionate and really really believe in you know what free code chem is you know offering is and it sort of like reminds me of of myself like pretty much like two three years ago when i started um i was that guy pretty much like i would rock up and i could be like me and a couple of other people um but like for me it was just you know like just getting in a lot of information getting as much information as possible about you know software development um and as far as i mean you would obviously know that you know the learning never stops right so um so like i really appreciate people that that make it to the to the meetups um and i'll grant it i understand some people cannot you know make it you know they'll have other plans or something comes up and so that sort of thing and so i i get all of that but you know i just shout out and say thank you to the people that constantly come to um to our meetups um and then funny enough i'll tell you just besides about that so i was we had a party at um at my company lost a couple of weeks ago and i mentioned to one of the top guys and i said um i'm going to dublin in a couple of weeks i'm like okay cool like so what are you going to do there and then i obviously had to tell the whole story about free code camp and whatnot and they were like mind blown they're like what why didn't i told you guys but he didn't take me seriously so they were all ecstatic and excited about it and i remember one of the top guys there uh jimmy's like um no dude like seriously when you come back like we don't don't you worry about the next venue you can totally use our office we'll even organize coffee for you guys all right yay so i'm definitely gonna take him out jimmy i'm gonna take you up on that offer okay [Laughter] so yeah now with the community is growing um and we see a lot of people coming in um i mean just trip coming here i'm i met a couple of guys um in in oral timber which is our international airport in joburg um the one guy actually he's he was coming to meet his future colleagues he got a job offer um here in dublin as a backend developer um but so he obviously told him the reason why i was traveling to dublin as well and he was also like like and it's so funny like when i explain the story because i'm so passionate about it but when it finally hits the chord and you see people's eyes they just like dilate for a second then they're like wow that is just amazing like how come i've never heard about this thing so obviously exchange numbers and whatnot and he's like no no i need to get my uh cousin into this thing and that's what i just told you now like i it happens so often i i love telling this story because i truly believe in it i've been in it um i mean it's been like almost three years now right you're one of the earliest cameras yeah and i still feel like looking looking around you and seeing these guys i mean just doing some incredible work and i'm very passionate about it and i just want to see the next free call chem 2.0 or 2.3.0 whatever how far we're going to take this thing right yeah yeah well we're building uh we're building an events platform that'll make it easier for people in johannesburg when they're just using freecodecamp to it'll remind them hey there's an event in uh you know at the nearby office uh where you're having your next event so i i'm optimistic that that will help even more people who are already in johannesburg who uh don't realize that you're having all these inperson events that will help get them involved as well absolutely um yeah i mean it's um so like so it's another aspect of it i mean it's um we were talking about how else uh myself in the evidence we were talking about how else we can contribute like is is this all we can do you know is is that like how do we take it to the next level and i was like my response to that was like that's a very good question brother what do you think and he's over there so he gave me his peace of mind but like for me i think for now is like we need to continue doing what we've been doing because um personally i mean for me the the reason why i believe in this and why i'm still doing what i what i'm doing now is that i see value in this you know i truly believe like this is um one way that we can and i know it sounds very like up in the sky but i really believe like this is one way of actually tackling poverty um and i see people that are frustrated in their jobs uh people that they just you know they just go to work just for the heck of it but they don't enjoy it you know and for me i strongly believe in that like you have to really enjoy what you do and i absolutely love what i'm doing right now and thanks to free code camp and i think the way just back to my original point was that um how to take it forward is first of all we need to keep doing what we're doing you know don't drop the standard and obviously think of other ways um of how we can improve it um whether it's um i don't know like which just maybe writing articles if you would say you were doing like youtube stuff or you hosting meetups um maybe just you know think of other ways of um contributing more or at least getting other people to feel the same passion that you have so that they can also continue and and contribute to the platform in in different ways yeah and if for those of you who are watching who are interested in some ways you can contribute aside from leading local study groups which i think is probably the most important and immediate thing because that way you're able to actively get people in your community reach out to your neighbors and your friends and get them into coding this is a skill that i i encourage everybody to pick up even if you don't envision yourself working as a software engineer at some point in the future these skills are going to be incredibly helpful regardless where your career is so so by running local study groups like you're doing in johannesburg you can really bring a lot of people in just get them some basic exposure and so they even realize that this is a skill they can learn and build up their confidence so i would say some some ways that your community can absolutely help would be uh adding captions and subtitles i know most people uh in south africa speak english but you also have afrikaans and there are other other local languages that some people in your your study group may know that would that would help and uh of course creating more articles and creating creating videos those would all be tremendously helpful no absolutely um and finally mentioned that that not so long ago in fact i think in preparation of the next meetup um a lady commented on a facebook group and the question was um are your meetups uh suitable for um kids and like that caught me off of god because i like you know it's not something that you know someone asked just like that and it was like and i didn't respond immediately i just thought about it for a second i think i probably slept on it i don't remember exactly but my response to her was very simple i said look um if a person who wants to you know come to our meetups as long as they can read and write um you know i think they're good to go and i strongly believe in that i mean you can correct me from if i'm wrong but like i think um there's no age limit when when it comes to learning and specifically software development as long as you know you can look at code and you can read and you can write i strongly believe that you can actually manage to learn and and you know and code so my advice was basically like look um you know maybe just come because she hasn't been to to the meetup i said look just come to our next meetup check it out and if you think it's suitable for your son or daughter you know then you can invite them the for the next meet up and she's like no well that's that's a good answer so hopefully we'll see her at the end of this month um and hopefully we'll see some kids coming up in the uh in you know in the next meetups um but yeah it's um it's just been incredible i mean the last the last year we we've i think we've done more meetups than we have there was a period where we didn't have as many meetups um but then uh i always take cue from from the community from the the the members of the group um so whenever someone says hey when is the next meet up you know quickly jumping like are you interested should we do it and then we just put it together and and that's how we roll um yeah and i i just i'm looking forward to obviously like continuing having like a more uh regular uh credence uh cadence um and yeah because and also another request that came in in one of our last uh meetups was one of the members said they would like to have more technical uh meetup so i think with um with the offer that i got from my community to to have the next meetup in in the offices that will give us the the space and the environment for you know for something like that to happen so i'm looking forward to that yeah awesome well congratulations on getting your company on board is like a venue sponsor and yeah i totally agree i think if kids are mature enough to come preco camp as a community is really aimed at adults primarily there are other great initiatives like code.org khan academy and especially coder dojo i love what coder dojo is doing and hack club is another good one that's focused at the high school level but but we aim to make these events totally uh acceptable for kids and we want to keep them you know professional and friendly and welcoming so yeah absolutely if if somebody has a kid and that they're confident their cake will have a good time and get a lot out of it i would encourage them to bring it richie it's been such a pleasure man thank you so much for flying out here congratulations on all your recent achievements your job and how you're leading the community it's amazing and i think you're really setting an example for so many people around the world who want to create local study groups and and help people in their communities learn to code it's it's only a pleasure quincy like i've i mean we i'm just was thinking the other day like we we made like just a couple of years ago and it's you know our relationship has grown and the community has grown and i've i love everything that um uh yourself and the team have been doing and yeah i'm looking forward to the future and to frequent camp thanks again thank you so much brother yeah likewise bring it in hey hey quincy hey pleasure absolutely well david you are a prolific uh writer among other things and i think you have a very interesting background can you tell the audience a little bit about yourself and how you got into coding and writing about code okay first of all quincy i'm really grateful to you that you created free code chem because i think it was really the major helper for me to switch my careers because as you mentioned i was working as a lawyer i have a law degree and then i was working as a lawyer for two years but then i got eventually a little bit frustrated and i was wondering what to do next so i was checking online courses and stuff and funny thing first i checked some harvard course about cooking about molecular gastronomy and i spent like three months doing that but i said to me okay i cannot be cooked because i'm sweating and in the kitchen there's a lot of hot in here so i couldn't cook so i tried to we're watching for something else and then i find and first some course on udemy about uh programming css html and javascript and i tried that but then it was just a tutorial you know building things that other people built so it was kind of it was great i got motivated but it was just the first level and then i discovered free code camp and those algorithms and it was basically a different dimension for me because before i was just creating stuff according to tutorials but with the with the algorithms i need to really understand and at first i got really frustrated because i think oh my god it's so difficult i cannot be developer but then it really just it was better and better and finally i got really confident and really i started learning to code during the weekends and on the evenings and it eventually took me seven months to switch from a lawyer to or just coding into on the weekends and the night so i'm really grateful for free coach cam because it really motivated me to see all the people doing the same thing that's all though so why i decide for contributing for recode camp by writing articles because you know a free code camp community helped me to become developer and i also wanted to contribute to it by by showing people concepts that were difficult for me so i try to like describe them in a way that are more understandable for me and in a way that i want them to be to see them when i learned them because there were no resources before yeah and that's i think the part of my story and maybe just the the main thing what i decided to change switch the careers was that as a lawyer i didn't see the results of my work and as a as a programmer i mean you write console.log and you see the result it's it's so motivating you just write code and you see the result i love this and this is why i love programming yeah with programming there's a very tight feedback loop you can at any point you can see what the effect is you can push an application live and look at your analytics and see people are using it how people are using it it's it's unlike any other field really i mean you could argue that in teaching you can see you know the students faces and and whether they're comprehending things and see them turn around and apply but there are very few fields where you can immediately get so much feedback on your work i just want to underscore the magnitude of your accomplishment david because you said in seven months just studying nights and weekends while working as a lawyer time you were able to transition into tech and tell us a little bit about what you're doing now okay now i work as a javascript developer for the for the uh digital agency in prague or blueberry and i'm doing typical performance stuff i'm working with react most of the time and now i will basically maybe start with a view as well so i'm really looking forward to it because i never do it and i'm also pretty excited about reason ml yeah and i'm pretty excited that uh in my company we have internal projects where you can try different technologies and we were also able to do it in a company and build our recent application called uh called planning poker about scrum where you do planning poker and about application for that so it was really interesting and um and another thing i love about programming is that is the the way how it progresses i mean when i started programming there was jquery and angular okay that's some react i know what it is and basically it was so fast and now i like how it's moving forward there i mean my todo list it's so long and i never be able to like to try all the technologies but i love all the people who love what they do and you can learn from them so i maybe i just uh and you ask what i do yeah also right as i mentioned blog posts uh for medium publications and it will help me it helped me it helps me and the audience is because for me when i code something you know where you code something you basically don't care about anything you just said okay it works so that's a good but when you write a blog post about it you need to like really understand you will need to go deeper and eventually after that i even start going to conferences and speak about programming and it really helps me even more because at a conference you have qa right q a people might ask you and this like most stressful thing for the first time because you need to go really deep because people might ask you different questions so i know what i really love about all these stuff record camera conferences that you that i learned something like i share with us and the thing that i just learned it it makes i think more approachable for other people because i'm on this level uh they were there on the level i were before so i'm not that like not that on a high level so i like can understand what they need to how they need to learn so that's why i'm doing it yeah that's great so essentially what you're doing by writing these articles and giving talks at conferences is you're almost over training to make sure you really have mastered something so well that you can explain it and it's interesting because we were just talking with brianna a minute ago and she said you don't really understand something until you can explain it in like seven words and it's absolutely true because so much often when i write article there are i just got stuck and i was thinking why why is it working i mean why why and really forces you because you need to understand to to some person who doesn't know so so many stuff like you do because you are into the topic you truly and write it in the understandable way that's why i think it's like challenging for you to learning new technology because sometimes there are not enough resources and these resources are often right by people who are really good at it but sometimes for you as a beginner it's more challenging so that's why i'm trying to write it for like most approachable as i can that's why i'm kind of perfectionist so like when i write article okay i write it it's not complicated but i spend so much time just to reading it we're reading it sending to my colleagues for proofreading it's like really the right wording article is not the most difficult part the difficult part is just to make it approachable for people coming from different levels of their knowledge well thank you so much david for all your amazing articles that you've contributed and i've enjoyed reading so much so many of them and of course i'm very inspired by your just rapid transition from working as a lawyer uh to working as a as a developer and working with all these cutting edge uh tools you know reason ml very exciting stuff working you said you're getting ready to learn some view so we hope that you'll continue to write these amazing articles yeah i'm looking forward i i was also playing with idea to make some screencasts and i was discussing with with other people here and i think it will be really useful and again again quincy thank you very much for the free codec because it makes really difference for people like on the whole planet i think well thank you so much that means so much to me and i hope you have a wonderful time in dublin are you gonna are you gonna come run with us tomorrow i hope so i i have my running shoes running a running tshirt and my half of my luggage is just a running stuff so i guess i should because i just brought so much stuff with me well great hopefully it'll be nice and cool here uh the weather is very dynamic in dublin tomorrow it should be nicer i just checked the weather and it should be like not so much clouds or too many clouds so all right well great i'm looking forward to running around phoenix park with you tomorrow me too cheers likewise thanks again david yeah oh perfect hey james phillips thank you doing my best and next we have a man whom i have worked very closely with for years every still thank you so much for making it out here and perhaps you can just give us i'll give you a very quick introduction so evaristo has basically been leading free code camp's data science effort he is one of the most prominent people in the data science chat room on gitter and he's done a number of different analyses both on medium and on kaggle of different data sets we've we've made public um of course when we make data sets public we're very responsible about the disclosure and you know cognizant of privacy concerns and things like that so we have these huge public data sets and every so has analyzed them extensively thank you for joining us every so yeah no not everything i'm eduardo edward i'm sorry yeah yeah i'm eduardo vidis from portugal i'm sorry i gotta make something you make stuff yeah so tell us a little bit about um i feel so embarrassed yeah um so so tell us a little about uh about what you're working on out in portugal uh eduardo and and you're leading the study group there well i first knew free code camp in the beginning of 2017 and i was a civil engineering and i was not happy with my career i wanted to reboot into into programming and when i'm at free code camp i'm at the right path to start learning how to program i've tried a lot of boot camps without effort but with free code camp it was very very easy to to follow follow up and and at the same time that i was studying i started to motivate people to study with me i started at the same time as juan enrique and together we started the study group in our city and we impulsionated also the starting of the study group in lisbon the capital of portugal and we are doing that effort every week even after we get got our jobs yeah i've rebooted my career in five months studying more or less 10 hours per day but it was nats it was five months and i got from civil engineering to a frontend developer yeah and so eduardo you said within five months you were able to transition from civil engineer to developer just studying on your own yeah yeah correct uh because when i found uh free code camp i found the right pass i i was in a big doubt of what i should study first and what i should study after that and with frequent camp i got the correct path and i followed that path and it worked very well i also got a mentor uh thank you miguel coque for supporting me uh uh mentor is uh he was very helpful in in my study um and i got the job very quick with with this help and with the help of free code yeah yeah so you even though you've gotten a fulltime job and and you've made the successful transition you're still giving back to the community and you're still helping run the local study group talk talk a little bit about the the group and how you how your leadership of it yeah of course we have we have two main events we have one event that we call the social event uh where where we try to join the local community of senior programmers with the students and we have a second event called the study group where we focus just on solving challenges uh and it's working great it's amazing how people are are motivating and are studying and are growing with us step by step and when they are ready to enter in the in in the market we have jobs for them really yeah um it's it's great it's amazing yeah so uh when you say people are able to enter the job market how many people within your study group have gotten developer jobs do you think yeah first quincy let me tell you that we are in the south of portugal so it's a small town like 50 000 inhabitants and in the last year we got five five developers ready to start working and they started working so i think it's a nice percentage so basically one out of 10 000 people in your town has gotten a developer job thanks largely to your efforts and your community outreach also after that i started started writing on medium because i felt the the needs to contribute more to free code camp uh so i started to to write about react that's the the main area in which i'm working nowadays yeah well thank you for writing these articles so in portugal of course you speak portuguese and and it's also a huge language in brazil and brazil is i think the third largest country for free cocamp in terms of total number of people who who use it and frequently i talk to developers from portugal from brazil and other portuguese speaking countries and they have there's definitely a strong desire to have to be able to read about technical concepts in their native portuguese and since you've already started writing articles i'm just going to put this out there eduardo would you be interested at some point in potentially writing articles about technology in portuguese yeah yeah of course totally agree with that uh i want to to to start writing in portuguese for the big communities that we have because portuguese is the fifth most spoke spoke language in the world but at the same time i feel the need to motivate people to learn english because when you start working in a remote team or something like that you need to interact with people from all over the world so uh in spite of having uh a way to learn in portuguese you also need to train your english skills i think that that's very that's important to train your english skills of the people uh in your study group that are getting jobs how many of them are getting jobs at local companies versus i don't know how many uh multinational corporations and have like branches there but what would you say the ratio of like local employers and small businesses versus multinational employers okay uh basically portugal is very trendy now so i have some difficulty to do this this this calculus but i can say that three in two got remote jobs in the north of europe um so two are working locally but basically that two local companies are startups that are based on germany or in the netherlands or in sweden so i think we can speak of 100 of international internationalization that's great well what are some of your goals now that you've gotten a developer job you've you've gotten this community running you've proven out the notion that people can come into your community they can learn to code you will help them build up their skills help them build up their network and that they can get jobs now that you've proven that and you have this proven path to help people in your community get developer jobs what are your goals for the near future well for the near future i have to do i have two main goals one is to become a senior developer in my team contributing more for the for the future of the architecture in the web application uh but in a second plan not less important than the first i want to continue thriving and to motivate people uh to learn to how to program on frequent camp i will say i'm a free code camp evangelist because i really believe in free code camp because i've tried a lot of other boot camps and i didn't have uh success and i think free code campf as the the main ingredients uh to turn you into a successful programmer in less than one year yeah so i think people should try free code camp they should join they should try the challenge they they need to speak with people and to surpass the challenges and learn how to program they have everything every tool they need it's on their hands at the first moment they sign up to free all right well thank you so much eduardo for joining us thank you very much i'm sorry for my english i'm not a native speaker your english is excellent thank you very much thank you very much mr larson you're great yeah it was nice to meet you absolutely i'll see i'll see you are you gonna come run with us tomorrow of course all right well we'll have fun running tomorrow yeah all right awkward fist bump all right next robert have a seat man thank you thank you welcome yeah so uh thank you for flying in from vienna yeah you lead the free cocaine vienna group along with daniel deutsch who who couldn't make it uh he's a student uh tell us a little bit about the origins of free cocamp vienna which i think you said is about three years old now yeah it is it is um yeah it's like there's so much to say but um it basically started i i now have a developer job and i mainly attribute that to free cocap which is awesome and when i started as a student shortly after there's this there was i think it still is but this is getting started guide and you're getting courage to check up your local group there was no local group but there was a nice guide saying if there is no local group start a facebook group this is how you do it so i did and then no one came so i asked my wife to join i invited her we were two then like this is probably just in the span of a couple of days there were still no more people joining so i got impatient so i think i texted you on gitter or something i was like i don't know if quincy larson will reply to me but he replied and it was awesome and i was asking can i start a meetup.com group because i knew meetups from my city there's a quite a bit of them thinking that that's the way i could get more people involved because i wanted to meet other students right um and then i did that and you replied like yeah of course sure just keep in mind it cost money and stuff and i was like that's fine so that's basically how it started in the format that we have now um we've been going almost three years like this i think november or december and we basically have it where i always try to say that this is the local group for frequent vienna this is a meetup but if anyone wants to help in any way you know i'm just here now helping it to grow starting and keep it going so we have a format normally now of one or two talks and some group coding or some group discussion whatever people want to do just to keep a monthly thing where people can meet other students which is yeah what i've been doing yeah awesome and so it sounds like you have a very supportive wife who's how has that helped you because i also benefit from an incredibly supportive wife jade i don't know if you're watching thanks uh and i none of the free code camp would be possible if uh if jade hadn't believed in me and let me take an extended uh departure from working fulltime so i could so i could build free code camp and start trying to try to build up the initial community um so talk a little bit about your your relationship with your wife and how is she learning to code as well no no yeah i think she could benefit from learning i don't i think she doesn't know what she's missing out on but yeah she's been super supportive um in the beginning there um maybe we can touch a little bit on because i used to work a longer career of all sorts of jobs from theater stagehand to customer service to sales to you know selling newspapers on the phone selling software i was working actually here in dublin for two years in xerox and also in oracle but mainly support or like phone sales so i was exposed to technology and i've always loved computers since young age but for some reason i figured programming was harder than i like i imagined it to be this really hard thing so long story short then back to i was starting a um agency kind of company with a with a friend while working full time so in my spare time and my wife is so supportive so um when she was watching tv or series i was sitting on my computer trying to make some business happen right and i did that before i learned to code with wordpress sites and themes and prepaid you know themes and plugins and stuff and that led eventually to me being curious we are doing shared hosting can i do the hosting myself and we have a better margin so i that's for the first time i get exposed to online courses like treehouse and linux academy where i was realizing it's hard easier than i thought to learn these technical skills that i was interested in but a bit afraid of so that led to me discovering that oh i should probably try and do this with the programming as well again and uh it really clicked with me but it wasn't until i really was like oh i can do this i got the belief that this is not as hard as i thought but it was mainly via free code campus sort of my base or like my goto place for learning that i kind of got the ball rolling and really got into learning and through all of this my wife has been super supportive because as i said you know like she would do leicester's leisure stuff at the evening and i would you know be on social doing my stuff which works but it can only work for that long kind of you have to find a balance yeah yeah well i wasn't aware that you'd had such a whining career and and done so many different things and it's great that you've worked here in dublin uh so it sounds like are you originally from vienna i'm i'm from norway um i worked here in dublin and that's where i met my now wife she's austrian so we moved to norway we got we established a family and then we moved to vienna her home city like five years ago yeah wow so it sounds like you all have really benefited from the eu's like ability to fluidly move between countries because you've been moving a lot yeah yeah for sure for sure no way it's not in the eu we're in this collaboration like switzerland and uh us and i can't remember luxembourg i think but it makes it basically i can only remember the norwegian one efta but it's something like that eeaa or whatever oh okay yeah i thought it was when i was in customs yeah it's a like special line for people who are in the eu uh switzerland ch yeah and then like the eea yeah i think that's what it is yeah but that's really nice because basically that and schengen so that the passport agreement makes it so it's really easy to visit anything in europe and it's really easy depending on the country to get like a work workers license or just the extended visa you don't even have to apply often so that's nice and yeah so if you're curious about like working abroad then europe europeans should like more europeans should avail of that yeah yeah so now that you're leading the study group what are some of your goals for free co camp vienna and for your own personal career for 2019. yeah oh that's nice um i'm i'm really grateful that i have daniel deutsch with me he's been i think about two years my coorganizer and cohost i also run two other meetups now over a year one is for vue.js and one is for golang which because i love this interjection of meeting people getting to know them help them if i can and this like mix of people in code which is awesome um so i know that even if i take a break or slow down free cold camp vienna is still going to be there because daniel deutsch is just running the show and it's seamlessly it's perfect with the other meetups i'm slowing down now because um i think what i want to happen in let's say 2019 to put a number on it or yeah is to switch a little bit my career from pure developer to doing more developer relations in one form with another my dream future would be where i get to do professionally what i do um as a hobby you know with the meetups so if i can be more you know conferences traveling online forums doing community work and that be the focus of my um yeah professional career that's where i want to navigate towards and but i still want to do some coding even if it's like demos or prototyping or preparing technical talks and stuff like this yeah awesome well thank you so much for flying out to dublin and it's such a pleasure to finally meet you in person you and i have corresponded for years so it's great to finally meet you and go out on the rooftop and take a selfie together yeah yeah yeah we did and i want to thank you personally like this has been so awesome the fact that you started free code camp and one person can start something that trickles down to now this huge movement which it is with all these channels i like i find it so amazing and inspiring you're a true inspiration you are thanks thank you but it would be nothing without the help of so many amazing contributors like yourself so thanks again for everything you're doing uh to inspire developers around the world and especially in vienna take care all right thanks hey hey welcome have a seat thank you so elephania am i pronouncing your name correctly yeah you do lift there yet ellie all right well i i like your entire name it's just so cool and and distinctive and yeah actually in my country means freedom so yeah it's cool like freedom yeah great well elephant thank you so much for flying in from greece you are a very prominent person in the freco camp community especially recently uh you've been live streaming a whole lot of videos you've been creating videos on things like angular it's it's incredibly helpful tell us a little about how you got into tech and how you started deciding to record all this and share all this knowledge okay uh well i wanted to learn and firstly i wanted to learn for me and for myself but i knew that eventually i wanted to find a job and i wanted to be sure that everything i know i can also like go to another person and maybe teach them so i said okay how can i do that so start coding in my computer as always and then i'm going to record these videos and if they're very good then i'm going to upload them so basically that's how i started i wanted to pass this knowledge to other people and make sure that i also know these things that's great and i think it takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there and to record videos about a topic that you yourself or are just learning how did you get the courage to go out there and what was your thought process like because i always wanted to get better i thought that i should start from somewhere i should really start from somewhere because if it's only me that's studying in my own little room then it's not going to be anything i wanted to to pass this knowledge to everyone else and yes i'm still learning i don't know everything in angular but it's something that i like doing so i'm doing it great and your videos have been very popular and we've had so many people who've asked for more content on angular so it's perfect that you started creating these great videos what are some things that you plan to do 2018 is almost over coming into the end of 2018 2019 what do you plan to focus on for the near future in terms of creating videos creating articles and teaching other people about technology i have a few plans on my mind as far as angular is concerned i would like to focus more on angular and angular material so i would like to create some videos based on angularjs and maybe mix it with a material library i would really love to do that but other than that i'm also interested in ux and ui design so i was also thinking to contribute and make some videos in ux and ui design and other than that i also have like some plans about teaching maybe javascript like volunteering and i would love to go in some other conferences that i have in mind and maybe if i could help them and also pass some knowledge i would love to do that um it can be quite scary because as you mentioned i'm still learning and i'm still quite new but i believe that if it's something that you love and it's something you like then you should do it no matter what you seem to have a very strong passion for learning and a desire to improve yourself and expand your horizons tell us a little bit more about your background and how you got to be so adventurous uh well it's true i'm very passionate and i really want to improve myself so when i was 18 um i had to make a decision and just study something in my country in greece you have to give some final exams and i wanted to go into an engineering school i wasn't that good and my exams weren't that good so i didn't really pass but then because my sister was in this university i got an opportunity to pass because she was also there and as soon as i got in i really liked everything but the problem was that you only get the basics from backends like java and some php and some basics on uh printed development like html css and javascript and then i knew that if i wanted to get a job that wasn't enough i had to study on my own and first i found an article on medium and they suggested free code camp so i went there and i at first i didn't know what freak.com was i started doing the first challenges which was about html and css and so i fell in love with it so i continue building yeah yeah but that's the truth because i i continued building and i saw that i could progress and i could learn stuff and i could have some the most important thing was that i could have some of those projects in my portfolio so i also beat the portfolio and i had these challenges and uh it was really awesome yeah well thank you so much elotheria for coming out here from greece and thank you for everything you're doing to encourage people to learn to code i think a lot of people when they watch your videos they are not only they learn a lot but they get really motivated because you're just such an enthusiastic person and i think that really carries through in the videos all right well are you gonna are you gonna come out and run with us tomorrow i don't think so i have plans so with the family they are here with me so yeah okay wow you said your family came here with you my dad and my sister yeah great well what what is something exciting to do that you plan to do while you're in here in dublin well uh tomorrow we are planning on go on a tour in ireland so not only dublin and i'm really looking forward to it because maybe i won't ever have a chance to visit dublin again or even ireland so i really want to go there i like traveling and exploring so it will be a great opportunity for me to do that awesome well we're so excited that you were able to bring your family with you and i hope you have an amazing time exploring ireland thank you thank you very much all right i'm going to pop ella theria's information up on the screen i encourage you to follow her on twitter and we're going to get the next uh interviewee oh great thank you you're very fast all right next uh let's bring him in the the man the main man i am thrilled to finally hang out with you in person we've spent my gosh hundreds of hours so many hours oh ben mcmahon yeah ben is a prolific contributor to free co camp i think i've spent more time pairing with him than pretty much anybody in the free code camp uh community let me let me let me just let me just recount some of the things you worked on so you were you were very heavily involved in the javascript curriculum which pretty much everybody who's watching this has probably tried at some point um you created the challengeomatic which was the tool to make it easier to contribute challenges which we're not actively using anymore but it's an inspiration for what we're building the the challenge dramatic i think yours was the challenge of 5000 name at all oh that was how i just probably not a fan matic take memories why is it one day i'm like it sounds cool yeah well i think this next one's gonna be challengeomatic 5001. perfect that's exactly the very thing should work just start a random high number and keep increasing it yeah that way people will think there have been so many iterations to get us to where it is well tell us a little about yourself you're here in dublin right yes so i am based here i am currently kind of a college student uh detergent my degree is all work placement so i'm currently a working man for a year um in kernel development actually which is a complete pivot from javascript but curl development kernel oh like linux kernel okay i was like girl like the command how much can you really do that kernel development okay so talk a little bit about uh what you're doing with kernel development and where you're working so i'm in arista and there's the networks they've been the same market as cisco and juniper and those guys um mainly what i'm working on is you're most york revolves around you're dealing with you know they're linux boxes but they're links boxes with a lot of network cards which linux you know it works fine with it but it's not you know the first purpose so there are a few tweaks and changes that you made um and yeah that's kind of my day job now at the moment um it's very interesting because i'm learning c and current development and a lot of other concepts all the same time on the job which is an interesting uh take deciding stuff up for about sherlock yeah and so you're doing you you've gone from doing primarily web development which is what you're doing with free code came to really diving many layers of abstraction down i'm on the opposite end of like the spectrum at this stage yeah um no it's something i got a choice when i got the internship there to pick a team when i was going i need to pick something that i know nothing about um interesting that's also how i started free code camp was i tried to help i distinctly remember helping you at like 2 a.m with riding jade five years ago or four years ago now back in the cloud close the streams bring back to all the streams bring back closet streams well i'm happy to report that i no longer live in the bay area in a one bedroom apartment and i actually have an entire house with little kids running around it now so i have a spare bedroom that my inlaws stay in when they visit and i've i can stream from there we should absolutely get on and do a stream at some point there has to be a closet though it's not the same it's not a cloud boat okay so we do have a closet it's just very hot and i'm small what could i say i did my time in the the freako camp closet and now i want to sit in a proper room free close the camp so what are some uh you've been active in the free coaching community you've primarily been focused on your new job and your your internship before that which involved probably an incredible amount of learning are you are you interested in coming back and continuing to contribute to the free co camp community in the near future oh i'm dying to get back uh the problem with working with coding fulltime is you have to you do actually have to live to some degree because these days i'll come home and i'll be like i don't want to write any record i want to go to bed um but yeah i'm hoping to find some time to start getting back into it it takes i want to like block off a week or something to reacquaint myself with the code base and stuff before i dive back in because it's definitely changed and excuse me in the year or so i've been on active yeah for about a year well great well uh stuart's actively working on making the curriculum a lot more accessible of course stewart's only a few hours drive from you if you uh ever want to pair a program in real life which is kind of a clean thing that we used to do back in the day right back in the day so i think we should stop talking about tech and talk about this wonderful city that you call home where we're having this event as far as i know you're the only person i've talked to tonight who lives here i've talked to a few people who've lived here uh for shorter periods of time but what is dublin all about if you had to describe dublin how would you describe it jesus was not prepared for that um god one one word okay one word's tough it doesn't have to be one word i didn't impose that restriction i'm trying to be concise though as well like dublin's such a strange place because it's got like you have google and then you'll have like a pub next door with an old man drinking guinness in it it's kind of got like a foot in both of those worlds uh and it's very interesting culturally from that point of view um it's kind of it's a country that's grown up really fast and it's become really progressive of late um so it's it's a it's a happening place for definite um you can't see it anymore but if you looked at the windows earlier you can see cranes everywhere there's a huge amount of construction a huge amount of development um we're very lucky as well like you've no shortage of tech companies around here so for people definitely in europe it's a good destination to kind of pick if you're looking for somewhere to you know start a career in tech because there are a lot of places and they're doing a lot of hiring at the moment um but other than that like i like to think that people are friendly enough they're funny to me because i'm from here i guess but um it's it's definitely an interesting culture it's funny when i go to the states one of the first things i miss is the people and because it's a very different like interpersonal culture there um and it's nice but you do you do miss the the kind of i don't know everything has to be witty only has to be sarcastic all that kind of stuff and it's just it's the funny little things like that just kind of miss yeah so in in dublin people are constantly kind of like it's i mean do you think it's like a city of kind of entertainers and jokers kind of everybody's trying to figure out a clever way to put things well they always kind of portray the irish as that kind of like quickwitted like smart art type of character and you know maybe they're right um i like to think i'm pretty all right but no like huh you probably shouldn't um but no yeah like i think there's a lot of value place placed on your words and you better wait and you know i think it comes across when you meet people they're normally you know decent speakers and you know up for a chat and someone were a bit too up for a chat but that's a different story altogether yeah well what are some things that uh aside from kernel development and hopefully getting back into free cooking contribution what are some areas of technology since you're somebody who is you know at many different places in the stack and has a pretty good bird's eye view on on how things are moving what are some things that really excite you about tech information technology and the way things are going in terms of new things um i guess there's a lot of scope for i guess like this is trying to unlock but the entire integration of technology and people i feel like there's a lot of issues that are not serious enough that they've needed a solution in the past but it becomes so easy to solve that they will be um a great example is the the whole health technology kind of revolution the way everyone's get their heart rate consumed and all that kind of stuff um there's been many cases of people finding that they have asip or atrial fibrillation if you want the full visible thing uh because of their smart watch i think there's an article really recently an apple watch that alerted the person to it um and it's stuff like that that can you know makes huge differences to lives because they're you know if you find out you've atrial fibrillation you need to get it sorted and it's fine if you sort it and if you don't you get yourself a lot of trouble so there's all kinds of applications of health technology in particular that are not only really exciting because they're cool but they're also really exciting because they're good they're doing a good thing in the world that's a really good answer so are you planning to event i mean do you want to like ten years out you're so young first of all i think this uh this guy was one of the youngest free co camp contributors uh how old were you when you started contributing to free cocaine what year is there 2018 it was like four years ago almost 16 then yeah yeah and so you're you're right at the beginning of your career did you did you end up going to university or yeah yeah so this this year of work is my third year of college effectively and then i have to go back one more year um so yeah i kind of i took the weird right because i did the self teaching and the free code camp and in the classical training as well so i've kind of done all of it in a weird way so knowing that you know techn you know health technology and preventative medicine all that is is an area that there's tremendous potential for improving people's quality of life and it can be you know a huge industry knowing that and knowing what you know about uh kernel development and knowing what you know about web development what would you say the the longterm direction you hope to take your career in at this point is i actually am very happy where i am i'm serious it's a very good company to work for and i find my work really interesting um i try not to worry too much about the future the nice thing about tech is that when you get yourself to a certain standard you don't have to worry too much about you know you're not going to be unemployed probably for any great period of time so i i do like a degree of you know let the river take me wherever and see what happens for now i definitely for the next five years i can see myself staying in arista um but i have no plans even beyond that so i'm looking forward to seeing what opportunities do present themselves all right well thank you so much for joining us here and yeah coming out and giving us some local flavor that's it that's what i'm here for quincy it's great to talk to you live yeah great to talk to you in person in the flesh that's it hey coming up matt yeah welcome matt uh tell us a little bit about your background and what you're doing so i'm i'm originally a music teacher i studied music at university um taught guitar on piano for several years um and then which i still do actually just a little bit um in the evenings and weekends but i realized um it wasn't the career for me i wanted something which had a bit more direction had more of a challenge um and i met a friend who i'd not seen in a long time and he studied music with me and he was like oh i'm a developer now i was like how did how did that happen and uh i knew that well i found a lot of courses online and sort of taught myself and then a couple of years later and developers like that's incredible and uh so i started just looking around different resources um and this was so this was uh like three and a half years ago four years ago um so i was started with a lot of courses on coursera edx and those kind of things which were really good because they had these kind of deadlines so you had to get the project in by a certain time and then people peerreviewed them um and then listened to a lot of podcasts and i think i feel it was probably javascript java you were on and you were talking about free code camp or maybe it was code newbie maybe both and um and i heard about free code camp and started trying that out and and realized actually this is this incredible free platform um and yeah just got really into it and got quite disciplined about doing it every day and then uh and then i heard about these meetups that were going on and um which at first i was i'm not good enough to go along to these i bet everyone's amazing and you know very uh i was quite intimidated but i forced myself to go and then met people who were very similar to me you know some people who were above me some people who weren't quite where i was and um and found that really and suddenly it was oh you know maybe i can do this and yeah it's gone from there really that's awesome so describe the transition uh you're a musician and just looking at the different steps you would need to take and planning out your progression as it became clearer and clearer to you what you needed to do yeah i think yeah to begin with it's it's fine just to accept you're not going to learn everything in one go i think some people think they maybe do it for a week and think oh i feel like i don't know too much yeah i'm never going to be able to do this it's so this just it can be overwhelming um it's good just to yeah just do it initially which i think i did just to try a few things out and just just enjoy it really not necessarily immediately think i need to do this and become a developer as soon as possible i think it's good to take your time just to yeah try try some things out and but then as you enjoy it more hopefully and get a sense that it is what you want to do trying to um find ways to keep yourself motivated in my case it was initially doing these courses which had deadlines at the end of the week and then in the meetups thinking okay there's another meetup in two weeks i'd like to be able to show something to someone by then you know sometimes you feel like if you go along and you've not done anything since last time it's like oh you know i should have done it it's a nice kind of motivator having some peers around you i think it's very easy to sort of stay by yourself and get a bit isolated but you know what we try and encourage with the meetups is to get people to come along and just you know talk to people um see where everyone else is don't feel shy about it everyone's there to help each other we're not about you know criticizing i mean might be constructive criticism but um yeah so yeah yeah and so your leadership within uh within these meetups and and helping people in your town pick up these skills what are some observations you've had about people who've approached it and how do they generally find out about the events that come to them yeah so we uh so yeah for some more context i've been going to the meetups for about two and a half years but i've only been leading them since the beginning of this year um the person alex who was really great she was running them for a few years but just had a lot on her plate so she looked for a volunteer to to carry to carry on with them and as i was going to them all the time i thought i should do that ask for observations yeah i mean we get such a huge range of people that come there are people who have surprisingly you get quite a few people who turn up um and they they ask me you know i'd like to learn to co where do i start and okay if you try free code camera like oh there's an online platform they actually don't realize they've heard seen the meetups on meetup.com or i mean we have the facebook group obviously which i moderate and or just like the venues have their own websites and stuff so it's sometimes quite funny when to see the look on their face when to actually see someone for the first time see the curriculum and they're like this isn't all free is it and actually you know you explain yes it is and so that's great um yeah so we get we do get people who are really right at the beginning like that um and again this is what i keep telling i think there's we have i think we're getting on for like 6 000 people on the groove but we get about 20 to 30 people who actually come and i think there's a lot of people there and this is partly why i'm sitting here is too much i'm trying to make them realize don't be shy you know we'd love to have you um yeah so we do have that we got a lot of people who come who are yeah i mean we very rarely get people who are overly cocky actually most people are a bit unsure of themselves and it's nice to tell them actually no you're doing really well and yeah and we've had a lot of success stories lately i think the last meet up three or four people since the previous one had got jobs since that one so it's always nice when people come along and say hey yeah i've got a job since last time so that's really good to see yeah well that's amazing so having uh 20 or 30 people show up at a meetup is is really good i talk to people all the time uh who have been working very hard to build up a kind of a critical mass of people coming and it takes a lot of work to to get a group to that size it's you know because it's hard work showing up in a meetup and you have to put yourself out there you have to learn new things in programming pretty much everything you do you're doing it for the first time uh otherwise you just rerun the script you wrote last time right so uh i let's talk about music specifically and you said you were inspired by your friend who was a musician and how he transitioned into development and the parallels you see uh between music and coding yeah i think certainly selfdiscipline is a key one like as a kid just getting into the habit of practicing an hour a day of guitar on piano in my case and whatever instrument it may be that's definitely really been a key one is being able to um yeah just just motivate yourself try and sometimes it's a chore sometimes it's really not but but trying to doing a bit every day even if it is just maybe even 20 minutes is better than leaving long gaps and then doing a huge amount you know doing nothing for a month and then spending a weekend solid it's better to do yeah a bit every day or every other day so certainly that kind of thing um other parallels in music i guess patterns looking for patterns and things when i'm looking at chords and scales there's a lot of this kind of i'm i've come from a background i've been quite interested in music theory and that kind of picking things apart and seeing how they work so certainly from that that translates quite nicely into looking at code bases and trying to figure out what's behind the scenes and how that's happening so yeah well what are some of your nearterm goals as far as your leadership of the the study group and also just your personal career goals uh as far as the study group um yeah trying to get them get the meetups more regularly we are increasing this now we're getting i've been talking to some more venues around london and so we're not usually we're just in the same place but we're now trying out some other things so that's helping to keep things keep a bit more momentum going getting more people going obviously it's always good and i try and encourage people on the facebook group and our group and people who come this doesn't have to be the only thing go to other meetups or start your own um we're not we don't own the freecode brand you know we're just volunteers and so we do get people who you know after a session go hey you want to meet up the weekend and do some coding and stuff so always constantly trying to encourage that um talking to a few people about maybe doing some some talks and workshops at the moment our meetups are quite loose so which is kind of deliberate because i want to keep them as unintimidating as possible so that and also for me personally when i've been coding all day to go and have like three hours of lectures as it were they can be really great but sometimes you just just want to talk and um and enjoy the social aspect so yeah but but i think maybe we could also be a bit more structured have occasional talks on that kind of thing as far as career i've just started a new job this week so um wow congratulations tell us about that so it's with um it's with a company called bulb who are a green energy company so do 100 uh renewable electricity and 10 renewable gas so it's quite a good mission which i'm you know quite passionate about um and they're growing at a phenomenal rate so i think they had about a hundred thousand customers at christmas and now it's on to eight hundred thousand so it's um they're hiring more developers they want to you know obviously keep on top of things it was an interesting first week because it was everybody whether you're senior management or entry level does the energy specialist training so um learning about the energy industry and how to deal with customer interactions we haven't even seen the code base yet but so we'll see what it looks like on monday which is going to be fun but it's a really good stack you know react redox and enzyme just node on the back end so lots of good stuff that's great they're working with a contemporary stack so you'll you'll be pretty at home because you've been working with that previously and that's what you learned yeah yeah my previous job was mostly react redux so um quite familiar with that but i've done bits of back end but not too much so it'd be good to have a chance to do that as well and we're doing and it's all in typescript as well which i'm liking more and more that kind of thing so yeah i'm excited about typescript too there's a there's a new version and node that's typescript based i don't know if you've heard about it it's called deno it's like node but up backward or i guess an anagram of node deno i have the subreddit if anybody's interested in posting about deno uh r deno i'm the administrator on that subreddit now so as you learn more about typescript especially i'd encourage you to teach the community about it because that is a topic that i think everybody should get some exposure to we're hoping to add typescript to the free cooking curriculum as well yeah brilliant i mean to be honest i'm pretty much a beginner in it myself i mean i did you know the twitch project i did that for the hell of it i did it in angular 2 like two years ago and built that with types where i learned it for that i think it's changed a bit since then i've mainly been using flow in my previous job so but a lot of the principles are quite similar so but it'll be nice so having said that it is good to teach things even if you're not yet an expert because by teaching you do learn yourself so yeah maybe that's a good goal i should set myself is try and teach some people some typescript at the meetups all right matt well uh thanks again for your leadership of the free cocaine london uh group and i popped your information up on the on the screen uh i think are you on twitter oh it's not really not really okay there's a free code camp which we're doing which i'm actually probably not so great at maintaining as the other platforms but um yeah if anything i'm trying to maybe cut down social media just a little bit so but um but yeah i'm i'm on facebook and happy people linkedin obviously i'm happy for people to have me on that right well i would encourage you if you're visiting london which is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world or if you happen to be in the area um if you happen to live in in the uk and just travel there occasionally i would encourage you to attend one of the free co camp london events i've heard great things about it you've got some amazing photos from your events that i've seen and and i've heard great things about the events from various people have gone yeah likewise if when you're in london please do join us all right well hopefully within the next year or two i'll make it out to one of your events i'd love to go it's a it's a beautiful city it's got so much history fantastic okay okay thanks again matt i'm great this is teemo hey teemo thanks timo uh can you tell me how to pronounce your last name granches gurenges goodanges teemo gullenges okay and you're from the netherlands yeah from veda from the south of the netherlands okay so from which city in the south netherlands okay so first of all i just want to make sure everybody knows teemo is a prolific contributor i think i was talking about you earlier when we were going around in the circle but you've contributed an incredible amount and if you look on the github repo and look rank everything by commits you're way up there along with ben mcmahon and some of the other people we've talked to tonight so timo you are a young developer who is rapidly learning new skills and contributing to open source talk about how you got interested in technology i've been thinking about that recently and the truth is i don't really know what got me into this just i found out about it i tried it and i liked it and i stuck with it because it seemed fun and yeah i i can't really tell why why i like it but i like it and i think i like solving the puzzle i specifically like helping other people with the things i can help them with but yeah why why programming i i don't know it's just it seemed fun and it turned out to be fun so i stuck with it what are some of the ways that you've contributed to the free cooking community over the past year and a half or so so when it started out almost exactly two years ago now um i started with making small changes mostly to the curriculum uh small fixes to the test mostly so it was a test that was missing correct uh solutions or it was allowing solutions that shouldn't be allowed i try to fix those and that's mostly what i started out doing and then uh i found out about the free guide being developed and actually you had quite a bit of time at the time that it uh was an act of development and uh i got involved and i spent a lot of time on uh contributing to the freakout combine to the platform not the articles the content but to the platform the site around it yeah and the guide specifically what are some of the articles that you wrote that you're particularly proud of i the only article or the only content on the guide that i wrote is the home page which i'm still i'm kind of proud of because i'm sure a lot of people have seen it and it's actually in the past year or so it hasn't changed at all so it's kind of fun but i haven't read any other in any other content for the guide it's the only content i've written so most of your contributions have been to uh the the application itself and yeah yeah exactly yeah i've done a lot to uh just for the looks of this fight for the performance i cut it in half at one point there was a weird issue that made the loading time twice as long as it could be so that's a fun thing i did and lots of stuff around that making the tests better making it making sure it would give better errors when the things failed and that's sort of what i did around the kite yeah so next month we're having the freco camp jam stack hackathon we're going to be building a lot of applications using tools like gas bjs which is what the guide is built on are you do you have any time or energy to participate in that hackathon i think i heard about it and then i checked my calendar i think i could not that was i don't remember but i think it was something that made it so that it was difficult for me to attend but yeah i'd like to and i'd definitely check again but it probably won't work yeah okay well we moved it back a week so now it's november third november third and fourth and even though we're having it in person in san francisco at github we're also going to have a much larger online hackathon and one of the things we're doing is we're building kind of like google's lighthouse score you know how you can you can add like a chrome extension we want to do is we want to build something like google's lighthouse score that checks whenever a page is like redeployed through nullify we create some sort of web hook and then we can go in and we can just run a bunch of tests against it and figure out you know performance how it's doing performance wise how it's doing seo wise accessibility wise and and other like basic security considerations things like that so if you're interested you're somebody who has a ton of experience working with stack and and me and stuart are going to be working on this basically all through the month of october during hacktoberfest putting this tool together to to basically test hackathon projects programmatically would that be something you might be interested in contributing to yeah i think it definitely sounds exactly like the kind of thing i'm looking to contribute to right now so that's really cool to hear about i've been away from the contributing to africa again for a while now and that sounds like right up my alley so yeah i i definitely i'm definitely going to look at what i can do to contribute to that yeah great well we'll plan to include you in some of the meetings that steward and i have um right now we're focused of course on getting the freco camp repo easier to contribute to in preparation for oktoberfest got like a week left but that i'll definitely loop you in because we would totally welcome your help with that you've got so much knowledge about performance and and security and things like that what are currently uh what are you doing uh as a developer and what's your what's the next year and a half or so of your life look like wow that's a different question so right now i work at a very small local software company where the only developers are me my boss and a freelance software developer but it's i'm having a lot of fun there the people there are great so that's fun but the tech is quite old but also because it's such a small company i get to do a lot of different things and i quite enjoy that so um i i'll be looking into progressive web apps and we'll probably be turning our application to progressive web apps i'm quite excited to do that and we have a lot of ui improvements and performance improvements so i really like those areas and also happen to be the areas that we are going to focus on in our application uh at my job so it works out great awesome well timo it's been so wonderful having you fly in from the netherlands hanging out with us what are some things you plan to do while you're here in dublin um i'm usually the kind of person that really plans out in advance what i potentially like to do but for this trip i didn't look at anything at all so i'm leaving monday so i've the old day tomorrow here so i'll probably be at the fun run and uh don't have any idea what i'm going to do tomorrow apart from that but hoping to see do some sightseeing in dublin tomorrow and that's about it really yeah well thank you so much for joining us timo it's great to meet you in person of course and we timo ran into us at the airport actually and we you just saw the free cookie i'm sure he's like hey and i was like oh tivo and uh so yeah it was pretty dramatic uh sudden meeting and uh you came back and hung out at the airbnb with us so yeah we're excited i'm looking forward to running around the park with you tomorrow yeah cheers yeah hey sam sam williams welcome yeah likewise have a seat thank you very much just very quickly we've got 36 minutes left in the venue so we're gonna try to get some more interviews yeah well thanks for all your articles so far sam they've been they've been great thank you and very well received by the community yeah thank you virtually like the first article i wrote i was i wrote it just because i was in china and i hated the great the great firewall of china and i sent it to you and said can you have a look and you said you loved it and actually made me an author on the uh on the free code camp media mask on the medium publication and that just gave me the boost i needed every other article before that i got like five ten maybe fifteen viewers getting on the free code camp thing boosted me and gave me the confidence to write more and that was really big for me right on well so you're somebody who's traveled extensively and seems like you're constantly learning new things and kind of pushing the bounds of your comfort zone you talk about how you came to be and like what what inspired you to to travel and to learn all these new technologies well i'm an obsessive rock climber and that's what got me into travelling and that's what actually got me into software development i worked as an aerospace engineer and i realized that it wasn't what i wanted to do so what i wanted to do was do more travelling and i realized that doing that doing engineering as a career wasn't going to get me there and software development would so i actually used free code camp to teach myself how to do that and after a couple of months of really hard work i managed to get my first software job after that i decided to save up all of my money and go traveling and then after that i was like okay i need to take it to the next level so i spent six months traveling and learning all the newest things i learned i taught myself react through yourselves free code camp and a couple of other resources um i pushed my node skills and i did everything i could and i wrote a lot of articles whilst i was traveling about what it was like to go from i know a bit of html and a bit of css to i want to become a really serious developer and that's a transition that i found quite tricky but hopefully um through those articles have helped some other people like find their pathway from very junior developer through to like a midlevel developer and it's cool because like some of the articles have had comments saying this has really helped this is like giving me a pathway and that's it's just such a good thing to see that other people are making that transition with us so i have to ask as a rock climber uh you know i've i enjoy climbing i enjoy bouldering i am not good at it at all but that is a very itinerant lifestyle you're traveling around from uh climbing location to climbing location probably a lot of national parks and places like that that you you visit you do outdoor climbing as well yeah yeah so i grew up doing indoor competition climbing which was good fun but i realized that when i started going outdoors that was the beauty and scenery outdoors and just climbing on real rock is so much better than climbing indoors so yeah i've been traveling around spain germany france europe i've been across to canada i've been to uh north africa and then this was five months of traveling around asia so like months in china thailand lao vietnam and it's just brilliant fun traveling and the great thing is with traveling and doing software development is that you can take your laptop with you which means you can do work whilst you're traveling i met five or six other developers whilst i was traveling who had their laptop with them and on their rest days would take the laptop out find a quiet corner and would do a day's work and that's how they sustained themselves on their perpetual travels which is a really i think long term is something i definitely intend to do so when i was i spent about five years in china myself uh when i was uh younger like right after college i moved there and i i taught and i was the school director and i did an intensive mandarin program and and uh did an mba but while i was there um i definitely enjoyed it and i thought about just living in different countries for the rest of my life ultimately i kind of settled in the states and i still go back to china like i'm getting ready to move there for like six months or so uh just just to live with the family and give my kids some more exposure to the language but there was this amazing book i read i wanted to see if you'd heard of it it was really inspiring to me at the time it's called vagabonding by ralph potts ralph potts i've never heard of that i've never heard of that book no i think it was kind of a precursor to the digital nomad movement and i'm not sure you know whether it holds up and whether the advice in there is still like best practices and stuff but it definitely opened my eyes to it and now there's this entire digital nomad movement do you identify as a digital nomad and are you parts of it a part of any of those communities uh currently i'm not a digital nomad i have a fulltime job in manchester and i love it and it's brilliant but in the future i can definitely imagine myself well my aim in the future is to get to the point where i can comfortably sustain myself in a perpetual travel so i can go around i can live in a city i could live in like i could live in barcelona for a couple of months and then i could move to china and then i could move to chile and i that is the goal to have a digital nomad life where i can work where i want when i want and have complete autonomy of my life outside of like the the constrictions of a traditional job system in manchester uh do you are you able to work remotely at all or do you generally just work in an office currently i work in an office when i started this job i started as what i thought was a low to medium level developer i very quickly got pushed into being a mid to senior level developer like making quite big architectural decisions which turns out i really enjoyed so we've got a really small team and we tend to work all in the office if i want to work at home for a day if i need to i can that's fine but at the moment with the size of the company i work at working at an office especially because it's a 10 minute commute it's not two hours of driving i find it's quite nice to get away from home because that means that when you finish you go home and you can shut off yes occasionally you do have to pop occasionally you do have to pop online because there's a bug on the live system but you can go back but most of the time it's you finish work at the end of the day you go home and being able to fully disconnect being is something i'm actually surprisingly enjoying compared to when i've done a little bit of remote work before well you came from i think you said aerospace engineering so that's a field that's another engineering field uh you know software engineering software development also applies a lot of similar you know math and and kind of engineering principles how much of your aerospace space engineering training has been helpful in moving into software development i think actually quite a lot of it a lot of the problem solving and the ways that you approach technical problems through that we were taught and we practiced through university were actually really like applicable to software development unfortunately they're not actually that applicable to real world engineer like aerospace engineering which is ironic so i think a lot of the skills the problem solving and the approaches and like how to deal with something when you hit that wall that's the kind of thing that you deal with quite a lot at university when you hit a project and you hit that wall how to break through that wall whether it's taking some time off or approaching it from completely different direction yeah like aerospace engineering taught me more about software development than it did about aerospace engineering what would be some advice uh that you would have for other people who have gone into a field of engineering whether it's mechanical engineering or aerospace engineering or petroleum engineering or a field where perhaps growing a lot less quickly than software development is which i think is probably the fastest growing field maybe on earth um what would be your advice to those people who already have kind of a traditional engineering training but are interested in pivoting into software development if you're interested in pivoting into software at all give it a try stuff like free code camp and there's hundreds of other free resources out there they're all absolutely brilliant i learned most of the stuff i know now through free code camp it's free it has stepbystep tutorials that give you really good feedback as you're progressing through and the worst that happens is you try it out you do two or three months and you find that you don't enjoy it that much that's two or three months you've learned some new skills but you don't progress if you do enjoy it and you end up moving into software you can end up as a remote developer you could end up traveling around the world you could end up working with chat bots like i currently do and working with some of like the coolest tech like working with ai working with machine learning and doing something that is so beyond what you're constricted to within the traditional engineering roles thanks so much for coming out uh from manchester and uh are you gonna you're an athletic guy are you gonna come with us run tomorrow unfortunately i've got a flight quite early tomorrow morning um which i'm hoping that i'll be sober enough to fly on but it's going to be yeah so unfortunately i'm not going to make the run no worries we'll have fun uh we're i think we're going to go and do like a little pub crawl after this so yeah we've got some we've got ben the local here who's gonna guide us around town so uh yeah that it'll be cool to hang out with you later tonight uh thanks again for coming out man it's great great to finally meet you in person thank you very much cheers sam all right richard have a seat man okay great all right awesome we're making good progress so richard i'm so thrilled we've talked so many times we've been in touch richard is in charge of preco camp leads precode cam oslo and the free cocaine instagram which has i don't know 10 000 ish like 13 and a half or something now somebody wrote in the 13s i think yeah yeah and it's it's great photos of freco camp events and just beautiful workstations and code setups and things like that yeah all that stuff all the good stuff yeah what are your goals so you really took charge on the instagram and i mean you owned it for you were already very prolific on instagram you had a lot of your own photos you had a ton of followers yourself and you really took the free cocaine instagram which was largely just chilling there because i think i was the only person who had access to it at the time and and and now it's it's quite vibrant and there's a lot of beautiful photos on there can you describe that process of thinking like hey maybe i could help out with this and and how you went about it yes so i think people took it from about three thousand at the time uh are you saying it was like underutilized i think the thing i think you were very um very very good on twitter and things like that that stuff was doing it um and what i was doing on my own instagram uh was just pictures of my code stuff i'm working on um and things like that so we had the conversation about doing some stuff with the free code can't component to it have a lot more of the community stuff in there as well uh trying to re reupload other people's pictures um regram them or whatever they call that um so that's kind of what we tried to do get the community thing more in there uh and just try and try and build that up and have it a bit more of a community a bit more so other people could um you know get involved in that as well so that was the plan yeah yeah and uh early on you you made it a clear point that people could basically add mention free code camper hashtag freak codecamp on instagram and we could basically signal boost their photos and and of course credit them and everything uh are people still doing that pretty regularly we need them to do it more do it more um especially to do with if there's meetups going on that stuff's great so if we've got a meet up and you've got a picture of all the groups and stuff like that we love that stuff so like send those stuff but um yeah i'm constantly going in there checking the hashtags or if you've been tagging us in them directly as well trying to find the good stuff out there and posting it on there so um if if people send me the good stuff then it means i don't have to do anything so that's kind of what we want to do for sure yeah so beyond the instagram you have been leading these two study groups in two very different cities you're originally from leeds but you live in oslo as well yeah so um my kind of journey with the whole code thing started i was living in oslo so i kind of got back round to it uh coding i'd done a little bit when i was very young it was html with inline css so we're talking like 1997 here um so i got back around to it i was actually living in oslo at the time um then i ended up taking over the admin of the oslo group because the person who was running it wasn't really running it so they had a backlog of people they wanted to get into the group but they weren't being accepted so i managed to get hold of the the admin at a time and and get her to add me then i took over the admin of that um then as i was going back to uh leeds so i kind of been in oslo twice basically going back to leeds we had marek who came to the new york show and he was really like i want to do it and it's going to give me a kick up the ass if if if i have this commitment that i'm the person here okay well i'm i'm back in lead so i went over to leeds um got involved in the leeds community i think at that time they just added some more admins to kind of get stuff moving a little bit um because then also when i was there we started doing the coffee and code meetups you know we started weekly and doing once a month and trying to find its feet which was great when mike took over that he made it once a week and that momentum was really good so back in leeds we had the first copying code meetup i think after i've been there a month uh then they had me as the admin there so we started trying to do more frequent copy and code stuff there so we're doing it monthly day as well and obviously we've got johnny bissell the famous the legend of johnny bissell the legend uh so if you want to just um message johnny bizzle on twitter and just say ninja i think it's at johnny bizzle i'm sure it is just say you're a legend you know i go there well um and we've got charlie as well a few of the guys who are helping in lead so we've got the coffin codes running there and i think i think that's the good thing about the facebook groups is you can look at all the different cities around the world and there's some groups that are slow and some groups are really going somewhere and it doesn't it doesn't start it doesn't start in the groups it starts outside the groups and when you can start making that community outside the group then it translates to stuff happening in the group so um i said i went back to leeds and we started doing stuff in leeds and i moved back to oslo again and mike did a great job of making the copy and code meetups every week and from then you know i've been i've been back in oslo maybe six months now i think something like that and we're getting between seven and 13 people every single monday night um oslo isn't a big city it's like um 800 000 people so we've got 400 people in the group i think something like that so to have that community of uh people who come in every single every single week is great because it's the motivation to keep going you know even if all we do is just talk rubbish all night and we don't code anything which happens like but for me it happens the majority of times it's made for monday night it's my favorite night of the week i get to go hang out with these guys and we chill you know we'll go down to the lake we'll have some beers by the lake we'll go out and have a party like it's gone beyond we're here to learn to code it's like there's good friendships and i think with um what we're doing also especially there's a very big immigrant population there like as in some immigrant expat community um so it's nice to have something that ties us together and brings people together that uh as a social thing as well you know we've got people from uh not just people from england norway america um you know poland czech republic we've got lots of people that automatically have this connection with you because you code but also it brings together it gives you a good bond which is really cool it's like it's bigger than the sum of its parts i guess you could say yeah for sure yeah so you you just to summarize some of the insights you've shared first of all trying to build a community with like friends in a city first and get coffee and codes going and then try to invite the local facebook group into that rather than trying to post on the facebook group hey i'm trying to have this event if you get a critical mass going first where you have people meeting it makes it easier to bring more people from the community is that kind of what you're saying no i'd say the way we worked it was this i'm gonna go study every monday i don't care if you come i'm going like this is my thing and for me that's a it's one of those things where i had to do it and i motivated myself to go do it and when that when that momentum keeps going you might have one person one week might have no persons the week after but it's it's you're not doing it because of how many people are coming you're doing it because that's what you have to do and i think when you have these groups where people have got good leaders then they're just going to go do it because that's what they're going to do and it happens like even in the facebook groups if you're not um if you're not posting as a leader as a leader if you're not posting and you've got to be the one who's doing it even if nobody else is replying it's almost one of those things like you're so selfishly um blinkered if you like you almost explain you don't even care what's going on you're you've got to do it people might not be replying just keep posting keep posting the article you bet it's like and eventually the momentum will come you know leeds is very similar to oslo with the amount of people it's like 700 000 right so if if those groups can do it and you're in a city of 10 million people it's like you've got you've got such a base than even we had and the only thing that is different is the fact that we went i'm gonna do it and just just do it and don't care if you get any response so yeah just go do it for yourself keep posting make sure i make the event for the coffee and code meetup whatever it is and it's like the what is it field of dreams what's the movie where it's like build it and they'll come exactly that build and they'll come and i have to say uh just a quick observation because we're running out of time we're going to do a big group photo but i have to say that the study groups like where a study group will become huge and vibrant and help tons of people get a job has very little to correlation with the size of the metropolitan area has everything to do with the leadership of that study group and how passionate they are and how willing they are to do exactly what you said like i don't care if you come i'm going to be there so come and code with me if you want but either way i'm going to be there you know rain or shine and that attitude makes all the difference so thanks so much for imparting that in both the oslo and and in the leads groups and i'm hopeful that we can take a lot of your wisdom and you can write some articles and we can use that to help more people create these successful groups thanks so much for everything you're doing richard all right okay we're here with andrei do you have his name up on the screen okay perfect anderla has contributed extensively to free code camp uh through the free co camp guide and also publishing articles on medium tell us a little bit about yourself and how you discovered free code camp and decided to contribute to it okay um at the moment i'm a student actually just started like last week university um the my journey with frequent camp started when i um moved from like gsharp to javascript because i needed to learn node.js for like a server application and uh i basically discovered frequent camp to learn javascript then i started like reading the articles on the medium publication and when i decided that i wanted to also write articles it just felt natural to go to publish the articles on the media publication and then from there like the involvement with the community just like grew uh gradually um leading to contribute also mainly to the guides repository but also like to the other repositories like smaller contributions awesome well thank you for your many contributions so far what are some areas like when you look at the free code camp community andra what are some areas where you see potential for improvement that you're interested in diving into oh oh okay um i think that the backhand curricula um is like very good on the um beginner level but there are like so many topics that could be covered of course like the uh the work on actually developing the courses is like enormous for example a technology that i'm very interested in is graphql i think that would be a very nice addiction you are also using that internally uh in for the um in the guides repository with gatsby so um very cool technology would like like to see that uh yeah well i will tell you under the if you're interested in helping contribute to that that's like we want to add typescript when we want to add graphql those are the two things that we're most excited about adding to the curriculum of course we have other like things kind of supplementary things but we want both graphql and and typescript to be covered in the core curriculum so yes we would welcome your help and and you're right there absolutely we basically scratch the surface on testing on security on a lot of these major npm modules that people can add that add so much functionality and we'd love to cover a lot more would you be interested in helping with that yeah okay actually there is a i have a graphql article in writing should be published like already a couple weeks um as um helping the curricula i i can do some work the whole like not too much involvement because of like the uh plenty of uh things i have to do in this like period starting university having like a startup in the launching side job really heavy on the schedule but like the article is a good start i think you said you just started school you just started you just started university yeah congratulations yeah how old are you 18. oh wow you're getting really into uh really deep into technology pretty young and that's that's excellent yeah i actually like started my first experiences with coding like at 12 the story goes basically oh i like games why not make one and then like i just started with the software that lets you just create the game with drag and drop stuff and then you say oh i want to add this like cool feature i will learn some scripting and then oh program is super cool i will learn this yeah have you uh so are you thinking like game maker or tools like that uh what what did you use early on for building games okay yeah early on i used game maker we actually had an issue because we are three people using game maker but we picked two different versions of a game maker and we didn't know that and so like um at the time uh of course we didn't use gate i didn't even know that git existed and so like sending the versions and loading them into the software like broke the code and we are like these two weeks in which we were like building this very uh basic ai and every time we uh like sent each other the code it broke until we realized oh you're using 8.1 i'm using 8.0 wow that's that's kind of uh doesn't sound like they have very good backward compatibility yeah have you looked at uh unity 3d or the unreal engine or any of the more contemporary big developer tools for game development i did something unity but actually in the last three years i haven't done like anything in game development i've been doing mostly backend work like on an iot framework some frontend work with react for the interface well but you know iot related stuff is of course very interesting and node.js is a powerful tool for doing iot stuff so if if you want to write more about that we'd welcome that if you do want to dive in and do more game development there we've published a lot of videos on game development like build flappy bird uh build you know basic kind of almost programming oneonone type classes like tictactoe and stuff but we would welcome more indepth game development especially because it sounds like something that you you're passionate about they got you into coding in the first place yeah i definitely want to get back to game development in the future but not in the short future like when for example the iot framework that i'm building at the moment is like version one ready then we can start to think about okay let's begin another big project until then game development takes really a lot of time so it's on a stop for for now well it's it's great to hear about uh your projects and i'm glad you are staying focused on your iot stuff um keep us posted and keep writing your your articles are helping a lot of people thank you thank you very much all right cheers all right i'll just grab the camera um so matt's over here we're gonna take a big group photo and then we're gonna gracefully leave because we do have guidelines for the leaving i'll talk to you i'll brief you on after the street okay great um hey everybody hey we're going to take a very quick group photo and then we're going to follow the leaving guidelines and make sure that we leave the place in a good condition yeah everybody come over here and i mean this wall is so colorful i love the but we can get maybe the window and the wall in the shot uh unless somebody has an even better place to shoot it a couple strong burly people grab that table on that table move it out of the way so that we have uh can you do it i said strong as berlin why are you there all right all right we're going to take a group photo okay taller people in the back medium people in the middle i think yeah or we could wait we are still missing yeah okay can you just wait for the guy that is in a bathroom no yeah we have a camper who's in the bathroom hey hey here all right well everybody thank you so much for tuning in for the stream we got to talk to a lot of exciting people doing exciting work both within the free cocaine community and just working as developers so i hope you all have a beautiful evening we're gonna chop all this up into a great highlight video that will post uh if you missed any of it you can catch the highlight video and from dublin signing off have a beautiful day you
