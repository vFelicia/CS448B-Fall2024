hey everybody and welcome to live coding with jesse uh still trying to get everything set up just give me a second the stream quality wasn't great so i've been trying to close out everything i can okay i think we have it now all right so welcome everyone i imagine we probably will have some newer uh some new viewers on the stream because this is very beginner friendly it's going to be pretty much basic html so if you're new this is how things go on the stream uh we break up the stream into periods where we code and then periods where we uh where i answer questions in the live chat so uh after i explain what we're going to do i'll start my first coding session and that'll be a 25 minute uh pomodoro session what i'm going to do today is pretty basic so it may only take one pomodoro session but if we don't get it done in the first session we'll do a second one after a five minute break to go through the live chat if you have any questions at any point please put it in the live chat i may not see it at first but i'll definitely get to it before i end the stream the streams usually last about an hour hour and a half occasionally we've gone longer than that but i think today it should be an hour or less so um i apologize uh for those of you that get motion sick easily i'm on a laptop right now that's sitting in my lap and i'm using the uh the webcam from there so the image of my face maybe a bit shaky i'm going to keep that small the whole time i'm not going to make it full screen because i know i get motion sick easily i don't want to do that to you all i have a legit webcam that is that i ordered and it should be in tomorrow so hopefully for friday's stream when i stream from home i'll have that webcam and i also have a tripod for it so it should be better picture quality and nice and steady uh so i see a lot of you saying hi and uh so hey everyone i'm gonna go ahead and start the uh the stream it looks like we have a bunch of people in here and the stream quality is good uh so i'm gonna start this pomodoro session and we're gonna get right into coding uh i put a link to this repository uh in the description to the video so if you go to that link this is where it'll take you this is a static html site for the clinical mental health health counseling program the university that i work for work for offers a uh a program for counseling and so we gave them a separate site as part of a marketing campaign we're gonna run another marketing campaign for them so um i receive some edits and i actually have the edits on a sheet of paper with postit notes because my coworker uh asked me a while back on slack how do you want me to send the changes and i being a smart alex said uh on on paper with a number two pencil please of course i was joking but she when i came into my office the next time this had been slid under my door um which uh has a note on it that says be careful what you ask for uh so i'm gonna be explaining what's on this piece of paper to you all as we go through uh so let's check out let's check out the site so i can explain what we're going to change since whoops all right i didn't really want it to go in a separate window but that'll work uh since you all probably have never seen the site before i want you to be familiar with it so basically uh some of these design elements should be familiar to you uh but this is kind of the first site where we went with this um this header style of being kind of the light header so it has some of the new design elements and some elements that we don't really use anymore but the first thing that definitely needs to change is we need to use our newer logo and if you've seen past streams you've seen the newer logo so we're going to be changing out a logo and we may have to adjust the css there so there'll be some basic css we also are going to need to change this text and we are going to need to change uh we're going to need to remove some elements so we have some elements here and it also switches and there are certain things on the page that are only visible either on mobile or on desktop so we'll have to make the changes in both versions so we'll get to see you know how how we did that um and let's see i think those are all the changes so you see there's not really a lot that needs to change but um like i said this will be a good stream for beginners i am going to explain you know the structure of what i'm doing and why we're doing things as i go on and there'll be a lot of times time for questions okay and if you want i'm gonna copy and paste the the link to this site so you all can check it out on your own computers uh and then like i said the link i'm going to link this github repo in the live chat if you're watching this and somehow don't have access to the live chat the link's also in the description to this video so i don't even have this installed on my laptop yet laptop yet so i'm going to be super basic and first thing we're going to do is clone this repository so uh you may or may not be familiar with github so i've gone to this repository i clicked this green clone or download button don't worry about the dark background on this i have some custom themes going on github so this is the regular version of github that you all can see as well uh so i've copied this and now we're gonna go to my terminal and let me make it a bit bigger for you all make sure you can see it uh so i'm going to explain what i'm doing in the terminal just in case there are some of you out there that aren't really familiar with with the terminal i am on a mac so these are going to be mac commands they'll also work on linux the commands may be a bit different on on a pc on or on a windows based machine so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to change directory with cd and i'm going to go into my projects folder and in my projects folder here's here all my projects that i've been working on i like to keep them all in in one folder like this and now i need to do a git clone and i'm going to paste in that link that i just copied from github and when i do this it's going to make a new folder right that's called cmhc site that's clinical mental health counseling site right so it just makes a folder that has the same name as your git repo so now that that folder is made let's go into that folder now we're in there and let's just check out the files we'll do an ls to check out all the files so we can see we have um you know some basic files and what we need to do so we have this package.json file we can see we have a yarn lock file so this project was made with yarn instead of regular npm so let's go ahead and do a uh yarn uh we're just gonna type in the command yarn that's gonna install all the packages for this package json file okay so we're not going to go into that now because i want to stick to basic html so um if you if you want to know more about your package json file what's going on here just put a question into the chat or in the comments and then i can answer that in more depth later on in the stream um so let's see while this is running let's uh get this open so i'm going to duplicate the tab and i'm going to open this up in visual studio code so i'm just going to type in code and then a period and that should open everything up in visual studio code for us which it may take a while this this particular laptop is a bit slow there we are another instance of code is running but not responding okay i guess we'll close this out let's check this out all right this is my other instance of code that's running i'd rather not shut this down because i'm working on that but let's see okay it looks like it's working it was just taking a while um apologies for the slowness of the machine when i'm trying to run my streaming software and do this at the same time it does slow down the machine a bit when i stream at my office i have a more powerful machine and it doesn't slow it down we're not going to upgrade right now we're going to do that later and let's see what is going on here nope that is not the project that i wanted did i duplicate the wrong tab looks like i accidentally duplicated the wrong tab so i guess let's just check out let's duplicate the right tab now close that down there we are and we'll just do the same command which we need to wait a minute anyway because all our packages are installing so i wanted to do this on the stream with everybody watching so you like you get an idea of how this works so i didn't anticipate it taking quite so long uh but it does give us it gives me time to check out some of the questions in the live stream uh while we're waiting so i'm gonna go in the stream and just kind of check out what's going on i'm gonna start at the top here and i'm gonna keep an eye on this this uh other monitor here so that when it's ready we can get right into it hey harshits in here he's it's a perfect time so harshit uh the timezone in the harsherton is a little bit difficult uh to catch a stream in so um i'm really glad that you could watch today harshit uh darshana prasad so i don't know how to pronounce your entire name but hopefully that's let me know if i pronounce that part right it says hi it's my first time with jesse hey welcome uh thanks for watching uh hopefully this this stream has some good stuff for you today uh hermes here says hello wow there's a lot of hulas i'm not gonna read through everybody's name that said hello i'm just a lot of hellos thank you all so much um okay so now we have some code up here that we can check out so we're going to go into where's our index page this is a onepage html site so we're going to go into our index page and i'm going to make the code as big as i can so that you all can see and i'm going to scroll down a bit let's um let's move this over here so we give us some more space i'm going to scroll down if you as i scroll i'm not going to go through everything on the site but i'm just going to explain a little bit so you can see this looks like a regular html page right we have our html tag our head tag right we're importing some things up here um importing a javascript uh and css library called materialize to help us this is an older version of materialize so if some of the things in here look different to you because you're used to a newer version um definitely go with whatever the newer stuff is don't take this as you know the way to do things because i'm sure some of the uh some of the ways that we're doing things may not even be supported in the newer versions this site was developed uh over a year ago um let's see so we have our navigation and let's see where our logo is here we go so the first thing that we're going to edit is our logo and uh let's check on this still going still going all right so let me bring over our logo we can at least put our logo in there and uh the easiest thing i think would be to name our logos the same name inside now logo okay so let me grab my logo so i'm going to open up a finder window just on my other screen because i have some finder windows open already um so let's see i i think i downloaded a logo this logo that i need to use uh not too long ago let's see and i think i have an svg version of it which i'm hoping it's an svg version i prefer those and it would be cool to just show you all uh how we use svgs uh in case you you haven't seen that before let's see um i have a bunch of svg's just named logo so i'm looking through the previews just to make sure that i have um the right svg okay here we are uh i found it so let's copy that and let's see if i can paste it directly into here in the images folder that's not going to let me do that let's see if i can all right doesn't let me copy and paste so uh i guess i'm going to need to drag and drop this within finder so i'm doing this on my other screen because this is just basic like i searched for a file and now i'm going to drag and drop it somewhere all right let's make sure cmhc site image there we go okay so now we have our logo here and what we can do is just delete this logo i know you know what uh they have different file the endings anyway so can't do it like that let's just change every instance here of this side logo uh so what we'll do is do control f right to find it and then we will let's see how do we open this up there we are uh and then we're going to replace it with this fus logo.svg and you see we have replace or replace all we're going to do replace all right and now we need to see what this looks like so hopefully oh goodness it's still going building fresh packages all right we'll go we'll go ahead and replace some more stuff uh where's this vertical logo i'm not sure where we're using this uh let's check it out i said i guess in the footer maybe oh here we are okay we are using that in the footer i think we can keep this i don't like i don't think that's an issue um it wasn't something that was marked to be changed so we're going to keep that in the footer but just notice how crisp this is because it's an svg even zoomed in uh there's you know it it looks fine it doesn't look pixelated at all now let's compare that to to this up here if we zoom in it's actually not too bad it must be a decent sized image but i don't know if you could see it on your screen but i noticed some fuzziness around the edges here so that's why i really like svgs is that no matter how much you blow them up or zoom in uh they're they work they still look fine okay looks like there's a lot going on in the live chat here i will get to that soon let me check my timer all right about 10 minutes so it looks like uh this logo is the only logo that we had that we need to deal with um i know i named it sidenav logo but really you know i don't have another logo in here so this is what we were working with and i'm gonna delete this since we don't need it anymore all right so that should be okay for getting the logo in as soon as um my yarn command uh gets through everything that it needs to we can run this locally and see the changes if for some reason it doesn't work i can just open this in chrome without having like the auto refresh and stuff happening uh so that that should work um the thing the one thing that we're gonna have to make sure that may not work is the the style so you know the image we had in there before was a certain size this is an svg uh you know the the size could throw things off um but hopefully it won't now we need to find michael says there's hardly anything in your package file not sure what's taking so long building fresh packages uh i guess we could i mean it could just be that i'm i'm trying to run obs at the same time let's um you know what i'm just gonna stop this process and uh let's try it again just you know we'll try it out you know maybe it got hung up on something so we'll let it do its thing we still have some other things that we we need to change in here so i'd like to show you what we've done with these sections actually let's let's change this so if you notice um let me switch this around so it's easier to get to all right so notice we have uh this background image and it's just kind of scrolling like uh almo like a parallax um style uh for this big hero section and then you know we just have some text here kind of station well it it's uh it's actually stationary but it looks like it's it's moving up over top of the image right so that's kind of like that parallax effect so we're just going to change these and you can see how we've done this we have this whole section with the id of home is a wrapper for everything we set a background on this this section uh and that's where that that image is and if you really want to see the css of how we did that let me know in the live chat and i'll make sure i show you that css before uh before i end the stream so basically that is a background image and then within that we just have some divs that are there for alignment and then we have an h1 and an h4 right we've just centered them done a bit of styling and then we just we have a button right that's just an a tag that's styled in a particular way alright so not too difficult so we do need to change some of this text uh the only thing it looks like the changes won't mess anything up uh if the text were to be too large that could be a problem uh but i think we'll end up with less text uh overall which i always think is good for that hero section professionally grounded face faith inspired uh so that'll be our change for that and then for here we're gonna say all right master of arts and clinical mental health counseling okay and i'll save that let's check on this wow it's still doing its thing okay um not really a problem we're about to take a break and go to the live chat anyway so it'll have you know a little while to to work i do want to scroll down so i mean you all if you want to take a closer look at any of this let me know and of course you're welcome to check it out uh in the github repo as well um this section is where we're gonna look at now it's uh the y franciscan section okay so there's actually let's see two let's scroll down here so there's actually two sections here one is hidden right now and those are these large cards but the second one is only really visible actually let me let me inspect this i think this will be easier overall uh to change the screen size all right so i've uh right clicked and clicked on inspect and that's opened up chrome dev tools and if you're not familiar with dev tools it is a really really awesome tool for web developers and you know you could see the whole dom tree all the html elements right and you can see all the css that's attached to them but i really want to use it right now just to be able to make this window smaller there we are so you could see at a certain screen width it changes because i don't want users to have to scroll for a really long time on mobile so we've changed it and made these smaller cards and you can see they just have this little effect where they open and close it's just a little pop out okay so that's what we need to change right now and we have about a minute so let's uh let me just show you so this is the section where it's at uh so what we're using we have the markup repeated in two two different sections so the first one uh let's see if i can this will make it easier to see so basically you have two different sections and the one says hide on large only all right so that's those large cards that are fully expanded and then the second one and this is um for oh i'm sorry i'm sorry the first div is actually the mobile section but we're hiding it on large screens so reverse what i just said uh the second section is the one that only shows on large screens so this is the large cards and this is the the smaller kind of accordion style so we'll need to make changes in both of them and that's what we'll do in the next pomodoro session but right now my timer is about to go off oh it just went off great i'm going to take a short break and hopefully this will work while i'm taking this break i'm gonna scroll up to where i left off in the live chat and answer as many questions as i can in this five minute period let's see all right uh himanshu asked what type of html update it was about so i mean i've already answered that hopefully uh let's see uh the question says can you speak hindi uh no unfortunately i don't speak hindi so if if your english is not very good and you like to ask me a question in hindi go ahead and type it in to the live chat and i'll use google translate to try to translate that and uh hopefully i'll have to answer in english but that may be a little bit easier for you we do have some other people in the chat that can speak hindi so they may be able to help translate as well john hanson says i'll be curious if visual studio code will do any lint checks for the html yeah i'm a little interested to see uh if any auto formatting and things happen uh with visual studio code since i built this in atom um we'll see i mean it shouldn't really have an impact on the site but it may switch up the way everything looks uh in the code uh a ayush deep asks what is yarn so um yarn uh is a javascript package manager so if you're familiar with node package manager yarn does the same thing when it first came out it was faster and it included a lock file which npm didn't have but now npm the the latest version also has a lock file and it's also pretty fast so at this point me using yarn is just out of habit and i i know the commands and i like them but npm does the same thing so you can go with either one it just installs lots of javascript code for you automatically so that you can use it in your projects let's see all right uh greg has a question about that pomodoro timer and how long do i set it for uh when i use pomodoro timer i take 25 minute coding sessions and then five minute breaks and after i do four of those sessions i take a 10 minute break i have seen other people do different amounts of times but this is how i learned how to do it with with these times and so i've stuck with it during that short break usually it's not like a complete break that's when uh like i'll check my emails or um if i've uh have just have other things i need to work on i'll go back to that uh occasionally if i don't have any emails i'll just just relax for a few minutes try to clear my thoughts and before i get back into the code but the idea is during that break you don't want to really think about the code uh directly right you want to give your mind a break just kind of to sort through things all right greg says i'd like to see the css okay good so after this next session i will go through some of the css of how i'm doing some of these things um okay phoenix did does say it's mostly just background attachment uh fixed property and css yeah that is how we do it so i i will go through and show the css on the screen um but that is basically you know how we do it with the background attachment fix i have heard that that can be a little bit uh resource intense intensive so just be careful with it i would never use background attachment fixed on lots of images on the same page i almost you just use it in one place per page uh and otherwise you may have some some jankiness with the scroll okay didn't quite get through every all the questions so um let me mark down somewhere where i left off at let's just do it here i'm gonna open up a new terminal and let's see okay so my time 12 29 pm is the time stamp on the question where i'm going to pick up at next time wow note says that's wild i'm not sure why that's taking so long oh why is it we we can work around it uh if we need to let me start the timer all right so we left off kind of just showing where we need to make the changes uh on you know the actual site and then we also found it in the code so let's go in here we're actually just going to remove these sections so let's go to this first one first and we'll scroll down to the section that has the header affordable okay so you can see in we're using materialize so we've this whole thing is just an unordered list so within each li we have two divs the first div is the header okay so we've marked that as collapsible header with a class and then we have the body which is collapsible body within the body we did put some p tags in um but we could put whatever we wanted in that in that body but what we need to do here is just remove this li completely okay so we evidently we no longer want to advertise this program as affordable so i don't know i don't make the marketing decisions so i don't know whether that's a good idea or not a good idea but i that's that's the instructions that that i have um let's see who's that at why franciscan oops i accidentally minimized the entire section instead of just um this part there we are so let's minimize that and now let's open up this section and find that same thing so we need to look for affordable there we are so we're going to remove in this case you could see we have everything split up each section is split up into columns so the first div gives us column classes we split up the entire site into 12 columns and we say based on the screen size how many columns we wanted to take up now in this case we've actually set it to always be full width when we've done these two sets of columns here really we don't need that second piece probably at some point uh i had different values here and then i just i left it in well i'm going to leave it in there now don't really want to go through refactoring on this stream um then within that column we make we have another div with a class of card so just to kind of show you what's going on here so you can see this is the card this box here on the page uh and each card has some certain styling like two pixel border radius we have a specific box shadow for a card okay so and in a different color so you see the background is pure white on the cards and it's uh off white uh slightly gray in the normal background so that's what our card div does and then inside the card we have certain sections so we have a div for the card content and in this case everything in this particular card is going inside that uh this helps uh because it adds some some you know basic padding and things uh we don't want our our text right up against the edge that doesn't look nice um and then finally you know we have within there we have our card title uh and we've we've made these you know spans to give it you know a particular look uh card title text theology that's interesting i wonder why i left this in here looks like i copied and pasted this from previous website and never got rid of that class so it's kind of fun to look back in to see what was i doing um and then within with this card content we've also put a paragraph tag a p tag and with our our text in here and we've given it a class of flow text in materialized css it comes with a class called flow text which actually changes the font size of the text based on the screen width which i think is really cool but in this case we need to remove this section all the other sections are laid out the same way all the other you know for the different cards uh we're going to save that and it looks like we need to make one more change and this is just a text change let's check on first let's check on what's going on here wow still nothing i'm really wishing that i would have installed all those packages first now uh so i just i didn't think it would take that long you know i just wanted to show you all the process uh so it looks like we may not get to see all the packages installed after all uh we need to go down to where we find the affordable card oops i'm sorry the supportive card which should have been right under the affordable one so supportive and we're just going to add in a bit of text so right after this help we're going to put our students i'm sorry students and faculty and students and cohort style learning okay so close interactions between faculty and students and cohort style learning help you feel supported throughout your academic career okay looks good i'm just going to copy and paste this as well because we're going to use the same text up here in this other section as well and are we at oops i did it again i closed the wrong wrong thing uh we're gonna close this open this this is our our um accordion style text so in here this is where i'm going to paste in the new stuff there we are okay so now we have our text here and it looks like those are all the changes that we need so now let's make sure that it all looks alright uh let's see what our okay so since we never changed the styles this will work uh for us to be able to um see what's on the page without having our our server running so we did we would have had a gulp server running but and that would compile our scss or sas for us but we made no changes so we should be good luckily we didn't have to make any changes so i'm just gonna open up did it work oh it worked yes cool okay um so let's do i believe it's gulp watch it'll let me know if that's not the right command i'm i'm not going to go over this unless you all want me to because this is definitely not basic html uh stuff here let's see what's let's open this up here so we can see our changes uh but basically what gulp watch is doing for us is uh it's gonna watch all our files and it's serving up our website locally so that every time we make a change it automatically is reflected here otherwise we would have to do a manual refresh which is not a big deal but it takes an extra second or so if you're working on a site day in and day out all those seconds it starts to get pretty annoying to have to do that so much better when you do this it also lets you do cool things like you do your css in sas syntax uh scss syntax and it automatically compiles it for you which is very cool uh so let's just check out you know did our right we don't have affordable in here anymore it's gone we have our cohort style learning text in there uh we have our new our new text here it looks good and we have our new logo but we can see there's some issues with our new logo uh we don't have the proper padding so let's compare right this logo worked probably because the this is a ping file and it came built in with some padding so we didn't have to add it ourselves uh did we have yeah so what we need to do here since our svg didn't really come in with enough it it doesn't have enough padding built in we need to add it so let's check out in dev tools so we're going to inspect it whenever we need to make css changes i really like to make the changes in dev tools first just so that i can see it you know immediately and then i transfer once i'm happy with how it looks then i transfer the code over to our actual files you can even set up dev tools so that it will actually edit your files from dev tools it'll edit them i haven't had it set up yet uh maybe one day i'll do it like that because that does seem like a cool feature that would be you know it saves some time alright so here's our logo here's our image and then it's wrapped in an a tag that's interesting let's see huh okay so our image actually is overhanging a bit and it's not really the end of the world that it's doing this i don't like it um let's see yeah that's odd i wonder why our image did we set a height let's see if there's a height set on there actually you know what i'm i'm sorry this is uh this font's way too small let me make it bigger okay that's a bit bigger and i know my my face is probably covering up a bit of this so i'll try to make sure that i scroll properly so that um you all can see it may still be a bit too small i'm afraid to make it much bigger though because we won't be able to see enough uh for it to um if it even makes sense um whoops all right yeah you know what i'm not exactly sure why we're getting such a weird height on this interesting okay well we can at least switch it up and say i i really do want the margin let's change up our margins here so i i don't want margin top at all i want to set a margin all the way around so let's do just regular margin and we're going to set our top value to 8 pixels and uh we're going this is just going to be to start we're going to set our oops our next value which will be our right margin to zero we don't really need a margin there our bottom margin let's set to 8 pixels and then our left margin we're going to set to 8 pixels okay now already we can see an issue here and that this header does not resize uh compared to this so we're probably gonna have to manually change the height of this nav okay and actually i don't really like that idea i i don't think this nav needs to be bigger than that i like it to be a little bit more slim so we can decrease the size of this logo and then that way we can keep the header the same size so we're going to give this logo a height of 60 pixels now it makes it a lot smaller but we can go with a smaller logo here because we have this big fus at the top and actually franciscan university yup so you can see here the words are are just not that easy to read so we couldn't go any smaller uh now you know what i just thought of this i wonder if i'm gonna go with this logo right now but i wonder if the the logo that actually says the word franciscan would be better here at least on the desktop we certainly have the space for it uh so maybe maybe that might be the way to go uh yeah let me see what you all think let me know what you all think about that uh should we go with the one that says franciscan at least on desktop uh yeah we'll um yeah we'll have to see about that for now i think this works and uh let's change this now in our actual uh sas file so we have our styles.scss file if you're familiar with normalcss and you've never seen this it might look a bit weird at first first of all you notice we have variables for all our our colors okay so when i go to say a color down below i don't need to put the hex value i just put the variable this is really nice because later on if i wanted to change the theme i could just change all these colors up here and then it would automatically change them throughout um all the rest of the css it's really really kind of cool uh let's see we need to go to our logo right no it's that that's a sidenav logo so we haven't styled that yet uh let's check our nav brand logo image yep this is it this is what we need uh so if you remember we we lowered the size to 60 and then we changed instead of margin top we're gonna do regular margin and we did uh eight pixels and zero eight pixels and what's the last one eight pixels right yeah it was eight all the way around uh not that this really mattered you know entirely but uh that's what we have here so when we save it you'll see it'll change in the css folder so right now this is white meaning it hasn't changed but it should change colors once we change this so i'm going to save it there we are so you can see we had a color change all right to indicate that these files were modified right so we could see our css so that automatically changes the sas syntax into css which is important because browsers can interpret css but not sas so not this s css so it's nice to be able to develop with this because we have features like those variables that i showed you but unfortunately browsers can't handle that with the latest versions of css though you can do things like variables so there's less need for scss but you know it's still if you're already used to using it it's still valuable if you haven't used it yet i would probably just learn the newer versions of css and not worry about learning s css now that's just my opinion i may be missing some you know reasons why you would want to learn it but uh from my experience i'd say you know just don't don't worry about it unless you have to um you know if you're working on an old project that uses it obviously you need to learn it but um otherwise you really shouldn't need it so we can see we'll do a refresh uh just to make sure that anything we put in there uh is taken out of uh the dev tools to ensure our styles are still there so there's our styles it works it looks okay let's go down a bit so we can make this uh sidebar happen there we are and now we can check so here our logo still works which is great and then here actually our logo it it still works here uh so it's interesting let's inspect this okay all right so a few things that i don't like about this uh this a tag is not okay i guess it works i was worried that you couldn't click okay so that works uh i think the image could actually be bigger and it would be okay so actually that's that's interesting all right let me show you what i what i mean by that so our sidenav logo um should have a height of 80 pixels but it seems that we've i've messed up at some point so i should not have given this the class brand logo i should take that class out so let's see what happens when we remove that class oh okay so wow all right let's check out where we're using brand logo uh you know what i know why uh brand logo probably comes it's probably one of the classes that comes built in uh so i i still want to take it out and let's add in some styles of our own okay i didn't i wasn't 100 happy with that the way that was styled and i do i want to keep the styles for these two logos separate so instead let's style it here just in dev tools and let's see so that class was actually on this a tag but what i'm gonna do is put some styles directly on this image um so let's go with heights um let me see sidenav logo okay so the li is logo so the li itself has a height of 80. okay all right that makes more sense now okay so on the image itself let's go with a width of 100 there we go that makes it a bit smaller we definitely want a margin on the top and bottom uh so let's go margin 8 pixels and then zero for the sides and it's too tall so let's do heights um 70 pixels let's see what that gets us down to yeah that's still too small i want this to be a bit bigger see what i'd i'd like is this to line up with this side and that looks about right so let's take it to 94 pixels and then what we'll need to do with this li is make the height 94 pixels so that they match and then we'll make sure you know that's it needs to be larger than that let's take it up to 110 there we are great and we still need we don't want this to change color when we hover over it so we have to make sure that we we do that as well okay so let's make the changes before we forget what they are so um our side nav logo uh this is going to be would we go up to 110 110 pixels and within logo we want to do this a tag and on the a tag we want to make this have a and hover like that and then also so within sas you do nesting so it saves us some typing here and uh then it gets interpreted in the css like uh you know sidenav.logo you know and then there'd be another one sidenav uh dot logo uh colon you know hover right so there would it would make it normal css but we can take advantage of you know kind of this uh this nesting that looks nice all right and then one more we need oops within the a tag we have our image tag so let's do the image and within our image let's just copy what we've done here save us the typing and there we are let's save that because i should change my indentation so we're going to save that and see what it looks like here after we give it a refresh sometimes it's it's good to refresh the page uh because what you've done in dev tools will stay there so you won't you'll think that what you've done worked but really it's just what you did in devtools beforehand so you want to clear that all out first uh so if you only change one thing you could probably do it manually whoa see after i refreshed it we can see there's some crazy stuff going on here and it looks like i forgot to save i've in index i forgot to remove that brand logo class i did it in dev tools but not in my actual uh html so that's what we're gonna do right now there we are which to be honest with you we don't really need these logos to be links because it's a onepage site so like why you don't need to navigate anywhere so we don't need links like that but anyway all right cool so this looks alright uh we hover over this we don't get a weird color change and it's this is not overlapping uh wonderful okay as i'm looking at the site i see so many other things that i would want to change but i can't i can't take the time right now this is not my main project so i'm gonna stick with what i was given so for now looks like this works um yeah everything looks fine everything works uh oh my timer ran out so let me go to the live chat here and uh here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna do another five minute break and then i'm gonna show you how we uh push these changes to github and how i update uh the site and that'll be the last thing that we do for this stream so let me see okay i'm trying to just pick up right where i left off uh with the questions in the live chat okay greg asked is there any way to get the background to scroll to just at a slower rate uh yeah definitely um you can do that so you what you would do in that case is uh most like you you'd want to use some javascript to uh change the scroll change the position on the page of that image on scroll so you're gonna need an event listener for the scroll and then tied to that it's gonna change the directly change the um i guess since the background image it would be the background position of that that image so it can be done i think um so the the guy uh travis who used to do the devtip show i think he did a show on parallax images where he shows where you can do that so if you check out his channel and uh try to maybe search in his videos for the term parallax check out his videos on that and he he does a lot with that if if you're interested uh gokul says i'm in i'm a civil engineering student from india my passion was to learn computer science so i'm going to drop out of uh my college and learn computer science by watching these tutorials wow um that's a big decision i just say if that's what you really want to do go for it but definitely think about it uh i'm not sure how far you are in your engineering program but if you're close to being done with it you might want to think about sticking with it or if you have some sort of scholarship where you can go to school without paying that much money you may want to think about it as well otherwise i'd say you know go for it good luck and you know definitely we'll try to help you here in in this stream as much as we can uh and there are a lot of good free resources out there to help you learn michael noticed the unnecessary a tag as well you probably noticed that way before i did most likely what i had done is copied this over from somewhere else either one of my previous projects or maybe the like the default template for materialize and um just never changed it yeah the hashtag it as the atrium is it it just takes you to like you just stay on the same page right if you don't know what you want to link to you can just put that in there and you'll stay on the same page uh it's more like a placeholder so it's there but it doesn't really do anything in this case oh heart should ask where's pompom the dark theme timer you know what since i'm on my laptop uh this was already open i don't think i ever um use pompom on my laptop because normally i stream from work so i'll have to switch to that because i do love that dark theme let's see okay and lee also asked to show some of the css so i will definitely do that uh lucas says uh good morning good morning thanks for watching um gokul asks says are you in college no i'm not in college i i work for a college i am skipping a lot of the conversation that's in between people so if you watch the replay uh you should be able to see the chat like as it happened during the live stream so you can check that out if you want uh but i don't want you all to think that i'm ignoring the chat but uh just trying to to skip over to make sure i get to all the questions all right i'm gonna set this 25 minute timer for another session i really don't expect this to go longer than 25 minutes though uh since everything's pretty much done we just need to um to make it live so here's a few things that we need to do we do need to make uh like we need to build this so it goes into dist and we do we need to double check that the logos go over so i don't remember on this project if i have it set up to automatically push uh images into the disk folder we'll see um but here's what we we need to do i'm gonna get rid of or i'm gonna stop this this server we don't really need it right now and i'm gonna do a gulp dist all right so this is gonna change our files we'll see how long it takes there we are uh so it looks like nothing injected in html let's double check to make sure a change really did happen in dist yep it changed let's see what files changed in particular so our css did which is expected and our index did all right great now notice this side nav logo is still there so evidently i don't have it set up to pull over images so let's manually change this you see i didn't really have that many images so i suppose i just figured hey why why take the trouble to set that up if i'm not even going to use it and let's copy this and see if it'll let me paste it yep all right cool so now we have this logo here as well and now uh let's do a git commit so let's check our status forget if you're not familiar with using git it's a way to track all your changes and have lots of little tiny like save points for your code so that you can go back to previous points if you mess something up uh and you can see the whole history of the project you can see what if there are multiple people working on it you can see who did what um you know when so there's a lot a big advantage to using this git is one of the most popular uh version control systems there are other systems and if you use git you can store your code and all your your get commits on github so that other people can view it and help out with your code so that's what we're doing here so what i want to do first is do git add and i'm going to put a period means add everything so now if we do another get status you can see we've changed you know everything is now green that means it's it's ready to be committed it's in it's staged now in the staging area so before we had some stuff was read and modified uh some stuff says deleted and this stuff was totally new it wasn't being tracked at all now everything's here so the next step is to do a git commit and i'm going to use this m flag here so hyphen m and that's going to allow me to do a commit message right there in line so our commit message is going to be update or it's going to be add new logo and text all right it's pretty general i try to keep the commit messages uh really short so we probably could say a bit more about exactly what we changed but we'll be able to see on github exactly what changed so we don't really need to describe every detail right that's not what the commit message is for uh so that looks good i'm gonna hit enter here and we'll see that's all committed now we can do a get push and that's gonna send all that up to github so if any of you are checking out the github repo now if you refresh the page you'll see all those changes are now there in the github repo now to i i have what's called flight plan up to push this stuff to the server this doesn't always work so let's see if it'll work and uh if it does work then i'll explain how it works if it doesn't work then i'll just update manually later but let's try this we'll go fly the command is fly production and what it should do is automatically log into our server and move all the files over and we have to do we have to run our gulp disk and our git stuff before we do this because it uses git to determine what files change and it only copies over the files that change so instead of copying over all your files all the time it saves a lot of time by just copying what's changed so it's it's pretty cool uh all right cool so it looks like that worked let's verify by going to the live site and you all can do this too if you go to the live site and let's refresh the page awesome really cool great yeah that works let's double check down here yep looks like everything's fine everything works uh let's do a check for the mobile size just to be sure all right that looks good okay looks okay that does look a bit big to me now that i i see it it probably looks huge on mobile it's acceptable for now this is a very low traffic site so it's not it's not a great use of my time to nitpick the design here i mean i'd love to have all my sites be perfect but realistically um i need to be aware of uh the value of my time and the value of each project uh and this one is just not um it's not likely to bring in enough value to the university uh to justify putting that much more time into it at this point if i get some other projects finished and have a little bit of time where i'm not really working on anything that never happens but if it happens then it would be a good idea to come back to it but right now there the main website is more important uh but it looks like yep everything looks good all right cool so uh we've successfully um pulled down a repository from github we've cloned it we've installed all the proper packages on our machine we've changed out images we've changed out uh text we've updated the css uh to handle what we've done with the image okay we've used an svg image in place of a ping uh and we've successfully uh use tr is it transpiled scss or compiled site i don't know we've converted scss into css right we've behind the scenes everything actually got minified as well when we did our um our gulp disk command all right and then we've pushed all those changes up to the server using flight plan js uh and updated it on git so we did get a lot done and now i'm gonna go back i'm gonna stop this timer because we don't really need it anymore and i'm gonna go through all of the changes or i'm sorry all of the rest of the questions and comments in the live chat and then we'll we'll finish up for today i also want to let you all know um i'm going to try to do stream tomorrow but i may not be able to because i'm going to be speaking at the moms can code virtual summit at 1 pm eastern time so if anyone's interested you can sign up i don't think it's very expensive uh to sign up it's been going on all week so there's still talks today tomorrow and all day friday so um if you're interested you know check it out uh probably that probably won't be available that video uh except on the moms can code platform uh but so if i can stream i it'll probably be earlier in the day so i'll do what i can i'll i'll try to get a stream in but i may not be able to uh but i'll definitely try to stream on friday and uh use my my new uh webcam which hopefully will be in by then all right michael creole asks why use two separate divs and not media quiz okay so we actually are using media queries and div so behind the scenes uh we have let me scroll down to where those are my franciscan okay so behind the scenes this class hide on large only is is actually media queries and hide on medium and down are media queries uh to say whether or not something is hidden or shown so so we want to display really entirely different things depending on the screen with so we're using the media queries to just give something a display none or a display block uh john hanson says are the name attributes on divs for hash scroll um and div it should be data name instead of name for this attribute shows how well browsers are very forgiving to html uh yeah so the um uh the name yeah the name is um for i have a it is so normally you can just use anchor tags to scroll down the page but the scroll is very abrupt so i don't like that so i just made a little javascript function that slows down the rate of scroll uh so it looks a little bit nicer um yeah and i guess you can use uh data name yeah it really i don't know if it will matter but at this point at least browsers are fine with this with these custom properties um so it doesn't really matter if you use data name or not i don't know is there some plan to make it so that you can't do these uh and you have to use data name if there is it'd be good to know about but um yeah as far as it's been my experience that you know these custom attributes work without prefixing it with data hyphen yeah john hur uh john hanson said yes sass yeah i haven't used it in a while uh mark uh paglia asks if anyone is using notepad uh notepad qq for uh ubuntu i i don't use ubuntu as a desktop operating system so i i definitely have not there are a few people that do use it i think in that watch the stream sometimes so uh they might be able to let you know let's see uh zach asked if i was laying in bed no i'm not i'm laying in a recliner but actually that um it's probably misleading because i like this literally is like a tablecloth that serves as like my wall for my office in the basement so uh it probably does look like i'm laying in bed because it looks like a sheet or something how cool would it be if you had a set up where your monitors were like on the ceiling and you could just lay embedding code it'd probably be hard to stay awake though but it would be the most comfortable setup uh zack says cozy coder yeah when i work from home it definitely is very comfortable uh zach also says nice code editor uh thanks and he says annie uses yarn uh with the little little heart symbol after so yeah definitely definitely like yarn uh alex asked did i just hear a lady in the background speaking portuguese you may have heard someone in the background because uh my wife is just um she's actually like right next to me on an exercise bike uh doing some coding as well i think she's actually trying to take an instagram pic right now so uh um so she doesn't speak portuguese she may have been listening to um a talk on um the moms code virtual summit so i'm actually i think i'm missing a talk right now which i was hoping to be finished early enough to not miss one but oh well uh yeah but i don't know about portuguese okay horseshit's saying enable editor.format on save on vs code settings okay cool i'll have to do that i'm not going to try to do it right now because everything's so slow in my machine it's just it's somewhat annoying we'll see at what point i get so annoyed that i really try to like do something about it there is a way that i can run obs on a separate computer to so that my computer will run faster i might try to set that up uh uh frankie said i had to step away for a moment oh yeah no problem uh frankie says we understand uh jesse in regard to skipping over comments to get to the questions smiley face all right thanks thanks for understanding yeah i used before i really like to read all the comments so that people watching later uh the recordings would get to see them but now that youtube uh lets people see all the comments even on the replay i just don't think there's a need for me to do that so i could keep the videos you know a bit shorter uh if i don't read everything so hopefully that's all right with you all let's see harsh it says uh javascript af progress thoughts so uh javascript af is a side project that um horoshit and i and nikki have been working on and uh javascripter who's i don't know if javascript is here or not right now um so realistically harshit uh has been doing a ton of the work lately in nikki um i haven't done much at all um but uh we're hoping to launch soon it's uh basically just gonna be a uh like a web app where uh you can go to highlight some of your github repositories and you can vote and i'd like to highlight some of the um javascript repositories that are not very well known uh see you know we all know what the top repositories are like react is huge right so you know it people know about those but i want to get to like that next level of repositories that you know they're doing really cool things uh but maybe they're not getting noticed so this would be kind of an easier way to just check out javascript repositories search for them and let people know what you think is is really cool that's going on so that should be launching sometime in may i think but anyway horseshit i i think everything's going well so far um i haven't had a ton of time to check you know check out all the details but in terms of functionality it's getting really close to being complete all right so phoenix says the logo on the side menu look huge i checked at my machine yeah i was afraid of that uh maybe i'll go back in and change it i'm not gonna do it right now but i'll check it out on my cell phone and just to see uh if if it's like extremely too big then i'll go back in and change it um let's see inna says thanks for your strength oh yeah you're welcome no problem thanks for watching and anna it watches uh frequently so and always has really good questions not always code related but that's kind of cool i get to talk about other stuff uh so thanks for that anna dimitri says jesse uh you're very good man i see your streams always oh thanks thanks i appreciate it thanks for watching uh harry asked the free code camp was down um i have no idea i haven't tried to log into free code camp today so it's possible let's see so i don't have anything to do with um like the servers for the free killcam.org so um i i can't do anything about that uh sorry if they are down though i'm sure they'll be working on them to get them up as soon as possible phoenix says it looks even bigger in mobile um yeah maybe i will have to change that then michael says by the way i got a scholarship for google's mobile specialist nano degree on udacity it's a six month program that cost 1200 dollars so i'm kind of stoked hopefully i'll find a remote job by the time it's finished wow congratulations congratulations that is awesome um i'm really really happy for you you'll definitely have to let me know how it's going how the program's going and what kind of cool stuff you're learning um that's that's really cool no life says hi i'm new to coding now i'm learning html and css at w3schools when is a good time to start making something on my own is html css good enough to make something for my portfolio or should i learn javascript first you can definitely do really cool stuff with with css in html uh you know check out on codepen uh a lot of the cool stuff that people do without javascript so you can definitely make things with just css and html that are awesome to put on your portfolio um sarah drazner does so much really cool stuff uh with css uh i'm trying like who else i'm drawing a blank um christina gorton coffee craft code all right uh my wife's name from the other christina gorton from coffee craft code um does really cool stuff with css um uh una kravitz does really cool stuff so uh check them out find them on twitter and and check out what they're doing um but yeah definitely obviously if you want to do this as a career you would you want to learn some javascript but if you just really feel like making something cool then html and css are definitely enough to get started with it all right michael says uh thanks uh went through the threemonth tryout and got the news about getting to the finals yesterday that's really awesome um actually my wife went through the tryout as well and um and she just found out she got into the uh the front end uh nanodegree so uh i'd have i know i know what you're going through michael with that uh at least from you know from watching my wife uh go through it so um yeah really really happy for you again congratulations alex said it sounded like she was scolding a kid in portuguese she was probably scolding a kid but uh not in portuguese though that would sound cool okay so it looks like free code camp may actually be down right now so um heart should ask uh if he can put the link in here for javascript.af yeah for sure put the link in if it blocks you um i'll i'll allow it i'll show it um just lost my place it scrolled me down automatically um harsha's assume that some of the people can give testing data i need data yeah yeah for sure that's a great idea so um uh let's put the link in here you know what harsh i can is it the same link you gave me earlier for testing let me see if i can find it uh maybe i closed it i hope i didn't close it uh i'm let's see i think i may have closed it i'll have to uh it looks like karsha is going to put the link in so um oh okay so free code camp is working for harshit and it's working for phoenix so maybe it's back online uh rajish says uh are you using any css framework yes so for this particular project i'm using materialize css it is a bit of an older version of materialize so it may look different than you know if you're used to using the updated version um let's see oh michael says uh tell the wife congratulations i will hey back michael says congratulations she says thanks all right her yeah clickable i didn't nothing came up in the live chat i don't know if you're trying to put um put the uh link in there or not the beep sound uh that was the uh we have an exercise bike and uh i guess something happened did you do all right so she was she's doing an hour on the exercise bike and that was the timer said it kind of triggered me the beep noise triggered you um oh okay to here would it be all right so there's the link ah it wasn't clickable let me let me do a clickable version all right so uh there's a link now it's jsaf.now.sh if you'd like to check out the the project um the side project that i described a little bit earlier um you go there sign in with your github account and then um click on the little edit icon in the bottom uh right hand corner and add some of your repositories to javascript af and that will give us some more data please give some feedback on what you think and um hopefully this would be a good thing for the whole you know community that you know that's the goal uh so if you wanna you know help out working on it or submit a pull request or anything um it's it's on github uh i believe you can find uh the repository for it on javascript af so um when you get in there you can see it and um you can check it out contribute you know how whatever you want um oh yeah our says feel free to make issues on github yeah if you see something that's messed up go to the github repo and make an issue uh that'll be the you know the best way and put any details screenshots whatever you need to uh to explain the issue uh rajiv says do you have any javascript es6 tutorials i haven't done one personally but on this channel the free codecamp youtube channel uh we i believe we do have some uh some tutorials so just search for that among the videos uh i think we have some uh i may do some tutorials along those lines on my own youtube channel so if you're interested in in my own videos tutorial videos uh check out the link in the description and subscribe to my channel i've been a little behind on making videos but now that i'm i'm buying what i need to have a more proper setup for doing videos hopefully i'll be able to get you know get more done one of the issues with making videos before was low quality and then if i tried to use my camera on my phone which is a good quality i didn't have a tripod so it was kind of always at an awkward angle so uh anyway i'm hoping to make some new videos soon it's been a while uh since i've done that and um let's see uh phoenix asks uh jesse what is getter uh it's just like a chat uh thing so you can go on there and um you know we we chat about the stream and help each other out with things all right so i'm at the bottom of the chat now and this has been an hour and a half long stream um so definitely a nice uh nice length here uh thank you all so much for watching and for helping out i know it i think we had a lot of new viewers because at one point we had 103 viewers uh on at the same time which is uh uh which is really really awesome um so if you're new uh and you you liked it come on back we do a lot of things all the way from basic html up to more advanced react things uh we do some back end stuff occasionally set up servers like we we do a lot uh most most of what you would need to be a frontend developer or a little bit of like back end as well we do here um so uh and let me know i love feedback on the stream so send me a message you know somewhere i'm on twitter i'm on all the social media stuff so you know send me a message let me know what i can improve about these streams i want to make it better for you all let me know what you like about them and uh i may be back tomorrow tomorrow i got a lot going on so may not be able to stream tomorrow but i think friday um i'm pretty sure i'll be able to do a stream so uh i'll see y'all then um and until then have a wonderful day
