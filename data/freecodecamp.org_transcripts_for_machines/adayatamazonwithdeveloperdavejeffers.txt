hi everybody my name is Dave Jeffers and I'm a software developer at lab 126 for Amazon and today I'm going to let you guys tag along with me so off to work and I'm on my way to the Detroit office I've just arrived at work I'm walking to the building and right here we got a great view of the GM building and Hart Park and on the other side of the park there's River and Canada I just got to the office and I'm at my desk and the first thing I'm going to do is go through my email I got about 40 emails to go my desk is kind of a mess right now cuz I don't come in here very often I made it through emails so the next thing I'm going to go through is code review requests most of my emails I got this morning were code review requests so I'm going to open up our Garrett tool and start looking at code and reviewing it please add more comments and logging code reviews took up most of the morning and now I'm out for lunch I walked on Cadillac Square see all the food trucks behind me I'm going to grab a bite to eat just got back from lunch and now it's time to get some work done I'm opening up our jira tool and I'm looking at what's assigned to me for the bugs and tasks that I have to do I'm going to work on whatever is at the top of the list and and unfortunately I can't tell you what it's about but it is interesting and Cutting Edge I'm still in the video conference room and I'm about to dial into a standup meeting in the standup meeting we're going to share what we've been working on me and my team uh to keep everybody informed and uh to keep my manager informed all right that meeting is done and on to the next meeting the next meeting we have is a planning meeting for a future project which I can't tell you B basically anything about but I will say I will be working with Alexa all right that meeting's done so now I'm going to go review some more of this planning for this project and then I'm going to uh go over it with the architect make sure I understand everything correctly uh this is something I'm going to be programming in the near future um and then I'm going to head home and I think that's next time I'll talk to you guys so I'll see you back there all right folks so I'm back home and I'm working in my home home office and as you can see down here I got my laptop I'm working on xcode right now finishing up and building here pretty soon I have my devices iPhone and an Android device an Amazon tablet and a Fire TV hooked up and pretty soon here I'm going to build and test the fix I've been working on and we are building all right so I've run two builds and I have built two libraries and now built the sample app so we can test what's uh test the change that I did and here we go and we're going to test playing elephant stream on Fire TV and it looks like it is working we don't have any crashes there's no crashes in the logs it looks like we're doing good and now let's see if my wife wants to watch elephant stream on the Fire TV in the living room ha hey okay so now that we're happy that everything's working and all the test pass the unit test passed as well uh we're we're going to create a commit and uh push our code change to get all right so our code change is up and Garrett ready for people to review I sent out review requests and oh look that we already got one review let's see what it says um needs more comments and log lines all right guys so that is basically a typical day I'm about to call it a day um there's lots of other stuff that we also do and of course it's going to be different from Team to team that you work on here at Amazon but I hope that gives you a good idea of what it's like in a life and a day at Amazon
