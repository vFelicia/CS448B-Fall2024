hi my name is luke siciliano i'm a web developer i'm also selfemployed i've done a video before for free code camp on the topic of whether or not you should go the freelancer selfemployment route after you're done learning how to code we're going to link to that video in the description below now assuming that you've decided hey i think i want to be a freelancer i think i'm going to start my own company i think i want to work for myself rock on good for you i think you should go for it i think you're going to find the experience incredibly rewarding both financially and personally with that being said there are a lot of things that come along with running your own business that can cause a lot of people to feel intimidated and that's the due to the fact that when you're working for yourself you have to deal with a lot of things that in the past an employer handled for you things such as how do i deal with health insurance vendors because when you've got a job you just sign up for the plan the employer gives you well now you've got to figure out where to get health insurance from things such as how do i pick a provider for my retirement account because again when you're employed your employer just you know says here's who we go through you're going to go through vanguard fidelity whatever and you just sign up for their plan of the things you have to start dealing with when you're selfemployed perhaps the issue that intimidates entrepreneurs more than anything else is the topic of taxes you know people might be concerned about um how much am i going to be taxed on how do i pay my taxes during the course of the year how do i get money to the government so on so forth i am here to tell you that the issue of taxes which we're going to break down on all this in a second is not something that you need to be intimidated over and you certainly don't let it need to let it intimidate you to the point that you decide not to start your own company okay you've just learned how to code you can learn how to deal with these kinds of issues so just understand working for yourself means continuous learning you're going to learn how to deal with issues and you're going to be successful all right so do not let these kinds of issues especially taxes intimidate you out of working for yourself so in this video what i'm going to do is talk about three things number one i'm going to talk about what it is you actually are responsible to pay taxes on uh what's what's your income when you're selfemployed i'm going to talk about how you can structure your business to manage your tax obligations and then i'm going to provide some kind of basics that we do in our business um you know to help streamline some of these issues one thing i'm going to really stress before i get into this is the fact that i am not a licensed tax professional i am not holding myself out as one um i am not holding myself as any kind of a financial advisor these are things you really need to talk to a lawyer about talk to a tax accountant about so on and so forth to figure out what's best for your particular situation what i'm doing in this video is sharing my knowledge with you and explaining to you what what we do in our business so with that being said let's look at what it is you actually pay taxes on in other words what's your income when you're selfemployed a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that everything that comes into the business is their income so in other words person one writes you a check to build a website person two writes you uh pays you cash i should say to build an app uh person uh number three uh you know get pays you on a credit card to build some local software that they want to run all those things come into your business that is not your income that's your revenue everything that comes into the business that anyone pays you is what's called your revenue so your revenue is everything that comes in you have expenses which are everything you pay out to run the business maybe you had to write a check to amazon web services maybe you had to rent an office maybe you had to pay the utilities at that office that's the money you spent to make money so everything that comes in is your revenue minus everything that goes out is your expenses and after that you get what's called your net income okay so under our little scenario here let's say during the course of a year you brought in 120 000 in revenue 10 000 a month again building websites building apps whatever during the course of the year your business paid out twenty thousand dollars you had to rent an office you paid amazon web services uh you know you had to pay utilities at the office you know things of that nature so you brought in 120 000 in revenue you paid out 20 000 in expenses that leaves you net income of 100 000 so at the end of the year when you're reporting your income to the irs this is the number you report as income one hundred thousand dollars and this is the amount that you will be taxed on so depending how you structure things a certain percentage of this is what you're going to pay to the government you are not going to pay a percentage of your revenue you're going to pay a percentage of your net income generally speaking okay now how much of this 100 000 you pay to the government and how you pay it to the government during the course of the year um will depend on how you structure your business so now let's take a look at three ways that you can structure your business there's a lot more than this but for the purposes of this video i'm gonna go over the three that if i had to guess are the most common for uh freelancers small entrepreneurs things of that nature one is a sole proprietorship i've got solep for that one is an llc which is a limited liability company and the third is to choose to tax yourself as an s corporation or an s corp i'm going to talk about each of these in turn sole proprietorship means you don't go out and start a separate business in other words you're doing this as an individual you don't go out and start an entity you don't go start a company um you know so in other words instead of starting an llc or an s corporation i just go out and get a business license and i start building websites and doing these things for people individually and then they write a check you know directly to me and then that all goes into my revenue so that's a sole proprietorship it's not a separate entity you know you're just handling things directly and at the end of the year you're if you're a sole proprietor you're going to attach what's called a schedule cd or tax return and that schedule c will report your income or your revenue your expenses and the 100 000 in income and what this person will want to do since they're not getting a paycheck they're selfemployed is every quarter they're going to send some money in to the irs and then that's going to be the same as having or in lieu of i should say having withholdings from a paycheck and then you make those estimated quarterly tax payments to make sure at the end of the year you don't get hit with a huge uh tax obligation because of the fact that you have income from that so sole proprietor again just to be a little repetitive not a separate entity just an individual essentially an individual for business license money comes into the business or i should say into them personally every quarter they send an estimated tax payment into the irs at the end of the year they report their income on their schedule c on their personal tax return uh if their estimated tax payments cover their obligations and they don't owe anything else if they overpaid their tax obligations they'll get a little bit of a refund if they underpaid they have to write the irs a check that's how sole proprietor works another option is an llc this is stands for limited liability company as opposed to a sole proprietorship this is an actual separate entity you have started a separate entity a separate business and what happens is the llc you start the llc the llc gets a business license all this revenue comes into the llc in a bank account in the llc's name all these expenses get paid out of the bank account that's in the llc's name at the end of the day the money that's left over gets distributed to the owners the owners write themselves a check they call it a distribution and that's how they get their money from the business the llc does not pay any taxes okay um at the end of the year the owner is going to get what's called a k1 it's a tax form the owner is going to get a k1 from the llc saying llc had 120 000 in revenue llc had 20 000 in expenses llc profits are 100 000 the individual owner will pay taxes on the 100 000 on their personal tax return same as with a sole proprietorship if you're going the llc route what you want to do is send in quarterly tax payments to the irs so at the end of the year you don't just have to write a huge check for your taxes and it also helps you avoid uh getting hit with any penalties so that's an llc the third thing you can do is choose to be taxed as an s corp uh this is what we've done in our business now an s corp is another form of a company but what we've done is we have started an llc and there's a form we can you can file the irs link to in the comment form below where you are telling the irs that we have an llc for tax purposes please consider us an s corp so in other words for all legal purposes we're an llc but as far as the irs is concerned we're an s corporation an s corporation works a little different do you remember with these i was talking about how you just distribute money to yourself as the owner well with an s corp if you're owning the business you're also an employee of the business so you set up payroll just as you would for any employee you're required to pay yourself what's called a reasonable salary and then you any profits on top of the salary you distribute to yourself so in other words let's say you know all after expenses company brings in a hundred thousand dollars let's say an average reasonable salary for a web developer in my area is sixty thousand so you know i run payroll just like i would with any other employee and i pay myself a salary of sixty thousand dollars because i'm required to pay a reasonable salary of myself taxes get withheld out of my paycheck just like they would for any other employee and then after that sixty thousand dollar salary i've got forty thousand dollars in profits left over because a hundred minus sixty is forty i take that forty thousand dollars as a distribution so just like here and here total i'm getting a hundred thousand dollars it's just that here you got distributed a hundred thousand dollars directly here you got distributed a hundred thousand dollars directly here you got sixty thousand dollars in salary and a forty thousand dollar distribution now again this is what we do in our business and i know hearing what i just said this probably sounds way more complicated than these so you're probably wondering why would you want to own the business and be an employee of the business and deal with payroll and give yourself more headaches okay and i understand why people feel that way here's why you do that when you get a paycheck from an employer you are used to federal income tax being held out you also see social security medicare medicaid uh fica those kinds of things being held out of there let's call those things employment taxes social security medicare medicaid those are your employment taxes well when you work for yourself because you're not getting a paycheck no one's withholding anything from your paycheck so i talked about with these you're going to send estimated quarterly payments to the irs but those estimated quarterly payments only apply to your federal income taxes they don't apply to social security medicare medicaid fica employment taxes which is what we're calling them so at the end of the year you're going to have to pay what's called a selfemployment tax on top of your federal income tax and your selfemployment tax is the equivalent of those employment taxes social security medicare medicaid so on so forth so sole proprietor and an llc if you make a hundred thousand dollars on top of your federal income tax you're going to pay employment tax or selfemployment tax on the hundred thousand dollars which is about 6.2 percent so in other words after these people have paid their federal income taxes they're going to pay another 6.2 percent or in this case six thousand two hundred dollars to the government on top of their federal income taxes to make up for the fact that they didn't pay in the social security medicare medicaid during the year they're going to pay selfemployment tax so that's 6 200 bucks on a hundred thousand dollars now let's go down to my scenario again that i gave down here excuse me remember i said you're an employee of the business and you also own the business well when you're an employee and you get a paycheck that means federal income tax gets held out social security medicare medicaid gets held out so that social security medicare medicaid is six point two percent the same as the employment tax that these people pay so on that sixty thousand dollar salary again we said you're getting a sixty thousand dollar salary in a forty thousand dollar distribution out of the hundred on that sixty thousand dollar salary you'll pay the six point two percent employment tax the thing about an s corp is that that forty thousand dollar distribution that we got on top of uh our sixty thousand dollar salary you pay federal income tax on the forty thousand dollars but that forty thousand dollar distribution in other words anything beyond your salary is not subject to the selfemployment tax so in other words you do not pay the six point two percent selfemployment tax on that forty percent profit okay or forty thousand dollar i should say profit which under our hypothetical right here would save you call it twenty five hundred bucks six point two percent of that forty thousand dollar profit profit is roughly twenty five hundred dollars so in other words the sole proprietor pays 6.2 percent employment tax on their entire hundred thousand plus federal income tax on a hundred thousand the llc pays 6.2 percent employment tax and federal income tax on a hundred thousand the s corp owner pays federal income tax on the full hundred thousand because they took sixty thousand salary and they've got forty thousand profit they pay which is a hundred thousand they pay federal income tax on all that but they only pay the employment tax on the salary portion and the profit does not get hit with that 6.2 percent tax so if you were to add up all the obligations at the end of the day this person is going to pay a little bit less in taxes than these people so there are some tax advantages to doing an s corp which is why you're going to go through the extra rigamarole that i talked about a minute ago of setting yourself up as an employee so on so forth now a couple of things about this is you have to pay yourself a reasonable salary you know you know you can't pay yourself five bucks or something like that you have to pay yourself a reasonable salary talk to an accountant talk to your cpa about what is a reasonable salary for you to uh be paying yourself that's issue number one issue number two is that there's some complications that come along with an s corp in the sense that yes you know you have to pay yourself a salary and manage all that don't make that complicated sign up for a payroll service to manage that for you we use uh intuit payroll services in our business there's a lot of different payroll services like adp and whatnot they will if you sign up for your full service options they will manage uh the withholdings for you they will like file your different state and local forms for you so on so forth so you're not buried in paperwork all the time so while setting yourself up as an employee may sound complicated using a service a payroll service to manage that for you actually makes it pretty simple i mean again we use intuit merchant services i would say at the end of the day it's actually pretty seamless having ourselves set up as employees of the company and we save money in taxes at the end of the year you know because of it so again what we do in our business is an llc with an s corp election that's what we do in our business but what's best for your particular situation is something that you need to talk to a lawyer or an accountant about one last thing i want to close on with this is the topic of your expenses one mistake i see a lot of entrepreneurs making is they run the risk of under reporting their expenses there are a lot of things that are expenses for your business that you might not realize uh if you leave your office to drive to a business meeting your mileage might be an expense if you go out to a business dinner with other developers and for work purposes it's possible that the cost of the meal might be a business expense there are lots of things if you have to buy a computer for the office that might be a business expense there are lots of things that business ex that are business expenses that people say hey i'm not sure if this is an expense or not well at the end of the year what those people do is they might have a stack of things that they're not sure if their expenses so they don't give them to the accountant well if the accountant doesn't know about those expenditures they're certainly never going to be counted as expenses on your tax return right so what i would suggest doing is save everything you've got to document your expenses is you know you can't just say my expenses are x you have to have documentation of them save all your receipts document everything er on the side when you're talking about your expenses er on the side of saying something is an expense and at the end of the year give everything to your accountant and have your accountant tell you whether or not something is an expense don't make the mistake of thinking i'll just assume this is not an expense assume it might be and ask your accountant okay because you want to capture all those expenses that you possibly can because again if your revenue is 120 and your expenses are 20 you pay taxes on a hundred thousand dollars well let's say under this scenario there were ten thousand dollars in things of in potential expenses that you missed and you didn't give your to your accountant so that means you brought in 120 you only expense 10 so you pay taxes on 110 000 in other words your tax bill is bigger record everything give it to your accountant and let your accountant tell you whether or not uh something is an expense i'm not saying to just put everything on your tax return as an expense i'm saying ask your accountant about it that's the one last piece of advice i will give now we all know there was a big tax change recently and that the tax code is different for 2018 prior to doing this video i have talked to the cpa that does our taxes and he has um you know what he told me and again this is not advice to you at all what he told me is that this is still the way to go he is advising us to continue to go this way that i've just talked about with our taxes even after the change in uh the recent changes i should say in the tax code so if you have any questions feel free to contact me directly i know this may sound like a lot trust me taxes are not something that should intimidate you out of running your business okay they're just not get a good cpa talk to a lawyer structure your business the right way so you pay as little as tax as necessary make sure you record all your expenses and hey you'll be fine this is what we have cpas and lawyers and stuff for right so again if you have any questions contact me directly and good luck in all your endeavors
