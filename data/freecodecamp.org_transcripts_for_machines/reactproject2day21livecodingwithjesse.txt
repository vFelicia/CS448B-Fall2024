hey everybody it's Jesse and everybody this happened a Good Friday kind of nice end of the week looking forward to to the weekend although I'll still be coding over the weekend I'm sure it's the same with all of you there's always always something to work on today see I want to let you know about a few things before we get started so one really cool code school is having a free weekend so they're courses you go in there and take their courses for free so check that out it's cooked code school comm slash free weekend and thanks to Patrick for putting that in the live chat and in the slack channel for for our live stream so check that out not an official endorsement because I haven't taken courses from code school so I can't say personally whether or not it's a good resource but I checked out some of their courses just the you know the names of of it and I look pretty cool so if you if you don't have anything else going on this weekend then seems like a good opportunity there's one more thing okay I remember I should write this stuff down beforehand so I don't forget I so this is the style guide and I think I've shown this before on live strangers the style guide for the the university that I work for so I made this and this was actually the first react project that I ever worked on the reason that I bring this up now is because I had a comment on a one of my videos and someone had said they found a typo in the style guide and they they were going to submit a pull request to fix it but they couldn't find the repo and I thought that was odd and I thought well maybe I made it private it turns out I did so I made that repo private I'm not sure why but I suspect since it was my first react project I didn't want to look like a noob so I just made it private so now that I'm live on YouTube looking like a noob every day I decided there's no reason that it should be private so I did make it public so that repo is now public on you can find it on my github account which I don't know if I have that linked or not it's linked from my YouTube channel which i think is like linked in the video but anyway if you're interested you can check it out I wouldn't really spend too much time doing if you wanted like let's say to contribute I wouldn't spend too much time on this one because after looking at the code I think I'd really like to redo it and and redo it to the point of maybe it's better just to start a completely new project this was done using create react app but I ejected it really you know really soon into it was maybe like the third or fourth commit said I ran eject and I think I was just curious and wanted to do some things with the setup I wanted to use sass so and at the time I couldn't figure out how to get sass to work without ejecting so anyway it probably has really old versions of everything all the the packages and things are old and it's using materialized and not material UI and I think I'd rather go with material UI if I'm doing things in react so anyway just thought I'd let you know since there was some interest in in the style guide I didn't realize anybody was looking at it but I guess at least one person was alright so I'm gonna say hi and check the lab chat really quick okay cool Patrick says he's done some previous free weekends on with code school and he said it's a pretty good resource so awesome okay so let's get started I do want to say my normal type of kind of thing for any new people that are watching or maybe you've only watched a few times and haven't heard this before the point of this stream in particular is to just show me in doing my everyday work as a frontend developer I'm employed fulltime by University and so it's not necessarily a tutorial but I try to explain what I'm doing as much as possible so if you're a beginner then it might still be worthwhile for you to watch even if this is maybe a little bit more advanced than than what you're currently doing because I'll you know I try to explain things and also you know not everything is done during the stream so from stream to stream there may be things that I work on are things that change that obviously I didn't get you know recorded there will be interruptions occasionally people knock on my door they call me and I have to stop so just wanted to get that all out of the way right off the bat if you've been watching for a while I know you know that but occasionally I do have people that are I don't know it seems like maybe from the comments that that they don't they've never heard that before or realized with what I'm doing with this stream so I just want to make sure when expectations are correct with what we're trying to do here alright so having said all that I actually have changed very little since yesterday and in fact Patrick submitted a pull request and basically I don't I don't know that I want to say fix the issues we were having with with standard KS yesterday but I guess kind of worked around it all right and here's the workaround so you can see it in two places first place is here at the top of our file we can set some some es Lin rules and in this case we're setting the global onmouseover on Mouse outs right so this would these were we're giving us errors saying they're not defined now there's no errors and then also we can do that in our package JSON so you can see under standard Global's we put all these things one of them being state so when we were defining state and let's see what we're doing it okay when we're defining state like this we were getting an undefined error so now we don't get that anymore and going forward for anybody submitting pool requests I think the best way to proceed with this is if you if you use something here with especially if you use it you know like this with the arrow function it's it's not going to it's not gonna recognize that right forward for a lot of reasons that we went over yesterday and I'm not gonna go into because I'm not exactly I'm not even exactly sure what the reasons are but it has something to do with updates to yarn NPM so what we will do then is in our global up here within the file so not in package JSON we're gonna put everything that's giving that's giving us errors or that we know ahead of time we'll probably give us errors this avoids us having to bind so normally we would bind these things we bind this for each one of these in our constructor right so for every single click for onmouseover for onmouseout that would be two separate lines so we still have to do something but it's it's less than what we normally have to do and it's way up at the top and it's not down here you know kind of clutter things up so we can basically do it all in one line and just throw it up here it'll work if you're going to use something on more than one component then it can go here in our package JSON so that's the that's kind of the workaround for now thanks Patrick for for doing that that was really good thinking actually because that's I mean it's just a very simple solution and this is certainly a debatable thing so I don't want to put this forward it's like this is the solution that everybody should use because it's there certainly might be a different way or better way to get these working without errors and it's debatable as to whether or not this is even the best way to do things you know the older way of using the constructor is still in the react documentation binding with this inside the constructor is in the react documentation it does mention this property initializer syntax but it does it says that it's experimental so this is certainly not the standard way I like it I've been doing it that way for the last at least the last two projects I think including this one and so I've gotten used to it I like it it's more concise and I don't have a problem telling you know being able to know what's going on I have read you know online some people saying that they're not sure you know what's going on when they see that but I don't know I think it's pretty straightforward so I'd like to keep using that but I certainly understand it let's say if you were to submit a pull request using the older way of doing things I'm not opposed to that I'm not gonna say that you need to change it so with with that said we're gonna move forward when I do things you know I'll do it with the property initializer syntax but I just stuff I definitely don't want to put that forward like this is the way to do it because I don't think that that's at least from what I've researched it's it's certainly not a decided issue yet okay so actually I just got a link from so then put a link in about this buying issue so I'm gonna I'm gonna open that up on my other screen so I don't forget but I'm not gonna go over it right now because I've already talked for a long time without doing any coding so I'd like to get started on the coding but thank you Ben I will check that out as soon as I'm done with with the stream and what we were working on yesterday so just to catch everyone up we're building great with react we use create react app and we've got a bunch of other kind of nice tools that we're working with to autoformat our code and so the basic function of what we're building is to provide resources like logo images and information to people who work at this university that I work at and also allow them through a form to submit requests for work so we're working today on this section and so yesterday we we set some things up to be able to attract the scroll position of the user on the page and to also get the values of the Y position of each of these these are all h3s that I'm highlighting each of these age threes the plan today is to change this side menu here to reflect the names of these headers and to have as we scroll down have the appropriate name be highlighted okay and not only that but we'd like it if if you happen to click on one of those names that it would scroll automatically to that section okay so we're gonna be adapting this this component comes in material UI and I think it's called pepper immaterial UI so it's not exactly intended for this kind of thing but it's close enough that I think we can adapt it pretty pretty easily I don't think it'll take too much work to do this so that's where we're at that's what's what's going on so if you want to follow along in the repo we're in the planning guide Jas is where we'll be at for probably all of this maybe we'll put some styles in a sass file but other than that we're gonna be hanging out in this file so I'm gonna close our folder tree view and just give us some more space I'll make this a bit bigger for you all let's see so we need see I need I need to get my mind wrapped around where we left off I had meetings all morning and so I didn't I didn't get a chance to work on this okay all right so currently our header positions are here in an array and then our scroll position is here under scroll Y so let's change let's change the values here for this step or just to make it a bit more obvious with the what this is supposed to do I keep having to explain what it's going to do because we still have all these default things here so let's change that and for now I think I'm just going to I'm just gonna manually put put the sections in I think if we had more sections it would be a better idea to grab the text of each h3 and then loop over let's say we had an array of the text for each of the h3 s loop over that and then create these but since we only have what three or four I'm just gonna put them in here and all right I'll just copy and paste these actually this will be faster let me drag this over on my other screen and it'll be a lot faster for me to copy and paste that I may shorten some of these up we'll see how how they display but I'd rather not have them wrap onto another line so we'll see if that's necessary and we need to add few more just one more right there's only four and let's give this a step index of three and they should be two three yes if he should be three as well all right see how that looks oops okay that's actually and not bad now that I look at this I think it's worded a bit I don't like how it's worded right so it says please follow these guidelines and so it says plan ahead proof the job in a timely manner so those are like saying here's what you do right you have to plan ahead you have to prove drove in a timely manner and then this just says budget information I think it might be better if it just said budget right like you need to budget and then obviously this is information about budgeting normally I don't make decisions about content we have content editors that just tell me what to do but I think I'm gonna change that and we'll just see how it goes they'll definitely make me change it back they don't like that budget following that same logic services would probably go better up here's a planet and I guess would be better if it's a plan ahead to services budget proof the job in a timely manner maybe services could go after budget I'm gonna leave it alone for now oh this is not really my area I'll let the content people deal with that but now that we kind of after we had it kind of displayed over here it just it looks looked a little odd to me I think we can I think we can get rid of this one two three four I mean the steps are somewhat logical but right now at least the position of services throws things off a bit a bit because that's obviously not the last step so we're going to remove this reset and we're gonna remove this click a step and then I guess we'll remove these as well so you don't need yeah this entire paragraph we can get rid of and you know if you get rid of this yeah hopefully this won't break things and I think we don't need these buttons anymore not okay great so we have gotten rid of that good okay so it's still doing some things that we don't really want it to do but we'll get we got something through many a oops forgot to set my Pomodoro timer it's so let's set it now better late than never so we may need to let's check out the options in material UI if there's not an option to change how this looks then we can always just use some CSS to override things I'd rather not directly modify the component in material UI so I think it would be better in this case to just change essentially just hide this with CSS assuming that there's no option and we need okay it looks like we we may be able to put whatever we want inside the step okay so right now we're using this step button which I'm assuming that's that's what's giving us our this kind of circle with the checkbox there so if we changed it and we didn't use a step button but instead I mean we replace this with anything really if we leave the on click the unclick yeah I don't think we'll be changing state yeah I don't think will change state well we want to do unclick you scroll to a certain position yeah so let's just first let's try changing this let's just make it a span for now just see what it what it looks like all right cool so let's change all of these two spans see how that looks whoa all right still want to get rid of these but okay not that we want to add add some styling to that but we've gotten rid of the other thing so okay I want to see how this looks now in the and he's you know okay I'm gonna try let me make sure I'm gonna make this a bit smaller so we can see both both things I believe we can scroll was it no let's just be honored right no this whole table is not a function hmm I thought we'd use this we'll use okay so that's just giving us our let's try with window oh we need sorry let's try that again I remember how to do it now there we go okay so we can do this and it'll scroll us around so if you saw that I'm just typing in different values for scroll top I'm setting scroll top to whatever I want it to be okay so that's that's how we do it you'd see I was a little confused at first and I was trying to set it in here and dev tools kept telling me that it wasn't a function and it just didn't register at first okay so first we're gonna do it like this a nicer way to do this would be to gradually scroll so maybe we'll implement some sort of smooth scrolling I have done that on previous projects it's possible I use jQuery for it but it I think it would be worthwhile for me to look up how I did it before and see if I could just adapt that so here's what we want to do on click me grab this so on click we want to see you want to go scroll top equals this set or this state and let's go with call that header physicians okay so to go this state header positions and header positions and we can actually use the step index right we have we do have the step in ducks here correct yeah so we can use the step index no we can't because I'm not setting the step index anymore all right I may have to rethink I'm doing this for now I'm just gonna manually put a few of these in and that'll at least be able to test the next step okay let's see cool alright so this is working it's taking us to the sections gray awesome okay so that's I think that was actually the second step as I explained it before but that ended up being easier to implement so one of the things that we wanted to do is implement it and the next thing is just going to be to highlight this if we're in that the right area you know kind of so as we scroll down and that highlight whether or not something is highlighted will be determined by our Y our scroll Y and our header positions so let's see so I think we should give position of active section and let's see zero so we'll use the index of each section I think that that we yeah that should be the easiest way so section 1 which would be 0 right because we're zero indexing section 1 will be the default because that's just going to be the top of the page basically the top we're not including that first h2 but this will work so active section is 0 so let's see all right let me let me just kind of explain out loud what I'm thinking for the next step so we will make the active the active section will be based on a comparison between the scroll Y and the header positions that comparison will happen every time handle scroll runs will do that same comparison so I suppose inside handle scroll will do that will it'll be something like like a note like this set state but it'll be maybe a switch statement that may be the best way to do it because there's going to be conditions so if scroll Y is between certain values then that's going to change it will change the state here for our active section so then for each one of these we're gonna have to have some sort of check to say if the active section corresponds to this this section that's represented by by these labels then we're gonna want to make it bold or something I actually haven't even decided with the what the indicator is going to be does that make sense okay I know there's a delay so give everybody like 30 seconds to respond I don't want to lose anyone so let me know if it doesn't make sense but that's what we'll be working on okay Patrick I just I saw your comment about the the warning so at 31st he is like okay cool so Patrick's saying that these these that he put the first line that he put up here was to take care of the areas that I'm seeing in the console step but mr. fun I'm just gonna clean things up a bit and then I'll check the live chat before we go move on now that I look at this I think we're we're really not using very much of the functionality at all of this stepper essentially it's just providing us with just kind of the layout of a list of things vertically so I guess we didn't really need to use the separ we'll see once we're finished with it once we're finished with that we may be able to just switch these over to divs or a maybe a ul and it would probably work especially since we have this we have some of the styles here too guess we don't need the back button there Styles action I don't think we even have the actions anymore I'm not sure what part was the content let's see okay yeah that's the list here that works this is drops oh here we go forgot to take this one up hmm who did yeah we're definitely not even really using most of what's going on with this with this stepper so let's just get rid of this okay and still there we go you will see I'm just was trying to get rid of some of these errors these crops from the element planting I had one of four I thought I removed all of those I can't find them well maybe now might be the best time to just switch this over from this step to ul yes yeah I think that'll be the way to go so let's get rid of this I mean why why import you know this component if we're not even really using it so I mean this was kind of useful just to help frame how we were going to think about this but now it's pretty obvious that this is not going to be necessary okay and that should take care of great so you took care of those little lines which is pretty awesome so we'll need to add a little bit of padding and everything but much better we're gonna get rid of Stefan stuff here define I've never used yeah there we go get rid of that okay so now get rid of those error messages and the click yeah so this still works so everything that we've done with clicking still works great all right I said I was going to check the live chat quickly so I'm gonna do that now yeah so let me just check the live chat now since I started this timer late anyway so we're gonna do the five minutes if you're not familiar with with this stream and haven't seen it before we do Pomodoro's timer so 25 minutes of coding five minutes I check the live chat we do that maybe two or three times and then we finish up and the last part of the stream is just cue a questionandanswer see so I'm just gonna scroll up a bit and see what I missed so someone asked if angularjs is worth learning I just say it depends on what would you want to learn if you're interested in that if there's jobs if at a certain company you know that uses angular then it's definitely worth learning depends also you know how much time you have if you have a lot of time you know go ahead and and learn it you know you could learn it without even really having a good reason to yeah but it just definitely depends on what you're what you're trying to do Blake also at Blake asked brackets i over PSA's vs code it's a Visual Studio code so I don't know I've never used brackets so I can't really compare I have used Visual Studio code and I like it but like I said since I haven't used brackets I can't really answer that question braxton says hey Jessie how's it going I'm doing all right huh how's everything going with you thanks for watching okay Rohan has a good question Rohan says I know you have a job currently but if you were to change jobs or go freelance again would you advertise yourself as a reactive or frontend slash fullstack yeah I wonder I I guess I would feel comfortable at this point calling myself a reactive that's not to say I think I'm an expert at react but I've been developing sites you'll react sites for a while so I would do that I'm deaf obviously I'm comfortable with frontend I don't know about full stack I'm getting more confident at at doing things other than frontend so I don't know I'd have to do a little bit more with backend before I be comfortable saying full stack but I don't think I'm that far away from from being able to say that honestly so maybe I guess it would just depend on what what I really wanted to do if I read if I knew I really wanted to do react which at this point I I really like react so I may end up just saying reactive yeah I may I may do react because I I would like that and then just for the type of company react is is somewhat new so I would know that if there is a company that is using react and they're looking specifically for react dev the odds of them being open to adopting new things like sooner are probably greater than a company that is just looking for a front end of and you know who knows they could be using you know in anything so I guess it would for me at least I'd like to have a job where I'm you know I'm somewhere the comfortable trying new things and trying to stay you know as cutting edge as is reasonable so I guess the answer the question right now after I've thought about it is I think I would market myself as a react dev okay then I just saw your comments about the material UI components and all the props so I mean I guess at this point it doesn't matter but thank you for for letting me know about that break point asks why are you implementing scroll instead of the anchor we're doing the scroll well basically it's easy to get it so my times up here so let me let me start this again but this is a good segue back into the code so the the reason I went with the scroll instead of the anchor so I originally I was planning on doing the anchor and I think I had yeah so I even added in IDs thinking that I would go with the anchor but I really don't need the idea is now because we end up going with this index and since we've indexed the positions the header positions here then when we click on these it's easier just to go by the index I I think it's easier just go by the index at this point especially if we were to let's say like create these dynamically okay so that's one reason is it was just easier when I was doing this to say like okay we have the value stored in an array so let's just go with the index the second reason though is if I want to implement some sort of smooth scrolling feature I know I don't know like I said I need to go back and look at how I've done this in the past but I think it will be easier to implement by the position because I believe what I've done in the past is gotten the ID determine what the position was and then set up scrolling based on the position anyway so and in that scenario it wouldn't really matter you know we wouldn't be using the anchor to navigate so does that make sense I mean maybe I'm thinking about this wrong and you know maybe it'll be clearer later on for me but probably what will end up happening is I'll I'll have some sort of like smooth scrolling happen and it'll be more beneficial for me to know the position anyway okay I was just checking the the last little bit there and in the latch at okay so I didn't get through everything so I'll come back after this Pomodoro session and I'll start back you know right with the comments right after we talked about using the anchor so so any comments made after 226 p.m. Eastern Time I will get to those in about 20 minutes all right so let's move on I really think we can get this working before we finish so that's the goal today I'm not worried about having its style 100% properly but at least having it functional I think it's a good goal and it's definitely reasonable okay so let's do our we're gonna do this on handle scroll right now I want to do this on handle scroll because it's being throttled right so we're tracking the scroll we have our event listener but we're only calling handle scroll every you know 200 milliseconds so this is where we want it let's do all right let's do a switch statement I'm gonna have to look up on my other screen how to do a switch statement because I have not typed out a switch statement in a long time I remember when I was first learning how to do a switch statement I made a textbased game and depending on how you answered the questions it did different things and it was just one big switch statement I think it's on my github yeah I think I did put it on github it was like a Lord of the Rings kind of game and I think it used alerts yeah so it's probably I haven't looked at it in years it's probably pretty terrible but the whole point was for me to learn how to use a switch statement all right so on my other screen I just opened up the ND mdn page on switch statements and I'm just gonna paste in there example to say sometime alright great so the switch statement is we're gonna pass in the scroll wide yeah we're gonna pass in scroll why scroll why and then the first case is going to be I see you scroll I actually let me see this I guess it would be oops yeah we won't even really need the first value at all since the top of the page who have it highlighted so we'll just skip right to the neck the second value so if wait a second I need to read let me take five seconds to read about switch statements because like totally just drawing a blank with how to do a switch statement so what I want to do basically is something like if the first case will be is if scroll Scroll Y is less than now yeah if scroll Y is greater than header this state header physicians one they were it okay so you know I'm trying to do okay let me try it like this okay this is how I think it would work all right so for the switch I want it to match true right so if this is true then it's gonna do what's in here right does that make that makes more sense we'll find out in a few seconds so for now why did they put these brakes let me get rid of these or at least that's and I do want this default so one oops to let's see this is greater than let's see I think I'm doing this backwards from what it should be so what I should ever do is if it's less than the first position then it's going to be header one there we go if it's less than the second then it's going to be oh yeah header header two three and then this last case will be for three do you think suppose someone lets everyone listen to all right let's try this out what did I do all right so let's see what we get okay cool so four three two one alright so normally if someone would start at the top of the page there at the top of the page let's see as we go down having one that's cool 1 1 1 1 1 now we switch to 2 right there perfect yeah that's where we want to switch and now 3 and finally 4 all right cool so that works just like we want it to work now we just need to switch it out instead of consult logging we need to highlight one of these depending on where we're at on the page so let's do that so I think it's the best way to do this I think if I can put I do this I don't think I can I was trying to put a ternary in style but I'm pretty sure you can't do that can you put one inside an element let's see I don't know if I've ever tried this before let's just try it and see what happens so actually see we want step content I don't think we need this anymore right yeah let's get rid of that I didn't realize I already had a switch statement on the page that would have would have simplified things okay so let's do something here so active okay I already have active section okay cool so actually to test this all I need to do is is active section see if I can do this I don't think this is gonna work but let's see we let's see now I knew I'd get in there alright let's see let's check the live chat really quick alright nothing in there okay so good to know we can't do this we can't do this so let's see at least I can see if I like the font weight all right so that's that's not I think at least can see the difference in it I do it here actually this is toship this is an object if I could do it in here I don't think this will work either this would be the last silly thing I tried that Oh needs to be this state active section whoa did that really work actually so it kind of worked let me try it on another one okay yeah it doesn't work what I was trying to do was check to see if the active section equal zero then oh yeah wait a second maybe it did work and I just I just did it wrong okay cool so that like I said it kind of works because it doesn't update see should I do this let's see all right so what uh what I'm trying to do which was probably obvious is I want to change the font weight based on where we're at on the page Oh have I not changed active section yet yeah oh all right that was silly I haven't actually changed that to section so this is this sad state this may end up working this one too so right now there are a lot of things hardcoded in here that could probably be done in a more automatically I guess but for now it's this works oh look at that it worked a little bit I didn't put it on the other ones yet all right so check that out we have the highlighting its changing awesome let's put that on these other guys alright so cool so this is really good to know I hope I remember this next time I try it because I know I've done this before and went through the same thing if you're trying to apply a certain style to an element in line if you try to put the entire style object you know inside this ternary it does not work but if you inside that object since this is just JavaScript anyway for the value and the key value pair if you put the ternary there then it works so if you're not familiar with this this is like I don't what they call it one of you are the one that that showed me how to do this it may have been Patrick and I think you call it like a shortcircuit or something like that so basically it's like we're checking to see if this if the active section is equal to zero instead of putting you know let's say the question mark and then 500 and then a colon and putting out of the default font weight value there we can just say we just put this in here basically and then so whatever happens after that is just gonna happen you know automatically if this is true and if it's false nothing happens right because if it's false it's it doesn't go any further right so anyway so it's just a little shortcut so let's put these here and here and two three I just got the feeling like I recreated a lot of what that stepper already did but oh well it works cool and see see so this is working oh no I don't know if you saw that so if I click on one the other ones still highlighted I think what we need to do in our switch statement then is put equal to less than or equal to for all these and that should fix it so let's double check I know it doesn't if we move down just a bit hmm less than equal to oh no now we don't need me equal to let's see and position listen I think if I had just adjusted like this let's see there we go so that was enough so if we just adjusted it so it's one pixel less than that that solved the problem because when we click it is taking us exactly to where that is so there we go all right awesome and that was pretty good timing because this just beeped about a minute ago so I'm gonna do the five minutes let me check the time actually I might I might wrap things up now and just check the live chat do a little question answer now because we basically accomplished what we wanted to for this I'm obviously not gonna leave it like this style wise so I'm gonna get rid of these these discs the bullet points I'm gonna get rid of I'm gonna make these let's see if that font size I think this could do with a bit bigger font size obviously some better spacing between these and maybe maybe something more pronounced here to show what section you're on I'm thinking like possibly a a very small left border that moves as we go up and down and that would that border could be our accent our current accent color which is this yellow yeah I think that'll that'll look look a lot better also we're gonna want to set our cursor to pointer when it goes over these just to give a visual indication that this these are clickable all right yeah that's that sounds like that'll that'll look good so I'll probably work on that maybe before I leave actually I've been meaning to stop at the post office for like a week or two and I never get out of work in enough time before the post office closes so I may be leaving a bit early earlier than normal to be able to make it to the post office so if I don't get this to this today than Monday morning I'll make those changes so the code portion of this stream is done so if you just wanted to stick around for the code now that was a good time to to leave and totally understand if you got some other stuff you need to do thank you so much for watching I'll be back on Monday if you can stick around for the question and answer that would be great even if you don't have a question I'd really like your input and a live chat to help answer some some of the questions that we get so so right now I'm gonna scroll back up to where we left off at so if you have any questions put them in the live chat quickly because once I get to the bottom we'll wrap things up and in the stream if you can't stick around to hear the answer to your question you can check out the replay of this this video the recording and that will be available on the free code camp Channel you could also send me a message on Twitter or any other social media platform that you like and I'll try to answer your question there as soon as I get a chance okay okay I think I found where I left off at and I'm not going to read out everything in the live chat but the questions especially questions from from people who are new I definitely want to try to get to those questions and make sure everyone feels welcome okay Blake said Blake it asks a question about bracket zero versus Visual Studio code and he says brackets tayo does not work with github repos so string did do you mean that it doesn't have and it doesn't reflect any of the the state of of get like visually in there I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that so I guess let me know I probably won't be switching editors but it would be good to know maybe especially if there's other people watching that may be considering it dinesh asks is Redux mandatory and been been said no but it is recommended it's pretty standard pattern for react yeah for sure I've I've actually I'm building a react project with Redux right now and it's it's just like a react blog you can post you new blog posts and comment and vote on comments and on posts and I'm doing that for the Udacity react nano degree I'm using Redux for that but I've actually never used Redux for any of my other react projects so yeah it's definitely not mandatory but now that I'm learning it I can see that it would give you a big advantage and keeping keeping track of especially if you had a bigger project things could get things get a little bit crazy with trying to pass state down through so many child components yeah it would Redux makes things a lot easier to reason about so anyway I definitely recommend it unless unless you're doing a really small project then you probably don't need Redux but otherwise it's probably good idea to use Redux or I mean there are other alternatives to Redux too that you could use Jess Quran asks which is the best channel to keep yourself updated related to web then says these videos are using pretty uptodate stuff and level up I don't know I always don't know how people pronounce this but I always say level up Tut's so UTS but he says it's it's a good it's also good for some of the newer things cool yeah I mean I would I I try to do newer stuff when I can I mean I don't I don't use new stuff just to use it because it's new and if it has to be of some value to the project but I real I tried to do something new on every project that I that I use so even if you know most of my projects are probably gonna be react there's some things that I may need to work on where I can't use react because of I have to work it within an existing system but I am gonna try to use some new technology that I've never used before so I guess I guess you know Ben's right this will normally be pretty uptodate looks like there's there's some decent discussion on the merits of Visual Studio code versus brackets okay and it looks like I've got some a clearer picture so what Blake was meaning by github and and brackets is the git integration is is not great so it evidently it breaks live reload if you using it so like I said I don't know I don't use it so I'm not I'm not exactly sure but anybody anybody that uses brackets maybe if you could help out in the live set or in the comments to this video and see if you had any trouble using get with the live preview if so have you found anywhere to work around that or get get it to work Rowland earlier I commented on a on a JavaScript textbased game that I had made that was I was trying to learn how to do switch statements and I mentioned that I used JavaScript alerts for it and Rohan says JavaScript alerts used and loved by scammers and learner's alike indeed yes I really want to go back and play that game now I I think I actually have either a code pen or something on jsfiddle I'm gonna have to go back and look at that that repo because now now I'm just curious it's always it's fun to look at previous projects and just kind of see just like whoa see what you were thinking or how far you've come here it is I'm moving it onto the screen right now I'm just gonna show you oh so you can see look how simple it is one javascript file and to read me at least I put in a readme that I mean that's pretty good this was probably one of the first things I ever used github for let's see the sewers okay yeah so you can see this big switch switch statement yeah defeated you are cool so anyway actually it's not as big as I thought it seemed really big at the time so that's my JavaScript game I should have saved that for like Thursday I could have done throwback Thursday or that project but anyway yeah feel free to play that whenever you want it's super fun you can you can get through all the game content in less than a minute if anyone who is a lawyer for the Tolkien estate and you see this don't don't sue me I'll take it down if you want me to all right Patrick said sorry Patrick I didn't see this comment this was a while ago he said I don't think that's a great place for a switch statement so I guess let me know I'm probably not gonna change it right now but let me know where else would you put the switch you know we I guess should I just kind of extract this out of here and then I guess I could make this into a function in return no I wouldn't need to return anything would I because it's already doing what it needs to do anyway let me know where where I should put it in Y and that would be helpful it would be helpful for me and maybe for other people watching as well actually there's there's not really a question made more of a discussion going on about using a using it through the terminal or using a graphical user interface forget so I like github as a git client for the desktop I'm interested I mean what do you all prefer obviously I use the terminal I've never used the the desktop app for github before is it better for some things I tell you what figuring out like merging things I could see how merging might be better with a better interface and definitely trying to do like like you get diff would be potentially easier with a graphical interface but since I already am doing things with the terminal it's just so much easier to do everything in the terminal I think and then once you remember all the commands it's so much faster Patrick says this is the most convoluted use of a switch statement I think I've ever seen impressive thanks Patrick yeah if anyone has ideas to refactor this let me know I'm definitely not we don't have to stick with this it's just the first thing that came into my head to deal with that patrick said i once had to refactor and maintain a pearl cgi shopping cart written by a graphic designer as one giant switch statement haha I would like to see that I would not like to have to maintain that but it would be cool to see it Mitchell says hi guys this is a nice way to learn never thought of live coding hey how's it going not sure if you're still still watching but thanks for watching okay Patrick says don't set state twice and handle scroll combine the scroll y1 so I then to put this scroll Y part in here so that set state only runs essentially once each time this is called okay Patrick is saying I build a new object in the switch and then set State at the end with scroll Y included okay that makes sense so I would then only call set State down here and it would include whatever whatever info I need and the scroll Y in an object all right that's that's cool I said I'm not gonna make any changes right now but that does make a lot of sense Patrick asks what am I going to do with the menu on small screens I'm just gonna hide it on small screens I don't really know I can't think of a good way to display that on a really small screen so I was just gonna leave it off if anyone has any ideas for how to display a menu like that so this type of side menu when a screen gets really small let me know but I I don't know I think it would just be better I mean it'll be a lot of scrolling but it would be better to just leave the space for the text I think although what I made when I may have available though is a an arrow maybe to go to get to the top of the page Oh we'll see actually you know what I am gonna try to implement it so that if you scroll up a little bit the header then appears wherever you're at so that that would eliminate the need to put that arrow to scroll away up to the top yeah I think we yeah we had talked about that earlier in the week I think John Hanson said it's amazing so much goes into a small UI function yeah can you believe that I mean I thought about that this morning and like I can't believe I'm still working on this part like it looks so small and that's it's really hard sometimes to people who have no idea of what goes into making something like this would potentially think like oh you just add this little thing you know that's what like an hour less than an hour to do that it seems like a small thing but it's really not so I found that with with clients before with people here at the University that that there's very little understanding of how thing how long things actually take so occasionally someone will ask for something and it immediately be dismissed is all that'll take forever but really it's not a big deal and I can get it done quickly and then other times the last or something that they think is a very small thing and I have to explain like well actually that's that's going to take a long time so anyway I guess that's just how it is I'm sure it's like that with other professions as well unless you really know what goes into something then you won't really have an idea of how long it'll take so we have a question so I started to use Redux recently in the fields that it's very hard to divide components and smart and dumb how do you make it yeah I don't know I guess I don't have I haven't really had so basically smart and dumb components we talk about stateless and stateful components right so components that have state and that needs state and then components that don't I don't know I guess I haven't really had problems in dividing them because it's I mean usually you know if your component needs to do something or change based on user action then it's probably going to need state if we're talking about Redux then most of your state should live in the store and redux right so you shouldn't have this separate component state but I will say if you have components that are really simple like that the state is basically just for UI right so in this case I don't know that I would store the state to make this thing work in this in the store in Redux this would probably be something that I would keep at the component level at component level States I'm not exactly sure if this is what you're asking so hopefully this helps though so this is something where you know this state is not going to need to be known you know by other components right it's not it's not shared right so anytime you have a shared state that more than one component needs to know about that state it should definitely be in the store but like if you have something that only one component needs and especially if it's just like UI related right in this case we're just changing the whole point of pretty much everything that we've done here was just to make this a slightly you know higher font weight so I would keep that at the component state sooner sorry if you have a worth worked on Redux that might not have made very much sense to you sorry about that hopefully the next project we can use Redux and then that'll be a nice if you haven't worked with it'll be a nice introduction if you're just starting out with it then hopefully we can we can learn and get better with it together I John Hansen asks our empty div section main etc wrong thing to build into react components making them are usable when I tried to do this components like figure image figcaption nested inside the above don't show em actually I don't I don't know I am I don't know that I've ever tried to make like empty sections basically layout components right yeah I don't know that I've tried to make that are you using what would it be it would be children so within I would check out two things I would check out maybe two to see so in our last project which is the repo is called CI react or maybe react CI either way there's a layout component that essentially does somewhat of what you're talking about so check out how that's done and then also if you look at the materialize is it materialized no the latest version of material UI so the the very newest version that we attempted to use it first and then decided to switch back I think they have some layout components like that that are just basically empty sections for their grid view I would check that out as well and see how they implement that so I don't think it would be wrong to do that I could definitely see value in that especially if if you want to use them as layout components it almost reminds me of in WordPress they have these shortcodes and they have short codes for layout which normally you would just do with divs but I mean if you've worked with short codes in WordPress you know what I'm talking about but essentially they would serve the same purpose so anyway those two places might be a good place to kind of look into it and see how that's being done in you know in other ways oh cool cough will says West boss has a Redux course and it's free so that's awesome I'm gonna have to check that out like I said I'm learning Redux through the Udacity react nano degree right now but maybe that would be a good resource to use alongside of it and give me a better understanding hey I'm there so congratulations so Umberto who's regularly in the live set says that he just received part one of an interview process for a Java developer position that's awesome good luck with with the whole process and that's that's really good I'm really happy for you definitely let us know how things go okay so so someone I'm I can't read and how to pronounce your name so I'm sorry about this I think I'm assuming that's in Russian let me try to translate I'm going to show you a chance like this I can actually say the right name alright so Google Translate is saying it's a bulat sorry if that's wrong I'm just going by Google Translate so uh so I'm gonna say bulat it says recently I got a job as a react native developer but on the previous job I coded 2d games with phaser j/s how much time and I need to afford to be comfortable with react development I guess it just depends on like how how much time per day can you dedicate to it to learning it how fast of a learner are you you know things like that so it's really hard to say you know it's it's more of an individual thing but I've I think I'm pretty comfortable with react right now I mean I'm comfortable enough that I can create websites that are that are going to be used by clients by the university I'm comfortable enough to live code in react I guess and I think I started my first real react projects last winter so maybe the beginning of winter in 2016 so it hasn't even been a year yet and during that time I haven't dedicated all my time to react either so I've had to work on other things that weren't react so I would say like potentially you know within a few months you know you could start you'd be really comfortable with it but I and it really does depend on your situation and your your capacity to pick up new things all right Patrick says I actually like the switch statement you wrote so thanks Patrick okay so David says the desktop clients for forget are good for seeing the history of a repo especially multiple people are working on it that's cool yeah definitely I didn't even think about that but that's that's definitely I would be useful as well okay here's some ideas for what to do with this with this on a smaller screen so Rowan said could it be a right slide out actually that's that's possible I think I think I remember that doing like a side and that thing like this on this side was very easy just basically you just change a prop and to add another one so yeah that yeah that could definitely work yes I'll think about that also Thomas says we're fixed fixed to the top yeah I could do that too I don't want to really don't want to take up too much space we'll just have to try some things out on mobile like I'm not really actually what I should do I'm gonna check out the analytics right because we're redoing something that's already live I want to check the analytics and see what people are using when they go there if it turns out that there's a very small percentage of people visiting this on their mobile phones then I'll probably just end up completely hiding this if it's a large percentage then maybe I'll you know try out some other ways to mean it to make this work on a small screen but it may not be the best use of our time to really you know do a lot more with this for smaller screens if there's not really many people using the smaller screens probably good to check the analytics anyway and just to see you know perhaps we need to test this on certain browsers that are being used frequently as well Oh awesome so bula says the translation was correct so in it in he is from Russia so cool I'm really glad it's correct and why I'm a little bit nervous Google Translate is normally really good but I'm always a bit nervous that it'll like mess up when somebody's trying to say so so that's cool I'm glad that I'm glad they got it right okay yeah so I think I've got through all the questions now and yeah okay so it's almost four o'clock Eastern Time where I'm at and I really need to get to the post office before they close they close in an hour so now it's a great time to wrap things up thank you so much for all your help in the live chat and and just for watching I really appreciate it I think you know we got this working and I'm happy with the way it's working just needs a bit of styling to look really nice and think I'll be back Monday let me double check just to give you kind of an advanced headsup if I need yeah it looks like I don't have anything on the calendar for Monday afternoon so unless something else comes up some meeting I should be at the same time I think I do have a meeting at 300 that I didn't put on my calendar so it'd probably be a short stream on Monday maybe I might take a day off next week and take my kids to a museum in Pittsburgh but I'm not 100% sure about that because some of my kids have been sick lately so I don't want to take them if they're still sick but anyway I'm sure y'all don't need to know my oh my my life right now but I have a wonderful weekend hope everybody you know has an enjoyable relaxing weekend or if you have to work I hope it's productive for you so I guess I'll see you on Monday thanks again
