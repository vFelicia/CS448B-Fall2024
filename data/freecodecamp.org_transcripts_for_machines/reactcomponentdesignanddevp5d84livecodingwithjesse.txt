hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and I'm motivated today we're gonna get some stuff done so not sure why I'm so motivated because it's Monday but we got a good workout in this morning so maybe that's why I don't know but we're gonna go back to react land today we spent some time with PHP the last few streams and I'm just a little frustrated with it so I want to take a break from that and build a react component doesn't sneeze done so may as well do it give my mind a little break from the PHP maybe I come back to it with a fresh point of view and hopefully figure it out before we get started I just want to let you know about a few other things first I I want to show you all this GoFundMe campaign that I am I started and so Charles is a free code camp editor for a medium publication and he's trying he was named one of the top contributors so he's trying to get to one of these ceremonies slash parties but he needs some help financially so I'm gonna put a link to this in the chat if anybody's interested you know any any amount of money would help but I think it'd be awesome if we could help out Charles in getting there so you know he needs money for the plane tickets for you know getting a hotel for food you know for all that so he'll be coming from Nigeria so anyway check it out if you get a chance you can read more about his story and you know maybe you'll give a donation or at least if you're not really in a good place financially so that's number one number two I just wanted to give a shout out to my patrons I haven't talked about it for a long time but just wanted to remind everybody that I have this I will link to it and I'm not gonna talk about this every stream as I promised before so maybe once a month or something I'll mention it but I did want to give a shout out so thank you so much to Dondre Oliver dawn and Audrey for for being patrons so right now the for patrons and I'm super appreciative of that so thank you so much and yeah so let's get started now and enough enough about this other stuff also if you'll follow me on some social media you might have seen I've been working on a react native project on the side for for balance IO if anybody be interested in seeing anything about that the project's open source so there shouldn't really be a problem with me livestreaming that on my I probably do it on my own channel maybe like on the weekends or at night or something so let me know if you'd be interested in seeing that I really like the project I have a having a lot of fun working with react native it's mostly just UI stuff so somebody else was working back in and somebody else was doing the design so I'm taking sketch files and turning them from just the design files and turning them into actual react native components so just thought I'd throw that out there see if there's any interest and then maybe I'll do some live streams for that as well so let me know in the chat or in the comments below or however else you feel like getting a hold of me okay let me get my screens situated cool I spent less than three minutes on all the other business now we can get to where coding let me say what's up to everybody in the chat oh great we have a almost 60 viewers so welcome everyone especially if you're new let me give you a little breakdown we're gonna do 25 minutes of code and then we'll take a little break about five minutes and I'll go back to the live chat answer questions and we'll go back and forth like that and probably at least twice we'll go back and forth like that and then at the end whatever questions are left over I'll go through the chat Oh answer all your questions feel free to add questions at any time or let me know if I'm doing something wrong you know that's don't be shy about that and oh Shubham says hi Jesse today I started my career as a web developer really happy congratulations congratulations I hope you start your career off you know really well and you enjoy it I certainly enjoy what I'm doing okay so let's get to this code I guess first thing we should start with is let me show you the old way we're displaying this data on the old site and then we can come up with design ideas for how we want to display it once we have the idea in our head about a design then we'll start doing the coding so let me start my timer so I can find it yep there we go this Poulos Pomodoro timer over here start it up okay let's see this one might have it there we go all right so this is the data that I want to display with this component that we're building so we'll have a title for the the program in general this is for University and we'll have basically four four tabs I'll probably keep the tab idea because I think that that works for each year right now it's not always like this so there's going to be some variations so for here it's freshman sophomore junior and then they go to a different school to finish out but sometimes this this won't be based on on year so these are going to be variable and I'd love to figure out how we deal with this because right now I don't have an input to make these variables so I'll deal with that on the con on the backend side of things but in terms of the UI it won't really matter for today and then within each tab will have two columns there are two sections and then we'll have courses beneath them now these look like their links but they're actually not I'm not sure why they show up as links here they just link back to the same page so it's a bit misleading on the current site don't I don't really know why they it was built like this so that's what we want now we do have this link to view all course descriptions and this link actually doesn't take you to course descriptions either so it on sometimes it does and sometimes it takes you the current page so currently it's not really the best user experience so that's all the data that we'll have now I'd like to figure out what's a better way that matches our design that that would work Oh Michael asked if we're gonna do an grow up today yeah we could do then go out let me let me grab my terminal and start that up it's been a while since I've done in grok I remember how I did that all right sweet I think I remember it reporter beyond 3000 well we will be on 3,000 once I started so let's start this up young starts is that it nope Johann dev I'm working on different projects and sometimes it's yarn dev and sometimes it's yarn start so I I'm getting them confused now okay so if you're not familiar with n drop this is gonna let you all view what's locally running on my machine and you'll be able to see the the changes and the updates as they happen so I just need to get this started here I'll pull this over so y'all can see what I'm doing so here's n grog and there's a free version of this so if you're interested in using this you know check it out just google and rock and gr okay and you should come up so oops and rock a CTEP should be 8080 or 3000 I mean 3000 there we go all right so let me give you I can't remember which one's it if both of these worked or not so I'll just paste both links in here the HTTP and the HTTP link so area I see some of you are connecting cool Wow Elon Musk is here in the chat so welcome big fan of your work just joking I'm sure it's not really a lie musk okay let's let's get rid of some of these tabs I don't need and I will yet here all right this is what we want to look at so let me go to I think we have the pharmacy page working so we can see both pages side by side oh wow right now I have nothing so this is the page that that program would go on and I have no information right now so let's try to find a page that actually has information maybe maybe the English page No education well that image is huge may need to do something about that because that's really big right now okay so here's the data that we're getting in now and we just having a big list let's go back here and see alright so we are going with the material design kind of look for everything so usually when you see material design stuff the tabs aren't down the side the tabs are on the top so we may end up one with something on the top and we are using material UI so let's check out material you I and I'm gonna so let's check out the tabs because we may be able to use some of the stuff from the tabs and I'll paste that in the chat as well so y'all can check it out if you want so we may be able to use some of this as kind of the basis for our component and that'll take care of a lot of the you just switching back and forth so we don't really have to think through all that which is cool the one thing I'm concerned about is with all these tabs we're gonna have four tabs if we put four tabs across the top depending on what these labels are that might be too much I mean we could try to cut it down so I mean we don't really need to use a year here we could say freshman sophomore junior we could even switch it up and say year one year two year three year four I mean that's possible so I mean yeah I guess let's just assume that we can cut this down to be maybe like six characters I think that might be doable to do for across let's see how this looks when we shrink the screen all right at some point you just scroll okay I'm alright with that normally I don't like horizontal scrolling but in this case it it would actually fit with what's done with material material design okay so hopefully we can avoid that maybe with adjusting padding and things like that alright but that looks good I'd say that's a good start alright so let's assume for now and we'll build this out and see how it looks and then we may change it but let's assume for now that we're going to use these tabs up top to represent you know these then really this this layout here where we have first semester second semester I I don't think that's that's bad I think that's an okay layout the thing that I worry about is on a mobile mobile screen what's gonna happen so like this is what happens right now right it well two things happen right so actually that's better than I thought I assumed it was going to break the layout and we'd have a horizontal scroll okay I actually I really like how that stacks I really do like how that stacks and I'm not sure if we want to do an accordion here accordion style menu we'll see how it looks so here's the plan and then after I tell you what the plan is here I'll check the chat to see if anybody has any objections or other ideas so we'll do we'll start with the tabs up top for each of the years and then we'll do this look where it's sidebyside on large screens on smaller screens it stacks in here and then depending on how these tabs look on mobile we may switch up to an accordion style on mobile just on mobile only I think the accordion style would not look as good on a desktop so I'd like to stick with with the tabs if we can but we'll see how it looks and to start out with I'm not gonna worry about pulling data from anywhere we're just gonna hard code some of this data probably what I'll do is I'll just make an object an array of objects for all this stuff and we'll pull it in just within our component like I'm not gonna I think that'll be faster than trying to mess with getting this data which right now we actually we can't get this data right now because I don't have I don't have it set up to be able to get repeater fields from WordPress through graph QL so that's that's what we're working on the last couple streams and it's not finished yet we could potentially if if we can't figure out how to do it through a prio we could end up getting that just through the REST API but I'd rather not make to API calls on the page if I don't have to but that's that's kind of a backup plan that could buy us some time we can still launch the site and it would work and then we could figure it out later all right so let me check the chat before we start definitely want to see what input you all have see so I'm skimming through I'm gonna skip over any questions for now I'm just gonna see if there's anything any advice for what we're doing right now our heart should say why is there 17 pixel padding on the body it looks weird see on the homepage we got weird stuff going on on the homepage I'm not sure what I should I'm not sure what you're saying with the homepage John says you can maybe change the prop value of the tab title values based on media queries like oh okay okay yeah so John's saying that if we need to we may be able to change what the titles are for the tabs depending on the screen size so on larger screens we would have longer more descriptive titles on a smaller screen suite or shorter titles all right I'm gonna think about that I'll probably I'm gonna try to get away with just really short titles and then if my boss or someone really insists that we have more descriptive titles then I think that's a good plan William says so this is an ongoing project you have been working on yeah we've been working on it for since like December January something like that so yeah this this is a real project I'm doing for my fulltime job here at a university so yes so this is not exactly a tutorial this is what my work is so you're gonna see me make mistakes and we're gonna make decisions here for this project during the stream and and this is a real project all right well let's get to it let's get to the code so first things first let's make this component so we'll go to let's go to this faculty let's go to this faculty j/s page first if you want to see this code you can go to the github repo that's linked in the description of this video and check out the code it's all up to date everything's open source so you can do what you want with it but what I like to do when I design a new component is first I'm just going to build it out within Paige that's going to be in and then once we get it to a point we're happy with it then I can I'll pull it out put it in a different a whole different file it's just kind of nicer to work with in one file at first okay so all right so here's where we have the the content is coming in and we have all the content being pulled in as a big chunk of HTML that's gonna change so we're already starting to break chunks out of here so this chunk now we're breaking out as that section that's that we saw that's that list of of courses so we'll be putting this section below so let's check out what code we need automatics for left and right buttons will automatically be presented on desktop and hit it on mobile I think we can go with these views for larger views we definitely want to use the scrollable tabs so let's grab these we want to get tab and tabs and it looks like they're getting app bar as well but I wonder if we can do this without that let's see if we can do without it and let's see what else we need that should be it and that's all we need right now so we'll grab these and we'll import them so if you're not familiar with react there might be a lot of stuff that's new here feel free to ask questions I'll do my best to explain so what we're doing now is we're importing this these components so they're just JavaScript files we're importing those JavaScript files into this file so that we can use them there so we say what we're going to name it and then we say how to get it right this is the file path so we're from now we're going to refer to all the code in this file as tabs and all the code in this file is tab ok and these are reacted components so we can go down here and we may as well just copy and paste the code that they have save us some time we're going to copy and paste this into here and we're gonna wrap this in a div I know now there is I believe a way to do this without having to wrap things in divs but I can't remember the syntax for it so we're gonna wrap things and divs and while I'm again okay I think it's just indentation stuff yeah here's what we need let's go back here and grab our state where's the state there it is okay so it's gonna use state in react to so we're gonna use state to determine which tab we're on and we may as well copy this as well so this is destructuring and i see how it lets us know i have to type in this state all the time when we want to call something that's in state so right here under render we're gonna put that in and now we shouldn't have this line let me save and see if I still have that line that's we constant state that's weird alright well this should work now so I'm just gonna go with it okay Nikki saying I think this version of neck supports the empty tags as fragments camp posts here YouTube blocks it's just an empty tag just removed if okay the Michael Patterson said it's it's react dot fragment tag I believe okay cool let's try it so down here actually let me see and he got put this in the wrong spot yeah let me pull this out cuz I don't think I think I can just put this here for now anyway yeah we're not actually getting any data yet so I'm not gonna mess with that right now I'll just put it here and then we don't have to worry about it at all okay oh we need the this dot handle change that's important so we're gonna grab this so we need a function to change the state whenever we click on a new tab right so now whenever a tab is clicked on is we're gonna call this set state value right so we're gonna change value to a different number right each of the tabs now are numbered so that's how we're gonna know which content to display okay so we have our tabs and labels and then where's our content here we go oh I see how they did it so they have this tab container up here in a function interesting alright that'll go be what we get into next for now the timer is almost up so let me go back to the chat answer questions for about five minutes and then then we'll come back add in some content and then see what it looks like a short break alright I'm gonna scroll up to the top of the chat now and scroll down through get to as many questions as I can it's okay Michael had had said definitely put year one so we're talking about what's what labels to use our tabs so it says because of people changing majors midcareer okay that that makes sense so to say software you know freshman sophomore junior senior year it might not work for everybody right it technically you could be a sophomore and then change to a different program and you're really going to be your one in that program so I do like that idea Benny says how do the accordions play with mobile devices I would think if there's a lot of info on the tab but we have pain to scroll on a mobile device yeah so there are a couple issues I've noticed with using accordions on mobile devices so that well sometimes it can be a little like janky when you try to open and shut the accordion depending on how you how you do it so the accordion that I've used before with materialised CSS which is not react based it is a little bit janky I don't know that's that's been probably a year or two ago that I've used that so it may be fixed now but it wasn't the animation just was not smooth so I've done accordions and react just really basic accordions with no no real animation and they're fine on mobile but you're right about the scrolling so you open it up have a lot of content you got to keep scrolling scrolling scrolling you do have the option to then you know close that you know but potentially if you open it read the way all the way through then you come into the next one you don't want have to scroll a back up I mean it's possible you could make it so that once you click on that next section of the accordion menu the first one closes so you'd never have more than one open at once so that can help keep the page a little bit shorter yeah but I definitely you know I understand you know the the accordion is not it's not always the best choice for for mobile if you're not sure what we're talking about with the accordion menu this is so when you have these little kind of dropdown things here that's sometimes called an accordion M Verma MV mo coding not sure how that you want that pronounced says please create apps with react native all right cool yeah I'd I mean I don't know if you were here earlier but I mentioned I'm doing a side project with react native and if anyone's interested I may do some streams on my channel for that so the link to my channel is in the description so if anybody wants you go to my channel if you subscribe and turn on notifications you should get notified anytime I I live stream so maybe I'll start streaming that that project that react native project okay Michael says I can't remember the link to get to the department you're working on and rock slash education goes to the old page that's weird do you mean like if you're on end rock and then you type slash education it goes to this page like the the main website did we have to do it a different way I can't remember okay alright it looks like there's discussion about f1 also Formula One racing is that it alright so I'm gonna skip over that you're welcome to discuss that in the chat but I'm not gonna read it up alright cool so I got actually got through everything if I miss your question just put it in there again and I'll see it the next time around let's start up our next 25 minutes timer and now we're gonna get this component working so it should show up below here is where we'll see it I don't think I've saved it yet so we're not seeing it yet good night son I'd say yeah let's save it and see what we get nothing yeah that is it Oh No I know why I'm looking in the wrong component we're not in faculty we're on we're in major okay let me get the right page up here let's close out some stuff because I have too many things open okay major all right so let's just get rid of this stuff I add it over there and I can't put it pull these out put them here and the query actually not I think about it we do we should put this inside the query component because at some point we hopefully will be getting the data from graph QL if not we can move this but for now let's put it in here and let's try What did he say I could do an empty is this what you are talking about with the shorthand for the react fragments let me know if that's the way to do it or not I guess I can just look it up it's not let me get this copied over and then I'll just look up the syntax because I don't think we've done anything with fragments weight is the global X still in there oh no I can't believe it's still in there I every time I've seen it I tried to take it out but that was just something hard should put in there for testing so keep forgetting to take it out all right so let's grab these two things and then that one and we'll be finished getting everything out of here there we go oh yeah and now I'm just gonna back out all this stuff there we go okay alright let's just check this fragment syntax okay fragments fragments fragment component there we go tackle cool all right so that should work all right let's check Oh property value of null for what 30 where I miss it's all right anybody see what the issue is I probably should doublecheck this to make sure we got everything that we needed all right so pulling these that's good we didn't use this yet we're not using prop types we don't need this root style right yeah we're not using that here let's a button we have the state we have the handle change are we even bringing any props no all right we have everything maybe maybe I don't have the latest version of next so maybe it doesn't support this so let's just throw in a div here just to see if that makes a difference mm obscurities okay so it wasn't that so I guess I'll go back to what we had before oh okay it says John says is it not necessary to import a fragment from reactant using the empty tags I don't know okay all right so we don't need to specifically import fragment as harsh it's pointing out in the chat because it it comes in with react when we a just import reacts up here or we bring it really brought it yeah up here there yeah all right let me paste in the rest of of what we're supposed to have because Siri will just paste in a couple of these maybe it's looking for these I don't know that doesn't really make any sense she Michael says roll back and had one thing at a time yeah actually that's a good idea instead of adding things let's take away things let's get rid of a little bit just so that we have less to deal with let's take the tabs out can I be property value of no is this this state alright let's just take this out all right what am i doing do I have the style in the wrong plate or the state in the wrong place maybe that's it no I don't why isn't it recognizing this state Michael said I may comment them out yeah I guess that would have been easier what the heck so it's just not it's not recognizing that there's a value can't read property value of you know so when I try to go get this state it's saying that state is null all right so the error message there's more close up of the air message so so can tree property value of null so I'm trying to look at the property value of state of this state so for some reason it's saying state is null and I'm wondering why why does it say state is no I may not maybe a copy and paste thing all right Hudson try console logging this state which I'm assuming it's not going to be able to find stable let's see yeah I don't know what happened we just decided to work all right but we've got all kind of weirdness going on here too okay so we now have stayed why do we have this get rid of that and whoa all right so I'm gonna just go with a div here because when I don't do the div and I try to do the fragment it keeps inserting all this stuff so maybe that's just I don't know maybe that's just my editor and the way I have it set up but I'm okay with just using div it shouldn't mess up anything all right so now yeah all right so now we don't have that weirdness going on but here we have our our tabs great we have our tabs took way longer than I thought to just get these tabs working but sometimes that's how it is okay now that we have our tabs we can put some content here that correspond to those tabs so let's just grab a few of these we will paste them down here below the tabs and let's add another tag and this change item to year your for I may change these two numerals we'll just see on the space they take up and I guess I can try to put yeah let's some D structure that value again others copy it okay for now let's just change this see what we have already up here we pulling in anything no all right for now I'm just going to change this to the div and it'll just display this okay there we go so now you see we click on these tabs and we get the data changing here so awesome so that works just like we wanted to actually doesn't take up that much space let's shrink it up a bit Gobbo zoomed in here area yeah so if we get it kind of smaller we will have this scroll here okay I can handle that for now all right so now we need a little bit of structure for this part of it and then we'll also work on we will work on this right we we don't really want it looks like this is getting centered or something we don't really want that so we need to fix that too but first things first let's get the data in there and see how it looks and then we can work on styling it a bit more all right and about three minutes we'll go back to the chat and check out what's going on there so I think we'll go with let's see what we have here in material UI in terms of less to be needless see what the list look like yeah I don't think we really need to go with a list like this so we can probably just go with basic like you oli all right so for now and so I'll just build this out right here so we'll need to this will be nice one we'll just do it like this five classes what's the is there something for an unordered list that's like a list header I can't remember if there is a tag like that let me know that was probably better to use for accessibility than just creating an Li and putting a style on it to make it bold you know what we should put this in a grid yeah let's check out how we're using grid elsewhere oops that's my timer let's take a short break I'll go over some questions now on the live chat and then we'll finish up just one part of this component with just some some testing data just so we could see what it will look like and then we'll probably finish up the stream after that I'm going to try to find out where I left off and then answer questions from there okay MV ARMA coding says and Verma coding anyway let me know I'm supposed to say that says can you use material UI with react native apps and as far as I know the answer to that is no it looks like we've got some other answers for that as well Harshit says you can shine ativ base also says it's always a good idea to look up an awesome list for the stack you're using on mpg says what best performance between using regular CSS style or inline react CSS style as a way to styling I'm not exactly sure I mean I would guess usually regular CSS is more performant than anything you can do in JavaScript but I'm I don't have any numbers or anything to say like how much more it is that's if I had to guess that's what I would say our should says performance wise inline styles are the best but it doesn't give you any major feature like media queries etc nowadays we style components solution like emotion style components for rendering react styling yeah there's a lot more solutions for that let me reread this cuz Regulus is just over in Lion react CSS though as a reactivated styling okay yeah I could see that the reason I was thinking the inline react style would require more JavaScript is because there's JavaScript happening in the background to apply those Styles in line but I mean like for instance in this app it would be serverside rendered most likely cached and then served as HTML to the user or potentially if we're doing the clientside routing it would still be cached in our our service workers so in that case I guess it's gonna seem like regular inline HTML you know CSS styles to the user so yeah the inline would be faster so anytime you're not importing an extra file that's going to be faster but usually I don't usually have found like there are the difference in that is going to be so small like milliseconds right it's it's not going to be a huge performance increase maybe there are some circumstances where it would be so I guess I just wouldn't I don't worry that much about that because it's not really a big difference Julito says shouldn't state be assigned inside a constructor I'm not sure we can do state like this I remember listen that they're used to at one point you used to have to do state differently but this way to do state actually I think is the preferred way okay Nietzsche said he's using the babble plugin transform class property so the Declaration of state outside the constructor is valid okay I remember a while a while back and one of the projects we had a big debate about this and looked up whether or not the way we're doing state here is the way we should do it and I can't remember all the details all I remember is that after much debate in research we concluded that this was the way we were gonna do state for these projects it's Sonique Jesus so what fixed it honestly I don't know what fixed it the only thing I did was I did a refresh I opened up to have tools and i refresh the page that's it I don't think I changed anything in here so I'm not really sure what happened but it works now Benny says sorry I wasn't here for the babble stuff oh don't worry about that we've done it honestly we set that up like a year ago for a project and then just kept copying the config over for all our future projects so I don't even I didn't even remember that we were using Babel to get that to work honestly and and I either set it up or I merged the PR that did set it up and somebody else did it so either way I still don't even remember and I should alright okay I didn't get through everything but let's finish up and get something on the screen here for this component that we can look at and then I'll get back to the chat and finish up answering any questions that you have so I figure we'll probably go maybe like a half hour longer on this dream depending on how soon we can get this done and how many questions are in there so if you have any questions get them in there you know somewhat soon before the stream ends all right so where we at here oh I couldn't find where my allies were okay so the grid stuff is where I'm gonna go next I just want to see what the syntax is I forget okay great container spacing and then grid item I and then we need a great item all right so our our grid is it's basically like column classes so if you're thinking CSS grid that's not really what's happening here these are components and material UI well we need to import them okay I just say they say having good set up in your editor for doing react or really any type of coding is save you a lot of time like having an auto highlight things when I forget to import them or it's really helpful otherwise you know before I had this stuff you know I would have forgotten to import that I would have tried to run it I would have got an error bestcase scenario I would have remembered immediately I had to imported you know otherwise I probably would have gone through debugging tried to remove stuff only to realize that I forgot to import that so it takes you know it takes a few minutes to set up but it'll definitely save you a lot of time in the long term alright so we've got this grid here this grid item and I'll explain how the grid works in just a second so right now what we're saying is we have these two grid items and we want each one to take up 12 columns right in the screen so we the system's based on 12 so this means full width we don't really want them to be full with all the time so let's say we want them to be full width if it's extra small but if the screen is let's say medium and up we want them to be 6 so we wanted to take up half the screen right so let's put six in here I think this will do it we want it to do okay so we're gonna save that we're gonna go over and we should get okay so it's showing us now they're stacked like that obviously it's not how I want to style I'm not worried about that right now what should have happened is once it gets larger it should have went to six so I did something wrong oh you know what it's probably MD and not just em and the there we go so we have our columns that are taking up 50% of the width and then once we get to a smaller screen it goes down like that we actually we could probably keep it in the columns for longer so let's drop this down instead of medium screens let's say small oh I don't know how I accidentally pasted that in there okay so this still works we'll have to see let's see how small we can get down with this okay so as long as we don't really have the course names getting really long I mean they can always wrap down on the next line that would be okay this should work okay and then it would be like that for each one I'm not gonna copy and paste each one of these what's gonna happen though is we would pull in this data and it would we'd iterate over each piece of data so most likely each each tab or I'm sorry yeah each tab so each year would be its own object in an array of objects so we would loop over that and for each loop it would add another tab you sign went through the loop and it would also add another one of these divs here and then within that it would show us that we would have our sections but we'd also loop over and put these allies in for each class right so we wouldn't actually have all this markup you know taking up a ton of space right yeah we just loop through it and keep adding this you know programmatically you would just be added right so that's why I'm not gonna copy and paste all this out if it looks right now and it works on one it'll be it'll look the same on the other ones I was I was thinking of like making that structure that array of objects and testing it out but I don't think I'm gonna do that because we've already have you know coming up on an hour and 15 minutes of streaming so I'm not gonna do that right now basically it would be something trying to give an example where we've already done that in this project I can't think of it right now but we would use map right so we would we must do array dot map and then inside that map function that's where we would do all of our all of our assignments here and then each one of these these classes would be another dot map inside of it and so we just have to make sure we structure our data in the right way to be able to do this easily with dot map okay so let's I'm gonna submit this this stuff I'm gonna make a commit push it up to get up so that you all can see all the code that was added and you can mess with it and then that way I won't forget to do it and Michael says didn't we map in faculty list ah yes yes we did awesome let's see that yes I don't want to leave you all hanging here so thank you Michael so here's what okay so we're getting faculty data right so we're grabbing that from graph QL we're getting the faculty data we're doing dot map right here okay so we have this is our return for a react component so we have this stuff that looks like HTML okay this is JSX that's what we call it then if we put our curly brackets here we can jump back into JavaScript land and we can write JavaScript so we're now using this this constant that we've created up here which is just our data that we're pulling in from wordpress and it is an array of objects so we can use map on arrays and then once we have an object we can just use our dot notation for objects right and we can say we want to get faculty so we've we've assigned the name faculty to each object in this array that we're mapping over so we can say faculty dot node so now we've gone and do the dot node object and now we're getting slub we're also getting the title and the content so now this will end up in our page in our HTML with all the content for the zeroeth item in the faculty data array then it will go to the number one which is really the sec item right and it'll get all that data it'll loop through each one and we'll get this on the page for each one but it'll have the unique data of title content and slug so that's we're going to do the same thing it'll see slightly more complicated because we'll have to have nested maps because we have those lists so it'll look a bit longer we'll definitely make it its own component because we don't want to have one component that's really huge with all of that so it'll be its own component but that's what we'll do in here to clean this up and then it will allow us to have all the data will keep our component components really clean the data will get pulled in from WordPress and it's really kind of nice when you can render so much data with so little markup in your components but that's the plan so let me commit this so we're just gonna do a git add and yarn CM so normally you would just do a git commit command after that but we have a special tool set up here that helps us create a nice commit message so that's why it's a little bit different I'm gonna say we're gonna add a new feature and we'll say we've add basic had basic tab core scheduled to major page okay we don't need a longer description we didn't break anything and that's by default and I don't think we had let's doublecheck and see if we did have an issue for this I don't think we did but it's always good to reference it usually I have the link to this there we go also if you would like feel free to take on any of these issues and submit a pull request if you need help with that let me know if activation Oh style sample program sections actually this is regarding that so it's not going to close this issue so here's how we're gonna we're gonna say I believe if we put our e and then the issue number it will be referenced in that issue but it won't close the issue so this is number 102 102 if we were to put fix and then the issue number it would automatically close that issue as well which it's we're not totally done yet so I'm not gonna close it yet but now anybody that looks at that issue will be able to see that this commit did something that has to do with that issue so we have a lot of automated tests that it's running through and automatic code formatting so it's gone through all that it's passed everything and now we can do a git push and we're still in development so we still push to the master branch normally that's not the best idea like if your your project is already live usually people set up a development branch but in this case master is okay so now all this code is available on github and let's check out our issue and we can see here it's been added here we've referenced this issue so eighteen seconds ago so this is our commit and now there's a record of it within this issue as well so that's pretty cool all right okay cool so let me go to the live chat at this point I'm just gonna answer questions all the coding stuff is done we may go back to the code if we get a question that that references the code but otherwise it's question time so if you're not interested in interested in questionandanswer you know feel free to leave the the stream now and thank you so much for watching join us again for another stream at some point otherwise if you're gonna stick around please put your question in the chat now or help answer some questions I definitely do not know everything and I rely on your expertise for a lot oh cool william said the LH tag is the list header awesome I'm gonna put that I'm just gonna make a note right here age I'm gonna put that in there now it's not gonna show up on github but that'll be a reminder to me Thank You William in general if HTML has a solution to something it's better to use it because that's going to be better for screen readers to pick up so instead of as I said before using in Li just putting the class of header on it and then styling that a screen reader won't pick that up as the header right but it would be able to explain that this is the header for this particular list so that's it's definitely much better for accessibility that's not all you need to do for accessibility but it's a great start Harshit says have you checked out the new repo for JavaScript AF that we're constantly maintaining I haven't checked that out in a while I do get updates on the activity that happens so I'll need to check that out and actually are you sure we need to talk about that because I think well I'll have to check it out again but it might be time to do like a real launch if we're ready for it I'm okay with doing kind of like the MVP launcher so a Minimum Viable Product doing that launch and just kind of seeing you know what happens as I know you've been doing a lot of work for it and yeah just be I'm just interested to see what kind of response we get if we officially were to launch it and you know kind of put the word out there to Oh michael says is is LH still supported okay that's interesting I don't know maybe we'll have to check that out trying to find something new these are so old all right let's go past year let's just try em D ends article on the UL to see what can go in there permitted consonant li element hmm maybe not let's check out yeah so there's nothing on LH in in mdn okay so I'm not sure about that okay John Hanson says the proper way to title a list is to wrap a heading tag and the UL tag with a section tag okay let's check this out all right let's let's put that in quickly so we're gonna wrap the entire UL then in the section and the section tag and then within there let's move this up and put it here and change this to like in h3 so John let me know if this is kind of what you're thinking we can actually see if this okay I mean visually that's that's okay I definitely would style this a bit but I mean that works michael said even though i haven't had any motivation to work on my stuff for Udacity slash Google in the last five weeks I still remember little five weeks so you haven't had have you not worked on your stuff for five weeks that's a long time see anyway I think I think we have to try to find a way to motivate Michael to get back to coding so everybody throw your ideas for coding motivation in the chat now or in the comments to the video so yeah you gotta get back into it I do appreciate that you're still watching the stream though that's cool Benny says CSS grade is judging you right now I know but you know what for me it's like I always want to learn CSS grid but it seems like every time I start to get motivated to learn it I do a react native project and then I have to use flexbox again so I I just learned more about flexbox yeah Mel asked what the name of the tool was for better formatting commit messages and Nikki says it's committed so I just wanted to say that out loud in case you can't see the live chat right now that tool is committed in Nietzsche says you can also use commit lint it's it's very similar okay cool I haven't used that but thank you for the recommendation you I developer says what is that live I'd like to take on issues UI developer if you're talking about the github repo that I had up on the screen for this project the link should be in the description of this video oh and I see Benny also mentioned that it's posted in the description thanks many our heart says let's try commit lint this time I feel like should we try it on the next project I'm alright with that eruvin says can someone send somebody be more handsome than Jessie thank you for that I appreciate that it's always good for the ego I did shave yesterday which I hadn't shaved in a while I was getting pretty scruffy so so might be looking less scruffy than normal I guess 8bit engineer says how long have you been coding with reacts let's see over a year now so maybe like going on a year and a half I think Benny said push the master it looks out a window waiting for nuclear missile to launch I suppose I think when you have like one person working on a project or a very small team you can get away with with things that you'd never want to do on a larger project with a large like especially distributed team so so yes we do the push to master Ahmed says how to get react to work in Visual Studio code yeah as far as like extensions are concerned for Visual Studio code a good way to start out with if you're doing react is to get the react foodtruck extension and that will install a lot of react extensions that are very helpful just be careful about performance if you start seeing a lot of lag happen then maybe disable there's one part of react foodtruck I think it's still there it was when I first came out automatically told you the size of the packages you're importing so if you turn that off the performance is fine but that's how it's start what's called react foodtruck so just you know google that and install that and that'll be good to get you started using react with Visual Studio code criticized how easy is WordPress been to integrate into this project to be honest with you like it we've done similar things with WordPress before so it's not that hard to integrate an end because we're you know we were used to it part of the biggest issue that we're having right now is we we can't get some of the fields we're using the advanced custom fields plugin to create what they call repeater fields and we can't get that day right now through graph QL we're using a plugin called WP graph QL so we have not been able to get that data yet we can get other data with advanced custom fields but not that data other than that we've had really no problems that I can remember so I mean it's it's basically you're just getting data from an API you know it so it wouldn't necessarily even matter if it's WordPress or anything else where you can get data from as long as you can get the data and display it you know it's it works and so the only tricky parts on the WordPress end are just making sure that we have the right post types and field setup and making that data available but I try to use a minimal amount of plugins but also minimize the amount of custom PHP work I have to do so it's kind of a balance right now between keeping the plugins you know definitely I like to keep it under 10 plugins if I can and we've done more PHP work than I normally do but we have a lot of custom post types going on all right I should says people will love the news spoiler alert and I will also set up email so that you can get your daily dose of Awesome Devon news and packages that's awesome the arson I'm excited about the news part of it I think that was amazing idea that was your idea right horseshit I want to make sure you get credit for that that's a really really good idea I think so in case y'all don't know we're talking about a while back I happen to purchase the domain JavaScript AF and I asked you all what I should do with it and we've kind of come up with this website that pulls together a lot of really awesome JavaScript repositories from github and a lot of good news and I don't know what all features we have active right now so there's some other features that may be there like a lot voting on things and like you can add your own repos so I'm not sure what features we'll go live with the official launch but I think it'll be a cool site I just kind of like the name I thought it'd be cool to have that name and since I purchased as a thought we may as well do something with it and harsh it and Nicki have done an amazing job of working on that my contribution has mainly been just like paying for hosting um and a little a little bit of guidance on the on the project here and there I don't even know how many pull requests or commits I have but anyway I would love to be more involved with the project but most of my projects now are stuff that I get paid for I haven't really had time for side projects I should said we'll be setting up kubernetes today awesome Albert says how long you're finished with this project I don't know I really hope soon it the way the project will go there won't really be a finished there'll be a launch date and then I'll probably continue to work on parts of it and make it better so some of it will be optimization for the speed some of it will be making it easier for content creators to upload their content through WordPress so I don't fixing bugs it'll be yeah but I'll probably move on to another project and then we'll come back to this project occasionally when something comes up oh cool John says that this this format is the way to do it so thank you John I appreciate that getting close to the end of the chat here so don't delay if you have a question or comment you'd like to get in there I lost my place sorry sometimes it just autoscrolls down to the bottom and I have to figure out where I was at okay Michael says below the UL tag wait so should should that H tag go below the UL I'd see Nietzsche says I've never browsed the web with a screen reader maybe I should yeah it's been a really long time since I've attempted to browse anything with a screen reader but I think that's a good practice for anyway for those who don't know a screen reader is a tool that allows people with vision impairment who can't see your website that allows them to have the websites read out to them and so if your website is created properly it'll make sense when it's read out but if you do weird things with your your markup it'll confuse the screen reader and then also the person who is being read to so we want to make sure that we do the we have our markup be right be correct so it's not enough to just have it display properly visually on the screen and say all users will never check out the code well that's not necessarily the case the screen reader will read through it and it doesn't matter how you styled it wheel with CSS you know if if you did this whole list and you didn't use you ELLs and how eyes and let's say you just made it all divs and then styled it to look like a list screener is not going to pick up on that being a list so it's just something to keep in mind that it's not it's not really obvious if you've never had to use a screen reader then he says Jessie can I have you as a wingman me to be your wingman short oh okay the the extension 4 vs code that I was talking about that uses up a lot of a lot of RAM or a lot of you know computing power is called import cost so if you do load up react food truck and it still comes with import costs you may want to disable import cost it's really cool but it just eats up I remember the stream kept lagging and we couldn't figure out why for a long time and then finally we figured out that it was in for cost when I used to have it on there so that's why I don't run it anymore Deon says Nikki try it meaning try to use the screen reader it helps to become a better Arya developer Arya its relates to accessibility it's like accessibility standards because you can empathize better with users who use screen readers yeah definitely a hundred percent agree Deon this Vishnu says where can I find the starter kit to follow the session I do we have a starting kid really I'm not sure this project has so many streams I'm not sure where the best place to start would be I mean it would be insane to try to catch up at this point I would say the best thing is just to ask a lot of questions when you watch and we'll try to get you caught up you know as we can and I'm going to try to go through the code as much as you can you can always look back on early commits to try to get an idea of where we've come from the link to the repo is in the description to this video Benny says jessie graff ql or rest or both so I really like graph QL better than rest api's because you get just what you want and nothing else in terms of the data so if I had the option use graph QL I will choose graph QL but rest api's are still awesome so I'm not hating on rest api's I just think that using graph kyo to make one API call get all the data you need and only the data you need is definitely better than having to make multiple API calls to hit different rest endpoints and then at each of those calls you're getting back a bunch of data that you potentially don't need okay so harsh it says we're not even using now right now so you can save money there or you can keep bait alive okay so hard so it's cool if I shut down the now account that would actually be good because that's like 25 bucks a month to keep that alive so I mean I unless there's a really good reason to keep it like that I mean I'd be alright with shuttin it down yeah I mean I don't mind covering the cost for this project until we can get some sort of like ad money or funding or something but I mean 25 bucks is 25 bucks right it's being you better to have it than not yeah okay there was some talk about what we're using for the search we are using REST API for the search because our graph QL set up with the WP graph KO plugin can't do what we what we need it to do so we are using a combination of the WordPress REST API and WP graph QL continuances love that domain name thank you I just I just thought up like I gotta have it right I don't know what made me think about it but when I realized dot AF domain names were a thing I immediately just searched for different domain names I can get in JavaScript was one of the first ones I searched for and I was like oh it's open I'm gonna get it without knowing at all what I was gonna do with it I just thought I just want to have it Ahmed said I've been a finished Bo's fundamental so I'm assuming that's that's Bo Karns JavaScript fundamental video series here on the free code camp YouTube channel says where to go from there hmm kind of depends on what you what you want to do have you done the free code camp curriculum yet because I mean I I think that would be good to go through that in terms of video series I mean depending on what you want to do you can check out some of the other things here on the free code camp channel we've been adding a lot of series for all different topics recently this particular series live coding with Jessie is not really great as a tutorial but it can be it can be good just to see what it's like to encounter issues and work through them and see like how we set up like a real project and go through the whole process of testing and launching it and maintaining things so yeah so I'm adding there's value in it as well but not necessarily as a tutorial snick Monty says you seem to be a bit down is everything fine hope everything as well yeah everything is cool I think if I seem a bit down it's probably just because I'm really hungry right now so I actually feel good other than being really hungry but I actually I'm starting to feel really good I've got on some different medication for my depression so fYI if you're new to the channel I do suffer from depression and some anxiety issues and I've I've done a I do a combination of therapy and exercise and medication to try to help with that and I've recently gotten on some some different medication that so I'm on antidepressants but recently I'm doing a like hormone replacement therapy and a thyroid medication I just started that so not sure if it's actually kicking in yet if it's just placebo effect but I'm starting to feel better doctor I went to said you know potentially if your thyroid levels are low and your testosterone levels are low that could also cause depression and since I've been on the antidepressants for so many years and I'm still struggling with depression he thought it's worth a shot so anyway this is not official medical advice I'm not a doctor I'm just letting you know what's going on in my life and particularly how it affects my coding so I think that along with you know working out and you know getting good sleep is helping right it's helping I'm not like you know laughing 24/7 and happy all the time but it seems like I'm doing well so thanks for asking though okay harsh it says the documentation for the UI library is also looking great have a look oh cool often yeah I definitely got to catch up on all that artists I just there's been so busy since since it's like vacation and that since I got back from vacation it's just between this project and the project for for balance so busy okay so Michael criolla saying yeah the H leaves should go inside the UL all right let's do it and let's save that let's check it out oh okay all right I mean I like that that it's lined up more and this will look a lot better once I take away these right so that'll just in case you're wondering that's just CSS class of Lists list type or list style type something like that and then you just put none I think it's liststyletypenone in your CSS and we'll put that on a ul see if it works and if not we'll put it on the Li and see if it works and that'll get rid of that that bullet point thanks Michael Nino says is their library and react it gives you a customizable carousel probably I don't know for sure material you I might have something I don't remember it they might have something but yeah I haven't really had a need for customizable carousel and react so I don't I don't know for sure Luco mania sevices what do you think about having a portfolio website domain using the new domains such as XYZ I think it's okay for your portfolio I mean it's for any website I think it's good like if you can use your name and keep it short that's fine you can't always get like a toplevel dotcom name or something like that so I was really lucky to get it probably because my name is just not that common that I have Jesse Weigel com don't go there it's terrible but one day I'll fix it up but yeah I think it would be better to get the domain name that you want regardless of whether it's about X Y Z or dot IO or do whatever you want it to be then to try to have some weird long name and have it be a.com that's just my opinion speaking of like if I saw somebody's portfolio on a you know on the resume and I saw the link I'm way more likely to go to it if it's just short no matter what the ending is so that's important to me you know on the on the side of like if I was interviewing in for a new developer position or something but I'm not sure there might be some other factors that I'm not seeing world says hard is the honorary boss yet harsh its knowledge of coding is quite amazing so usually when I should recommend something I for sure try it don't always go with it under percent percent of the time but definitely try it and most of the time end up going with it michael says still 44 out watching after 90 minutes must fear record yeah well we have 45 now thank you everyone for sticking around and watching that's awesome usually people can't handle the really long streams we're going up on two hours almost now so all right when I said it to people drop down Deon says way to seize the day with the domain name thanks John says Jesse's videos give you the coding bug to try out new things hear that Michael Creole watch a bunch and you'll be good to go I hike cool Benny says thanks one more sub from here thank you for the subscription I appreciate that I will stalk you for a react native CSS grid really shines when you combine with flexbox one day I will inject it into react native personally sweet that'd be awesome Steven says why depression I had no idea honestly I I don't know why I don't know why I've depression late in my late teenage years it started and I didn't really know what was going on I started having panic attacks and yeah so I've been trying to deal with it ever since I tried to do it without medication for a couple years and you know kind of got worse and so then I tried with the medication with the counseling the best thing for me that helps is stay on a good schedule get exercise medication counseling all like together if I can do all those things consistently together I usually feel good if I start to slack off then I feel bad again so yeah but I like to bring it up because I know some of you also struggle with it and so I think it's helpful it kind of be open about it and I'm in a position where I can be open about it and not face you know any kind of social stigma for it I'm not afraid of being described against at my job for it or anything like that so not everybody's in that position so I figure out you know I may as well take advantage of it why can't you know just share share with everybody Deon says depression is a bummer I need to get some medication myself yeah and I mean I'm not like I said I'm not a doctor so definitely you know check with your doctor and everything you know different people have depression for different reasons and there's different things going on you know so definitely just you know get to a doctor you can trust that can check out and try to try different things just be patient with it because it takes a while to figure out like what medications work and what dosages work well and you know you got to give them time to work so it's it's kind of a long process and sometimes you have to adjust along the way just medication it's just the way you're treating it but it's it's worth it to try you know just if you're struggling with that you know don't give up keep trying even if you can feel good just for a little while it's worth it michael says my wife walked in when you're talking about depression she started pointing at me and told her she needed to see see the stuff before me he says by the way I love that indentation indicator vs code has that highlights at what level you are yeah really useful and since and Jessie you need some bracket pair colorizer in your life if you don't have it already yeah you know what that's been mentioned before I don't think I have it at least not on this computer so I'll have to remember to install that all right michael says the location of the header is more about arias like accessibility than formatting cool I mean I yeah I think it's a nice bonus that the formatting happens to look better in that case to sneak Monty says me to anxiety and a constant feel of worthlessness mainly after a traumatic event that happened two years ago mental issues are crazy hard to think to deal with I never had them before the second year period you know what uh mcmoney if you haven't already I'd recommend researching a little bit about PTSD so posttraumatic stress disorder my wife had the same issues after she had some really crazy health issues with the the birth of our last child so you may be dealing with that especially if there was an event that that triggered all that so look up that and like some of the treatments and things because that might be a good way like if you haven't already like I'm not a doctor or psychologist or anything I just know what my wife went through and so it might be an area you just want to learn more about lugo mania 7 says thank you Jessie you welcome the problem mcmoney says hope from the bottom of my heart that you find peace you have helped me a lot to learn react thank you and and I hope the same thing for you as well Jordan asks what I miss uh huh I guess a lot we've been streaming for over two hours now so you may want to just go back and rewatch I don't know that I could sum everything up right now the whole world's also said it sounds like PTSD yeah Phoenix says finally down to my exams for this semester hooray congratulations I hope you did well well wall root what were you combo come out I'm really sorry I probably just messed up your name please let me know how I should pronounce it but anyway they say what's your take on progressive Web Apps PWA you think that it'll replace native apps I don't know native apps are so entrenched in people's lives right now it will take a while I think it'll take a while so I'm I mean I don't think they'll be around forever but it's gonna take a huge shift like those are less who are developers and understand them I think are way more open to them than the average person who's just like you download an app like that's that's how it is so it's definitely going to take if if let's say Apple and Google on their mobile operating systems really pushed it it could happen but if that doesn't happen I think it's going to be a hard sell because people generally just continue to do what they've always done so unless there's a really good reason for them to start using progressive web apps more they're they're gonna stay with what they have so anyway that's my my kind of opinion on it and I'm take it for what it is I'm no expert right Phoenix says also apparently going through that stressful period of my life imposter syndrome existential crisis feeling like I don't know anything yep all those are my daily thoughts hang in there Phoenix I mean I think I think most of us has been through stuff like that the imposter syndrome gets better at least in my case it gets better really since I started livestreaming my imposter syndrome has gotten better because I've laid everything out there for everyone to see all my code even some like Mia my personal issues things like that and people still watch my show they're still positive about it and so my fear that people will figure out that I have no idea what I'm doing has been proven to be a false a false fear right so that's helped me to get over that so I think the more work you do the more good work you do that you're proud of and that other people like it will help you get over that imposter syndrome Stephen says well Jessie had no idea you ever had it meaning the depression just remember your stream led me to my first frontend programming job so you got that hashtag hype the stream now I'm learning react Thank You Stephen honestly comments like that really do help a lot in this this stream has helped me a lot one of the things with depression is you get depressed like you don't want to see anybody you just want to be by yourself and not do anything and that just makes you more depressed so me wanting to keep streaming for you all has helped me to like I have a community now you know I have you all that I talk to you know very frequently and it forces me out of that state of I don't want to talk to anybody or do anything you know so and it forced to be honestly it forces me to act like I'm not depressed because I don't want to be active pressure on the stream that's you know I don't want to spread my depression right I want to spread happiness so it's literally I like take caffeine and try to pump myself up I listen to upbeat music and I try to act happy even from not and sometimes just that acting helps me to feel happier so I'm always exhausted after I stream which y'all don't see that but like when I saw screaming I just sink back in my chair and just catch my breath right it takes a lot out of me but I think it's it's helpful the stream has helped me in comments like that helped me you all like I feel like we we on it like we have a relationship right we don't see each other in person but you know we we have this connection now and it's real it's it's important connection so I don't want to get all emotional on y'all in the stream but I just want to let you know that I really appreciate you all and it definitely helps me not just in the coding you know but also with the depression and and everything as well Phoenix says coding helps me get through it you have no idea how helpful you are at this time I feel lucky to have top loader of your life James the right time Phoenix I appreciate you saying that I'm really really happy that I could help Eva says are we talking about coding or psychological problems both we normally just talk about coding but occasionally we do talk about psychological problems so if you're not into that right now that's cool don't worry about it we will talk about coding like 90% of the time we talk about coding so it's mainly coding but if you want to talk about psychological issues we do too as well so yeah because I think other things in life affect coding I mean it's just the way it is on MTG says when or what kind of project to use these library for state management and react like Redux because I see you're not using it in this project I'm on a project right now and sometimes I got confused about using it or not when I find that I'm passing props down multiple levels then I consider using state management if I'm not doing that I don't worry about it in general right so if the project isn't gotten like that big that I need to do that I just go without it because it's it's simpler to not use it I have use Redux before I like Redux it's a little tricky but yeah so that's that's usually how I decide whether I want to use state management library or not Carlos says hello Jesse hi everyone I'm late but I managed to get the live feed hey Carlos how's it going Steven says I do need to tweet you some of my sites I've made with the company so you can see what I'm creating I keep forgetting to do that up to 39 new sites and six months of work oh yeah awesome Steven I definitely want to see those so yeah if you if you get a chance and remember I yeah send me those michael says don't most coders have psychological issues I don't know I don't really know I think a lot of people do so I guess coders would do is do as well I've never seen anything that said coders are more likely to have psychological issues but I don't know mental Health's a big deal right and we're learning more about it than we ever have now so I think it's good to talk to talk more about it you know it it's it's gonna help people maybe you don't realize that they even have issues maybe realize like hey wow now I know what's going on with me and and I know I'm you know I'm not alone in this and there's ways to treat it so I think it's I think it's getting better for people to be able to find help and in different ways to treat these things yeah Mel says you just got a new subscriber I have no idea of your coding skills but you sound honest that's more than enough for me thank you I appreciate it yeah I don't know about my coding skills either I build things and they work my boss is happy so that's all I know whether or not I'm better than anybody else I don't know and it doesn't really matter Carlos says I'm actually a clinical psychologist so coding and psychological issues is 100% good for me even if we talk about anything else it's nice to hear it's nice to hear you Wow Carlos that's awesome that's awesome well maybe we can talk about psychological issues sometime Carlos as long as you don't charge me for it since that way I'm just joking michael says sorry Jesse didn't mean to make this a group session oh don't worry about it harsh it says kind of scary to listen to this about the mental issues I'm sorry I didn't mean to freak anybody out Stephen says I will say I was really scared making a career change didn't trust myself and what I knew it did take me some time to build that confidence Carlos is your thing Aloha yeah yeah I mean it's that's that's how it is sometimes career changes and things are huge like it's huge whoa what were you says is it advisable to have a side project while working fulltime I'm doing it right now and I've done it in the past it's just it's a lot of work if I'm gonna do a side project I'm working fulltime I need I need to have a really good reason mostly like I need to be getting paid a lot because that's a time a lot of time away from my family and I need to be able to show something for it like hey family like we can buy this thing that you all wanted or go on this vacation or something because I did this so for me that's what it needs to be for some people maybe it's this is my path to a promotion or getting a job or making the career change it kind of depends on your situation but just be aware like when you put in your regular full day of coding trying to do anything after that it's pretty it's tough it's not impossible but it's difficult and you could easily get burnt out Edward said I'm new here what is this broadcasts all about just really quickly this broadcast is about me doing my everyday work as a full full time of frontend developer and so we do the projects we talk about them together and I answer questions and we discuss things so that's kind of what it's about and I mess up a lot and we get we go through it and try to solve the problems together Stephen says teaching K through five to fulltime programmer was a big change really scary move but I don't regret it Wow I'd say that is definitely a huge change but I'm glad that you like it you don't regret it all right we're getting we're getting to the bottom of the chat here we just have a few more comments and I think we'll wrap things up we have a hello from Ukraine how long will it take to learn to code as a frontend dev I can't give you time it depends on like how many hours a day you have to dedicate to it what you know already and like how how easy it is for you to pick up new concepts so really not sure but you know as soon as you can convince somebody that they should pay you to build a website for them then then your friend right I mean I don't know there's different definitions but to me like once you learn enough to actually build something of value to somebody and and get paid for it then at that point your developer at least a professional developer in the sense of the word like a professional is someone who gets paid to do what they do Carlos says I have to change from clinical psychology to programming 100% I changed from my country to my wife country so I have to do something else here it's scary that's how life is and learning oh okay yeah for sure that it that you know life is is dealing with change Moli it says hi hey how's it going Edward said I'm from Ukraine awesome Carlos's programming is a great asset for life work in any place on earth definitely amaura says how long will it take you to get a master with react how do you get how do you master Java scripts as well I don't really know that that answer is going to be different for everybody in terms of how long it takes to master it and when it comes to programming languages that that change right that can get updated like at what point do you really master that can you master it I think the the right thing to way look at is I'm always going to learn more right I'm always gonna strive for mastery knowing that you may never get there because there's always new things to learn nikki says thanks everyone got to go bye and go go Belgium for the World Cup see you later Nikki thanks for watching thanks for hanging in there for so long with two hours and 15 minutes now I got to make sure I don't go past my meeting haha I didn't think I would even be close to this running into my meeting time at 300 300 p.m. Eastern but now it's looking like it might Mohit says please suggest to me some project form urn stack I don't know if anybody has project suggestions for mine stack please let little hit no I don't really I don't know anything I've stopped my head probably because I've been streaming for so long my brain is starting to get emotional Stephen says it has taken me a couple years of JavaScript still not even close yet but I have a four year old so I only do about an hour on each day in two hours each day on the weekend oh cool cool yeah I totally understand how it is to try to do coding stuff with kids so I can definitely sympathize with you their kids are wonderful they're awesome but for some reason my almost 2 year old wants to help me code which means she bangs on the keyboard and says help that helped edit so it's really cute but not easy to code all right I'm at the bottom of the chat now and I definitely need to end so I can eat something and get all my stuff prepared for my 300 p.m. meeting so thank you all so much for hanging in there for so long and and helping me out talking with me I know we had a lot of new people welcome and I'm gonna be in the office again tomorrow I have a meeting that I have to go to so I'll be streaming again from the office good quality and probably sometime in the afternoon because I have morning meetings after noon Eastern Time so anyway again thank you so much and I'll see y'all tomorrow until then I hope you'll have a wonderful day
