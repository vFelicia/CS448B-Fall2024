everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse today we're going to do something that we've never done before on the stream we're going to work with Salesforce in particular we're going to edit some visualforce pages so I'm going to start out with a little introduction of Salesforce since we've never used it before you may not be familiar with it so sales forces as a product is huge and does a lot of different things so I'm only going to talk about the little piece that we're going to work with because I'm definitely not a an expert on Salesforce it would take quite a lot of research and training to learn it you know everything that it can do so I've learned enough to be able to do what we're gonna do today and even if you have no idea about Salesforce or what it does as long as you know basic HTML and CSS you'll be able to follow this string cuz that's really what we're going to deal with maybe we use some JavaScript we'll see I don't think we'll need to but you never know so Salesforce basically it's it's mostly used by companies who want to track like leads customers right so a marketing tool we at the university that work at use it a little bit differently in that the university you don't have customers in the same sense that maybe another company would have you know like a retail store or something so we have a prospective students right so students usually high school students who are interested in coming to to our schools so there are various ways that they reach out to us so we have an inquiry form for those students who are just you know kind of interested but then we also have an online an application that's what we're gonna be working on today and so what happens is when we have a student who's interested in coming here they get into the Salesforce system and then they're put into categories and there's data available for our admissions counselors it gets them into let's say like what you'd normally call a sales funnel although we don't really consider its sales and as they progress through the stages and then different things might happen they might get different materials so let's see it looks like there's audio popping all right let me try to move my chords around and get them away from my mic all right let me know if you're still getting the pocket that's odd some days I think it has to do with where I'm putting my phone and where the my phones usually plugged into my computer it usually has to do with where it is some days it's fine and other days it's twohour anyway it's Fitz fix that's cool but anyway we're going to deal with that part of the process where a student has decided that they're interested enough in our university that they actually want to fill out an application to go here so we need to work on this application right now we're using an application that does funnel data into Salesforce eventually I did a lot of work on the current application to get it looking as nice as I possibly could but there were a lot of limitations so I have no direct access so I guess I could it would be better if I showed you the current application instead of just talking about it so the URL is not easy to remember so I'm going to go in through this way supply okay so the application to look at it is not terrible it actually shares a lot of the styles that you've seen that we've worked on in other other applications so the header should look familiar the white you know the three pixel gold border the shadows even the shadows on the card so everything is is the same even you know this material design style of the of the inputs so this was all done though with CSS that had to override what was already in there so all the only access I have to this is I was able to have the company that made this put in a link to a CSS file on a server that I do the popping is back you know what I'm just gonna unplug my phone completely and put it somewhere else let's put my foot over here all right so my phone I just now threw it in a chair on the other side of the room so if the popping is still there we'll know it's not my phone at least if if the popping is still there after that then I'll switch up to the the builtin mic on the iMac I think we try to fix this on another stream and I figure okay it's good now all right if it comes back please let me know I'll just quit using this mic let's see where was that I got I got offtrack oh okay we're looking at this so basically the problem is I only can just do CSS work to it so I was limited in what I really could do like you know these inputs there there are little things that I couldn't make it exactly like the other the other forms okay and then on the back end of things there are some other some other problems and I'm not going to go through this form now but basically you need a there's a page refresh that happens every time you go to a different page so it's not a modern experience like you would get in a progressive web app or a single page application where you know you'd be able to navigate around without having the page refresh happen all the time so you you understand what I'm saying I mean the technologies are I don't know how you can see that or not but I mean it's it's jQuery base so the new application we can see we're getting a little bit better here still using some jQuery stuff which is understandable everybody uses jQuery but at least we're using a more modern responsive framework so they're actually using bootstrap for this okay so not bad so what we need to do then is change these default styles to match up more in line something like this it's not gonna look exactly the same but we need to use those same styles we've been using on all our projects it's going to be a little bit different though because we're not gonna have our normal dev environment set up we're gonna have like I just looked check the live chat and are sure that's what extension that is it's wet lap eliezer w APPA al y zer so I'll type that into the live chat so anyway that extension is pretty convenient to be able to just see what's with you don't really have to look at the code just with a click you can see what a website is built with so I'm always curious to see how people do things so this lets me just take a look quickly okay so that's basically you know what we're gonna do we're just going to try to get as much done as possible I don't expect to be able to get everything styled you know properly in here but for today it would be nice if we could get the header looking like the standard header that we've had the white header with the web logo on our gold border at the bottom and the correct shadow also we need to figure out what we're gonna do with this area here I'm not sure how I feel about this yet so maybe you can try a couple different things out I'll tell you what I'm thinkin so y'all can think about it though III see basically two options here I I don't like just this little strip of a of an image to be honest with you this page right here is just to sign up actually this is is me go to the first page login I think the first page is the login page ok this is the first page users will see the whole point is login so why do we have this big image and title here and push the login down far go to the bottom right the user needs to login they're not here to look at images so I'm thinking either completely get rid of the image and just have a very very simple login screen that it's obvious right away login here there's nothing else you can do just login or make some type of full screen background image with the login floating on top of it that way at least the login will stand out more and we'll have the image and the image will obviously be the not the focus it will be in the background and the focus of everything will be the sign and so either way my goal is to have the signin card be the focus so y'all can let me know what you think when we get to that point first things first let's get this header in better shape so let me pull over where do I have it yea let me pull over this Salesforce page and also let me know what the quality of the video is so YouTube changed how you do live streaming and you used to have the option to set beforehand what quality you wanted the video to be but now they took it away and I guess they automatically detect it I want to make sure that we're still able to get 1080p video so I'm trying to check the analytics it looks like some of you are watching in 1080p so I assume since that's happening then from my end it's it's alright I'm over five five thousand kilobits per second so I'm it should be good enough for at 1080p okay so this is what we'll be working with as our file so within Salesforce so if this is the oldschool view of Salesforce so they do have an updated UI my organization is not switched over to the updated UI yet I can do a preview of it if I really want to but by default I still see the old views so if you are using Salesforce if you're a version of Salesforce may look different the how I got to here so probably may not be a big deal if you don't use Salesforce but in case you do I'll just quickly go over how I got here so up in the upper right hand corner for me there is a setup if you're using the newer version there'll be a little Settings icon you know like the little looks like a gear within the settings icon then you can click setup either way once you get to setup you go over here it's gonna look different depending on the version but they'll still be this this sidebar here and you want to go to develop and then expand that and go to visualforce pages then you're going to be given a huge list of available pages figure out what page you want click it and then you're in here the first screen you get won't be this it'll it'll show some info but it's not editable if you have the proper level of permissions in Salesforce there'll be an edit button click Edit and that's how you get into here so I know that was really fast I just don't spend that much time on it if anybody wants to talk about it more later on let me know during the question and answer session let's see I'm trying to find my my timer so don't forget here we go and I will bring it up here ok so let's set that 25 minute timer and get to work ok so I need to figure out a way to make this look a little nicer actually let me pull this out let's pull all this code out and put it in a code editor it'll be a lot easier to see it in a proper editor so I'm just gonna pull this into this page and let's set since this is HTML hopefully it'll it'll deal with these custom tags yeah that's not about it it looks like it's dealt properly with some of these custom tags so basically Salesforce has their own I guess maybe like a templating system it's this apex so a PE X right so they have these apex tags so think of this as I don't know if I want to call them exactly components like in the react if you have components but I it's somewhat like that alright so it operates something like that we could see that it allows us to insert you know variables dynamic content into the HTML so I guess in a sense it does it's you could think of in a similar way teraz react lets you mix javascript in the HTML I know it's really not that it's it's more you put HTML and a JavaScript function but this is a similar thing that we get to put programming concepts right in this case variables into into HTML we're not really going to be messing with that that much though I don't want to mess with what this does by default what I do want to change is the container the HTML shell that's around this so let's see I just remembered I didn't really check the live chat yet so hey everybody just want to see what's going on quickly before I start okay so let's just briefly go through some of this you can see this looks aside from all these apex tags it's a basic HTML page right you have your HTML at your head title tag you know all your links that are bringing in write your icons your JavaScript CSS C we're bringing in bootstrap here they do have some custom CSS where I have been unable to locate in Salesforce where this file is this target X dot CSS I would love to be able to just edit this file directly but I can't find it and I've already spent too much time looking for it so I've just given up on that and we're just gonna add our own CSS and we may end up putting it in a style tag or we could link to it from something else we'll see I can see pros and cons to either way alright so now we get to the body I just put in this class body test just to make sure I had there were a few templates that were all named very similar names so I needed to make sure which one was actually the active template so that's why I've added this in so I'm gonna remove this now since it served its purpose whoops I went to save it well what I'll do is maybe we can make changes here with art so we could use our editor and then at periodically we'll just copy and paste everything into here so I realize changes I make here are gonna do anything yet but I think that'll allow us to take advantage of some of what we the features we have in our code editor it'll probably be easier in the long run to do it like that ok so we have our nav component and and remember if you used to bootstrap try to think in in bootstrap mode in terms of when you see some of these classes they may be familiar to you now this page is actually really basic and that mo of the markup is going to be injected you know with with these apex tags so we're not gonna be able to see everything we may have to do some digging if we really want to change something but I think we'll be able to get a lot done with the combination of this template and chrome dev tools and we may not even have to dig in and find these files this actually feels very similar to what we are doing with that dotnet framework main website page that we were working on a few weeks ago okay so alright so we have some things comment it out okay so this file actually you can see is very very simple like I said really at this point all we're gonna be doing with it is using it to add in some of our styles so let's get to work on picking out some of the things that we want to change so we're gonna go in with dev tools I am for this particular window I'm using Chrome Canary if you're not familiar with Chrome Canary it's the latest version of Chrome I don't know that it's necessarily like the cuttingedge version they might there might be a better version but it's pretty stable and it allowed the reason I like to use this sometimes is that it gives you access to new features and dev tools before they are released into regular chrome when I'm testing a site I like to use the regular version of Chrome because the odds of a user actually using Chrome Canary are super low so anyway so my dev tools may look a little bit different than yours and actually let me let me copy and paste this into the live chat the link I didn't test to see if this was available to everyone but I assume it is I guess I could let's see alright yeah that should be available to everyone actually let's update our Chrome Canary write it canary has updates so frequently which is ok you can see it only took a second to update ok now let's go into our dev tools and let me try to get this so I'm not worried about these errors because I really can't do much about them anyway like I said there are some files that I have not been able to find so I can't fix that so let's save some space and just minimize that and let me know is this font size too small in dev tools I can probably expand it a bit and make it a little bigger I'm afraid if I get too big we just won't be able to see things all right so let's try to target this a nav bar and I've already the only thing I've done is I've pulled in the low the proper logo and I'm actually I'm maybe going to find a better solution than this but right now I'm just linking directly to the logo that's on that Resource Center that we that we built maybe a month or so ago ok so we're gonna have that's interesting so it looks like we're gonna go the nav component itself yeah the napkin phone is what we want yeah ok so here in the nav component let's change some what we're doing we don't want a border at all so I don't think yeah first let's let's do some things to cancel out some of the styles that are in there you can see these are coming from bootstrap I have no desire to edit bootstrap directly I think that's a mistake so let's just work with what we have so we're gonna go bordernone so we have no border there but then now we want to do a border bottom and we're gonna go with three pixels solid and we need to grab that gold color and I always forget what it is so where is it this is the fastest way for me to get this gold color probably in this project that's fine CSS we don't anything in our CSS let's see if I can find where we use this then we put in our app bar nope do not put it in here I do not remember where we put all of the styles a few guys theme that's gotta be it we didn't even put it in there alright enough of that that's a waste waste of time let's go here and just inspect this one very an h1 really that whole things in H tag you see what kind of ridiculous stuff happens sometimes when you don't have control over the markup my entire at bar at the top is an h1 tag it's insane it's an h1 to anyway that stuff just it just amazes me sometimes but this is actually this is what I had to do to make an AB bar the only element that would work for this was an h1 so anyway uhhuh that's just that's just the way it is sometimes you gotta work with what you have okay bringing back all these memories of when I actually did that work and how frustrating it was it's it's a mix of fun and frustration it's fun because it's like I can't believe I just took this crazy markup and it made something that looked decent with it and then frustration because it's like all I need is a div right here and you can't do anything you can't put the div in okay cool so we have our border at the bottom now we need our shadows so let's grab we could check the shadows here yeah I guess we'll just use these shadows I do want to make sure that they match actually these do look like the newer shadows initially we use slightly different values and I'm talking like maybe a year ago or something we had slightly different shadow values and then materialized CSS updated and added a third line here in their box shadow and so I don't I don't remember what we updated what we didn't so anyway that does look good that looks like the right values so let's use those so we're gonna throw in this whoa it's not let me paste that in that's let's try again we're just gonna grab the values this son and we'll type box shadow on our own sometimes paste thing into dev tools can be a little weird if you paste if you accidentally paste the wrong stuff it just rejects it yes it worked that time awesome whoa maybe it didn't what did I do oh I type accidentally Ted bucks sizing box shadow that's what we want okay great and that should work let's check back here we can't really see it but there should be a shadow you can slightly see the shadow so all right cool so we have that down the basics down there it's not what I wanted so let's grab these and pull them over huh I'm actually not sure what the best way to to do these styles is you know what let's um for now let's just open up another another file here and whoops let's let's just start putting styles in a file and then that way we don't have to make a decision on where to put the styles and yet never yeah let's just use nav bar dot nav are there we go okay actually let me save this in case something happens and I guess I should say this is a project so let's make a new folder and call this so forth yeah I'll just call it Salesforce and let's go application dot CSS okay cool so now we can let's try to make this logo look like it should look so we need every nerve container assuming it's in here there we go so target X header University icon wow that that is quite a quite a large class so I'm just gonna paste that class in here right now so now we're gonna be using that and let's see it's just it's simply a background image so you can see the background image it goes back to this default so we're gonna take that background image and we're definitely going to keep that at least for now we're gonna keep that that URL so we'll have that in our file now what we want to do is add in some some options here see you check my timer alright good eleven minutes let's see so wow it's been a while since I just did straightup CSS its background let's go background repeat' cuz we definitely don't want to repeat no repeat and then background is it sighs there's so many background properties there we go that's what I wanted sighs cover contain container I don't want I guess contain is what we want for now and then okay we need to set it with let's go with actually there we go that looks good let's check that out for a minute okay what's that sighs look actually I like that sighs that's not too bad let me see what it looks like here nice all right that's actually it was a breakpoint I think we'll be fine even great all right I really like that I think that's perfect so let's let's copy this over and paste it I do want to see if we even need this no repeat that's yep we definitely need that I was hoping we we didn't need it when we put the contain on but we will so always worth it to try to save a line of code though there we go okay awesome all right so it looks like our header is looking a lot closer to what we our standard header is now we definitely want to change I don't mind this this online application I actually really like this font off to double check and see what font this is I'm just I'm interested in seeing what they have loaded already let's see the font family hi it's just open sans that looks really nice being being thin like that obviously we're going to import Roboto that's the font that we use for everything I'm not going to do it right now though we'll see how things go so I think with let's change this to that green color the font color to green and then we'll change these icons to green I hope I just got to do this I really really hope these are font icons or SVG's if not we're gonna totally replace these icons actually we might replace these icons no matter what before we're using an interesting huh really interesting okay so here's what I'd like to do I'm a just now I think about it I may actually just remove the icons I don't think we need any icons there sign up and log in or find the thing here's the one thing I did not like about those icons okay obviously those weren't material design so icons but aside from that it seemed to me like that icon was supposed to be a male a silhouette of a male head okay so I would rather use an icon for a person that would be genderneutral that's just a personal preference for me and I think I think users would appreciate that even if it's just they don't realize it I I prefer to do it like that so in this case I actually like it better without the icons I think the icon and the text was unnecessary so let's while we're down here let's grab all this and we're gonna reset the content let me grab all this and calendar before email before you had our user all right let's get rid of this because I don't want to mess with those yet what I do want to worry about is this header user before now I'm assuming that that's what this is content and then we're just gonna give it that let's double check target X header user yep that is what we wanted okay great so now that's gonna remove that for us while we're down here let's um let's see where we're getting the font color from target X header you so it is in fact on that target X header user okay so we're gonna have to grab this header print counter you know you know what let's grab all this and change the color of it ok this will be that green color so actually I used to have the highlight that worked an atom that showed the color but it was throwing all kind of errors it's the pigments is the the package and it's thrown all kind of errors so I turned it off so you can't see the color that was always nice but not necessary ok great so that should be fine for the font color let's let's just change it here just so that we can get a nice visual okay there we go and all right let's see what we have here where we're getting that color from Target etc university name great let's just add this here we can manually add it in here just so we can see it great okay now I'm gonna change the font the font way the size probably at some point for now this is okay I just want to see what the colors look like and I want to see what the color looks like for this online application but I think the gray might it might work out it might look nice with the gray so we're gonna try it but maybe we'll switch it back so let's see actually let me do this I'm gonna add in an another attribute and that way we can switch back and forth 52 colors more easily okay so here's the green let's zoom out because a user will almost never be zoomed in that much and we're going to toggle back and forth hmm interesting I'm not I'm not sure that I have a preference by their way so here's what I'm going to do let's put this in here and we'll just make a little note so that later on we can make a decision on that okay my timer is up so I'm going to do five minutes of questionandanswer in the live chat and then we'll do another 25minute session of just some CSS this is actually pretty fun for me I I mean I started out doing a lot of CSS just like this people would come to me with existing sites that needed work done and I would go in there and just try to make the best of it so this is very like natural and fun for me so I'm having a good time hopefully you are enjoying it as well I read an article yesterday I forget where it was from but the article was someone recalling a conversation they had with a person who was attempting to hire developers that could work with just regular HTML and CSS they said they were having trouble finding people like that they could find people that knew how to use frameworks they could use angular react view and do really well but anytime they asked him to do just a simple basic CSS change or vanilla JavaScript change they couldn't do it and I that was really interesting to me because I haven't had that experience I came up through doing just normal CSS and JavaScript before I started with react and different frameworks so but they were saying because of coding boot camps there are a lot of people a lot of developers now that are coming through the coding boot camps they focus on the frameworks like react or angular and you learn that and to save time because they need to get in so much material they skip over a lot of the basics you know why learn CSS if you could just use bootstrap right or some component library so anyway I thought that was interesting so maybe I'll try to occasionally throw in some basic CSS stuff like this because evidently there's some there's some need for it in some cases let's see okay I'm bear to saying the image looks very gloomy are you talking about this image in the background I think at that point in the stream we were talking about this image so potentially yeah actually this image is the default stock photo that came with this this application so we we hired a thirdparty company that's not Salesforce but they developed this for Salesforce and this is their default thing so I don't even know what school this is but we're definitely gonna if we keep an image we are going to take that out actually I just made up my mind we're not gonna have an image in it first if people higher up than me tell me I need to put an image back in I will but we're gonna save so much time by not having to go through images and pick what image we want for this and then edit the image okay so let's just let's just do that and then of course I would want to have responsive images so I would want multiple crops and sizes so that's we're gonna save a lot of time no no oh man almost locked me out okay oh cool so Michael Creole says my first time watching you live awesome thank you for joining us hopefully you're still joining us I know you sent that message a while ago about a half hour ago yeah but that's awesome I'm so glad that you could you could join us live and thanks for letting me know so feel free to send me any comments or questions that you have and I'd love to hear more from you Harshit says I guess Salesforce is the company who made Heroku oh really I did not remember that that's cool yeah Salesforce is a really big company they just either built or bought one of the biggest buildings in San Francisco for their headquarters so they're quite quite a successful company right now a harsh it says the editor looks like notepad plus plus yeah does it definitely looks like notepad plus plus I was not in a hurry to use that that builtin editor okay I see something about font size let me increase that font size again oh maybe we'll have to extend this a little bit all right maybe right there we'll be all right Oh Michael says here in the woods of Mississippi I'm struggling to get 360 probably not your fault oh man I'm sorry that must be really hard to see everything I'll do my best to describe everything because I it's probably tough to see it on 360 we'll talk about video quality so anyway Michael uh awesome you're from Mississippi I don't recall anyone ever on the stream saying that they're from Mississippi so you might be the first person well harsh it's in the Himalayas I'm not sure if I had anybody say they're in the Himalayas before so that's that's cool all right so my timer is up I'm gonna grab a pen and write down where I'm going to leave off here in the live chat so I can find it more quickly later on and let's do another 25minute coding session and the first thing that we're going to do first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna grab this code and that we just did so all this and we're gonna put it in and see if it works I definitely want to test it periodically because I'm not sure if this is enough to override the styles that are in there right now sometimes you never know what gets injected into the page in line that could be overriding thing so now's a great time since we've finished this one component here I think now's a great time to check that out we don't want to forget though there is this dropdown menu so oh great okay I was worried that it would it would mess up a lot when we changed our Styles you know what I think this is fine the only thing that I'm gonna change about this is I don't want I want this to not have a background and I want this icon to be green let's go ahead and change that now and then we'll check it we'll check out the code so icon bar okay so the for the icon bar or default never tell you icon bar all right let's change this to 2a oh goodness this is how they did it oops that's not what I wanted I'd wait a second hold on this is so interesting okay bordercolor all right let's get rid of that border so no border color none will that work no we're gonna have to go transparent okay so let's let's throw this in here now so we're gonna have several elements they're gonna have to edit so let's go with bordercolortransparent for that navbar and then this is taller navigation that's for the screen reader so see this is s our only screen reader only and then it has text so that a screen reader when it gets to this we'll say it's the toggle navigation so that's useful for people who can't see or have trouble seeing and it's it's a good it's always good to think about that when you're developing so I think it's something that is really easy to forget but it's so important for people with disabilities to be able to have access to the site it may not seem like a big deal but to that person it's a huge deal all right so did that actually show up as green now it did yeah it was just a bit hard to see I want to doublecheck what we're using on our other sites in terms of borderradius for these so let's let's quickly go to let's go to the resource center and let's check this out it's not let me zoom why not now that's weird there we go my trackpad has been acting a bit weird okay so it looks like there's no borderradius on those so let's change that up I'm gonna leave this open so we can reference it more quickly whoops there we go okay so now back to here let's change our border radius to zero there we go now we have the look that we want great so let's take this just grab this and we're gonna grab this one so anyway if I sounded somewhat amazed when I first looked at this and that was because I realized that this is not a font icon or an SVG this is in fact three spans that just have a background color but yeah that's so interesting and actually you could do quite a lot with this since it's three spans I mean you could use some CSS animations to do some really cool animation things I've seen cool things done with these before so we're not going to do anything like that right now but it's just kind of cool to see it done like that I've seen it before but I never do it like this so it's just is kind of interesting to see how other people do that and okay I didn't copy that yet okay and we can remove these because we don't really want to change that all right now I think it's time to test this out so let's copy everything that we have here and let me let's paste it in so let's find a good spot here in the head to put in oops you know what I forgot that's not how our flow is going to go it's good too have a good workflow so things don't get messed up so I have a lot of experience with having to work with old systems or within these other systems and so you kind of have to just improvise a workflow since you can't have it ideally the way you want so here's the workflow what the workflow is going to be we're always going to edit this file first and then copy and paste everything over that way we can have a copy locally and actually I'm going to need let's just save this now in our projects under Salesforce so let's call this app template dot HTML great now let's create a style tag and then we can paste in all our Styles now we'll copy everything over and paste it all in this will it's it might seem kind of weird to do this now but if we start editing multiple places in here and going back in and trying to edit things it's going to get difficult it's much easier to just every single time we do something completely replace everything then trying to scroll through and find the exact spot where we need to edit things so in the long run the feedback loop is going to be much shorter if we just do it like this controls ctrl a ctrl c ctrl V is really fast to do I'm sorry I'm on a Mac its command so anyway so let's do save I recommend quick save if you're working in Salesforce save will take you back to the original page and then you have to hit edit again and go back in click save let you stay on this page so let's do a refresh and see how much of what we've done what we've done is actually gonna work okay not too bad it looks like our colors are good the border is good I I can see the shadow great obviously the logo the color here is I believe that's a green it is but we do have an issue with with this though showing up so that's one thing we'll have to override and let's check this out oops we have a hover I had never took away the hover effect so we want to get rid of that okay so let's let's do that so two things we need to do get rid of these guys and then get rid of that hover effect so let me do the hover first so I don't forget because the icons are a lot more obvious so let's inspect that and what we're gonna do so this is the the element that we're going to be working with we can go in here and dev tools and click on hover and then click the box for hover and so now we don't have to move our mouse over this it's going to be permanently hovered until we uncheck this and now we can see the hover styles so let's grab let's just let's grab all of this and but set transparent as the background color right normally we wouldn't be setting transparent as a background color that's ridiculous right but remember we're not going to directly edit this file so we have to think how can we override everything so actually let me see by default ever see where I want to put this thing I'm gonna put it here yeah that makes sense we're going to have to give a little bit of thought to our net organization of our code and actually I messed up on my um on my workflow here it should have gone here first I guess it doesn't matter we could do it either way it might save us a step if we just did it all here but I wouldn't kind of like to have a separate copy okay so you have that here say that there and so that should be taken care of and then finally let's go in here and inspect this and make sure it should be this before you know what maybe we edited the wrong thing let's take a look at this again hmm that's interesting oops I think we we went to the wrong before so well yeah we just need to edit our CSS so let's go ahead and do that I'm not even gonna test it in dev tools because I target header user okay because I am 99% sure that this will work just like this we'll just amend this here all right now let's let's give it another test before we move on quick save this kind of thing really makes you appreciate live reloading great okay so that works now No okay we've done something wrong here let's double check what we had here in our code whoops this is the problem his parents okay great now that that does work awesome you know what I think we have a hover effect right here on this text I can barely see it good let's see probably on this span let's check out the hover on the span no let's check out the hover here yep there we go okay so on this this a tag we have a hover effect where the color changes yeah I mean that's not a huge deal you can barely tell but I'll I'll see it so let me change that okay this will be an easy change just without we're going to do that we're just going to go a to a target etc user we're going to add this on here area and that should work okay I'm not even gonna test that that's that's definitely gonna work okay awesome so we've got a totally redesigned header I don't want to say totally I mean it we didn't do that much here right and we just remove some things but now this already just because we did the header I think this already looks like a Franciscan University website according to the the updated styles that we've been using so awesome awesome that looks a million times better than then would it look like an hour ago sorry that sounded like I was I was bragging on there I'm just I'm not I didn't mean for it to come out like that I'm just happy that this all worked out and it I'm happy with the way it looks right now all right so let me check out the time eight minutes okay let's see just see what we'll do nice let's just take this image out of here you know what I'm gonna see if I can find the actual element where this image is because here's what I don't want to happen I don't want us we could test this out for sure but what I'm afraid might happen is that this image would somehow get loaded anyway if we just try to override it so let's see what what this image is yeah it's probably it's a background image so yeah I don't want it to accidentally get loaded next word hero so if we can find this let's just try to remove it target X dashboard here oh I have a feeling that we're not gonna find it in the file but it's worth a shot so let's go back to our template file and find target X dashboard here whoa did you really find it crazy all right oops let me make this bigger sorry I am I don't know why I forgot to make this bigger all right so let's see wow we do have this here amazing target X 4 hero all right so let's see what we can move you know what I want to remove this entire thing there's no reason why we need Franciscan University student will here when we have it right here we have the logo here it's entirely redundant and unnecessary let's just get rid of this entire section they're calling a hero section here and then we don't have to worry about trying to fit our logo into here this is going to save us a lot of time and I don't think that we're really gonna lose very much aesthetically by getting rid of this section and it's definitely gonna be worth it for the amount of time we'll save so let's for now I'm just gonna comment these out I do have a backup of this so we can mess it up as much as we want and I have backups but for now I think it's which it's still better if we just comment it out and then it'll make it that much easier to bring it back if somebody sees that and freaks out and wants it back so insert hero alright so I'm hoping that I don't get an error by taking things out but let's let's find out I know when we were working with csharp and we try to take some of the stuff out we got an error and we had to do some other stuff but this should be fun I was afraid that would happen shoot you know I'm just gonna take this out and user use your name shoot hold on a second I want to see what this is and if this is going to be important at some point yeah okay I think I do want to keep this this little user that's kind of a nice thing a nice personalized thing it was commented out though and I don't know if they just it was in there just for a demo of what it could do you know what let's log in and see what this really does on the interior pages so we're gonna need to sign up so it's great I bet I get admissions pamphlets and stuff mailed to me not maybe if I use my Franciscan do you address somebody in admissions will realize that like I have a user already all right fine then let's use a different email just a while Jima it actually wouldn't be a bad idea for me to get these mailings I'd like to see and then that way if there's any UI issues with the emails that they send out to prospective students I'll be able to see them where's my email okay well so the email that gets sent out check that out so that could definitely use some work I don't know how much control we have over that but there's a few things obviously it's not aesthetically pleasing at all I'm not the best at making emails but so I'm not really shouldn't be talking about this but that could use some improvement and look at the email the from email JRM team dot franciscan so this is not it should not be that it shouldn't be JRM team at Frances the Franciscan agenda board calm all right well I don't think I can change that right now off there just deal with it later on all right so I'm going to create a password on my other screen okay so I was making sure that I added all of that it's the last pass I don't forget it so let's let's login whoa interesting all right so we're dealing with and this is using angular for this this looks like angular they are okay so the once you login it's using angular ok so I guess we're gonna have to do a whole different set of styles for all the interior pages alright well good to know you're not gonna get to it today but definitely need some work okay so that's taking a lot longer than I would expect all right so my 25 minute timer is up and yeah it's definitely up so I'm gonna go back to the live chat I'm gonna go through all the questions now and then trying to think if there is something now for some reason I thought there was something I want something else I wanted to do but now I can't think of it so I'm just going to go over the questions in the live chat so pick up where we left off after the last break so we're done with the coding portion of it which is good because I can't get this page to refresh now anyway but really nice definitely I for sure wanted to get the header finished today and we accomplished that we actually got a little bit farther and started checking out the code for that hero section so it was a good day and hopefully you all got something out of that just for some CSS stuff I um wasn't quite as interactive as normal mostly because I hey I don't need as much help with the CSS alright so let me find out where I left off okay so the all right I can't pronounce his PA t vq i'm just gonna say the pat so the pat says hello i want to build a simple portfolio blog site so i can update my progress so make posts in learning coding do you know any tutorial with Django or nodejs blog creation yeah there's a there's a lot of different tutorials that you could go to I guess it kind of depends on how complicated you want to make it if if you want to do this project of a blog as a learning experience then you could try to make one from scratch using node or Django or whatever you want if the goal is just to get a blog up and running as fast as possible so you can you know start posting things then you could just run a wordpress blog very simply they have the five minute install which I mean literally it is five minutes or less so that would be the simplest thing to do but if you wanted to get a little bit more complex you could use what's it called is it Jekyll is that is that the like the static site kind of creator that a lot of people use for blogging there's something else too it's a ghost I can't remember all the names of it but yeah you can definitely you can get a blog up and running you know in less than an hour if you just do a simple WordPress blog or you can be more common if you wanted to get really complex and just work on your skills you could check out what we've done with the WordPress API and react and nodejs in our previous streams of project one project and project four were all in slightly different ways basically building sites that have blog functionality even though we're not calling them blogs with WordPress node and react so depending on how complicated you want to get there's a lot of options out there for you Harshit says check traverse see media so I've never looked anything from Travis II but I have seen that recommended before so check that out Harris asked how well does free code can't prepare you for that's weird did that just take me to the main page the homepage it did that since that's not good oh shoot and that's not even what I wanted that's really weird actually let me take this out now before somebody sees this because I know this is probably a just a demo user but I doubt that they would want that let me remove that and this you just take the Sun okay there we go never this looks like one of my sites now right lots of white very plain the point is a site like this will load so fast right and users know what's gonna happen so they know what they're supposed to do anyway we'll clean this up tomorrow or some other Sun all right so it's re harris i am i got sidetracked so the question was how well does free code can't prepare you for salesforce development i learning the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript will prepare you well for any kind of web development but in particular Salesforce development has a lot of things that are unique to Salesforce so any course that's not specifically Salesforce is not going to fully prepare you for it but you just see now we're making modifications to a Salesforce visualforce page and we're able to use so far basic HTML CSS so that base will be able to it will help you to to do a lot and then you can just pick up some of the the more platform specific things later on so the answer is is I guess not fully so free code kind of will not fully prepare you to develop for Salesforce but it's going to give you the necessary basic information to be able to then build on and learn some of those Salesforce specific things so says rook says the screensaver behind you is mesmerizing do I have a screensaver me and I maybe it was on I didn't even notice let me see I didn't realize you could see that oh oh I guess you can't see that screen this is a really old Windows laptop that I have an external monitor hooked up to and I never use it it doesn't even have an internet connection I used to use it for testing but I just can't stand it it's too slow I don't have patience to deal with that old slow computers Blake says I didn't catch what Salesforce's can you react splain it rooks rook recommended rewinding the livestream to see it I'll give you a very short explanation though in case you didn't do that or if anybody else is interested Salesforce is a platform that's mainly used by businesses to track customers or potential customers or clients get them in a sales funnel and track them along the progress of being a potential customer you know actually being you know paying customer and then doing remarketing and things like that so it Salesforce can do a ton of stuff but I think basically that's the main goal of how a lot of people use sales was in our case for my university we're using this to help us organize the process that we go through to attract potential students and to have them you know actually go through the process of enrolling and coming to our University okay Harshit says I guess it's pas a platform as a service yeah yeah yes I think that would be accurate okay michael says regarding adam what packages are you using uhhuh a lot of faxes let me bring up let me show you my config yeah I'm just gonna scroll slowly through my packages I don't know this isn't gonna give it all is it shoot let me go to this you then I forget what the file is that shows all your packages so I'll zoom in oh I can't I was thinking I could save I'm just gonna scroll through these slowly so that you can check them out and then if you need to you can pause the video or rewind it later on okay so into my packages okay cool so some of you are saying where are you from so Tennessee so let me see so Dione is that let me know if I'm pronouncing that wrong D IO and any so I'm I'm thinking it's Dione but correct me please if I'm wrong from Tennessee so that's cool you're from Tennessee I'm going to be in Tennessee speaking at a conference at the end of November so November 28th and 29th I don't know what day I'm speaking yet but I'll be in Nashville so if you're gonna be around Nashville and can go to a conference check it out it's called November the tickets are still on sale it's going to be on the on a campus at Vanderbilt University so anyway check it out if you can and I'll be there and if you're there come and say hi to me also if you have any recommendations for what I should do when I am in Nashville please let me know if anybody has some natural recommendations cool Blake's from South Carolina cool I like I love Charleston South Carolina that's one of my favorite cities it's just I've I've rarely ever seen a city so beautiful as Charleston and the food there oh it's just amazing if you like seafood Charleston is the place to go let's see haha Michael said that that email that I showed earlier looked like a phishing email yeah it does that's a good point actually if I say that I think I'll definitely get the access or get that changed if I bring up the fact that it looks like phishing email so I'm really glad you said that Peter asks if I've ever played bf1942 so battlefield 1942 I have not is it good should I play it but let me is it a firstperson shooter because if it is I can't play it I get really emotional a firstperson shooters I can't handle it I used to take Dramamine which is a it's a pill that you can take that makes you it relieves motion sickness symptoms but it also makes you really tired so I used to take Dramamine at night play Call of Duty I'd play with my dad and then play until I was too tired and just fall asleep otherwise I'd be so sick michael says if you've got to fix that it might be time to ask for a raise actually I did I went to go make a joke to my boss earlier but he wasn't in his office but I was going to say hey now that I officially graduated from the Udacity react nano degree program I think it's time that I get paid more money I know that's not gonna happen right now but I just wanted to mess with him well maybe I'll check and see if he's here after know the strength okay cool allit Alessandra Alessandra or Alessandra let me know which way to pronounce it I don't want to mess it up says Gatsby J s that's I think that's what I was trying to think of Gatsby so that's for the I'm sorry I this for the blogging thing earlier we're talking about an easy way to get started blogging check out Gatsby jazz used it yet but I've heard really good things about it like at conferences and things so I I recommend it in the sense that I've I've heard that it's good okay cool Dion thanks for the the help with the pronunciation so it's Dion rhymes with neon awesome that's a great way to remember it so Dion says what skills are technologies do you consider to be intermediate frontend there are no junior level jobs in my area and a recruiter suggests that I apply for midlevel roles yeah definitely when it comes to applying for jobs do not be intimidated when you're trying when the Job Description seems like it's beyond which you can currently do apply anyway sometimes those job descriptions are written by people and Human Resources who are good at what they do but they have no idea what these coding terms mean so they'll go into the IT department or whatever department that's hiring a coder and say what do you need that coder to be able to do and they'll list a bunch of things that they'd like the person to do and then the HR person just puts them all down on a list not realizing that this kind of seems ridiculous to have somebody with all these different skills or I've dealt with that process of trying to make a job description that would make sense to a coder even though it didn't make sense to the HR people so anyway you never know what's going on behind the scenes with that so number one this isn't exactly a question but number one go for those jobs even if you don't think you have the skills yet also when it comes to intermediate frontend skills this is really it's kind of hard to it's hard to say for sure where that line between beginner and intermediate and then intermediate and expert is so I it's not like we could really give an exact you know place but I would say if you are to the point where and like I said this is entirely my opinion because I don't know that there's any for sure standard of what's intermediate but to me is someone claim that they were an intermediate level developer and were supplying for a job to work here I would want to see preferably on github I would want to see that they've been able to take a project completely build out the project connect to api's pull in data work with forms form validation handling form data I would want to see that they're able to use javascript techniques beyond just jQuery so whether that be some sort of framework like react angular paraview or others or whether that be they're using vanilla JavaScript or whatever but I want to see their beyond that I'd like also to see depending on the job it would be nice to see some custom CSS work so that they're going beyond just a normal framework the frameworks are really nice and I recommend using them whenever you can but it's nice to know that someone can adapt it as necessary so those are the skills that I would be looking for just in general it's hard to say you know because so much depends on specifically the the job and what needs to be done but but the big things are they can do things from scratch with the that makes sense or adaptive framework they can do more than just basic jQuery and actually do some more advanced JavaScript things that can potentially mean being able to handle using a framework and if it's like reacting a frame where they can manage state properly and then can they interact with api's can they pull data make sure that you know make sure that their sites are checking you go they're checkin these they're validating their form inputs are they checking to make sure that when you know data comes and when it's not when it's not there are they providing fall backs like you know error messages like things that things that separate the work from being like just a project that you're doing and being something that is actually deployable live and is reliable anyway so that was probably kind of vague I'm sorry if it if it was too vague for you but hopefully that that helps a little bit but in general my advice for that kind of thing is just keep working and keep pushing yourself and doing projects and keep applying you just you never know what's really going on and when a job description is created so it's worth a shot to applied it to anything that you're even remotely interested in okay Blake said did you see my question on Ajax I did not let me scroll up okay I'm sorry Blake I don't know how I missed that Blake's question is I'm sending data to a Google sheet using Ajax and in two of my fields I get undefined docs.google.com spreadsheet oh okay I checked all my name attributes code is like two on this up state all right let me check I actually have your your github open right now on another in another window so it's github upstate okay so this is assuming it's in contact je s yeah that's for your sending a Google sheet okay I'll check that out after the shingon all the time it is yeah if I have time today I'll check it out after the stream otherwise maybe I'll check it out tomorrow and I'll let you know maybe I'll just submit a pull request I don't know we'll see anyway I see it now sorry I missed that before Blake I've worked with sending form data to Google sheets before so hopefully I'll be able to sort it out now I won't be able to see what code you have going on on your Google sheet in Google Apps Script so if the problem is on that side of things obviously I can't do it and I won't be able to fully test it out so if it's something obvious that I can see I can help with otherwise I probably won't be able to help I can always maybe try to make my own she will see how much time I have okay Deon says darn I have to work is it livestreamed actually I I don't think it's gonna be livestreamed we actually add so on Twitter there was a conversation back and forth between the people that are running the conference and somebody from the livestream who was it I can't remember now who it was about live streaming stuff from the conference from November and it didn't seem like it was going to happen that it would be live streamed so probably won't get live streamed if the Internet's good enough I might try to shoot some footage if I'm allowed in either live stream it or upload it to YouTube it's going to place it'll depend on the quality of the internet there so I'll try to put out some content no matter what I know the keynote talks are going to be put on YouTube I don't think they'll be live streamed so I may or may not my talk may or may not be on YouTube so we'll see how cool Blake says it's nice so we when I was talking about Charleston South Carolina Blake says it's nice I live in Greenville it's probably the second nicest cool I've never been to Greenville maybe I've five a chance off to check out Greenville to okay Deon says thanks for your input to my question you're welcome they said hopefully that that had helped let me know if you have any followup questions or anything either in the stream or you can send me a message on Twitter or whatever social media be more than happy that answer any questions you have especially if it's something more specific sometimes people prefer to ask more specific questions over you know Twitter or something like in a direct message so I'm I'm up for that too sometimes if I'm really busy I can't always get back to you right away but I'll try with it to get back to you within a couple of days okay Blake saying asking if I want the Google script yeah actually if you could send me the the Google script then that would be helpful because then I could make my own and and test it Harris says what's your schedule like how do you balance we're teaching plus keep on learning more so I'm actually not teaching so my work here is I'm a fulltime frontend developer so my workday is it's supposed to be an eighthour workday but that includes one hour for lunch sometimes my hours are weird and it doesn't work out like that but in general that's pretty much my schedule of work I usually work on Saturdays on on learning more so if I have a class or a client on the side I do that work on Saturdays sometimes I do it before I come to work and on my lunch breaks occasionally I work at night during the week so I don't really have a consistent schedule for that other than Saturdays so I don't like to always work on Saturdays because I do want to spend time with with my family and I for four kids eight years old and under so I'll probably be taking a break from working on Saturdays now for for a while I'm I don't know we'll see unless something comes up like a project or client i I don't maybe I'll take a break until till after the new year he's I've been pretty busy since basically this whole year with side projects so that's kind of how I managed to learn more with the teaching thing I'm I was actually hoping to be able to teach a little bit in the computer science department this semester but things kind of fell through with I was planning on doing some sort of team teaching thing but the schedule of the teacher that I was team teaching with things are a little weird it didn't work out so I'm hoping that maybe next year it'll happen I don't know that I would want to teach an entire course all by myself and deal with paperwork and all that stuff but if I could team teach and just come in and teach certain topics and not how to worry about all the other stuff the administrative tasks that come along with teaching I definitely be up for that there's a web development course here in the computer science department that I would love to get in there and you know teach some of the newer techniques for web development but for now I like doing what I'm doing so I don't really have like a burning desire to teach I used to teach high school and it was nice but I'm not I love what I'm doing right now so if it happens and I get to teach that'll be cool because I'd really like to help out the students here and help them to get some good experience on projects but I'm not actively pursuing that if it happens it happens and if in terms of the balance the balance is hard so I don't always feel like I have a balance between work and and learning and my family so it's just something you kind of just strive for every day and if you mess up with it and you get out of balance you try to do better but it's just it's hard especially with kids you can't always plan everything out you know things happen a kid gets sick and you got to stay up all night with them or you know that that throws off your schedule so you just can't it's just hard to have like a set schedule and plan things when you have all those those unknown variables with with the kids that demand attention you can't just tell the kid wait you know and I'll get to it especially when you have babies like they depend on you for everything so you got to be there so I don't think there's one like clear answer to getting that perfect worklife balance you just got to be ready to adapt you know and then realize that sometimes you'll go through periods where you're able to do a lot one way or the other you may not be able to have a perfect balance every day so that you do these certain things you know depends on your situation Michael asked do you think freelance sites like up work are worth worth it to try out I'm not that familiar with up work let me look I haven't had great results with freelance sites okay upwork looks a lot like top towel and I I haven't worked for top towel but the concept looks the same and I actually like the concept so the concept is more like this up work or top towel is the middleman and they try to pair you up with clients and they handle all the contracts paperwork payments all that stuff and you just get to do the work I'm actually a big fan of that setup although like I said I haven't worked for them for any you big company like that so can't say about a personal experience but I like that the sites that I don't like and I don't think are worth it or the sites where I think one sites called freelancer freelancer yet is where you go on there and it just seems like people are doing work for for nothing you know they're trying to outbid each other undercut the prices it did it just doesn't seem worth it unless you have nowhere else to go and you really need to build up your portfolio people just aren't being paid what they should be what they're worth so then anyway that's my opinion on it like I said I don't have a ton of personal experience with all the different kinds of sites that do that that sort of thing so as long as if the sites encouraging developers to undercut each other in price I'd say stay away from it if instead the site is actually helping developers get paid what they should get paid and making it easier for them to find clients then great I'm all for that so just check out check out the site and see if you can get ahold of people or talk to people that that are actually working with that company and see what they think now Luke says the screensaver is back okay I see it now I can see it in my that is kind of cool I never see it because it's always behind me Harris says here's an idea freakout cam should provide productivity tips in videos or vlog format yeah that would actually be pretty cool I'd have to think about it I could probably do something I certainly have complete freedom to post videos on my own YouTube channel I have to probably run it by Quincy if I wanted to do a different style of video but he'd probably be okay with it as long as I came up with topics and the quality was good so you think about that and there probably other people that can do it you have much better quality videos than me and have better you know better topics a better opinion so yeah but that's a good idea I'll keep that in mind yeah let me know what kind of things you you all would like to hear about and I can either work it in the live stream or try to do videos and put it on my youtube channel I'm I'm open to suggestions my screensaver is is keeping everybody's attention now there we go you want me to block try to block it out I guess I can it's still there let's see okay sorry I Harris says oh by teaching I meant these live streams ok sorry that makes so much more sense now I just I never think about this as teaching it's because I it's it's way more collaborative than normal teaching so that makes a lot of sense that sorry I misunderstood so Harris says I meant by a teaching I meant these live streams I had a professor who ended up teaching half the semester through a youtube live that's really cool I would that I would like to do it like that not have to actually go into the classroom and just I think it would be easier because if I'm teaching like I want to I'm teaching code stuff the most important thing is that people can see my screen see what's on it so it would almost be better if I just live stream then all the students could have the code right there on their computers anyway okay yeah so the good actually there is one way there's one key reason why I'm able to do these streams and stream as frequently and as long as I do and that is because I get to stream while I'm at work so that's why I work on the projects that I need to for my job and so in that sense I can't always work on what I really want to but it's fine I think we still do good good projects and because I can do it at work it doesn't cut into my time that I would have with my family so it would be hard for me to be able to spend this much time if it was taking time away my family especially since I'm volunteering you know it'd be hard to explain to my wife that hey can you watch the kids for another like three hours every day so that I could do this and we're not getting any more money so you could see how that would be a hard sell so thankfully my boss sees real value and what I'm doing in terms of several reasons one the University's name gets out there to a lot of places that no one probably was never heard of this University before which is good also I learned so much from you all you can to contribute to project so these projects end up being so much better than they ever would be if it was just me doing it so essentially my boss is giving this time away by letting me work on it for free code camp and in return though the university is is gaining you know some publicity and gaining some expertise from you all so I think it's a it's a very nice kind of tradeoff there so hopefully I can continue to do this and it still is beneficial for for you all for free code camp and for the University and everything can keep working out like this all right Rick asks what is the most effective objectoriented programming language to learn in a short timeframe to land an entry job any suggestions I don't have that much experience with other programming languages but honestly the easiest language for me to learn out of all the other ones that I did that I worked on I don't know let me think about that for a second probably Python yeah Python so just to give some context I have worked with C++ C sharp PHP Java and Python and some of that was just doing basic tutorials but Python did seem to be the easiest for me to pick up so Python right now is really big with machine learning and stuff like that so if you're interested in that field then I would check it out also Python is cool because it's one of the few programming languages that it's really doable to code on a phone because it's more about indentation and less about special characters which usually take several clicks to get to on a phone so I actually learned Python on my iPhone and by learned I mean like learned enough to do really basic stuff I'm not at all an expert on Python world says do all frameworks use Ajax under the hood no I don't they don't all use Ajax and like I don't want to get into obaid over what's the difference between a framework and a library because we've we've had that before but using like the loose definition of those things if you would want to consider react in that general category of framework which I know we've had debates before and it's probably better called a library but anyway someone like that doesn't actually use anything so you're free to use whatever you want so you could use Ajax you could do just basic xhr you could use fetch what's the other one that people always like I can't remember there's some other way to do it no it's totally slipping my mind I always have suggestions from people to use it but anyway it doesn't actually come builtin so I guess the answer would be no not necessarily okay I've gotten to the end of the live chat I was just doublechecking to make sure I didn't miss anything if I did miss something really sorry you can ask it again in tomarrow stream or send me a message on some social media network let's see alright that's it for today I should be back tomorrow I don't think I have anything going on so it should be around the normal time somewhere around 200 p.m. Eastern Time I will be back we're probably going to be working on this this app some more this has been a project that I've had since May and I keep putting it off because it didn't need to be done so finally I just want to get it done so that when I finally get asked if I did this which nobody's asked me about it which is another reason why I haven't done it when I finally get asked if I did it I can just say hey check it out and it'll be done and and everyone will be impressed so it'll be this for a little while until we get it done I don't think it'll take that long hopefully not so anyway I'll see you all tomorrow until then have a great day
