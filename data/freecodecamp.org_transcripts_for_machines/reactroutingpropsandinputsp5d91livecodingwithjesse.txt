hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to try to make the search inputs in the app bar and the side drawer work okay so the idea is a user would type into that input and then hit enter or click on the little search icon and then uh the user would go then be taken to the search page and a search would automatically occur okay so i have a few ideas for how this could work uh we're gonna try them out and we can talk about it if you all have any ideas please feel free to mention it in the live chat for those of you who are new to this show you are watching me work on an actual project for my job i'm a fulltime frontend developer employed by a small university so we're working on the the new main website for the university uh so this is not rehearsed it's not exactly a tutorial it's just me going through what i'm doing but i do my best to explain things and feel free to ask any questions if you need me to explain things in more depth i will make mistakes and that's kind of the point you all can see how many mistakes i make and how i work through the mistakes i break things up by pomodoro sessions so pomodoro session is usually a 25minute period followed by a fiveminute break and so for 25 minutes we'll code and i'll have minimal interaction with the live chat and then for five minutes i'll go back to the chat answer any questions and read all the comments that you have we'll probably go back and forth and do two pomodoro sessions and then at the end of the second session i will go through all the questions in the chat and answer you know any anything that uh that you all have asked to the best of my ability so the stream will probably last somewhere between an hour and hour and a half that's usually the uh the time frame that we have okay i think i got all the intro stuff out of the way i'm doing my best to try to remember to do that for uh for all the new new people so enough looking at my face let me switch over to the code all right here we are um let's start with the ui first so you can see how this this actually looks and i'll start up an ngrok server i'm going to paste the link here into the live chat if you go to this url you will be able to see the site i'm working on and it will update live as i am working on it here alright so that link is is now in the chat and here we are looks like you're clicking on it awesome so let me uh that's the dev site i guess i don't have the loc oh is that it localhost okay all right so we have two search boxes we have this one up top and we have this one and the the side nav so those are what we're going to be working on and then we have a search page that we're going to navigate to so just just so you get an idea of where things are at and these are available from any page on the website so they're always going to have this unless you're on mobile then we get rid of this on the in the app bar but it's always there in that side drawer and let me start my timer because we're going to get into the code now so i have the component for search dot js here and if you are interested in looking at the code there's a link to the github repo in the description so this is quite a large component and could probably use some refactoring but for now we're gonna we're gonna leave it like this and what we we need to do in this component is create some way to trigger the search okay when we navigate to that so we need to make sure that we can get the value from the the input and then use that to search now over here i have the side drawer component so on the right and with this component we've already i've already done a little bit with it okay so just some basic uh stuff i've put in let's see an on click handler and it goes to the handle search function so let's go up to see the handle search function and see what we're doing let's see okay so in handle search all we're doing is saying if a user has actually entered in something into that search box then we're going to do a router.push now this uses the next js builtin router okay so if you want to learn more about that you can go to the documentation for next js it's on github they have a website so if you type in next.js github it'll probably be the first result that comes up and it has a lot more about how their router works but in this case we're giving it a path name and then we are using that search term so whatever the user had typed into that input gets saved in state so we're just accessing that that state for the search input and we're passing that along as a query string so let me show you how this this looks uh when we do this it's going to be hard to see because the you know the app um the address bar is is a little small but we could type in something basic like that and if i hit actually i didn't enable the enter key yet i just have the click working so if i click maybe it's not working let's try that again there we are okay so when i clicked it took me up here and just in case you can't read it i'll read this out so we now have we're on the search page so it's slash search and then question mark search equals the okay so we we have in the url the search term so i figured that will probably be the main way that we can we can grab that data the other idea i had is passing it uh by props but either way it might not be a bad idea to put the search term in the url because if we can get that working it would enable users to then save a um a search term or save a search and then they can come back you know let's say they bookmarked a search and those same results will will be there okay so there's there's definitely some other benefits to doing it this way it may not be the most direct way i think props would be a little bit more direct but uh i think this is something that we probably should do okay let me let me go back then so unless someone has a um a different idea for how to do this i guess we'll move along and basically start working in the search component to do two things one check to see if there's a search term in the url and then if there is initiate a search okay so that's what we want to do here if we run into a dead end there we could potentially attempt to pass a search term by props and maybe that would be a little bit easier i'm not sure about it though so i'm going to make a little bit of space so we can focus on this let me know if the font's too small i could make it a little bigger so right now a search is is triggered on um on a change in the search input so i guess we could hmm okay it looks like the font's too small so let me i'll make that bigger okay i don't think i can go much bigger than that without it being pretty hard to see i just wouldn't be able to see that much code at once but so hopefully this is okay so i'm thinking you know there's a few ways we could do this we could um put the search term into the input um in in this page or we could manually trigger uh a search so what i mean by that is let's say like when the component loads we'll just call fetch search term all right after we've already set the state for the the search string okay so either way um i i think we can get it to work uh michael says why not cash the search on the client side i think that's a great idea and that's definitely a feature we could work on today i'm just i'm worried about doing this though okay all right so let's try first off let's let's take the first step let's just see if we can get the url uh the search term out of the url so i suppose you know we want to do this on on a mount so we'll try component did mount and this is a builtin life cycle method so that means it comes by default with with free with react and this will run when the component mounts so within here um let's try we'll just try to do a console though um actually you know what we could do search term let's just have the uh have it appear right in the the input so we'll have the search term appear in the input i just need to remember what part of the state that goes into where we at okay value is search term okay so instead of console.log we could say uh this state search term equals um and then just to start out let's do like a window location and then i can't remember what to what it is i might have to look this up anybody remember off the top of their head it's window location what to get the um the query string is it query no um yeah let me let me look this up on my other screen okay um all right so i'm just checking out window.location uh on mdn mozilla developer network that's a really good resource and i'm hoping that they show all of the different options for window.location all right all right it returns an object let me just check this here in our um in our console clear this out window location and let's see what we get search there we are search window location search okay so we'll get you see the the value of search here make it a bit bigger um we are going to have to do some some stuff to get this this value out of there so let's not worry about this for now i just want to see if we get something so we can do search okay and let's see if this works oops i'm sorry i definitely should not have done that i'm sure one of you uh probably caught that and are already telling me in the chat so this states are sure um oops this set state and now we're gonna do search term and this is what we're gonna do okay all right that's what we want to do the only thing i'm a little bit worried about here is we are doing serverside rendering so obviously window is not going to work for side rendering so we'll see how that that works out let's see if this even works um i guess so refresh okay i guess it didn't work we can let's be 100 sure by going to our react dev tools and let's see what our state is search term yep search term is still blank okay so for whatever reason uh i suppose component did mount is not working so um let's see all right michael says window location search dot sub string uh one actually let's let's try that in the uh in the console to see if that would that would work no it's still giving us the same yeah it's just taking out the uh question mark which i guess i mean it's a little bit better without the question mark okay oh okay nikki says uh i can't find that response again but get initial props has access to the query param so you can check for one there for the first search making the url url shareable sorry sorry about the yawns for some reason i just yawn so much when i'm streaming okay uh all right let's try that let's try to run get initial props and see if we have uh more luck with that okay it looks like we can access the query param so i think we ought to go to the documentation first to see exactly how we do this so i'm going to go to next js on github and let me make this bigger and i'm going to try to find gets initial props okay there we are so fetching data and component life cycle hmm actually this is good to know i didn't realize you could use these for uh stateless components cool those are props all right here we are so get initial props receives an object with these properties pathname query okay cool we should be able to get the query then awesome nikki said types next in browser the first result is next.js github page sounds about right yeah i'm there often okay all right let's see i don't think they have example of getting the query that would be kind of cool but it shouldn't be too difficult all right this is actually another way to do it we could have made that a link all right it's fine it works the way we do it yeah we do uh use without instead all right let's just see what we get with uh with query here so i guess i can copy and paste this oops this one and then we'll just change it to what we need okay let's get rid of this one uh actually let's keep that for now and then we'll copy and paste what we need into there so right we want the query and let's see let's just do this for now oops guinness would prob should resolve an object but found a defined set hmm i wonder if i have to return it something there we are hmm all right nothing's happening there okay why maybe i can do this props query oops we'll do a console log hmm that's weird for some reason nothing we're doing in component dead mount is is actually working okay check my time okay about five minutes i'll come back to the live chat and uh and answer some questions okay all right let me think actually you know what we can we can see what's uh what's here if we go to react oops let's check out this and we should be able to see it in props okay so props query oh okay so we're getting the older version so in the documentation down here it says if you're using with router you just get these three in which our query then is an object and it didn't give us the info that we needed so all right let me see why it's doing this instead of another one i usually don't like to just read when i'm streaming but i i think this section is definitely going to help us here each type of curse with router instead hmm oh curtain coal says is there two component did not have do i have it twice that might explain why it's not working that's excellent awesome okay so evidently our component did mount we have two of them and that's why it's not working um actually though i think yeah actually let's let's do that let's um yeah let's go back to what we're doing and then we don't even have to worry about why we're getting uh you know one form of the information we should get and get industrial props instead of the the other form that we want okay so what we'll do then is get rid of that and put it down here okay why am i getting this oh because it's the second good job catching that that's uh i didn't even see that uh so you did a curtain call thank you all right okay so let's see now if uh it'll actually change all right cool okay so that that actually did work so it changed this and now it it has what we want but well not exactly what we want right so let me go up some of you put in who did albert okay so albert said uh we could split um split what we've got here okay well i think my timer is yeah my timer is going to go off okay so next step in our next pomodoro session is going to be let's grab the actual term out of here and leave all the rest off and then we'll initiate a search which i actually this shouldn't be too too hard the rest of it uh is pretty i think it's pretty straightforward okay let me set set this timer to five minutes i'm going to scroll all the way to the top of the chat and just work my way down so if you just asked something i may not get to it in this five minute session but i'll get to it after the next pomodoro session all right all right i'm just kind of skimming down and trying to find the questions here uh nikki says uh how are you doing how's the wrist i'm doing way less coding lately need a break uh just watching revlon relevant video daily uh this is this is the one no pressure um yeah my wrist is i mean it's doing okay it's just it still hurts um so the timeline i think is like it'll actually feel worse than it did before the surgery for about six weeks then it'll start to feel better uh but i'm looking at maybe like three months before i should i'm really feeling normal so i'm going to try to strengthen it just maybe like stretch it a little bit because right now it's pretty stiff so i'm just going gonna try to do more and more with it every day and and see how that goes but i mean just typing all day like at the end of the day my wrist is sore just from that so like without putting any weight on it at all it's just gets sore so um it'll just it'll just take time you know i mean which is expectable uh you know after after surgery it's expected yeah it's expected after surgery nikki says add a dot trim to that check and handle search prevents spaces from triggering search oh that's a good idea that's a really good idea um let's see nikki says i posted something on an issue a while ago about making the search your url shareable going to look for it yeah i remember i remember you posted on that issue uh so yeah i remember you posted that and i remember thinking it's a good idea at the time but i wasn't sure if that was something we'd be able to get in before launch and remind me after the next session to give you an update on launch date i just had a pretty long meeting this morning where we talked a lot about what's going to happen on the website so i do have some updates on that curtain closes font size is okay but it's so very bright and clumsy it is bright uh it is bright i'm not sure what a clumsy font means but um i guess i'm open to suggestions for fonts though uh gino asks uh should new junior developers skip ruby on rails python django and php laravel and just focus on angular react view node and express in mongodb it just depends on what you want to work on if if you have the ability to just pick what you want to work on i mean i would go more with the full stack javascript you know type type of stuff like i to me it's like if you can learn one language and do front end and back end like why not you know instead of trying to learn two different languages all right you're gonna have to know javascript no matter what if you're gonna do anything at all with front end so that that would be my my option but you don't always have that luxury sometimes you get a client or you get a job and you have to learn you know what you need to to get the job done so um you know i think it would be fine either way but i would lean more towards uh the full stack javascripts um po pokken puken lung sorry if i'm mispronouncing that but phuket long says actually what is this project it is a the main website for the university that i work for all right albert says isn't this project a little too big for just one developer i don't know maybe it is but i'm the only one working on it well i shouldn't say that you are helping a lot so um yeah but it's just me so at some point in the future it'd be awesome if we could hire some more developers here and i would have a team but right now there's only two developers in my department and we both work on totally separate projects uh so this is what i have right now okay my timer is up i'm gonna jot down where i'm leaving off here in the comments okay all right so let's reset this timer here for 25 minutes after the session's up i'll get to the rest of your your questions and all right where were we oh okay you know what let's we're on the search now what did we want to do i think it was nikki had an idea to do the the trim um actually i'm not going to worry about that right now because then i'm going to lose track i'll just try to remember that if i forget it um and you have time nikki uh please just make it an issue or something uh or i mean if i if you don't have time don't worry about it i'll try to remember uh but i really want to get this working in this next pomodoro session so i'm just going to go straight to it even if it's not ideal okay so we now have the data and we just need to split this string all right so let's see let's see what we can do um let's see actually let's just look up okay so for those of you especially for those who are new and i don't want this i want the mdn especially for those of you who are new sometimes it can seem like there's a lot of stuff to learn you have to remember it but like realistically i've been doing this for at least five years i'm getting paid full time to do this and i can't remember exactly how to use split right so it's not a big deal to have this stuff memorized when all you have to do is type it in the search bar and now you have it so and i kind of like doing this because i usually learn something new about a thing so even though i'm just trying to figure out what's the syntax if i spend a little extra time reading this i find out you know new stuff so anyway what i'm trying to say is just don't get too bad out of shape if you can't automatically remember syntax for how to do things because really it's it's not a big deal okay so we got our separator uh and then our limit so our separator in this case is going to be that equal sign so we need our string dot split and then the equal sign and that will give us an array and we should need the second value in the array which in this case would be 1 because the array started zero okay so let's go back and and try this out uh where do we do this oops it's in our um component did mount here we are so instead of just this set state and we're adding window location search it's going to be window location search dot split um and then it's going to be one and oops no no equals sorry equals and i don't know if we can do this all at once but i'm a little bit curious so i'm going to say oops this should be parentheses uh equals and it probably should put this area okay equals and i'm gonna try to do this i don't think i don't know if it'll work but if it does that'll be kind of cool and it'll let us keep this all in one line uh so let's save that and we should see the result now yay it worked okay cool so if if you're not sure what i just did there so from this this value is giving us that whole search thing with the question mark and the equal sign and then once we split it now it returns an array right that has two items in the array the zeroth item and the first item right so now we say we just want the first item so what gets returned out of here is a string that's that search term that we're looking for okay so this is actually going to work perfectly unless for some reason we have more than one uh parameter there in the query string in which case we would have to modify this i can't really foresee a reason why we would have more than one on the search page so i think this should be safe for now but just just for you all if you're trying to do something like this if you think you may have more than one thing you're you're definitely not going to be able to do it like this just like this you have to modify it a bit okay so now that we have this and we've put it into state uh what we can do so we've set the state and then we can trigger let me be i want to double check this function and make sure this will work we can trigger fetch search term okay we don't have to pass anything yeah so let's do that and let's say this dot fetch search term okay let's see if that works hmm all right that's interesting okay so let's see what this oops i want to see what the uh this ended up being oh interesting okay uh maybe that's pulling from somewhere else let's double check so we're setting the state to that value uh which part i say we're setting search term to equal that but maybe it's pulling from somewhere else this fetch search term so say base search string this state search term okay it is supposed to be grabbing the search term and then also the search type is supposed to be on the end of that um so we shouldn't have anything so by default there's not going to be any parameters at the end this is weird to the search term yeah this this should be okay it this state search term hmm all right i'm gonna console.log within here um let's see if that'll work it's giving me a an error there but also all right let's see all right all right let me go back let's double check in our react um dev tools let's see what we have a search search term is the okay all right that's interesting all right i'm gonna i want to see what what gets triggered on this search here on change this get search results maybe we should do that instead yeah let's do git search results i think i was skipping a few functions and trying to go straight to that one uh so not sure if this will solve the problem but this is probably the way we want to go anyway so let's do that all right you know what i'm going to move these up because i'm used to these being up at the top i just feel more comfortable if they are okay i like having the default like life's um life cycle methods there at the top okay so instead of fetch search term it's going to be get search results okay cannot read property oh there we go can i probably target him undefined stop value i'm at 50 oh 96. why am i using there okay um okay so the search term is getting set to value um but there is no value all right so maybe then what we want to do is uh debounced search okay let's do that then tbalance okay hey there we are it worked this time cool okay let's verify that again make sure it worked okay great now let's try it let's try it again straight from this this search oops awesome so we've actually added two um kind of layers of functionality not only will that work uh from that search input but also now any uh url you know we can type whatever we want in and it'll automatically do a search so this will enable you know being able to bookmark search results uh which is awesome now the only thing we need to change is right now if i were to do a search straight from this page then you see this stays the same right so we need to update it so a search from the search page actually updates this as well and we can do that with the the next router so that will be the next steps for then and then also we're going to have to hook up this one instead of just a side drawer but that shouldn't be too hard it's just going to be a copy and paste into this app bar component so let's see how much time we have how much we can get done okay a little over 10 minutes let me check the the real time 2048 okay actually you know what i'm going to since we got this working and the rest of it is just going to be a matter of kind of copying what we've already done i'm going to end now even though it's a little bit early and go to the questions that way i have a little bit more time for questions i do have to make it over somewhere else here on campus to um do some paperwork and the person i need to meet i believe is leaving in about an hour so i want to make sure i can get over there in enough time so i should probably double check i'm gonna double check the email and do one to four oh actually no i think i have more time than that yeah i do have more time all right let's try to get something done then sorry about that uh so i think they're gonna be here for another two hours so so we do have time so let's um all right well let's add this in over here as well uh so so that this also will work uh also it'd be cool to add uh at make it so that we could hit enter so that's actually the only new functionality that i think will will be added with this so let's let's do that and i'm not sure if i've ever done that before with react i don't think i have all right so this would be cool i'll learn um i'll learn something new here okay hmm oh so i'm not going to do it on here it'll be over here in the drawer component alright so the handle search needs to be triggered when we hit enter all right so i'm just going to look this up if anybody knows how to do it put it in in the chat please otherwise let's look this up and let's say detect okay awesome so stack overflow to the rescue this is exactly what we need we need to call an event after pressing whoops enter key i don't know what i just did okay according to react docs there we are all right let's just read the react docs instead keyboard events all right awesome so there's an on key press and then we can do the character code nice all right so on yeah on key press so let's add that into where it's we'll put it here on our input on key press and let's see let's see if there's an example here key press okay interesting okay so we're gonna add okay all right this works so this handle search change let's see all right curtain call is saying key press which 13 actually is there a way i could do it right there hmm all right i'm not sure michael's sitting in a switch yeah nobody i know the answer value uh is 13 but i was just wondering if there was some like shorthand way that i could do that uh like here right or if i actually had to modify this uh handle search um oops it shouldn't have been handle search change it should it search change no it should be handle search there we are okay all right nikki saying doesn't an input inside a form automatically submit on enter or does react prevent that um yeah i don't well i don't know if we even want to submit in this case you know oh okay justin has some some code here all right this looks really cool let me do that all right where am i at okay let me see if this works and then if it does i'll go in and explain what's happening oops unexpected character that's weird okay so that did not work okay here's another one all right so that didn't work so i'm not going to go over it since it didn't work but um it would have been cool it looked cool all right i guess we could just um just do it like like we saw in the example on stack overflow right it would be cool to do it differently but this will definitely work okay why am i still having this this is weird why is it still giving me an error actually this is really weird i think let me try this again i think something may have gotten copied somebody getting copied weird let me try this one more time all right shake this out so okay andrew's not doing anything what okay so that's i mean we're not getting an error or anything but nothing's happening when i hit enter your key i wonder if we're getting uh the right let's try key code and um we'll go with 13. try this i never tried to just use the name of the key before so i mean maybe it works it but let's just try it like this and see if that is the the issue nope not the issue oh well um justin i think that was an awesome awesome idea not 100 sure why it's not working curtain call says try e key which try enter lower case instead of enter uppercase that's what albert says e key console log okay we could uh a console log it yeah that makes sense uh so let's do that for now let's just get rid of that and do um e key okay so what this should do is just tell us what key is being pressed in the console all right that should work right enter should definitely be working there okay so go so this should definitely work if e and so now we're doing uh a tern area right so shouldn't you do on key press e without the braces curtain call says shouldn't you do on key press e without the braces no we need the braces in react because otherwise it won't interpret that as javascript um okay so if e key equals enter um if it does equal enter then let's call this dot handle search otherwise we're going to say no okay okay so what is happening let's all right let's just try try to figure out where the problem is happening okay so we're just going to console.log the word search it should console.log when the enter key is pressed right oops there we go okay awesome the so okay cool all right so we just had um the we know that this is working so the issue let's check this out handle search if this state search is not equal router push past n okay um so we need to do oh you know what i wonder if it's a this issue so um that's that's gonna be my guess it's it's at this issue within here so um nikki just said the same thing it's this issue isn't it yeah i think so so let's see how we can all right let me see what okay so justin's saying try it like that okay i'm gonna try that first because that's gonna be the easiest thing if this works then this would be very easy all right awesome that was it that was it so with so normally um in in react you can you can just do this right you can say this dot handle search right and you don't need and in fact you don't want to actually you know put the parentheses here you'd normally do to invoke a function right but in this case since it's not exactly the same right we're actually entering into uh the inside of another function right uh we need to invoke that so awesome uh great job justin uh just for coming up with this in the first place and then also for figuring out what the problem was so i really appreciate that and that took a little bit longer but this is honestly this looks really clean i like it and we didn't have to modify handle search and clutter it up there with uh with some if statements so actually i really like this right so we we avoid even having to call that function right uh so we do our check here otherwise we would have been actually calling this other function and then doing the check so i i don't know the difference in performance is probably so so small it's insignificant but i like how it looks uh and it was kind of cool uh cool to learn you know how to do that so anyway that's all i'm going to do for today because our my timer ran out a while ago i was just so into it i wanted to keep going until we got it so we pretty much got almost everything that i wanted well we definitely achieved what i wanted to achieve we added some extra things i'd like to do there and we didn't get to all of those but uh pretty close so i think it's definitely a good a good stream in terms of getting things accomplished status and we're going to com i'm going to commit this so you all can have the code available to you on github immediately so let's add this new feature and let's say enable side drawer search input and then we'll decide your search yeah that that works uh this does affect an open issue so let's put yes and let me see let's figure out what issue i love it when i type g and and github actually is higher than gmail in my uh suggested sites that's pretty awesome all right so i'm gonna go check out the issues here i know i have an issue about this i guess would just be under implement search maybe i don't have a separate issue okay i don't think i made a separate issue about it i do have a separate um kind of card in my trello board for it but it's the same issue so that's issue number 74. so we're just going to say re for regarding number 74. okay and when we add that in uh then there's going to be a little um spot and i guess i could show you how this looks right now because i think i've done it before so you can see here the reference oh yeah did i say regarding i mean reference i don't know why i thought it was regarding okay anyway so this issue is now referenced in this commit it's referenced in this commit and this commit and this commit so at least kind of a nice uh log of you know hey this is getting worked on and here's what we've done to work on it okay so you don't want to have to manually come here and and give an update but this lets everybody know that you know this issue isn't dead right it's it's being actively worked on and here's what's been done all right so that went through it passed all the tests and now i can do a get push and this will go straight up to github and you all can check it out uh feel free to fork this repo and make any contributions that you want submit a pull request i'm definitely open to that and i'll help you out if you have any trouble with it all right cool so let's check this we won't get an auto refresh on on github at least i don't think you will but here we are there's there's our our commit so enable side drawer search all right cool so i'm going to scroll back up to where i left off in the chat so if you have any questions or anything or comments put it in there uh and when it comes to the comments i i totally enjoy compliments and nice things but if you have something critical to say feel free to say it i want to make these streams as good as they possibly can be so that they're helpful to you all so if you think that there's something i'm doing wrong or something that i i could do that i'm not doing please you know let me know i can't always do everything you know that you say but i definitely want to hear what what you think so don't be afraid to uh to put critical comments in there some occasionally people put you know comments that are pretty pretty rude um and i'm totally cool with that it doesn't bother me um especially because 99.9 of you are super positive and nice about it uh that definitely outweighs uh everything else and if i ever get to the point where 99 of them are all negative then i'll know that maybe it's time to stop because this is not useful for you all okay scifaldine says hi hey how's it going welcome to the stream uh alex alexandro says hello afternoon i'm brazilian hey how's it going thanks for watching uh anand uh wants to know where the first video in the series is or the playlist uh there's a play playlist on so if you click on playlists on free code camp go to um the project number five playlist for live coding with jesse i think it it might be called react project five or something but if you go to that playlist that should have all the videos in order there's quite a few videos this is number 91 just in this playlist and with project five so um you know i definitely recommend if you're gonna watch maybe try to watch it on twotime speed and you know maybe skip around videos just to focus on what you're interested in if you have the time to watch them all that's that's awesome but if you don't have the time then that's probably the best way to go about it okay and it says hey hey anna how's it going i feel like i haven't talked to you in a really long time i guess it has been because i i didn't stream for a while after my surgery and stuff so um yeah let me know how how's how's it going what's new with you i'm really glad you get to catch the stream today a curtain call at one point said it's bad to code when you get got so very tired yeah that is it's for sure um so this is just a little tip uh from curtain call and from me in case you haven't been there yet um sometimes it seems like a good idea to stay up really late in code but i've found that i definitely make more mistakes after a certain point like i stay up late and i could i do good for a while but after a certain point it's just not worth it right because you mess things up so uh it'd be a good idea to like find out where that point is for you and then stop uh whenever i when i first moved into the house that i live in right now uh it needed a lot of work it was the house was like completely trashed so we got a good deal on it but we had to work so i used to have a rule that if if i messed up twice in a row i had i'm done for the night so that means like if i measured wrong twice if i cut if i had to cut something twice in a row because you know i was like building walls and stuff says cutting two by fours and drywall and stuff like that so i would say okay if i had to recut something twice i'm done because at that point i would just be wasting materials and wasting my time so i kind of have a similar thing with my code right if i start really messing up like consistently then i'm done because at that point there's not it's just not efficient anymore like i would get more benefit if i slept for a little bit and then woke up and started to code again so i mean sometimes it's an emergency like server's down or something you really got to do it but if you can that's a good point to go to sleep so anyway hopefully that rule will help somebody at some point uh lakshan says which js framework is best for mobile app development i i would recommend react so react native okay i i think react native is good uh i've messed with um like doing ionic before uh it's pretty good but but honestly uh i've been super impressed with react native with how easy it is to get things going with the quality of the apps uh i i really i like react native so that's my my recommendation i've heard you view either already has something to do native apps with you or they're going to come out with it so i don't know what uh how far along they are with that or if it's possible yet but i mean that's another option but obviously i've never used it so i can't really comment on you know the the pros and cons of it oh nikki said uh also flutter nikki sorry the flutter is pretty awesome has anybody used flutter so if you're not sure what flutter is it's um it's like a framework or uh some type of system to build native uh apps so um i didn't do they i don't know if they just announced it at the google i o conference or it was already out and they just talked about it but that was the first time i heard about it but i haven't used it yet and i haven't really i haven't watched any videos on it or anything like that but i would like to know how it is so if anybody has used flutter uh to build an app or anything like that let me know in the chat please or in the comments down below uh if you're watching the recording of this because i'm i'm definitely interested in it i mean i'm still like i like react native but i'm always open to learning you know new things exxon says i think i have to learn a lot to learn react framework well i mean you don't have to know that much to just get started with it but to really do more advanced thing it things it does take a little while for bigger apps like state management becomes a big issue so there are some things about react that take a lot of time to learn but you know just to get up and started with something basic it shouldn't take too much work it does depend on how familiar you are you are already with javascript though uh but you know don't don't be intimidated by it it i was really intimidated by it at first but it ended up being a lot easier than i thought it would be especially react native react native was so much easier than i thought for some reason i was just super intimidated by it but it ended up being not only easier than i thought but way more fun than i imagined uh not bad actually like my my wrist hurts uh but the doctor said that's normal it should hurt um he actually i was able to give him like a normal handshake with my right hand which is the one that i had surgery on and he was pretty impressed that i was able to shake his hand like like i did so i guess that means i'm doing well so i just need to relax and take it take it slow other than that i feel pretty good i i haven't really been able to do like my normal exercise routine so that's got me thrown off a bit and um from all that time off that i had it like not working out my sleep schedule is so thrown off so like so hard for me to go to sleep which is probably why i'm yawning because i'm running off of less sleep than i normally get because i just have trouble falling asleep but uh anyway and thanks for asking i'm not going to go on anymore because i don't know how many people actually care about uh my sleeping habits right now but uh i i appreciate you asking that all right nikki says do you have a thick elastic band those are great for wrist exercises oh i'm sure i have one somewhere i have to see i think right now i don't want to actually add any weight or resistance because my wrist like hurts enough just with without anything like i don't see like me just doing this right now hurts like and if i try to actually like spin it in a circle like that that hurts so i don't really don't need to add any weight and it says my branch is waiting for merge ah awesome awesome i'm gonna check that out after um after the stream's over so hopefully i'll have time to get it merged in today i'm super excited about that thank you so much for uh for contributing uh curtin calls this question do you manually normalize search input query somehow or it's react router's duty um i imagine things are happening on re so i'm not doing anything to normalize it so i'm kind of trusting that uh the router and so i'm not using react router i'm using the next router so although i love react router since next js has a router built in when i use next i do that if i use create react app i use react router if i use rack native i use react router or actually it's called react native router but same same but just for for react native michael says his first day of school uh for for the kid freshman high school i love him but he's been getting on my last nerve now the teachers can have him back yeah my uh my kids are gonna go to school soon too i have mixed feelings about it so like i'm not home with them all day so i i don't know like i'm gonna miss them but at the same time like usually i'm at work during that time so it's not gonna be that different for me the only difference is like i'm gonna have to be more strict about getting getting them to bed on time and i'll probably have to wake up earlier so i can get him ready help get him ready for school and and driving to school so um yeah i actually my youngest son ambrose is he just turned four and he's gonna go to fouryearold preschool so he hasn't been to school before uh and he was really excited but then he told me a few days ago that he was nervous about it uh so i hope he does all right i'm worried about him uh i don't want him to be sad for uh for preschool so we'll see how that goes uh ocean at some point said late again what did i miss uh i'm not sure how far along we are when you came in so i guess i'm not sure you could definitely check out the recording though but i can't remember what point we were when when you asked that uh curtin call asks it looks like you're using headless wordpress as a json backend any optimizations done or it's good out of the box uh so yeah for the search we're just using the rest api i added a plugin to get multiple post types so normally with the rest api you can only get one post type at a time since we're trying to search for everything at once we are using that plugin otherwise there's no optimizations now for some of the other sections on the website i'm using graphql so we have a graphql plugin that lets you use graphql with wordpress so but in terms of just what we worked on today it's just rest api with one additional plugin and i don't know how familiar you all are with wordpress but the rest api used to be an additional plugin and it was kind of like in a testing phase it's now merged into wordpress core so that means it comes by default with wordpress and it's turned on by default and it's stable so it's safe to use in production okay i'm skipping over some of the questions because they here because they had to do with debugging what was happening there so they're not really relevant anymore uh nikki says oh cool a loading indicator when did that get added uh monday all right michael already answered that yeah we did that on monday okay nikki mentioned the dot trim again all right i'm glad you mentioned that again because i would be likely to forget mmhmm uh gia says hi just tuned in please tell me you're going to take a look on login uh with the routing so admin slash user i'm i'm not exactly sure what you're asking there so geo if you could explain that a little bit more what you mean by that i'd definitely be happy to answer it but i'm i'm not sure uh right now how to answer that all right phoenix says hey i had a oneonone call with quincy today uh such an amazing guy he is uh it was great talking to him oh that's awesome um yeah quincy is really cool um so i've i've talked to him a few times like mostly through email and things and also by a video call and yeah really nice and uh really good guy so i'm actually going to get a chance to meet him and a lot of the other free code camp people in person um next week so like next weekend i will be in in new york for like a free code camp meetup type of thing so i'm really excited for that so i know i mentioned this i think on monday but i'll mention it again because i'm sure there's different people watching with just a different time slot that i i streamed in next week i will be in salt lake city utah for a while and then i'll also be in new york city i'll be staying in in brooklyn uh so if anybody is is anywhere near salt lake city utah or new york city uh and would like to hang out please let me know um i that would be kind of cool so i just i don't know send me a dm on some social media or whatever and be happy to like i don't know go get a coffee or or whatever you know um so let's see i lost my place sorry let's see all right cool uh kingsley says great job um it curtails this drum roll uh no um let's see tech trick said good job uh thank you those all came right at the time when we finally got it to work so thank you i appreciate that i mean it's i mean it was kind of like a matter of time before we narrowed down what the problem was uh and really it was uh justin who who came up with the final uh final solution there um curtain call says what's the name of the plugin for uh committing from console uh the one referencing repository fixes and so on uh it's called commitizen okay michael already answered that yeah so check out commedicine uh it's it's really cool um harshit who frequently watches this the stream and has done a lot of contributing harshit found that and set that up for this project so when i want to give credit uh where that's due it wasn't i didn't find out about it he did but i'm glad he did uh uh mammy says sorry if i'm mispronouncing that let me know how i should pronounce it but miami says thanks uh this really helped me a lot you're a great teacher i just can't see it but i listen okay yeah i'm really sorry about the the font if it's hard to see i really i can't really go any bigger because we wouldn't be able to see enough code on the screen for it to make sense um but uh i'm i'm really glad that it that it helped you out though um if e4 i don't know how to pronounce that uh but says what's the name of your uh night github theme extension uh github dark i think it's just called github dark umberto says i tend to think more clearly when i'm exhausted yeah i mean sometimes the there is some things about being a little bit tired that can't help you but uh at some point tired is just not good for work at least that's been my experience uh pukin lung says it's so interesting uh this live hope to see more often oh awesome i'm glad you liked it yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna try to do this um as as many times a week as i as i can and uh i'm i'm gonna get a new computer for my home office soon that should make it so that i can stream better with better quality from home so hopefully that'll that'll mean i get to stream more often oh cool uh so nikki uh added a pr that had trim awesome thank you nikki he says pretty sure it's the smallest pr ever it might be let's see michael says i i think i did once that fixed a one word typo and a readme that's okay it does it still counts as a full request keytron says the word headless triggers me i mean a person completely wrecked my life with their raspberry pi headless server uh let's see monir uh says hi hey how's it going thanks for watching uh adrian says hi how are you pretty good pretty good how are you doing nikki says haven't written any code for a while and don't plan to either but that that hit felt good good uh curtin cole says just return to wordpress after many years and it's getting better now includes json rest api it looks okay yeah and actually there's going to be a new um like wordpress editing experience is called gutenberg i believe it's built with react and it uses the rest api so i haven't tried it yet but it's gonna go live with the next release of wordpress so um you can you can choose to go back to the old experience if you new download is going to be live so be ready for that if you have wordpress or if you're if you're away from wordpress and just want to check out check it out then i don't know exactly when the new release is coming but that's whenever it does come it's gutenberg will be will be there uh curtin cole says i enjoy the teamwork yeah that's awesome all right michael so speaking of which uh where's where's harship been uh nietzsche's he's on vacation yeah he's on vacation right now he stopped in just like really briefly on monday and said hi and said he was on vacation uh hihi haha says will you make a discord server do we have a discord server yet or not i don't think we do we had a lot of other things uh but not a discord server actually let me know if you all think it would be cool to have a discord server for for this stream let me know i could maybe think about starting one i know we already have several other places things that we've started up and like none of them has ever i think really taken off you they usually die out um but i don't know i have several other uh discord servers that i'm checking regularly so for me it might not be a bad thing since i already am on discord frequently so anyway just let me know um barakah says which date and time is the meet up in new york um whatever let me see i don't remember what the date is it's like the 19th i'm gonna bring my calendar up on my other screen so i can tell you what the date is uh okay so i'm flying into new york on the 18th and then the meetup is that night so uh the the meetup is like invite only um but i will be there on the 18th and the 19th and then i will fly back on the 20th so um i will be around not that long but i'll be around for a little bit and then i'll be in salt lake city i'll get there on the 15th and i will leave um like around midnight on the on the 17th uh he says what languages do you know um i'm assuming that's programming languages uh so javascript um some php uh i've done some stuff but i wouldn't say that i know python java c plus plus c um i think that's it oh solidity yeah so those are those are the programming languages that i've i've done things with of course i'm not counting html or css as programming languages and i'm not interested in arguing whether they are or not but i mean i think it kind of goes without saying if you're front end dev you know html css uh justin says i'm giving a lunch and learn at work on progressive web apps in two weeks do you have any advice for me um i don't know honestly i think it would be cool uh if you're gonna give a talk on progressive web apps i think it might be really cool to have a demo app available just so that people can can download it on their phone and then have them put their phone on airplane mode and then use it that's kind of cool just to demonstrate that you can use stuff offline uh because that that like generally is like that's the most impressive thing about progressive web apps uh for most people so i think that would be kind of a fun like handson thing uh and it could be something like right at the beginning you put the url up there and then they can just choose to go to it or not and you know let them know throw an airplane mode and so um i don't know that would be kind of cool so they wouldn't just be sitting there listening uh they'd also see it you know uh firsthand so i don't know that would be my my uh advice for that uh he haha says can you combine xml and java with uh intellige i'm not sure how to pronounce that uh to make an app i have i have no idea um if anybody else has any experience with that please let us know but i i i have no idea if you could okay all right justin says i would not have thought of that good idea thank you oh yeah no problem uh if you if you can it'd be awesome if you could let me know how it goes so after you give the talk if you you know come back to one of the the live streams in the chat i'd i'd love to hear how it goes and if you end up like publishing any slides or anything or a video of your your presentation i'd love to see it he says you should make live stream tutorials teaching us to code um i don't know i have to think about that i actually i'm i keep seeing emails popping up uh while i've been streaming um and i'm on currently on an email chain with some people at the university discussing the possibility of me actually becoming a professor and teaching uh some web development courses so i might be like legit teaching so we'll see how that goes if that actually happens i could definitely see it being really beneficial to do a lot of video tutorials for for you all and for my students uh so that way um yeah it'd be difficult if i just go into classroom demo demonstrate something and leave it at that right it it's it's so much better if they would have the ability to rewatch things right um so i'll probably end up doing that so i don't know when that will happen uh but based on like the tiny preview messages that i've been seeing going back and forth it seems like it's a possibility oh cool i had a few congratulations for that oh thank you it hasn't happened yet but it would be cool if it does happen i would be an adjunct professor which i don't know how adjunct professors work in other countries but in the united states they're usually not paid very much so it wouldn't be like i'd make a bunch of money off it but it would kind of be like a fun thing to do and i think it would be helpful it'd be helpful for me because i would really have to kind of learn even more to be able to teach it and i think it would be really helpful for the students as well uh to get some like practical you know kind of cutting edge experience with what the latest and web development is okay let me see what time it is all right well this stream is going on almost two hours now and i've gotten through everything in the live chat if i skipped over your question it was definitely not intentional uh so you know you can ask me in the comments uh or dm me or something and i'd be happy to ask or you know wait for the next stream uh let's see i'll be back in the office tomorrow so i should be able to stream and thank you all so much for all your help today i definitely couldn't have gotten this far without you all i was you know super helpful and um yes i think that's it for me today uh so i'll see see you all tomorrow hopefully and until then have a great day
