hey everybody it's jesse welcome to live coding with jesse and uh happy new years and here's my some of my kids wanted to say hi so here's cordelia who um got a blue dye all over her face it's cupcake cupcake and this is i have moved ambrose eye on me yep you have a blue guy on you all right from cupcakes yeah so hey everybody i know uh a bunch you've been waiting in the chat for a long time uh so thanks for waiting so long let me know how the stream is uh analytics look okay so um i'm guessing the stream's okay i'm gonna get the chat up somewhere where i can see it easily let's move it over to this screen okay cool all right this looks good all right so i haven't streamed in a while it's good to be back um i see there's a lot of you in the stream i'm gonna do my best to uh try to respond to what you're saying uh but i'm not going to try to follow along with the stream in real time what i'll do is i'll set a timer a pomodoro timer of 25 minutes every 25 minutes i'll take a break and i'll make sure i'll take a thorough look at the stream and try to answer everybody and then during the 25 minutes we'll mostly do coding i'm going to be a little bit laid back here so if you're watching this recording i definitely recommend putting it on you know like double speed because it's new years and got a bunch of time to code it's still about three hours until uh the new year here in the eastern time zone uh so i got a while so i'm not gonna try to rush and um i see a lot of you are saying happy new year uh see if you you say like the kids are cute so uh thank you and um awesome so for for a lot of you it's already 20 20. that's cool yeah here in the uh in the eastern time zone in the united states uh it is still 2019. uh we're we're behind here so um yeah so you would you see on the screen uh is not the project that we're going to work on i just want to make sure all my stuff was up to date beforehand so i just did an update and this was the last thing i had to open which was the react native async storage package that i had done some work on which i did live stream a little bit of that with those recordings are available either on free code camp or on my channel i can't remember but a link to my channel and my social media stuff is in the in the description of the video um so feel free to reach out to me if anybody has any questions about what uh what i'm doing today let's see i'm gonna try to get try to get a window up here so we can see what we're working on here cordelia did you steal a protein bar yeah so all right you two wanna you wanna play down here you don't have to sit here and watch the code you can play do you wanna go play what you wanna watch the code all right that's cool watch the code all right you're being good so good job okay um let's see come here who else you want to say hi my wife's down here trying to get the kids upstairs come and say hi my wife codes too she's uh she's a um react developer and she works for an agency called sprockets come on and say hi she's on on pretty famous on twitter she's a lot more followers than me wave hi they can see all right cool so let's get a project up here uh now we got i'm planning on live coding until uh 2020 comes so that's about three hours for me so we definitely can work on a few different things if we want uh i was thinking of working on a project for the free code camp curriculum all right bye cordelia bye see you later ambrose byebye can you shut the door please ambrose all right good boy thank you bye bye is the kids it's the kids bedtime so they actually should have been asleep already but they wanted to uh stay up and be on the on the live stream so all right so anyway what was i saying okay there's a project for free code camp that i've done some live streams on before now basically we want to add uh in the free code camp curriculum on freecodecamp.org we'd like to add in some react native lessons that you can do right in the browser uh but there's it's a little bit tricky to get uh react native code to run in the browser now you you gotta do some basically you gotta change some stuff with it to get it to run so that was the the goal was to basically make an inbrowser editor for react native code that would display the results of your code immediately so anyway so we found just to bring you up to speed we found a library that kind of does that already and we're trying to modify it and get it to work within free code camp so we could try to work on that there's a few other projects that we kind of had going in the past um with different live streams so we had like a react native math game for kids uh that we were working on that we never really finished um so there's a variety of things that we could do we'll see how it goes uh so i believe i do have the project already pulled down on this machine though for the um react native like in browser editor so let's just try that for now let's see where i'm at here uh i'm going to go let's make sure you can see this yeah all right um let me know if the phone's too small and let me check yeah wow all right there's a ton of stuff in the chat so i know i'm going to miss some stuff i apologize in advance there's just like too many messages to keep up with let's see yeah just a lot of happy new year stuff all right cool uh let me oops i like this window let me find this project so we have async storage all right new browser editor oh we also have another react native app that my wife's been working on that we could work on as well so i guess we we do have a lot of stuff we could work on um she's working on an app to help women who are having a postpartum uh like depression uh to to help them so we're gonna need a popup menu all right react native browser editor yeah that's the one all right oops cd react browser editor there we go all right so we're in here let's go code it to dot to open it up in its own vs code window we'll close this window out so i am using visual studio code as my code editor uh this is what i normally use so um if you don't know me i am a um a senior software engineer at dick's sporting goods and i work i work with react and react native every day i'm gonna open up a can i have an energy drink here to keep me awake during this coding session so for my earlier live streams i used to drink gfuel and try to get a sponsorship all the time but it's been two years gfuel and i've gotten no sponsorship so now what is this one rain rain if you're out there could sponsor me for coding live streams okay project that his life says can't you code without energy drink oh yeah i definitely can but um it's past my bedtime so i figured this would help it would also help me to be a little bit more lively uh for for the live stream all right so let's check this out and see what we have going on here i believe what we have here is just a create react app project and yep that's it so we have a create react app project and the goal was this was a proof of concept we're going to try to take that library that i talked about and pull it in to this project and get it to work in this project so let's uh let's just start things out with a um with a start so actually you know what let's do yarn just to make sure we have all the packages which we do and now let's do yarn start see if a project runs all right and we have an error okay so let's work through our error here and i forgot to start my um i forgot to start my timer okay all right i get a timer since i forgot to start it i'm not going to go the full 25 minutes um before i stop the timer and go back to the to the chat here so let's see all right check this check out our error here um plugin preset files are not allowed to export objects only functions all right then uh let's see where our issue is all right it's not in here all right so let's see i remember now the last time we worked on this on a live stream we had a ton of errors because we tried to upgrade a bunch of packages and um it just wasn't it wasn't working out for us uh i believe the library that we're pulling code from hasn't been updated in quite a while uh so i think that's where we kind of left it last time was that we worked through a bunch of errors but we still didn't get it to work which that really worries me right i don't like to use um libraries that haven't been updated in a while and in fact let's let's uh let's check out the library now see if there's a newer version that we can pull it might solve some of the issues for us um and uh even if it doesn't at least you all can see what the uh what the library is let's see pull this in let's go to github and i'm not signed into github oops what i guess i don't have to be signed in i could just search um oops i meant to do that search in github i'm going to sign in this is the users i think this is the dude that did it that's it yep this is it okay cool um last commit on june 17th 2009 okay um it's been a while it's been a while not like the most out of date thing i've ever seen you can see what this is here uh let me make this a bit bigger just to like get a visual of what we're attempting to do here so you have code over here and then it displays here so you can see like it's like real time editing so that's what we want but this does not look like what happens on uh free code camp in terms of like the free code camp ui so we want to be able to modify it uh to work in that way uh so essentially like basically like package this so it could be inserted into something else like another project another um you know like basically turn it into a package that could be pulled in right so that's the goal let's see what the latest release number is alpha see like it's not like all right so this would have been the very latest gh52 f8 which i don't know that we had the very latest thing in our project or not ours might have been a little earlier than that let's do it again vlog there we go friday august 16th okay so if the initial commit from this was august 16th i think we're good i think we have whatever the latest stuff is we have the latest stuff okay all right hey michael uh curls here how's it going michael um michael uh watched when when i used to live stream way more regularly he always watched the stream so good to have you here um michael you are correct i did have a web player directory which i believe i just pulled down like everything that was there i think it might not be a bad idea to just check that directory out and see if it basically like see if we can get it working if we can get it working locally and go from there since at this point essentially like we took a big risk in the last stream with this where we upgraded a bunch of packages at once we knew it was a risk took it anyway and getting ourselves to a point where like we've worked through a ton of errors and we are still getting errors right um might not be a bad idea to just go back and start from a working point and then be a little bit more incremental about things so let's do that um react native web player okay there we go um all right cool so here's our react native web player which i've probably forked this repo and then cloned it let's see the log the git log get long and yep june 17th which i believe was the date of the last the last version that we had here so we should be up to date and so let's run this let me check the package json to see what the what this is to run start so we can do is this using yarn all right this project is using yarn so let's run yarn make sure we're getting all the stuff okay lots of stuff going on here hey happy new year everybody a lot of new people joining the stream welcome all right cool um warning you right now web player yes all right so we got a warning warnings are okay errors are not okay but warning we might still work so let's do yarn start let's see if we can get this to run also my timer is about to run out that i set um to kind of give me give us a little break so while this thing tries to start up uh locos 8080 let's let's click the link here sweet it's working it doesn't look does it look yeah let's make sure it works nice okay so we have a working place to start from i think the goal next would be to kind of take a look around see what we can get away with um in terms of like just packaging this thing what i want to do is be able to keep the functionality of being able to type here and have stuff appear here without necessarily keeping the ui elements right i want to strip away some of this so that we can instead do it more of like the free code camp style like keep their their ui and all that right um let me know if that makes sense or not all right i'm gonna set a little five minute timer i'm gonna go to the live chat and um there's a ton of stuff in the chat so usually i go to the top and work my way down but this time i think i'm going to do it differently and just start at the bottom and work my way up with the chat because there's there's just so many messages um but i'm going to try to go through some messages and just answer some questions here feel free to ask any questions if you have them let's see all right it's a lot of happy new year stuff so i'm just gonna give a big happy new year to everybody um let's see i just realized that if i start from the bottom will work my way up i can't follow the threat of conversation so that was a bad idea so i'm gonna go i'm gonna scroll up a bit and go go back down let's see michael says wow the kids are getting big plus a beard yes i have a beard the last stream i i think i did not have a beard so it's been a while been growing out the beard and the kids are getting big it's insane they just keep growing uh skinny slim says whoa coding family yeah coding family well i mean me and my wife code um the kids are still a little young for it try to get him into a little a little bit but we'll see maybe they'll get into it too one day uh joey says it's been a long time since i've been able to catch one of these live streams well i'm glad glad you can catch this one uh good to have you here man well there are people from all over a lot of people in the stream are like shouting out where they're from and that's just awesome we have people from all over the world all right also uh let me know if there's any weirdness going on with like the background noise or anything like that i tried to turn off everything i could so that nothing would make noise here i turned off my fish tank pump my heater and my house like everything is off so hopefully it was a better experience the last stream i know there was some background noise from my uh my furnace um ravish asked a question i know ravish isn't here anymore i think i saw somewhere that uh they had to leave but says what is uh free code camp going to do java for beginners uh object oriented programming design and coding um i don't know if there's any plans to do like a curriculum on freecodecamp.org but we frequently have video tutorials so there may already be a video tutorial of some java stuff and if there's not a video tutorial if anybody out there would like to create one um you know let um beaucorns or quincy know probably easiest way to get a hold of them is maybe like through twitter uh let them know and you may be able to get the the tutorial on free code cam mr potato hq says my name is jesse awesome great name let's see um let's see someone asked what programming language is that it's javascript uh and in particular uh we're working with react um xgn snowball says i want a penetration test where should i start uh for penetration testing that's not really my specialty i know there are some uh free lessons out there what is it like oh oh wasp is that what the i'm gonna let me think about that maybe and get back to you if i can remember but um the uh uh secure like information security team where i work uh they did a cool like capture the flag thing and had some good resources uh it was a couple of months ago so i can't remember exactly what it was but if i can remember it i'll i'll let you know in the stream um there's some free resources where you can learn more about penetration testing okay all right one more comment and then we'll get back to the code eduardo says thank you for everything you taught us this year i wish you all success in life i really appreciate all your time and effort i've learned a lot you are blessed thank you thank you so much um that's really awesome thanks for saying that thanks for watching um that's cool i'm glad i'm glad you uh appreciate it all right cool i'm gonna scroll back down here actually what i should do is make a note of where i left off yes pen i was afraid my kids stole all the pens um they did not they might have stolen on my paper all right i'm just gonna mark down where i left off at in the chat so i can get back to it easily next time all right cool okay so back to the code right now we have this running locally which lets us type in react native code and see our results in the browser behind the scenes this is using something called react native web which converts react native code into something that a browser can handle and it's using it basically in a like a service worker which is a file that can run um in the browser and do stuff i guess kind of like off the main thread of the browser so let's check out where that's happening because that's kind of where where all the magic happens with this yeah this is it that's where all the magic happens so that's where we want to look so i believe it's this nope not that um very uh babble worker so this is what is doing the transformation i believe yep that's it so things that normally happen in node on a user's machine on like on a computer we're now trying to get to work in a browser in this file right so it it needs to work a little differently than it normally works but this is what's what's doing the uh the work here so we need to at the very least we need to keep this intact and and let it do its thing okay a lot of the other stuff check out our babbo rc right it's it's not super complicated in terms of what babble stuff we have in here uh i'm just checking out a few of these other files just to make sure we're not missing anything in terms of like core and functionality okay all right so let's find let's kind of like go down into this here and see um we're importing this sandbox component so in components player sandbox all right interesting okay all right so it looks like there's a lot going on here as well that will probably need to keep okay console proxy there we go okay there's where we're actually pulling in uh react native web okay all right now the workspace itself this is a lot of the um like the the ui and this for the most part i believe can um can be changed okay so if we could keep basically the console part is what i'm the editor sorry the editor part is what i'm worried about most comments hmm okay all right it looks like simon says there is a lot of background noise let me see oh you know what that might be it might be the bubbler thing in my fish tank let me turn that off and see if that helps thanks for letting me know okay that to me at least it sounded a lot better when i turned the bubbler off i uh i didn't even realize that thing was that loud uh that was kind of a newer addition to the fish tank so cool hopefully that's better all right tell you what i'm i'm a little bit i'm a little bit torn on this one um like i'm just uh the reason i'm torn like i'm not sure that this is gonna be a great project at least right now to live stream because there's a lot going on it seems like there's going to be a lot of work where i'm just going to be reading through this code trying to figure out what everything is doing which won't make for a great live stream you all let me know i mean normally i just i would go through it it's fine but we do have multiple projects that we could switch to that would be um a lot easier i guess to uh to actually like get some code written um like we haven't actually written any code yet right uh so anyway i'll give you all like um uh like a minute or so i know there's some delay in the stream so i'll give you all a minute or so put in a live stream should we try to like stick with it and just like try to tear this code apart and figure it out or maybe i'll do some of the work like on my own and then come back to a later live stream whenever it's time to actually do some coding and then we'll just switch to some other stuff let me know uh i guess so let me check really quick too while you're deciding and see what i have already installed all right so we have so you do have the app so i have um my wife's app already available that we could work on um i could definitely pull down a copy of the uh the game that i was working on yeah we got some options all right uh i got some responses let me go through these responses see what you all think um uh connor's asking what is this code output uh the the main output is um it's it's outputting uh like html based on the input of react native code it it transfiles that and outputs it into html that can be displayed in the browser um let's see i said earlier that i'm torn what i meant was i um um i was conflicted like i just i really wanted to get this to work for the sake of free code camp but now that i'm going through more of the code i just see that maybe it's not going to be the the best thing to live stream it just won't be um i don't know it's there won't be anything to see happening on the screen you know what i'm saying so i just don't think it would be that great for a live stream uh so okay do something graphically interesting make a website do some beginner stuff uh do javascript okay so like come back to this project later um samuel says might be unrelated or my suggestion is make a music visualizer that you're happy with actually that's really cool i don't think i'll do that because i just i have no idea where i would start with that that's going to take some research on my part but that's a really cool idea because i would love to have a good music visualizer that would work with i use spotify all the time it would be great to have one that that's awesome that works with spotify um levi says can we get a mini flexbox in grid tutorial i can definitely do flexbox i'm not great with grid but react native uses flexbox so i i am uh pretty familiar with flexbox um carrie says we have nothing to do so we're just hanging out with with you watching cool um levi says do the game connor says is it hard or is it just not beneficial to peace through the code um yeah i just think it would be um i mean i just i kind of think it would be kind of boring to try to piece through the code at this point uh michael says go back to the math game there seem to be some beginners okay and that's a good intermediate project all right cool let's do tyler asks can we work some vanilla javascript um the projects i have right now aren't vanilla javascript but like within react we'll be doing some stuff that would work as vanilla javascript as well what page i have that this is a project uh connor says i understand that can you do can you show the web page slash app that this is the project like uh like what is the code like your website for gaming or what i'm a software developer myself so the the website for this particular so this is the website for that code right you like you put react native code in here and it pops up here and um i wanted to take this and convert it so that we could put it into the free code camp website and have it work and look like it should for a free code camp lesson so that's kind of what i was what i was trying to do uh okay all right cool let's um let's grab oops let's grab that project so i'm not signed in so i'm just gonna have to search for myself am i jay weigle or my jr weigle i think i'm jry though let's see no oops all of get up my jesse i don't know my github name is there we go just you know all right cool so battle math is the um is the game that we're working on battle math here let me put the link in the um in the chat so i just posted the link to the github repo in the chat so you can check it out if you want and um it's been a while since i've been in this project so hopefully i think i have https alright let me type in my github password real quick i'm gonna find out what it is all right so i have lastpass and it i have this really long password right which what they recommend and then you have to go in it's like two factor off so bear with me for one second i had intended to get all this set up and working before the stream but then uh my kids wanted me to cuddle with them before bedtime so i i did that instead um all right but this should be working now github sign in what i have two factors on github all right i guess it's good to have twofactor authentication all right now i can clone this with my ssh key there we go all right so let's go back here and i'm in my projects directory which is what i want to do so i'm going to do a git clone and paste in what i just copied from github cool so now i should have battle math yep uh so now i could cd into battle math and open up vs code let's close this out and let's close where's the other one at whoops i want to try to keep the as many windows closed as i can just so that i don't uh make the stream lag by having too much stuff going on at once let's get our terminal open here and we're gonna do yep i have yarn going on this project i like to use yarn um but if you want to use npm instead like it's they're basically equivalent at this point all right cool so that's installed let's do yarn start let's double check that that's in fact the right command where we have package json yep yarn start so this project is using react native web so we're writing react native code but we're running it in the browser there we go and here is the game the math game so uh quick overview of this math game if i get it right so three plus one equals four uh we need to first things first let's get this looking better because you can barely even see that right we need to change the the text color on that thing if i submit that right then these enemies here on the right hand side go away if i get it wrong the enemies more enemies come here's my little hero character over here so you can see there is a ton of ui work that needs done we also have subscribe subtraction multiplication division all right so we have several modes here um so let's let's get the ui cleaned up a little bit levi says this game could use some css that is a true statement all right uh so yeah let's let's at least get the font color in here and the font size uh to match what we have here that'll be much easier to read so let's go to our code uh so it shouldn't be too complicated at this point so everything's still in one yeah it's all basically in one component at this point so we have our app.js as you can see we are using hooks so react if you're not familiar with hooks uh you'll you'll get a little bit more familiar with it now um so we can use we use functional components and hooks in react if you're not familiar at all with react it's a javascript library that helps you to build apps so this if you don't know anything at all about react it's gonna be a bit confusing um all right we we definitely got a lot to do here so you see how we have this svg in here now uh this is would not work on mobile so we definitely want to we want to do something about this right but we want to find that that input so i'm just going to do control fine let me make the text the font size a bit bigger i just want to make sure everybody can see let's give this enough space as possible so um type in input there we go so answer input here so we do have a style for styles input let's go to that and where's that as we have our styles down here now in react native you can do your style one way to do styles is using this stylesheet.create that comes built in with react native and your styles end up being a javascript object so a lot of the naming will be familiar to those of you who use css but you're going to have everything camel cased instead of hyphenated so just slightly different also all of our values are unitless so you don't see any like pixels or anything in there so slightly different and where everything is by default display flex and it's flex direction column by default it's a little bit different than normal all right where was that input at okay so the input height with border column origin left let's see if we can just give the input a color and um let's just give it white so if we do fff hashtag fff um that should give us the right color and then our font size we're gonna try to match it with our our math text so let's give it a font size of 40. all right let's save that oh you have legacy linter options in your vs code settings they're no longer being used okay let's just i guess remove the settings alright now let's check out our app where are we at there it is cool look at that nice so we now have uh our answer text in our input is the same size as the rest of the the text and the same color wonderful okay uh cool my timer is about to run out so i'll take another five minute break and go back to the chat let's see and but the next thing that we'll work on is i want to show you how to um make a file that will run conditionally basically we're going to pull this svg out into its own file and we're going to make sure that one version of it runs on mobile and one version of it runs on web okay so that'll be the next thing we do all right cool take a short break let me scroll back up to where i left off which was a while ago and actually i i did miss so um unfortunately what happens in my chat is um if there's too many chat messages it cuts them off so i can't go back so i can't get all the way back to where i left off apologies if i miss your message okay but um i'll try to get as much as i can um sima says jesse first time i'm wishing you a happy new year 2020 dude pure love from india thank you so much i really appreciate that um skinny slim says what advice do you have for someone that's just learning to code and this one question wasn't just for me this was for everybody out there so feel free to add your advice into the chat um i would say try to code a little bit every day all right even if it's only a half hour every day just try to do a little bit every day and just just keep at it right if you can do more than a little bit that's awesome but just try to keep to a little bit every day uh stephanie asks what time is it in america uh on the east coast in um in america in the united states it is 9 56 pm all right i'm trying to there's still a lot of happy new year messages so happy new year trying to skip through and find um find out some questions here um akshay kumar says i love free code camp lots of free stuff they provide love you guys uh we love you too thanks for the message that's awesome yeah and it's not like i um i just do a little bit i do the live coding stuff there's a ton of other people that do a lot of work uh with free code camp so actually um they just came out with the top 100 contributors list uh so if you check out like the free code camp blog i believe it's on there if you check the free code camp twitter it's probably one of the tweets that come out within the last couple of days but uh you could see a ton of the people who are um or have been recognized for their contributions so check that out um hey gwen faraday is joining the stream not sure if you're still here but um she says good to see you streaming again it is definitely good to be streaming again i'm super happy about it and gwen's actually streaming a lot now too so check out her stream it's a faraday academy um so check her out on twitter and um she always posts when she's gonna do streams and stuff so um she is a free code camp contributor as well she's the one who initially even gave me the idea of attempting that project we were working on at first because she's done a ton of work for react native curriculum so i really hope that we can actually get that working and out there to you soon um not found asked why are you programming today um i'm assuming you're asking because like it's it's a holiday right uh well to be honest the reason i decided to uh to do this today um i just remembered maybe like four or five years ago um quincy who's the founder of free code camp did a live stream on new year's eve and uh i remember all the kids were already asleep my wife is asleep i was uh on my exercise bike uh in my basement and i i turned on the free code camp live stream i was watching it while i was exercising and i remember just being like thinking how cool it was that quincy had done this and made free code camp and how much it helped me out and um that was the first exposure i had to a live stream about coding and then a couple years later when i actually started live coding and then um ended up live coding for free code camp i i thought back to that and i thought how crazy is it that i'm live coding for free code cam um when the first live stream about coding i saw was the free code camp live stream so i thought wouldn't it be cool to do another live stream on free code camp um so anyway that was my that was my thought process behind it i also figured like hey my my wife wanted to go to sleep early she didn't want she doesn't like to stay up late my kids are gonna all be asleep you know i may as well do this uh so anyway uh that's why i decided to to uh to code and live stream today uh just so you all know none of this code that i'm doing today is for my job so i'm not like uh my employer is not mandating that i work on new year's eve this is all just fun side project stuff uh so uh anyway so that's what i decided to do today thought it would be cool so i didn't get to through too much of the live chat on that one uh but i'll go back to it anyway let me set my pomodoro timer again i may end up taking like uh the ending of the stream because it there's a lot of messages in the chat so i may do like um i don't know maybe like the last hour of the stream i'll just stop get through all the messages i can and then if i get through everything then maybe i'll do some more code but just so i don't leave you all hanging um when you've like when you're asking questions and stuff all right cool so next thing we're going to work on is this svg right so i'm going to copy and paste this svg uh so an svg is i believe it's a scalable vector graphic is what it stands for um it's an image that actually like you can represent as code in your project which means you can do some really cool stuff with it right so each one of these paths and stuff this this these all represent different things in your image uh so you could control all these values like fill would be like the color right and even more than that all these mean something right uh in the image so you could use css and javascript to control these values and change them based on what the user does to do some really really cool animations and things on your page so i know um uh what's her name sarah drazner uh she's pretty active on twitter uh she does a lot of cool stuff with svg animation so if you're interested in that kind of thing try to find her on on on twitter i think her handle on twitter is sarah edo but um anyway i've seen some cool stuff done with it so it's definitely i prefer using svgs when i can and instead of having to actually load an image file like it's just code right here so so much faster but anyway we're going to take this which i've i've copied and we're going to make some files here so right now everything is in source i don't really like that let's make a folder for components make a little bit more clean components make sure i spelled that right and i made a file not a folder so let's delete that and let's go back and make a folder components and then for now i'm just going to put the svgs right in there usually in a project if it starts to get big and i have a ton of components and svgs and all that i'll split it out and have like separate folders for everything but for now we're still small so i think we're fine no sense in like over organizing things ahead of time especially because vs code will pretty much switch all the imports for you it's really easy to switch to like reorganize stuff later on so in our components folder i'm going to make two files one is going to be called um let's see what we should call this let me see what this is a hero let's call it hero dot um oop i thought i was using typescript for a second hero.js i actually do want to switch this to typescript i've been using typescript at work a lot and now i'm used to it and i really like it when we did this project i wasn't using it yet so let's make another file and let's name this hero.native.js okay and we're going to go to let's see if i could find it um svg to react i found this cool uh react component converter and i use it at work a lot this is it yep this saves me a bunch of time because i use a lot of svg's uh and my projects at work like for icons and stuff so basically what you do is you just take your svg code you paste it and then what you get is a valid react functional component so that's pretty sweet so you get that here oops let me copy that and let's go back to our code this would be our regular hero.js now it just gives you svg component uh you know what i wanted to do and i didn't do let's name this uh hero svg i actually want to name this svg so that we know it's an svg and not a real component so let me rename this i don't know what i was thinking hero svgs let's rename this too okay usually uh react components are capitalized so for a native one we can go back to our converter i can find it let's go back to our converter and we can just check react native and um we can see it gives us basically the same thing but it says uh it's react native svg okay so we're going to use react native svg with this and we'll probably have to import it because i don't think we have it right now but this will let us oops did i not copy it yeah there we go we can name it the same thing and i don't think we have react native svg let's check our package json yeah we definitely don't have it we we only have a few things it's so nice when you have a new project and your package json is this this long um all right let's pull that in and uh let's go yarn add react native svg alright cool so now let's go back to our app.js component right and let's get rid of this giant svg stuff and instead we can put in hero svg as our component right and we're just going to give it a little ending slash there uh did we get it auto import yep so um my vs code is set up to automatically put in this import for us okay so basically it just said import here svg from and this is going to be components here svg now what will happen is if we're on the web meaning in a web browser it's going to pull from this file if we were to load this on a mobile device as an as an app it would pull this from this native file okay so an app like a a react native app on a for a phone cannot use a normal svg it'll throw an error so that's why we needed to do that so the way i usually deal with that is i always have two different files for my svgs that's not the only way to handle it that's just how i do it it's it's pretty simple there are definitely other ways to do it uh there may be better ways than this but this is just how i've come to handle that now let's let's give this a save here and make sure it's still working uh let's see yep there we go here's our svg and it still works now unfortunately i don't think i have this to the point where it would work let's see you think yeah it's been a while since i've used this project so i don't think it'll work right now because of the um the versions that i'm running basically the version of react native that i'm using is too old for some of the code that we're using particularly i believe some of the stuff with hooks so this will not run on a phone right now until i update the packages uh so i don't think i'm gonna update the packages right now and let's check our package json yeah yeah yeah this is definitely an older version should this is gonna show me it should show me what the latest one is latest yeah latest version react native for web is up to 0.12 i'm 1.10 so definitely not not where i need to be yeah i don't know if i want to go through the process of updating right now on the stream also i will say this if i were building this project from scratch right now i would probably use expo um because expo now has react native web support it did not have what it was like very very early on in the development of react nato web support when we started this project so we didn't go with it so i would probably do this a little bit differently if i started it now yeah but for now we're just worried about the web version on later streams we will we will probably get to um making it run on a phone all right just for all you that are typing over there i got about 13 minutes before i'm gonna go back and answer some more questions so hang in there i will get back and answer some questions and um let's see all right let's see what we work on next so also if you see anything that's like wow you should definitely uh change that i let me know i'll i'll take suggestions on what to work on next i know there's a lot to do uh we need actually let me refresh this and see okay so that is working um i was just checking to make sure that this automatically um went to this input so if a kid's playing this game like it works you could hit enter okay so it automatically enters good oh but you know what when you enter it doesn't go back to the input all right so uh here's what we're gonna work on next right now if i were to put in uh a number and hit enter i'd have to manually go back in and click before i could put in another number again so i don't think that's a great user experience especially for a kid if they're not used to using the mouse and keyboard yet you want to make it as easy as possible so i want to make it so that when you hit submit when you hit enter it submits and then it focuses back on this again uh levi says the corners look way too sharp on the images um some of the comic sans for life yeah we put comic sans on there all right maybe make the corners a little bit softer that does make sense the corners are way too hard like we're rolling with comic sans up there at the top and then we get these uh zero pixel border radiuses that just doesn't go that's a good uh a good observation uh so we'll um we're going to do two things next uh we're going to make this um auto focus after you submit an answer and then we're also going to soften these edges a bit and make it make a little nicer and match a little bit more with our font choice we could probably roll with comic sans so just like throughout i know we did it here but it's a kids game right we can we could call mcstands everything it's about the only situation that comic sans is going to be uh allowable let me get rid of this i'm gonna leave this thing up for now in case we uh throw some more svgs in there and let's get rid of i'm gonna get rid of these and all right so we're still we basically we have everything still in one in one file right so we separated out that svg but pretty much everything else is still here in our app.js file which is fine now it's still it's a very small app so on let's see what happens we should have on our um touch for opacity here we go on our text input submit editing it handles the uh submit right and we see our ref here is submit input ref we're gonna need that okay so let's find out where we do handle submit so we've handle submit up here and we're going to say use callback all right we're dispatching oh okay i see what we're using here um interesting it looks like we are trying to focus that why is the focus not working then all right i guess first let's make sure that this is actually um firing so i'm going to put brackets around this so we can do more than one thing in here i'm going to use a good old console log and we're just going gonna say happy new year in the console if that if that runs and uh now let's go let's run our inspector we'll go here and make this way bigger okay goodness i don't need it like that there we go all right so all right that ran so we know that ran then why is the focus not working let's see hmm all right let me think about this i could say let's see if we have a all right so we have a use effect already we could do all right if we already have this on a use effect this is really weird um my next step was going to be like all right let's do use effect and just put a submit input ref uh current focus on that too right that should that should work um it obviously didn't work now what we can do and this is going to be a little bit overkill right let's so when you do a use effect and you put this uh empty so use effect function the first thing that you pass in is like what you actually want to happen all right and then the second thing you put in is an array of um basically things that it would look for for changes to run again right so if you pass in an empty array it works just like component did mount meaning it just runs once when the component mounts if you take this away it runs every time the component updates it so we could do this and have it run every time the component updates this is probably not what we want i'll show you hopefully it'll actually do what i think it will and we'll be able to see this um so what would happen is well let's just see actually maybe that is what we want maybe that'll do it maybe that'll work hmm i can't believe that'll work cool all right that is that is actually what we want okay uh so here's what we're gonna do so yeah we're gonna keep that in there and we can pull it out of here right because this will this will run you can have as many use effects as you want really um this use effect is basically going to be our component did mount and this one is going to be our component did update the equivalent if we were using the uh it just slipped my mind basically the the old school way of doing the react components uh which is a class component so i can't believe i has lost my train of thought for a second so if you're doing a class component this would be the equivalent of component did update all right that's that's cool let's get that console log out of there we can also get this out of there i'm not going to remove these for now and actually i i prefer writing it like this to be honest with you uh which is the same thing so saying um saying i actually we can we can definitely get rid of this you know i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this in though actually this might be why they solve this i ran into an issue with another project before where the focus wouldn't work unless you did it twice it was really weird and the way i solved it there was to set a timeout um and run it again and like basically set a variable for whether or not something was focused and then check that variable and uh then say like all right if it's not focused then let's do this timeout run focus again so but basically you had to run focus twice to get it to work so i'm gonna leave this in here because if if that is the case and it's still that issue then we may need both of them in here i don't know why it's like that but for whatever reason when i'm using react native web on the web i need to focus twice um i don't think i need to on uh like an actual mobile app but whatever anyway um to do like if submit current submit input ref.current and then this right to use an if statement this is the same it achieves the same thing i think it looks a little bit cleaner you just put these double ands i believe it's it's like a short circuit they call it a short circuit there but this basically does the same thing it just says like uh if this is true then we're also going to do this if it's false it just stops which is the same thing we're doing here and it takes less basically you remove the if and the parens and then you just add in these two ends so slightly less typing all right but that's cool so we got that done next thing we're going to do is work on our border radiuses to soften those up a bit so that was levi's idea and i think that was a good idea i think it if we're talking about a kids game i think a softer border radius kind of matches more of the like aesthetic that is used in most kids apps all right let's see my timer's up let's take another break let's go back to the chat let's talk for a little bit oh it seems like there's still some noise uh since you can should consider enabling noise suppression in windows mic settings because there's still a small but noticeable noise okay i don't know i've never heard of noise suppression in the settings so i will check that out not right now but like for next stream unless the noise is like really terrible also i know i've been saying this for a while but like i'm going to get a uh soundproof office at some point built right now i'm just in my basement and uh i'm getting into soundproof office i've actually already like paid for uh a construction company uh to do some work i just haven't like set up when that's gonna happen yet um so i paid ahead of time and i kind of like got a deal on it was like this charity thing or whatever anyway it doesn't matter basically the thing is like i have put money towards getting an office a soundproof office built so that live streams would be better so it will happen at some point this year and um then it should be better the noise issue should be uh better at that point also maybe i'll i'll get a better mic at some point as well this is just a very cheap mic i think i got it for like 20 bucks on amazon craig says hi jesse happy new year i was told there would be punch and pie ah sorry no punch i have i have rain energy drink and i have a giant bottle of water um there is actually a chocolate pie upstairs though my wife bought one earlier so if you can make it to uh ohio then uh you can have some pie and energy drinks uh connor says okay cool react native similar to flutter with the app updating with the code do you work for free code camp so i don't work for free code camp this is just volunteer um so i would say like almost everyone that does something for free code camp as a volunteer uh there are just a few people who are employed at free code camp so if you're interested in helping out we're always looking for volunteers if you have more time than you have or you have more money than you have time then you can always donate as well um it's a nonprofit i think it you can get all the tax stuff worked out as well uh because it's officially a nonprofit um but yeah i um i just do this uh just kind of as a side thing just for free uh young do it says jesse is great you're doing a great job thank you i appreciate that uh quran says how to hack nasa with html i do not know how to do that if anybody knows how to do that i'm that's that's pretty crazy and you have a unique and special skill craig says 50 of coders i know let me remember my github password yeah i actually have no idea what my github password is it's some really long random string and i just have it saved in lastpass so uh if if i ever forget my last pass password then i would have a problem uh stormzy asked do you know preact i do not know preact i don't um preact is a lightweight version of react so i kind of always assumed that preact was close enough to react that if you know react you could do preact but now that i think about it i don't actually know i just assume that i've never seen any preact code so i could be mistaken let's see uh levi says i have no clue if i even have a get account or not i definitely recommend getting a github account uh if you're if you want to get into coding um it's a great way well one like you don't really need an account to look at stuff on github but it's nice to have an account because then you could you could save projects that you like but it's great for your future employers to see your code that way if you apply for a job you can put your a link to your github repos in there and they can see what you've done so they can say they're like at my job i interview people um coders for software engineering roles and if they don't have a github profile it's hard for me to know whether or not i should bring them in for for an actual interview like if i just see the resume i like it better if i can see their code first right it doesn't mean that i would never hire somebody who didn't have a github it just means that it's easier for me to make a decision if i can see their code so i definitely recommend doing it even if you're totally new you know just whatever you're working on put it up there i'd rather see that somebody is uh doing tutorials and putting the code up there then doing nothing right or at least seemingly doing nothing right your github repository can be like the proof that you're doing something to employers anybody can go into an interview and say oh yeah i'm coding every day but if you can say i'm coding every day and i can look at your github profile and see the code that you wrote and ask you about it and say oh that looks really cool you know that means a lot more so definitely recommend that uh it's free you don't have to pay anything for it it's um i think every every coder should have one just for the um like for the little edge it might give you in finding a job all right cool let's go back to the code see what time it is i'm going to do like one more pomodoro session of code and then see where we're at in the live chat and then i might do like a long break and answer lots of questions because i'm definitely getting behind with the questions here which is great i love there's so many people watching the stream there's a ton of questions which i love unfortunately when there's this many people and questions i don't always have time to answer them so i'm going to do my best to answer all of them or at least as many as i can before i finish up so i plan on going until midnight my time which is in about an hour and a half if there are some questions i didn't get to i don't mind going into a little bit after midnight but like it's already past my bedtime so i may not give great answers the longer after midnight it goes so it might be pretty tired all right let's get to it so our hero so we have our styles that we're going to change here i believe is our our character so right now our heroes and our enemies are basically just views which think of a view in terms of react native code or a div in html okay so when you see view think div uh so let's go to our character our character style so down here at the bottom we have our styles object which is very similar to css right now we just have squares we give them a width and a height but it'd be cool to give them a border radius and 40 40 here let's see what an 8 pixel border radius is this is going to be that's a pretty large radius but i think it would fit with with the comic sans let's see what that looks like if you're not sure what border radius is it's this part here right so before we had hard corners hard edges like we have here okay and now we have these rounded edges right so it's definitely a little bit softer a little softer there to be honest we we could go with complete circles let me know what you all think in there should we have should these be squares or should we have circles i never thought about doing circles before but now that i see even with this radius i think we'll do circles i'll let y'all answer and then while you're doing that i'm going to soften these borders as well so on this this select box on this text input and on the submit button we're going to soften those borders up okay we're gonna give those some border radiuses too okay it looks like we got some we got some votes for circles we gotta vote for square we'll see where we go i'll give you another minute or so and then we'll add up the votes here for circles and squares and see what we're going to go with there's more code oops all right um i should say too i'm on a pc now i do probably like 95 of my uh coding on a mac but the pc kind of throws me off a little bit but i just couldn't i needed a computer that was like good enough to do streaming and uh just to get a mac that was good enough for streaming was just so much more expensive than a pc so this is the way i route i went uh all right where's our okay our picker i believe is that select box so let's do border radius uh do i wanna do let's let's try to give it eight we'll try to do eight all around and our input border radius 8 and then our button border radius eight okay so we got that and let's see what this looks like and then i will check out the votes all right not bad not bad that looks i think that does look more like uh kid friendly although this this drop down still has uh that's gonna be a little bit more tricky i think to get a nice radius on there we might have to have to dig a little bit deeper into the code here and find out what we're going to do with that one all right so let's let's check it out we have uh circle circle okay levi's saying do a box shadow we can definitely add some box shadows um master siegel says it's okay you have starcraft installed how did you see i have i do have starcraft installed um circles georgia circles let's see who else says circles phil says aliens do aliens uh nikki for real says circles joey says jesse since you're used to a mac you might be more comfortable in linux than windows you know what i've thought of that before um i've thought about getting a linux system for a while i just kind of haven't haven't done it yet um what time is it it is 10 40 p.m eastern standard time abd gaming is voted for square a lot so i don't know abd gaming it i mean it seems like you're getting out voted here i know you typed in square a lot but it looks like most of the other people want circles so um okay joey says you could do radius zero on the bottom and left right corners of this drop down so it blends in more or like this select yeah that would definitely bend in more it might not look great though yeah we'll have to see i'm not really thrilled with how this looks in general so we may want to do even more with that circle we'll go with the majority then all right cool yeah it looks like most people want uh circles so let's see what circles look like oops i keep clicking the wrong thing to get to the back of the code all right so here's what we're gonna do where's our character so what we we could do here i don't want to get fancy i was going to do something a little bit fancier but oops if we do border radius 20 this should give us a circle so basically whatever your width and height is of your square if you just take half of that on the border radius it'll give you a circle now what you can do is like basically make these variables and then just make this whatever that variable is divided by two uh remember because this is javascript right this is a javascript object so you can do math here and actually like the newer versions of css lets you do variables and stuff too so i guess you could do with css as well but this is easy enough that we'll just put 20 in all right all right here's our circles wow okay this is kind of interesting our hero the svg goes outside the circle but i kind of think that's like a cool effect though like it's a mistake but it it looks almost like it's not a mistake i don't know does that make sense to you like it kind of looks cool um now i will say this we shouldn't worry too much about squares or circles here because my intention is like to actually get little characters here um so i did have somebody at a conference tell me that they had like a bunch of characters made that i could use for this game for free so i need to look that up uh i saved the link to it and i just haven't worked on this project since then so uh we may be replacing these with actual like uh little bad guy characters and heroes i'd like to have like the user be able to select what hero they want and have a bunch of different options and then depending on what you pick like whether what game mode you pick in the difficulty level you may have different uh enemies so i think that would be kind of cool to do but right now like this is what we have but i think it i mean it already looks better i don't know it looks good but it looks better oh i forgot we uh we wanted to change this like basically everything to use comic sans let's see how that looks let's do that all right let's see we'll go back here and uh where are we at comic sans math text it's gonna be comic says actually what i've done what we could do for now this will work but if we had a bigger app i'll tell you what i've done before is i've basically taken the text component and i've made a my own text component and given it the styles like the default styles i want including a default font and then when i go to import text i don't import it from react native instead i import my own text component which just uses the react native component kind of behind the scenes but it takes the bass react native component adds the default styles i want to it and then i i bring it out like that so that's probably something that like if this app gets a lot bigger if i keep working on it and maybe it would switch to that but for now there's just not that much so i don't think it's it makes sense to uh to do that right now because they're still pretty small uh but and like for the input and stuff like that it wouldn't make a difference anyway same way with the uh uh does the button have text i think i do use the text component for the button so um but for the input and then what about that picker did i miss that yeah here's the picker i'm hoping i can put that on the picker react native is a little bit um more like restrictive on what like css properties you can put on different elements so it will definitely like let you know and throw a warning or even an error sometimes if you try to put the wrong property on something like if you try to do i think if you try to do font related stuff on a view component it doesn't like that i can't remember exactly which ones work and don't work but it's not as you know like in normal html like css it's very forgiving right you can do a lot of stuff and you'll never get a warning or anything the browser will just basically ignore it right react native is is more picky like that it has to be for what it's doing though in terms of like what what phones can handle all right let's see what this does it should have changed us oh yeah look at that nice very nice comic sans make sure yep that is comic sans we probably could um set something on the input to say like hey we only want numbers in the input and as long as we're in a mode where we just have you know like single digit arithmetic we could say like hey we only ever want two digits in here that might be nice to have i could see it being frustrating if a child accidentally held a key down put a bunch of numbers in there and then you can't even see how many numbers you have really and you got to try to backspace them all so that might be a good a good thing to put in for now if we add modes later on where you're doing more complicated math then we could always relax the restrictions on it but um i'm gonna go about about nine more minutes and then i'm gonna take a break and answer a bunch of questions so hang in there if you have any uh any questions out there right now oops let's see this hey i think we got one of those errors i was just talking about that's awesome or a warning so invalid props style so family has been supplied to picker okay and that's we we can't do that so we're not allowed to do that so it obviously worked in the browser right so like the browser works um because of the way so react native web in the background is changing this react native picker into an html select and you can do that on an html select you can't do that on a picker so this is something that would work in the browser but would not work in on a phone so what we can do is let's check out our code and see what is this picker okay so what we need to do then is um is move this and put it on a picker item i believe and that should change it so let's do this the formatting just got messed up but let's say we're going to call this picker pick your text so i think it'll work here now the problem is going to be we still have like we we need the actual text on the uh on the picker which i think should work because i think it should work because we're always gonna there's no like default text on the picker that's different than the items so i believe addition shows up so this should work so let's take off let's take this out and instead let's add it in here pick it as picker text let's see if we can get rid of that warning and then this will be like slightly less of a headache for us down the road when we want to get this to work on on mobile see and we've gotten rid of the warning uh oh but it didn't work i messed something up all right let's see what we messed up so we should have pick a text font family common sense did i put that on there correctly oops style start pickers hmm where did i get this picker from it is from all right time to research let's go to react native documentation and see what the heck we could do about this uh i am going to check the chat out real quick to see if anybody knows what my issue is all right so picker comes with react native let's see if it has something built in to help us style this okay test id enabled mode item style there we go we need to use item style all right this should work all right so what we should be able to do i hope is say item style and then give it styles.picker text and then get rid of that which that's nice that gets rid of a lot of repetitive stuff there let's see if that did anything nope not yet alright so we need all right font family is included there interesting textiles picker style type hmm michael cruz says check the element in devtools that's a good uh good idea let's see if the if anything's being added there uh i'm gonna have to make this a bit smaller so i can see what's happening all right so we have the select so owner select uh it's probably getting covered up no it's there okay so it's just giving us the default system ui and then same thing here okay um let's just see if we can get an example uh to see if my implementation is wrong so let's do uh what it was called item style there we go so we got a an issue where it's not working but what this should give us is an example oh item textile did i miss that was that an option huh can i do item text style instead this is from 2018. hmm i'm going to try item textile just in case because uh if it works it'll be the like the easiest solution to this even though it wasn't in the docks nah it didn't work yeah and that's not it's not uh recognized okay um style so they're using item style and they're trying to do font family but it almost seems like hmm i wonder i wonder if it doesn't want me to use all right let's try this i'm gonna try one more thing on here before we just go back to our original idea um so let's grab this again and we can put in inline styles as an object here and see if maybe that works maybe like there is something wrong with the way it i mean i just i find it hard to believe that it wouldn't work with reacts implementation of the style sheet but maybe uh yeah see it's not it's not working um so all right so my timer went off i'm gonna go back and answer some questions now uh for this though at least for now i think i'm gonna go back to i'm gonna get rid of this for now and i'm gonna add since we already have basically two styles listed i'm gonna show you how to use two styles so if we just put a um these square brackets to make an array and we pass in an array to the style and we can say styles dot picker text as well it should take both styles and and combine them and uh that should work we'll get that warning again but see we have we have the font we want now at least in a web browser uh so this works like that we get this warning though now if we get to the point where we want to run this on a phone and we still can't find a good solution what we could do is just um render basically render this uh conditionally so uh what i would probably end up doing is just saying here in the styles like um if this is web then add the font family stuff or i could say it here or i could say it up here it probably would make more sense up here i guess um i would only add this pick your text class styles if we're on web otherwise i wouldn't um then it should render on a cell phone now we wouldn't get the correct text which is an issue but let's say like worst case scenario we can't figure out how to add the correct font at least it would run right which i i think that's kind of cool about react native and then especially right native web is that you could uh very easily like line by line say all right use this if you're on the web use this if you're on native and you can even say use this if you're on ios or use this if you're on android see you um you have kind of like that level of control into how you want to do things it's kind of nice because you don't have to write a ton of extra stuff for each platform you just tweak it here and there where you need it all right cool so let me scroll up and answer some questions and i'm gonna i'm not even gonna set a timer for myself now i'm just gonna try to answer as many questions as possible and uh actually let me let me commit this first that way you all can check out the code on github uh and i won't forget to commit this so good status see what we've changed let's see yep that looks like what we've changed vs code oh i want my vs code file in there where's my git ignore miscellaneous there we go all right so we do get add and i'm going to just add everything so get add period what everything we can do a status again just to double check that we in fact are ready to commit all these things and we'll do a git commit m which we're gonna put the messages and we're gonna say um i just prefix it with feed for feature so um let's say what do we do add style updates that's mostly what we did right mostly just styling i think so i know we did we did that svg thing as well but that'll be pretty good uh for now get and then we're gonna push origin master probably could just say get pushed since we're on the master branch but um like when i'm at work i never push directly to the master branch right i would normally be on a separate branch i would push that branch up and then i would submit a pull request and that pull request would have to get reviewed before it went in that's more of like the normal way you would work if you had a team of people all right but for a solo side project like this i shouldn't say solo other people have already made contributions to this project and you all can too if you'd like feel free to fork this clone it and make any contributions that you want uh that's that's awesome uh and welcome uh but uh you know definitely like make a separate branch and do it like that since it's my project um i'm just doing stuff right on the master branch but just so you know like your own project it's fine if you're working on somebody else's project you probably want to create a another branch and like at work i can't i can't even actually push on the master branch just lock down so um couldn't do it even if i i wanted to all right anyway let's get to the chat and i've i've been like squinting trying to read this chat and uh it just now occurred to me like oh why don't i just make the font bigger obviously that would that would be better right all right samuel has a question what's the difference between js and typescript so uh js or javascript um is not a strongly typed language right which means kind of like this is going to be an oversimplification but basically when you do something in javascript like if we have a a variable in javascript we can just assign it to whatever so i have this constant right this is a function um i have trying to make these are actually all pretty much functions so i don't have a good example uh trying to find one that's not a function that's actually something other than a function so basically i could have this constant i could assign and right now it's a function i could make another constant and it could be a string another one could be a number a boolean right an array an object they're all constants in other languages you can't do that i couldn't just say constant to do that i would have to say int for integer right um in some languages i would have to say exactly how many bits right it would it would have to be like in 32 right for 32bit if i wanted to have a string i would have to say string and assign it to a string right so you when you basically javascript doesn't require you to say what type something is when you declare the variable or when you assign the variable and here the way we're doing it here we're actually declaring and assigning a value to the variable at the same time you don't necessarily have to though what typescript does is it changes that so that in javascript you could assign when you declare a variable or declare and assign a variable you tell you put in the code exactly what type that is so not only that but there are a lot of other things like you would say if you created a function you would say this function would take in this many parameters and here's the type of each parameter that i expect in this function right and then depending on your your code editor you might get some really helpful tool tips that would come up and tell you exactly what to use right you'll get warnings in your browser and in your code editor right if if you warnings or errors if you try to pass the wrong type in so that's like i'm probably skipping some important stuff but basically that's what it does it takes javascript and it adds on to it to make javascript behave like a more strongly typed language which would require you to not only declare your variable but say what type your variable is right away so i like it i don't i don't think it's necessary for every project but it's definitely valuable for more complex projects at least that's been my experience oh let's see oh it looks like you all already uh answered what typescript is in the chat so i should have read along but um hopefully anyway it was it was helpful to somebody my explanation samuel says now i feel embarrassed asking this as i've never done it before but i'm presuming that you can't just copy and paste svg code into react as it won't work so you you actually can in normal react you can in react native you can't okay so um if you look i didn't really go over this but if you look at the difference here so let's let's do split screen here for a second and uh let's do one side so like here is our two svgs right one is a normal svg and one is the react native svg so if you use this react native svg library it gives you components based on what a normal svg would have so in this case we have the svg component and the path component so basically you just take what would work in normal react in an html svg and path all lower case and you switch them over to use these components instead and it basically works there's a few other things i believe like with these attributes that may need to be changed i don't know if that happened in our case no and then also it's possible i believe in html things like view box so some of the attributes would be hyphenated and you need to change them to be camel case i don't know if that's all of them or not um i can't i can't remember uh but those are the only things that i think you would need to change for regular react but then even for react native there's not really a lot that you need to change and if you use a converter like we did it's very easy so i actually have been using converter on anything i just leave it open all the time i used to do it by hand with like very small svgs but you can see like with larger svgs it it's much faster to use a converter but anyway that was a really good question uh let's see trying to find the next question looks like there's a nice little kind of conversation going on in the chat uh but no questions directed towards me so i'm scrolling down a bit oh yeah just just to be clear everybody i am using react native for this project so i'm using react native and then i'm using a a package called react native web so that i'm able to run this code in a web browser okay so it's it's confusing uh and it's probably confusing as to why you'd even want to do that but the main benefit is you can have the same code run in a web browser and on uh mobile devices like as native apps as well and potentially on other devices there are ways to run react native on um like as desktop apps uh or even on on other devices like um smart tvs uh i think there's a way to do it like on as a hololens app a microsoft hololens app so there's some cool stuff um there's even some other stuff that i'm not uh i'm not really familiar with that i've heard of uh that you can do with it so it's pretty it is nice and in particular for these live streams it's nice because running uh xcode and this the ios simulator or the android studio and trying to simulate stuff so that i could show you on the stream it takes a lot of resources on the computer and it would cause my frame rate to drop so it's not really doable on a live stream at least unless you have a really really good computer so this is a way for me to do react native on a live stream and still show you the results uh so there there's probably gonna be a time where i'm gonna like attempt to show you the results on a phone like on a simulator uh and just like expect that the stream is going to lag a little bit but we're going to do most of our development in the browser so that we can have a nicer experience looks a lot of people are joining in the stream at different times and saying hello and happy new year so hey everybody happy new year uh i know i keep saying it over and over again but um i don't want to i don't want to leave out the people coming into the stream now you know later on uh samuel was asking about the game mechanics of the game we're playing like what do you have a game over like what actually happens uh so right now the way the game works is i believe you will only ever get like if you keep answering wrong i think you only get up to six enemies yeah right now it only goes to six that's basically because like you can see if i put more than that they would start to things would start to get weird they're already touching at this point um and actually you could tell because they're circles when we had them as squares it just looked like one giant rectangle so this the circles are a little bit better you can tell that they're actually distinct so i don't there wouldn't be necessarily a game over uh you would just get to a point where you would have a bunch of enemies and you would keep trying you can win the game if you keep answering the if you keep putting the right answer in and you get to no enemies so every time you put a right answer in an enemy goes away you get to know enemies and you win right so uh that's all i have so far for game mechanics i i'm not sure that i don't know that i would necessarily want to have a game over um i think potentially like it would be better to let the child keep going and seeing if they could start to get them right because the more they practice like the better they would get yeah i could see that if they really just wanted to start over they could just refresh uh refresh the the browser tab and then maybe like when you win having the option maybe to go to the the next level so either like bump up to do double digit math and set a single digit or maybe like bump up to the next level so i don't know i think there's it's still like the bare minimum of functionality i think there's a lot that could be done and right now like it doesn't it's not like you have your score saved or your preference is saved or anything like that so uh very basic but that's that's basically what happens at this point and this is based off of a game i used to play with my son we would play it on a whiteboard when he was learning basic math and we actually called it orc math like after the orcs and lord of the rings but i decided to switch to battle math because i didn't want the the tolkien estate to sue me or anything uh for calling it orcmath so we switched it to battle math and i used to just draw little bad guys on a whiteboard and then manually write problems on the board and erase them like right and erase the bad guys so um that's so the game mechanics were already uh in use before oh levi asked a good question don't you need a semicolon at the end of those lines uh so if you see the code like i don't have semicolons pretty much anywhere so semicolons are actually optional in javascript so technically i believe there are some situations where you need a semicolon but i never encounter those situations like i i pretty much never use semicolons so um and if i ever really need a semicolon my editor tells me which like i'm telling you i've almost never encountered a situation where i need a semicolon so for me i don't use semicolons i set my automatic linting to just take them out if they're in there the way i figure it is if i don't need it then why add it in it's less typing if i just don't add it in so good question though levi says free code can't lie to me then about some yeah a lot of the beginner tutorials will have you put semicolons in so like technically that is like the standard for javascript is to put semicolons in uh but in reality you don't you don't need it like browsers understand it without semicolons so whether or not that was ever intended i don't know but it's just the way things are in javascript that you can write it without semicolons and everything still works yeah uh joey says it's a somewhat controversial topic it is yeah like um yes writing semicolons are not as controversial for all of my projects like if i have control over code styling um the code style then i i just have it automatically set to remove semicolons so usually like people can code however they want but if they go to commit a precommit hook will run and it will remove the semicolons so when it actually goes into the repository um it won't have semicolons so so you can go to however you want if you want to contribute to my projects but that's how it's going to be now if i'm coding for uh somebody else's project and they want semicolons like i will add semicolon then i'll respect their preferences but for me i do not put semicolons in uh samuel says silly question but why are you using react instead of vanilla javascript for this game that's actually a good question um if i were just planning on doing this in the browser i could definitely do this in vanilla javascript and it would work and it it might like it would probably be entirely doable it's not a complex thing i do it react native because i would like to use this on a phone like a mobile phone so react native will let me turn this into a native app and like have it on the app store and stuff right like i'm not i'm not attempting to like sell this or anything i just think it'd be cool if my kids could play this on a tablet or a phone uh so that's why i was doing it also like i uh i use react and react native at work so uh it's like a way for me to try out new things on something that basically has there's no consequences if i try out something new and mess it up here as opposed to work it'd be a little bit different right so this was one of the first apps that i really used um the context api and react hooks on and stuff so just gives me a little extra practice good question though uh sheehan says can i know how to write php for phishing attack no we do uh free code camp is not the place to go to learn how to do fishing attacks uh and unless you are getting paid by a company to test their security it is probably not a good idea to be doing phishing attacks levi says the twitch emojis are way better than the youtube ones i have to check out the twitch emojis i haven't i'm not on twitch that often uh so i'll check out their emojis and see what it's like levi says the chat is more like a q a than a chat yeah it'd end up being more like uh like a question and answer session oh michael good point so um he also says one of the one of the reasons why i used react native was to see if i could do it so this was um i did this at a time when using react native web was still like not very common i don't know how common it is now but at least in my mind it was still more experimental like i just wanted to know like can i use this with create react app and get everything to work right so i do i just really wanted to see if it would work so i had the idea for this game in mind already because i had played with my son um but i didn't i just like never got around actually doing it and so then it just kind of combined it with the idea of hey this would be it's like a cool way to use react native so that's why so i tried it and then we end up like we use react native web with react native at work as well so um i believe trying to make what i started doing first now i don't even remember i think it was almost simultaneously that i was developing this and testing it and we were doing it at work but anyway um yeah definitely not necessary for this project but it was a good opportunity to test out some some new stuff that i was learning we have a question about is rust hard to get into i i've never tried coding in rust so i have no idea if anybody knows anything about rust let us know in the chat oh cool levi says the noise is gone now so i'm not sure what that noise was but glad it's gone unreal expert says what type of drink are you drinking so i am drinking a rain energy drink this is carnival candy flavor i believe i went with carnival candy flavor because it was the cheapest flavor on amazon and i just put this on my subscribe and save uh this is like my preworkout drink so i don't drink these every day or all the time um i lift weights three times a week so i wake up early and i drink one of these on the way to the gym and that gives gives me a boost a boost of energy so that's my that's what i'm drinking also drinking water which i should probably should probably drink your mouth gets like really dry when you um are live coding because you talk a lot right so anyway um let's see anything i don't really know if these things are good for you or not so i just want to put a disclaimer like i don't officially like recommend this to anybody or not um but it it feels like it helps me get awake in the morning when i work out and then also like if it's getting late if i need to drive somewhere late i have one um if it's like an emergency and i need uh energy i'll have one uh mark shawn says thanks thank you for coding tonight jesse i thought i was going to be alone on the new year but not anymore oh that's awesome i'm glad that you're not uh alone on the new year uh that's pretty cool yeah i wasn't sure like how many people would want to watch because it's you know new year you know maybe people would have plans or anything but uh that's cool that's really cool i i would have been alone too to be honest everybody else in my house would have been asleep so um i don't even know i would either been asleep or would have been by myself probably uh checking out what everybody else was doing on on social media and waiting for uh for the new year um sammy says i must say like mark thank you jesse if you're doing this tonight oh you're welcome this is cool i yeah i like well like i said i i said this at the beginning the stream so a lot of you probably missed it but um it was maybe like at least four years ago maybe five years ago i was myself alone on new year's and um saw quincy who's the head of free code camp and the founder of free code camp doing a live stream and watched it and thought it was really cool when i um i had done some lessons on free code camp before and that was like my first experience with a coding live stream and years later it i remembered it and it was like kind of inspiration uh for me to get it started and uh it's just crazy that i'm live coding for free code camp now on new year's and um anyway so i'm really cool that i could do for you all kind of what quincy did for me back then and uh anyway so it's cool that we all get to hang out world changer says how to donate uh go to freecodecamp.org and follow the directions on there if you want to donate to free code camp and i said that money doesn't go to me i don't get anything uh so like we don't even do ads on youtube so like we don't get any money for that there's just a few people that do like very important work for free code camp like making sure the servers are running and stuff like that uh that are actually paid like i believe over 90 percent of us are just volunteers so uh if you want to donate in any way in time or money like that's awesome uh levi says i'd like to volunteer but i think i'm way too young free code camp doesn't accept teenagers do they uh i don't think age really matters to be honest with you i think if you um like there's a lot of different ways to contribute and so you definitely could like there's the free code camp forum is probably one of the easiest place to contribute you can just go on there and be active on the forum uh there's a blog for free codecamp has its own blogging platform now so you could post vlog stuff on there um there is a obviously the youtube channel then all of the free codecamp source code is open source so you could set up a profile on on github and work on some of that code even little things like uh writing correcting typos um you know that aren't necessarily code are still very helpful uh so there there's just so much stuff that could be done there's also like a free code camp i forget what they call it exactly but basically it's like documentation for every different type of coding thing you could think of so there's a ton of different ways to contribute uh and so just kind of check it out and like don't don't let age you know stop you i think if you have good good stuff to contribute then free code camp will probably want it um check base says do you know some programming language for cross platform ios and android um yes actually uh react native which is javascript based lets you do crossplatform ios and android uh i'm trying to think does flutter i'm i'm so uh kind of behind on learning about flutter but does flutter let you do android and ios i know it does android but does it does are there any um uh flutter people in here let me know if there if there are if it does um ios let's see all right uh xavier i'm not sure whether it's xavier or xavier let me know how you want me to pronounce that i've i've heard both uh so let me know and i'll do my best to remember and pronounce it correctly but anyway the question is what if you've been working as a developer for a few years but can't put up code to github to share with other employers can you not put up code because your employer isn't open source uh or is there some other reason if it's because of your employer that's that's kind of tough that's how my employer is right now your only option really is to i mean you could convince your employer to do some open source stuff which may be difficult or you could do some side projects on your own which also can be difficult if you don't have a lot of time to do it i know like for me i have four kids so there's not really a lot of time like if i'm gonna do a side project it usually means that's less time i get to spend with my kids so i know that can be difficult uh but if there's some other reason why you can't put code up there let me know but you know basically try your best to see if you can convince your your employer to let you put put some of your work code on github otherwise it's got to be um uh like side project stuff so i'm trying to find a question there's a lot of back and forth here what is dark thing okay i got to the point where we're all voting on circles and squares so let me just go through that you uh remesh pointed out that um the the app still has the reaction icon uh in the title of react app so yeah i'll definitely have to change that as well i don't really have another icon though that i could put there i don't have a game an icon for the game but that's something i'll have to have because if i want to put it on an app store at some point i'll need a little icon so i have to think about what i want that to be um all right uh levi says oh wait no that's not a question sorry oh sam had to go um and i didn't i didn't catch it if you're still here sam um i'll see you probably not still here that was a while ago all right still i'm still trying to find questions there's a lot of like uh back and forth talking in the chat which i love i love when you all interact with each other but it's hard for me to find uh actual questions oh levi has to go i miss that too that's thing that when uh i can't keep up with the chat then i miss when people leave so um but anyway levi wanted me to know to uh try to add border and box shadow around everything so it looks like it's raised off the page that that's actually pretty cool uh a pretty cool idea i think that's a good idea uh i kind of don't want to get too fancy with what i do since i'm prob i really would like to replace what i have now with um like character sprites like make it look a little bit more like a video game uh but i do like i like the idea of giving it some the appearance of some depth let's see we have a question does anyone know if the stream will be saved it will be saved uh the stream will be available to watch um just probably just a few minutes after i end the stream and let's see the project uh some questions about explaining the project uh this is a math game for children that we're building with react native react native is a uh like a javascript library and it can build we're building it in a way so that it could run in a web browser or it could run as an app in ios and android spence wants an opinion on learning c for a first language c is pretty low level um i if somebody asked me what language they should start with i probably would not say c it there's just there's a lot of stuff that uh other languages kind of do for you that you have to do manually and see so the learning curve might be a little bit harder i personally think javascript is a decent language to start with because you don't need anything extra to run it like it just runs in your web browser um it is it is pretty forgiving like you can kind of mess stuff up in javascript and it will still run like you can get it to run other languages like sometimes there's a lot of compiling involved like you can't even see what's going on uh also you can build pretty much anything with javascript by that i mean like you can build for a lot of different platforms with javascript like pretty easily so um it's a versatile thing uh also probably if i would if you didn't really didn't want javascript i would maybe recommend python uh i think python is pretty cool to learn with uh there's not really a lot of like special characters in the syntax so you don't get caught up as much in syntax stuff so those are just my opinions on first languages probably like i did learn a little bit of javascript as kind of my first programming language but it was such such a little amount i wouldn't even say it counted the first time i tried to use a programming language to really program something uh i took a class in c plus plus so that was probably my first first language uh but that was a long time ago and i just made a calculator with it i did and i did a couple other things but i i can't even remember what they were so that's where i'm kind of coming from uh with my my opinions there mark schoen says can i use spring boot and react native together um as to why i'm using spring boot i would be doing a lot of heavy serverside processing i'm not 100 sure i know people where i work use spring boot uh but i've never worked with it directly so i'm i'm not really sure if you could or not i believe there are people where i work some teams that are using them both but like i said i'm not 100 sure on that uh we got a question what do you think about expo i love expo uh expo which is expo expo is a weight it's kind of like a helper library for react native it makes some react native things easier than what they would normally be if you're just using just straight react native so i love expo i i definitely recommend using it for any react native project try to use expo uh if for some reason you're doing some crazy thing that isn't supported by expo then you can always eject it uh if you need to but expo just provides some really cool stuff makes things easier it makes like even even things like just uh running your stuff locally it makes that easier so bundling your app for the app store there's a lot of like helper components that you can use so expo uh i really like it especially now that it has web support as well expo is definitely the way to go michael creole says uh for our picker he says what if instead of a picker we just made it a button that opens a modal form with four separate buttons you could add font family too that's actually that's a good idea um you know the picker is definitely the simplest way but if we're not going to be able to do the if we're not even going to be able to control the font in the picker then you know maybe we should go with something else uh joey says uh we we were talking a few minutes ago about semicolons in javascript whether you use them or not so i don't use them uh joey's is when when uh so anyway joey says i do the opposite i often write js without semicolons and have the editor or eslint insert them when saving so for me i always have the editor just take them out and i never write them either so you haven't put them in so that is that's kind of interesting actually that would work for me especially if i'm working on someone else's project and they want them in there if i were to just not actually that is what i do normally um i believe the last time i worked on a project i did have the editor i didn't have the editor to do it they had it set up so that like the project would automatically put them in so i didn't have to do it when i wrote the code either so that that is a good way to do it um and andrew hillis sorry if i mispronounced that but uh says i still use semicolons because if i ever go to another language i'm already used to using them that's true a lot of other languages do use semicolons so i it is hard for me to get used to using them when i do have to use them for other stuff uh micah also has the editor add semicolons in amber steph says hello world hello how's it going welcome mojo says what is the big o of dijkstra algorithm tight bound i i don't know enough about dijkstra's algorithm and the tobigo notation to answer that off the top of my head uh so um big o notation is like a um a way to measure uh the um i always say this i see performance i don't know if reform is just the right world word um i it's a way to measure how performant an algorithm is uh both in terms of time complexity and space complexity um so um i don't like that i don't remember enough about anything like that the only time i study stuff like that is if i'm gonna do interviews and to be honest with you i've never had anybody ask me about that on an interview that's something i would probably just look up but um anyway that actually it's kind of good to remember like it's good to know about big o notation and all that stuff but to be honest like i've never actually had a question about bigo notation on an interview so i don't know how useful that information is in terms of getting a job but i guess it's good to know about in case it comes up mark shawn says have you tried anything with uh web assembly i haven't yet so i'm i'm like kind of i read about it when i see stuff about webassembly but i have not tried it yet i just haven't really had a good use case for it yet but it would be cool to try for those of you who are not familiar with it webassembly it's i'm no expert at it but it's a way that you can use different languages to write stuff for the browser so like you could use python or c sharp or anything whatever language you want write it and then have it run in a web browser and there are some performance potential performance benefits to doing this so it's really cool now for me i'm mainly a javascript developer um so it's not as attractive to me like i i know i know developers who aren't primarily javascript developers who see this as a great opportunity because they can use their main language on the web i kind of see it as like potentially it's a way to run do things in the web even faster um than you could otherwise so i just think that most things on the web right now don't really need that so i'm kind of waiting for like that that use case that's really going to make webassembly like a necessary thing so i haven't found it yet but like i said i'm not really an expert at it so i i think like it'll probably be a really big deal at some point uh probably just not like not it's not there yet like it's not ready for uh like mass adoption yet uh joey says jesse i tried live coding a while back and i'm a terrible host you're much better at it i don't know i don't know i just keep talking i don't know what i've also been doing it for a long time this is like two years of live coding so uh many many hours of live coding uh let's see rahman says hi there from uh iran hey how's it going thanks for joining us ultimate great says more live coding sessions i'm loving it awesome network host any area 51 says my house is already asleep they said they'd hang with daddy but my son said he wants a raspberry pi to code a network engineer like me that's cool yeah that's what uh i assume everybody in my house is asleep i haven't heard any noise up there uh it's definitely past everybody's bedtime oh it's almost midnight here so it is 11 53 p.m uh i have to remember to check this clock when it's midnight uh let's see lonnie bulldozer asks if i'm drunk actually i'm not drunk so i did have a drink earlier before the live stream so uh my wife my wife got me everything i needed to make a manhattan so manhattan is probably my favorite alcoholic drink and it's uh either bourbon or rye whiskey with a few drops of angostura bitters and sweet vermouth and then i you put a maraschino cherry in it i like to add a little bit of the juice from the cherry you can shake it or stir it depends on how much time i have as to whether i do that and then i like to add a little bit of ice in there too so it's a good drink so drunk not so much i would have to have more than one i think to be drunk but um it was it was nice nice drink she went out earlier and got got treats for the kids and stuff for uh for new year's uh let's see okay so i asked a while back about flutter if um flutter let you do android and ios and it looks like flutter does let you do android ios and web so that's awesome so i do i i have talked with some flutter developers before uh conferences and stuff so it seems really cool um i mean for what i do like right nate is my thing so i'm not really gonna switch right now like i'm in the middle of building a big app in react native so um but it seems kind of cool um we have a question about unity so does free code camp have lessons on unity uh and csharp i believe we have some videos on it i don't think they're like um there's no curriculum on freecodecam.org but there are videos about it on this youtube channel uh special else or sorry the l's capitalized so it seemed like it should be pronounced separately but i guess it's just special is the name says some people saying flutter is better than react native yeah to be honest with you i don't really know what's better like i use react native i haven't actually used flutter so i can't really say which one is better i imagine it's like most things in that um you just need like it depends on the situation so uh it depends like what do you need to build and what do you already know what does your team already know stuff like that honey buddha just said you're sweating uh maybe that's why uh lonnie asked if i was drunk am i sweating to be honest with you i have like uh like oily skin right like i don't have anybody deals with it right like some people have really dry skin they gotta use lotion like i never need to use lotion like at the end of the day i'm just like just so much oil on my skin so i probably look super shiny so it's uh it's really cold and right now i'm in my basement i turned off the heat so the furnace wouldn't run because it makes too much noise so i'm actually really cold but because it's the end of the day like i have this oily skin so that's probably why i look like i'm sweating all right three minutes until the new year where i'm at almost uh novez says this channel is one of the best ones congratulations ah thanks i mean i'm only like a small contributor here but i will say thank you on behalf of everybody that contributes to the channel uh max lozano says how do i start learning python um i don't know what the best way to learn python would be free codecamp i don't think we have python of course we just added something was it python i don't know this might be good to check out let's check this out uh where's our curriculum all right i thought we just added something else i don't know maybe it's not added yet yeah okay so there are some free like online coding places uh where you can learn python uh codecademy i believe has some free stuff udacity has an intro to computer science course that uses python that's free so check those out uh christy jensen says thoughts on women in programming i'm studying computer science sometimes i'm the only female in my class oh no well it's too bad that you're the only female in your class i didn't go through a computer science degree so i'm not 100 sure how things work in computer science but i do know um i think now is um a good time to get into program uh programming as a woman my wife just got into the programming hey it's midnight so happy new year uh just hit midnight here on the east coast uh in the united states so everybody in the eastern time zone happy new year um yeah i'm in 2020 now like a lot of you watching so i want to say like cheers or have like a glass of champagne but i just have this water bottle so happy new year so christy back to your question uh the reason i say i think it's a good time to get in now is because uh people are making i think more of an effort to so number one people are realizing how hard it has been for women to get into tech into programming and they're starting to make an effort to make things better so um for instance when my wife was starting out she got a scholarship to a coding boot camp and she got scholarships to go to conferences uh because she was a woman trying to get into programming right so there are opportunities like that for women that i think can be helpful also you know there are companies that are actively trying to hire more women uh so i think it's like there are definitely still places where it's difficult like i hear stories about that but then also know like my wife has had a very good experience so far um she didn't have any problem at all finding uh a job uh she works remote uh so yeah that's my thoughts on it like in terms of like where i'm coming from too is like there's no intrinsic reason why a woman couldn't be a good programmer like as good or better than a male programmer right like so i don't i don't have any weird thoughts like that right so um but i do realize that there are some like the way things are done at some companies makes it hard for a woman to like just be there and exist right so i think it's getting better there are some places that are better than others in terms of like just being a a good environment for women to be in definitely remote work is remote work is nice not just for women i feel like it's great for everybody because like that environment factor is brought down to a minimum right you don't have to actually be there every day and like be around people uh for like for better or for worse okay so there's a ton of remote opportunities but then even even then like there's opportunities where um just the environments are getting a lot better so i hope that answers your question uh hang in there in your computer science classes uh i know that's that's tough um being i don't know i just can't imagine i can't imagine that feeling of um number one being female because i'm i'm not a female right but number two being the only female uh in the class uh so that's tough i've been like on the other end like in with my degree uh is in economics there were some classes where there was only one female in the class in economics classes she would she always held her own though it was a small group of us that kind of all had the same classes but i imagine it probably couldn't have been easy for her but anyway hang in there get through it there's a lot of cool opportunities so try to take advantage of like the scholarship opportunities and stuff like that anyway i hope that was a good answer let me know if you have any more like specific questions for that and uh sorry if i rambled it is i told you anytime after midnight my answers are going to start getting worse because i'm going to be getting tired sergio says to be a backend developer what languages do you recommend learning first uh it really depends on what kind of work you want to do specifically um or like what companies you want to work at so if if there are certain companies you really want to work at or a certain thing you really want to do then you probably need to do a little bit of research to figure out um like what what you need right so um for instance a lot of machine learning stuff is done in python uh if you want to do like a lot of cloud type stuff um i believe like if you work at google i think go is used heavily for google's cloud stuff if you like some companies are heavily dotnet based so you probably want to do like c sharp and net some companies are very based in java some companies use java javascript full stack so i would maybe do your research if you just want to be backend then i guess it really if you have no preference at all it kind of doesn't matter uh if you at some point would like to be full stack though then javascript's not a bad option because you could learn back end and then also have that experience in javascript to do front end but yeah it just it really kind of depends on what what you want to get into uh samuel says what do you think of using spring boot and angular together uh i'm not really sure like i have not used spring boot myself and i haven't used angular in years so i don't know i don't know enough about either one of them to give you a a good answer micah says a national public radio report in 2013 stated about 20 of all u.s computer programmers are female and open source fields only 10 of women are programmers okay that's interesting um that's really interesting i don't i wonder why that is that it's it's less for open source okay um let's see says do you need to learn js and laravel um i don't i don't know if you would need to learn it depends on what you're trying to do uh in terms of javascript and larval so maybe if you got a little bit more information i could give you kind of a better answer uh cj says is anybody interested in google summer of code if so what projects are you interested in um i'm not really sure i don't i've heard of summer of code before but i'm not exactly sure what it is so uh i guess i'm i'm kind of interested but i don't know what what is about mark shawn says jesse your explanation of big o was perfect including time and space oh cool all right i guess i still remember i i remember it uh correctly then oh joey says uh ebay has an amazing blog post about their use of webassembly highly recommend reading all right cool i'll have to try to find that uh we were talking about webassembly a little bit earlier uh and um i said i'm i am intrigued by webassembly i'm just waiting for um like what's the practical application where like there'll be a really good use case you know uh mark shawn says if you check out webassembly's website there are use cases all right cool i'll definitely have to check that out then joey says plus one for manhattan's and old fashions yeah a manhattan is very similar to the drink uh the old fashioned uh which i also enjoyed that so i enjoy them both uh both are really good drinks if you're into uh whiskeybased drinks they're very good joey says no not shaking yeah yeah you can't i know some people have strong opinions about stirred versus shaking uh drinks but um i used to be a bartender at one time so i definitely appreciate the uh the differences between a steroid and shake and drink but i i like to be i'm going to be understood honest with you in terms of taste as long as you don't as long as everything is cold enough that the shaking with ice doesn't water it down too much in terms of taste i think shaken drinks are generally better right because of all the oxygen in the drink it it does something for the flavor right stirred drinks are better for presentation because it keeps the clarity and i will say there's less melting so less watering down of the drink but like potentially if you were to keep all your ingredients chilled when you shake it in the ice you could minimize the melting and so you wouldn't have a watereddown drink so like it just kind of depends like if i was bartending i probably wouldn't shake it i would want it to look clear and nice but for myself i shake most drinks if i want to take the time to shake it so anyway sorry this is a coding stream sorry i killed off on my my my dreams uh saeed says what do you think about chat bots applications and future using dialogflow or bot framework etc um i don't have a lot of experience with programming chat bots i didn't make an alexa skill once but um i don't have a lot of experience beyond that with programming chat bots but i'm really excited about it uh i i own a lot of uh like voice chat devices uh and i really like it um i use the uh so the google has this uh call screening feature for your phone and uh i really love that so i'm kind of excited for where that goes to where like chat bots either text base or voice base um become like nearly indistinguishable from people and like i i don't want it to be like in kind of a weird way where you don't know if you're dealing with a person or bot but just in a way where like i can talk more naturally to a chatbot and do things uh i'm i think it's going to be really cool when i'm looking forward to it just in terms of like the future of it and i think it could be applied to so many things in terms of programming it i'm not really up on on the best stuff so like dialog flow about framework i don't have any opinions on that i don't know enough about it but i think that's the way i actually have a um so beyond chat i think brain computer interfaces are kind of really cool just like skipping the talking altogether and going directly to reading the brain waves so i have a brain computer interface device that should be coming in in a few days and i really would love to do some live streaming about making applications that read your brain ways and do things based on that so hopefully i'll have more coming soon for that uh i wish i would have had the uh the hardware for this live stream but it didn't come in um i think it'll be on maybe this friday hopefully if there's no delays in shipping so we have a question about so i mentioned that i um was in economics says how fast can economists make transition into i.t system field analyst system analyst field i tell you the truth in terms of how fast can you transition it's hard to say um like making the transition into the field is all depends on like how fast can you convince somebody that you're to give you a job that you're ready right um so it's really really hard to say there are definitely people who take less than a year and make huge career changes and have good jobs in the i.t field there are people that take a lot longer it really really depends a lot on the person where the where they're living at what the job opportunities are like um so it's just it would be hard to say but it's definitely doable like within within a year all right christie says thank you for that response i think you're thanking me for the response i i assume the time stamps kind of line up with when i was talking about it you're welcome hope at least hopefully it was a decent answer to your question uh is it hard to learn java i only know c in python if you already know c in python i think you could probably pick up java uh the question is ng rx or rxjs for angular i haven't used angular since angular 1 and so i i do not know uh aditya says sorry if i mispronouncing your name it says what are you coding here i just joined in um actually so we're kind of done with the coding stuff we're just doing a little question and answer before i wrap things up uh but we were coding i'm trying to find my code uh we're using react native which is a javascript library to code in a game just like a a very simple math game to help children learn learn math and we want it to run on web ios and android oh joey says ebay uses webassembly for barcode scanning that's interesting that's really interesting i definitely want to check that out i'm doing stuff with barcode scanning as well at at work so i would i want to know more about that joey says no semicolons and shaking your whiskey's psy sorry uh muhammad says what programming language should i start in to become a successful software developer unless you really know what you want to do like machine learning or whatever i recommend javascript because that's going to let you do front end and back end and it's going to let you build for a lot of different platforms there's also the learning curve for javascript is not that steep and there's a ton of free resources for it uh i have tried to teach myself coding through various means multiple times in my life usually ending in failure any advice for a guy who wants to succeed but feels too dumb to keep trying uh i would say when you're trying to learn when i'm trying to learn something new or back when i was first learning coding uh the best advice that i could give i think is uh just try to do a little bit every day uh and just keep going and also like um there are times when you're gonna feel you are gonna feel like you just can't get it like you don't know enough like um the law the more you learn kind of like the less you'll feel like that or at least when you feel like that you won't freak out about it because you'll know it's normal but there are times when i i think oh wow like i can't believe i can't figure this out now like my wife went through in the last year like the process of learning how to code and getting a job and so um i kind of went through that process with her of you know she very frequently thought like i can't get this right um so you're gonna have those those times when you feel like you can't do it and you feel like a failure just realize like everybody goes through that just keep trying to learn at least a little bit every day so even if it's only a half an hour of coding just keep trying okay now when i say every day like if you got to take a day off here and there that's fine you know like for me like sunday was usually my day that i'm like i'm done i'm like uh you know hang out with family and stuff so i don't mean like it has to be every day or won't work but definitely you know take a day off here there don't take two or three days off frequently right you're gonna want to try to keep it up every day uh or as close to every day as you can it'll keep things fresh in your mind and um like it'll keep you going at it like when you feel like you can't do it like the the just keep going so like having that that cadence of every day will help you keep going i think my wife had a streak of like over 300 days of straight of coding and that really helped her get through it because she wanted to keep her streak going uh joey says what which brain interface device are you getting it's called the notion so it's a new device so the company is called neurosci neurosity um i think it's yeah i think that's how you spell it anyway um i got a um a developer kit so i think i'm gonna be one of the first people to get the kit uh so you can request like if you go on their website you can put in your email to get on the list like to get a developer kit um so i'm excited about it uh it's i haven't used it yet obviously but it's supposed to be like pretty um pretty accurate and um i'm just i just keep having all these ideas about stuff i could do like uh i don't know it's gonna be cool i don't wanna say too much so i'm getting really tired i gotta end the stream but i really hope to be able to do some awesome stuff and like do some streams about it uh sorry for mispronouncing that says love from argentina thank you uh joey says jesse my first code contributions to an open source were to your fus site project uh that's awesome now i'm a lead software engineer i said this already but it got buried before you found it okay i thought i saw you say something about this and then i couldn't find it again all right i'm glad you said it again wow that is so awesome well congratulations on being a lead software engineer that's amazing and that's so cool oh man i'm really like i'm i'm so happy you said that thank you uh thank you for saying that twice uh mark shawn says do you work or fedex or a different company that needs to scan barcodes uh i work for dick sporting goods uh so we scan barcodes like in the store basically so i'm working on a um of sale system that'll run on cash registers so in that context we're doing barcode scanning uh cheyenne says how can i stop procrastinating um that's that's really a tough question uh yeah trying to think of like some type of uh some type of tricks to get yourself to stop uh you could set i mean sometimes it helps to like set a goal or just set a timer say like i'm going to work on this thing for let's say half an hour and the timer goes off and you like reward yourself so sometimes a reward helps a reward and or punishment right like if i don't do this much by the end of the day like then i don't know i can't like no tv or no video games or something right and it's hard to do it like to punish yourself right but or you say if i do get it done then i get this extra thing right so maybe something like that uh once again says where should beginners go to start learning i recommend freecodecamp.org it's a great place for beginners so uh kavita says uh hi happy new year 2020. hey how's it going happy new year patrick's hand says what is battle math uh battle math is uh a um a game a math game that my son and i came up with um when he was learning math uh as when he was very young and uh basically it just when you get a math problem right you defeat an enemy if you get it wrong more enemies come onto the battlefield so it's just my son really liked it when he when he was doing that he was really into lord of the rings and stuff and so like the whole idea of it being like a battle was was more fun to him than just doing math problems so i'm trying to turn it into an app all right i have reached the end of the chat oh there's one more question so i'll just do this one more question and then then i'm done i got to go to sleep the last question is what tech are you excited for in 2020 um for me personally feel free to add your uh your answers in here as well in in the chat or in the comments but the tech i'm most ex well the tech guy i'm excited for in 2020 is uh definitely my brain computer interface that i'm gonna hopefully be developing for soon uh super excited for that um i'm also uh i'm really excited for uh the companies that are working in like space travel so uh spacex blue origin um i'm like i'm super excited for for whatever is going on there uh i wanted to be an astronaut when i was little right so uh just the idea that um things are moving forward in terms of like people getting more people getting into space i think is really cool so i'm just always excited for anything going on with that um i let like electric cars being more affordable uh is a cool thing i'd love to get one myself at some point so trying to think that's yeah that's probably the tech that i'm most excited about yeah um yeah definitely and then in terms of like coding and what i do react uh suspense seems super awesome i can't wait until that's actually like usable and like fully production ready so all right so that was my last question i got i got to cut it off i know there's more um there's more stuff uh coming in but i'm super tired uh so this has been a three and a half hour live stream thank you all so much for watching uh everybody in the chat you all were uh amazing uh felt good to be back in um in a live coding session so hopefully i'll be doing some more like live coding sessions uh it's really tough between my job and you know my family i don't have a lot of time but i'm gonna do my best to try to carve out a little bit of time and do more of these anyway happy new year everyone i hope this is a great year for you all and uh until next time let us have a have a great have a great new year great new decade and thanks again for watching
