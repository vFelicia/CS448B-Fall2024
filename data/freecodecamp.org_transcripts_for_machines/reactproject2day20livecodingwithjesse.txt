hey everybody its Jessie and today I guess who will start out I want to start out by explaining what I've found out since yesterday about some of the things we were talking about but then also some of the errors that have been reported that others have been getting and I finally started getting them too and I think I know why so it would be worthwhile to go over that and then that way maybe we can solve the problem finally or at least at least work around it after that we're gonna work on this scroll kind of the scroll spy thing where it'll this will highlight as we scroll down whatever section that we're on we'll be able to click on one of these and take us to the correct section alright so first let's let's go over some of these errors and I also had said in the description for this video and for in the the tweet that we were going to talk specifically about property initializer syntax so if you want to check that out in the react Docs if you go under the handling events page about halfway down a little more than half way down they go over the property initializer syntax and we're using this in places and this is causing an error so basically it's instead of binding this and then in this case its handle click and then calling handle click but or anything you know we really want to call instead of doing that we're using an arrow fun which is basically automatically taken care of binding this and it works so that the pages obviously work so for instance on this page we're using we're using that several times to make this work we can see that it is working we can click around and there's no errors I check the console earlier and that no errors at all so it works the problem is when we're we're using standard J s to help keep our code nice and clean and always formatted the same way so that's where the errors are coming from it's it's not that it's not working it's just that that's an advanced the react Doc's say experimental it's an experimental feature in JavaScript so these are the errors that we're getting you make this a bit bigger and let's see so it's looking something like this so it's saying like onmouseover is not defined handle close is not defined right even we it state is not defined when we try to define state and kind of the shorthand way that we've been doing at at times instead of inside the constructor so all of these errors are basically the same thing it's using that property initializer syntax so initially when we first started this project and even in our last project I think we did the same thing we weren't getting errors at least I wasn't getting errors and some of you are getting errors I started getting errors when I upgraded yarn to a new newer version and a little before that I also upgraded NPM although that that didn't matter for me but you'll see in a minute I'll explain why that probably matters for some of you so I was using a very outdated version of yarn and I didn't realize that at first because I kept doing the auto updates and then it hit me like wow I'm I'm being asked to update this very frequently and so I finally checked the versions and realized that every time I did that auto update it didn't change anything I was still in the same version so I was running yarn like version 18 and now I think I'm on 24 whatever the latest one is I'm on that so what I think happens and this is based on going through some issues and create react app and issues with es lint so I spent way too much time researching this but finally what I think happened is that something changed in both yarn and NPM so if you went from NPM for something you know to NPM version 5 I think 5 the latest it also the same thing happen whereas they're handling one of one or more of the dependencies differently than they were before at least that's I don't know technically how yarn and NPM do things and what exactly change but that seems to be the conclusion on that I found like I said from looking at the issues that other people have had on the github repositories for create react app and I think it was for es LAN or perhaps like for babel something like I can't remember what the other repository was but that was the conclusion basically and some of the issues had been closed in particular in correcta react app there's an issue basically the same thing that's happening to us and it's been closed and the solution which the workaround given was revert back to NPM version four you know for dot whatever and the reasoning given was you know version five there's there's some different stuff going on five we don't recommend using that in production and that was that was it so couldn't really find a solution and I don't really want to go back in revert versions right that's not a great solution either because not only would I have to revert but anybody that wanted to try to run this without errors would have to revert so that's not really a good solution so I think that leaves us with two two ways we could go the first way is we could just switch everything back to a less experimental syntax which has already been suggested so Matt had a pull request that had did that among other things and some of you have already suggested that in the live chat or in comments to the videos so that's one way that's probably the easiest way I mean it would be a little bit of a pain I guess to go back and do that and I know Matt's pull request had done that but we've we've changed something since then so I can't just pull that in I'd have to deal with the merge conflicts as well and the other way that we could go is try to really figure out what's going on and and fix the problem so I went down that path a little a little bit earlier so I actually did pool Matt's pool request and he ejected create react app in that pool request right so my thought was hey if we eject that I can go in and change the figuration of what we're doing with with es lint and and fix it now also what I had done is I pulled it in I resolve the merge conflicts but I purposely left in some of the newer syntax so whereas Matt had changed it back to the old version I wanted to test to see if we could get it to work so I left some of it in and I didn't have any success in trying to change configuration no I will say this I'm not I'm not really that experienced with you know dealing with configuring you know babble and es LAN and standard js2 all work together so you know maybe I if I worked on it more I maybe could get it to work but at this point I think I'm probably just gonna switch everything back so and so I do that if you want to submit a pull request use this no verify flag on the end so if you edit a file that doesn't have any of the the property initializer syntax it will pass the test so you can see I try to so I changed this glossary and home right and I committed that and everything worked that's because the standard Jas is only checking the files that had changed so the only files the change were these I'm not using that syntax so it works and this explains why it wasn't consistent like the errors that people were getting you know in particular these errors were not consistent so I committed that everything was fine but then a few minutes later I I tried to commit after changing this planning ijs where we are using some of that newer syntax and you can see I got the errors again all right we have handle next handle pre not defined so if you're changing something and you're not using that syntax you should be fine to commit otherwise use that know verify flag at the end for now I don't really want everyone doing that all the time because then you know we we won't have very formatting but I know that this actually works so I'm not super worried about it now so what I will do is convert everything I I really I'd rather not because I do like the the newer syntax better but at this point like I said I just I think I've already spent way too much time on this issue trying to find a better solution and if I would have just changed everything over a couple days ago then this wouldn't really have been a problem I wouldn't have even known that it was a problem so that's where that's at so I know some of you have told me that you've had these issues so they will be I guess not not really fixed but will work around them will avoid them by going with the older syntax for now all right so any any input you know that you'll have any any ideas in regard to that I'm definitely open open to that so probably at some point maybe tomorrow I'll change the I'll change the syntax but for now we're just gonna we're gonna go ahead and everything we do we're just gonna commit with that no verified flag and I just remembered I'm gonna take a minute here on my other screen to check my mic level I had a comment on one of the recent videos that someone couldn't hear me so I'm gonna doublecheck okay looks like the level the level it should be fine so my output volume is all the way up on for the settings for my Mac and also for the settings in OBS so I'm not exactly sure what was happening but I don't think there's anything else I can do about it on my end so let me know if the sounds alright for you all but I definitely I wanted to at least check it out double check and make sure it wasn't it wasn't anything that I was going wrong so let me check the live chat quickly just say hello to everyone before we get into the coding I'll bring over the Pomodoro timer and I also want to apologize yesterday I had said that the the secondary stream on Instagram would be available to view for 24 hours afterwards and it wasn't so I got some sort of error and it said that the stream wasn't available I think it was because I waited too long to hit the share button because it's happened to me at least one time before so I apologize for that if anybody was looking for the stream and couldn't find it I'll try to remember to hit that share button right away this time okay so Sebastian in the in the live chat is saying pray for Barcelona so if I remember correctly Sebastian your you are in in Spain right not correct so anyway yeah definitely yeah I'll keep keep Barcelona in my prayer is everybody affected by by what happened it happened today so I I just I read a little bit about it earlier so from what I understand correct me if I'm wrong someone drove a car into a group of people or a van so I didn't get to see what the if there were you know casualties from that I am assuming that at the very least there's some serious injuries so that's about all I know about it but yeah definitely I will I'll be praying for everybody okay cool so so but Sebastian is in Spain but not close to Barcelona so well I'm glad to hear that you're all right Sebastian and yeah so anyway so anyway everybody watching who who engages in prayer definitely definitely be good to get some prayers going for that situation alright so for same ones oh goodness Sebastian says that the reports are saying that they're anywhere from 1 to 13 people deceased from from what had happened so I'm gonna take just a second to pray silently for those people just all right okay let's see we try to go all uh I'm gonna get started now and I guess if anybody's tracking what's happening if there's anything like any you know important news or anything comes up about that you know keep us uptodate I'm not I'm not going to be able to follow it while I'm doing the stream but just have had a few kind of basic questions that I'll answer now since they're at the top of the stream I don't want to lose them later on braxton ask Jeff see if you completed the free code camp course like everything or what parts actually no I haven't completed it so I haven't even finished the front end certificate so I'm slightly ashamed to say that I have not finished that so you know I go through it and you just get usually what happens is I get busy with with work and I just I don't I don't work on it like I should and now that I'm doing the Udacity course the react nanodegree I've been putting off the free code camp stuff so I don't know I don't think I have my free code camp profile linked anywhere right now I probably should do that and then you all can check out my progress I really I do intend on going through the rest of the free code cam at some point but definitely not so after I'm done with my react course which should be I think November I think the course ends in November so it'll be a little while but also okay there's another question but you'll cover that in the live chat so thank you yeah okay so Sebastian that says so you are saying the tests are failing because of newer he s six syntax yes it's actually boa it would be what are they calling es 6 + es 7 so I'm not really sure what at what stage the property initializer syntax is right now I was reading some things about the stage but I think some of the stuff I was reading was old so I'm not sure that it that it's still up to date but but in any case that's basically the the issue alright so for now I want to kind of move forward with with this and you know maybe maybe we'll find a better solution to it but at least for now we can work on this so what I've was working on and what we left off with yesterday was we need to find we need to track the scroll position so we need to know two things we need to know the the position on the page of each one of these there h3 tags so we need to know that position just in terms of I guess they're pixels from the top from the top of the page and then we need to track the scroll position so we could get the scroll position pretty easily so you'd see I just doing some things in the console here so we can do document dot body scroll top okay and this gives us I believe it's the number of pixels from the top that we've scrolled so if you could see we we're at the top it comes back as zero scroll down a bit and comes back 587 so we've got one covered the next thing we need to know is the the position of these elements so actually I had a little trouble so I assumed like hey I can just get the scroll top position of this and they kept returning zero so I looked into it and on mdn I was it was saying basically this doesn't work on every element so if the element is non scrollable or if it has no overflow its scroll top is always zero so I'm just I'm wondering what the kind of what we should do I kind of want to see if I could just change the overflow and make it work in here I didn't really matter I guess what I said it too now we're still getting ya are still getting that so maybe I need to target a different a different element yeah let me try to target a different element that might be the easiest thing to do unless I'm using that close up in the wrong way okay Matt says be careful about using a spy scroll for on page load if you have dynamic data updating the page and it changes the height you might get the wrong body height I should have this page should be alright just in terms of I don't think we'll have any dynamic data for this page it's this is just going to be pretty straightforward but wool I mean we'll we'll see if we have issues with it so let me I'm just going to take this ID and put it on this div just to see if we can get a different result no we're not I I'm wondering if I'm using the wrong thing if this maybe is not what I should be looking for I know I've done all this before I've done it all before but I I I kind of think I did it in jQuery before so I'm not sure that my my old code would be very much help to look it up basically what I'm looking for is I need the the Y position of an element an HTML element on the page mmm get boning box yeah I was each other let's see okay so this is one way to do it okay I there's got to be some way to get right right to this right this is what I want but you would think there would be some way that I could just get this oh well we can do this for now so let's let's move this back onto our h3 so it should work we'll double check make sure that it does work okay that's working so here's what we need to do on on page on component amount we're going to get the values we're gonna these values for each one of those h threes then on scroll we're going to get the user scroll position once the scroll position gets to this top coordinate for one of those sections then we'll change the state so that one of these will be highlighted so let's that's the plan so let's let's do that let's go over to our code and make it a bit bigger and so for now let's see okay so our step index I think our step index just gets a number okay so that's just zero index number so in this case I guess we could just get all the eights trees on the page I was thinking we'd have a different ID for each h3 but I don't know that we don't know that we need to do that oops okay so Matt had typed in a live chat try doing offset height and I had done that before but I kept getting 46 and there's no way that this is 46 pixels from the top so that's why I didn't go with that so maybe I'm doing wrong hey so anyway so aim aim highs here if you're it's been a while how's it going right now we're working on the scroll so we're gonna get the scroll position and we're gonna change basically this it's going to highlight this menu in the side based on what section we're on in the world so you'll be able to click on a section and then it'll take you right to that section actually we will need our anchor tags right because there are our IDs yeah so let's give these IDs sign ahead budget proof services okay now see if we have I don't think we yeah we don't have a component didn't mount in here yet so let's add that in Odin did mount and that's not sure if we'll need that but in terms of being able to access this but we might cements will put it in actually probably will because we need to access state let's see I'm trying to think of a way that I could get all these without having to manually call the get the ID so maybe see that's AG h3 get elements by tag name okay cool so yeah we can get you can just get this and most of the ID ID something okay okay Alberto has given another another option here that we can try out and that might be the winner offset top that's what I think that's what we were looking for so yeah that's what we're looking for so that's the right value Thank You Alberto I knew I knew that there was something that would give us what we wanted so that's it so to get the height or I'm sorry to get the the position of an element in terms of how many pixels from the top it is then offset top is the way to go if you need more information just get bounding client rec will give you a lot of information but we don't need that in our case okay great so all right so here's what I'd like to do I'd like to get when within component did mount I'd like to get all the h3 elements and then save see I guess we could save that as key value pairs with the ID and the whatever value we get from offset top and that should be all the information we need about those those age tags okay does that make sense if not let me let me know in the live chat okay slightly off what we're doing right now but so Patrick has been kind of giving updates on trying to replicate those errors we were talking about at the beginning of the the stream and he couldn't replicate it but then Patrick installed node version eight point four point zero and now the errors are occurring so yeah so that's that's no good I mean anybody that's keeping their stuff up to date is gonna get errors so that's not what we want all right so let's let's go with what's gonna console.log that the double check make sure that that works before we go forward cuz that's pretty important shoot and it's not giving us anything why not the all right either we're doing something wrong maybe it's not the right place to put it I'm I'm not even getting any errors the not really much I can I can do okay now Patrick went back to an earlier version of note he's still getting the heirs yeah it this is it's it's frustrating it was a fresh ending experience for me Sebastian says he's on note eight point two point one and not getting any errors so yeah it's just it it's really difficult to nail down exactly exactly what's going on I mean all I know is that I update and I get the errors and I never got them before all right so good thanks so am i had the suggestion just log a string and see if component did mountain is even getting called and no it's not what what's going on three items in my feelings you're not getting it's it's alright so I'm not seeing anything but I'd saying that I'm having items hidden by filters but I I'm not sure that I have anything filtered maybe this is who knows let's see no that's not all right well for some reason we're not we're not getting component did not see if we can get anything to show up that's that's really odd you all right so not sure I'm not sure why I can't get a console look I'm checking in the live chat now see what would you or thinking Yosef says today no thumbs down we really should celebrate ya know thumbs down yet we'll see I usually always get one or two okay let's see what's going on yeah it should be yeah I mean that this should be what we proposed only to fall whoa okay so that fixed it okay somehow I had I guess turn these off anyway Wow so it looks like this worked so let's see what did I change let's go back to what I initially had to see if it works there we go all right okay never use so this is what is now our we name that headers so we should be able to grab what's that again okay it's just ID so we can grab the ID and then with the ID we could get that what was it offset top yeah we can use offset top to get that value right now the david said it was probably a chrome update or something that caused that it's so annoying when things like that change actually now you say that i did update chrome but yesterday i think i updated on this computer yesterday so that's that's possible because I don't remember changing that but I do remember that I haven't seen any errors in the console for a while so that was probably what all right so now that we've gotten through that kind of a silly silly problem now let's go through us we're gonna do the headers I think with the best way to go through these headers would be we met I guess we could map right oh I know I was corrected in an earlier stream but we can map over an array correct that's the proper use of map I think I tried to map over an object before and that was not the way to do it so Hale says can you invite me to the slack chat I don't think you need an invite you just need the the link correct it should so Blake pasted a link in there in the live chat so if you copy that and then replace the asterisk with asterisk with a period then it should work let me know if that link does not work it says you okay so it does say you need an invite that's weird is anybody else does anyone else have that same issue of needing an invite whoa patrick said linting fixed PR incoming patrick if you really fixed the linting i'm gonna be super happy and like very very impressed because this has been what like we've been streaming for less than an hour and it took me probably fifteen minutes to explain what the problem is so that's very impressive it's like you've you've probably fix this issue in less time than it took me to explain the issue all right here is an invite link to join the slack thing I pasted it in the live chat try that out and let me know if that works alright so anyway where where is that I got distracted okay okay so we want to do in the States it is mmm okay yep I think that's what I want to do so we can check that out nope that's not gonna work all right wait a second yeah it was I I D was the I was there right see is this just a syntax thing did I mess that up at least No it's visited okay maybe do I need do I even need this okay thank you too maybe I didn't need that it's there's my error message this is my error message headers done that it's not a function and today I just can't I can't do anything without getting an error how about it right I say my says do array is array by station let's see let's see Serio give us okay so thanks I'm Berto for that suggestion and then I don't need yeah correct okay just so yeah so then we don't really need when in here I was using the the ID to get that element but since it's returning elements anyway I don't need that I can just go straight to straight to this so okay so still getting this Heather's map that map is not a function I actually was I thinking I didn't want to set up my state like that I wanted to have let's see let's just loop through this in a simple way all right so I'm gonna be oldfashioned here for for a second yeah did I mess up in a forloop I'm pretty sure I did not mess up the forlán yeah it's your iteration condition uh I did myself a for loop I'm very so good good look it up man I just that may be my most embarrassing moment on a live stream that I I messed up a for loop by putting the putting the greater than sign instead of the less than sign it's not like I haven't done that before but I've never done that live on YouTube alright I just looked over at my analytics for this video I was expecting everybody to just quit watching at this point but it looks like it didn't happen okay Matt said you might be able to use a for each loop instead of for loop yeah I figured I could use something else but I just thought like I'm just gonna go like to the simplest thing I can think of just to test it out so that could probably be refactored I'm actually I'm still not exactly sure why I couldn't get mapped to work I I don't know so does doesn't matter for loops are fun so hey look we have all the values that we want now we just need to put that I'm gonna put that in state so that we can can access that actually doing need that in state let me think about our next step needs to be so now that we can get we can get that we need to compare waste we need have us scroll handler to listen for the scrolls and then compare okay yes so probably in scroll position should also be in state and we could just start that at zero because that's probably where it'll be anyway okay let's get rid of a lot of this so I'm just thinking of trying to think ahead trying to think if I even need the the IDs to be in state I'm not sure if I'd I need them to be in stay right now and their positions okay so Tomer Hey welcome I don't know that I've seen you in the live chat before but welcome and also a good call so summer says document dog get elements by tag name returns an HTML collection not an array that probably explains why I couldn't use map so thank you for that sebastian is also saying could you do something like this if the scroll position of the first h 3 is less than X set step index to 1 which is the first step if the second H 3 is less than X set step index to 2 and so on yeah yeah Sebastian that's I think that's the way to go John also asked our props not usually the way to go first before using state I keep seeing this so I'm not sure John I'm actually I I frequently do you state just two stores store data in state and I don't know that I necessarily need to I guess I don't really know what the the best way to do it is but with some some things obviously you do want to be in state like if you want if you want things to happen when values change then she put it in state what they're doing what's the the new what's it called the new es6 syntax is a spread operator can I use that in this case to add things on I just kind of freaked I forget what the sin let me look up the syntax on the other screen because it would be cool to use this properly in the video I was just I was just going over this fright night does it maybe like two weeks ago I was going over this so I don't use it often enough to remember how to use it it's something like this right it's really we want to combine combined arrays so I guess I could just say that and see I'm pretty sure that's not all that I need but let's see yeah oh yeah cuz I'm not this this is not an array so I guess I could just go with whoops that's not oh cool Andrew says in the official documentation Facebook has a great section on how to determine when you'll need state it really helped make sense of things for me all right good to know so if you're curious about when to you state and when not to you state check that out I made I should probably check that out as well since since I'm not able to really explain how I decide when to you state and when not to you state then I think I need more information on that I mistake he need to okay cool can cateye good thanks Sebastian that was exactly what I needed I was thinking in my head like what is it do I use push or pop or what you know those are things to handle a raise and I'm trying to remember what's the one that would add it to the end but this works this well yes loose what you know come on what is going on here this is like okay that's it King cab returns an array which does not use AIDS Day all right let's see I'm getting some some suggestions here in the live chat so let me go through some of these by Patrick says can Cat returns an array thereby not mutating state and you just build the array in the for loop and then add it to state all right cool I'm Barrett oh yeah that makes a lot of sense all right cool let's do that so I don't remember if I read America's coming out loud or not but I'm better just said why not just create the array in the loop and then add the array after that to state and that that that makes a lot of sense so let's do that way what was Sebastian say okay Sebastian says do do the same as in component we'll update next crops next state and then consider position from next state yeah you need to set the state outside of the loop yeah all right let's get this out of here okay okay sorry I'm not usually accused of talking too much in my streams I feel like I'm not really saying very much of all what I'm typing so anyway what so what I'm doing here is we have basically we've made an empty array here that's our header positions that's going to hold our values inside this loop we are pushing the values here our offset top values into the array so then we're gonna call this set state and let's see we don't need this anymore we need header positions is going to be their positions okay so you need to do right and probably don't need to initialize that into right let me just see what it says first Oh didn't get an error that's a good sign really sweet look at that no dang it it's not the right values okay but we have something all right so we've successfully put something into state all right man this is this has been rough this it's like every single step something goes wrong all right so why why is this happening he had a position oh because I put zero and I needed I alright that's I'm happy about that that's easy to fix yeah there we go right so here's all our positions wonderful so just just in case you didn't fall along this maybe especially if you're new to JavaScript the the error that I was having was that I I put 0 here which was giving me the first element in our headers array and then getting the offset top of that element which is why we had the same value for each one what I needed to do was put I here right and I is going to be 0 1 2 3 4 each time this loop goes it's gonna go up by 1 and that gave us the value that we needed ok wonderful are you haven't looked at the live chat for a few minutes and the did you tell someone that I'm using notepad yeah okay so Sebastian said doing it like I'm doing now I don't need this yeah you're right I didn't I don't need these and okay I figured I may have left the console log in there as well but I think I got them all out Oh slip slip sack no had he caught my my error with putting the the zero in here instead of the ISO thanks for catching that sorry I didn't look over and see it so you must have caught that right away so guess good job on that okay so sue sahib is saying I'm not understanding anything anybody who can help alright so I'm not I'm not exactly sure what your level of understanding is in terms of like JavaScript or react or anything so I'm not exactly sure where to start but we're using a JavaScript framework called react to build this so it's not exactly just plain JavaScript but within this what we're doing here is mostly just plain JavaScript and that we're just grabbing the header tags all of the header tags on the page we have this gives us an array of the the elements or not exactly an array but this gives us all our elements and then we're just looping through those elements and we want to get the position of each of those elements on the page in terms of how many pixels from the top of the page it is so that's where that offset top is so we now have an array called header positions it gives us the position from the top in pixels of each one of the h3 elements on our page and our page being this page so these are h3 s and we have four h3 s right and then this is the react part of it all this was just regular JavaScript the react part is that were only set state right which our state is up here and we're going to set this portion of our state which is header positions we're going to set that equal to our header positions that we've put in here and this is block scoped right so it's not we're not going to be able to access this anywhere else in terms of this this variable but we will be able to access it through state all right so that's what we've got now the whole point of getting that I'm not sure if you've been watching the whole time or not so you may not have heard towards the beginning but the whole point of getting that is that we want to be able to track where a user is on the page as they scroll down and then show that visually by highlighting this menu over here which we haven't each one of these menu items is going to correspond to one of these H tags so as the user Scrolls the corresponding section here will be highlighted and they can click to go to whatever section they want so that's that's I guess where we're at so hopefully that made more sense of this for you all right good all right so I have not taken a break since we started well almost since we started to look at the live chat so I'm gonna do that even though I remembered to pull this over on my screen I never started it so let's take a fiveminute break I'm gonna go to the live chat see if I missed any questions and to be honest with you I need the 5minute break right now because we just I don't want to say we but I just struggled through that that was that was rough it was it was rough on my my mental stamina here so I can feel like I just need a small break and then we'll we'll get back to it okay going through I guess I didn't miss miss many questions here in the lab chat so that's good Ali asked a while ago if there are good resources for people who are not too new who are not too new with JavaScript sebastian recommended free code camp yeah that would be my recommendation to free code camp code Academy has some introductory JavaScript courses that you can do and then Udacity has some free internet introductory JavaScript courses as well so those would be my main suggestions if you like reading more than like the handson stuff then the book you don't know j/s is available for free it's all on github so you can you know read through that that whole book for free that's that's really good it's more like a series not just one book but those would be my recommendations okay okay I mentioned earlier we were talking about Wendy you state and when not to use state and I had seen so Andrew had said that there's a great section in the react documentation on that and then I didn't see his followup comment which was the section is called thinking in react so if you want to go right to that section check it out thinking and react is the place to go John Hanson has a question this is what about media queries that can change a component would it be better to associate that with props or state yes well I guess if we're using media queries then that would be in CSS so if it's a CSS change I don't it doesn't necessarily need to be in props or state that would that would just be handled with the media queries in CSS so now if you wanted I guess if you wanted to use JavaScript to check the width of the page and then do things based on that then I I would if if I were using javascript to check the width of the screen and then let's say every time the whiff changed you know it updates those values then I would say the the screen width which should be in state right the value of the width of screen should be in state it should update every time the window has changed the window width has changed I suppose I mean I guess that would be a lot of a lot of changes maybe you wouldn't want to update every time yeah that be I guess I'm just not sure I'm trying to think of a situation where you would want to do it that way instead of using just regular CSS media queries I'm sure they exist I'm just having trouble thinking about it a situation like that right on the spot at some point hold on I have a knock at the door I'll be right back so make sure okay I'm back sorry about the little silent few minutes there but when was the head of my department when the head of the department knocks on my door I kind of have to take that so and that was in regard to our last project the catechetical Institute site so I guess I'll be working on some updates to that starting October 1st so we'll be going back to that and hopefully making it better we'll see we'll see what the requested updates are okay see all right so I've just seen Sebastian I've seen your latest comments here saying when I click the link in seek common Markov terms for more information for some reason I'm scrolled in the middle of that page seems that depending on your scroll position and planning guide you did a different scroll position in glossary yeah that's that's not what we want and that's that's odd and so this that's that's really odd behavior I would think the default behavior for react router actually let's see if am I using the link there properly okay I am just linked to glossary all right you would think the default behavior would be to scroll up to the top of the page has anyone had any experience with this using react router where it does not scroll to the top of the page I mean an easy way to fix this would just be to scroll the page to the top automatically on component and it mount but there there's got to be something in react router about this let's see I'm just going to add this okay okay Matt said I ran into a similar issue and used window scroll top or window dot scroll to zero zero zero on route change okay cool that's what I was well I mean that's what I was thinking about doing in component did mount but you can do that I'll just have to look it up to do that on a route change like I'm assuming there's like a callback for route change where you could do that in with react router so mandela mandela effect conference asks how did some of you guys posting learn react for us noob so i guess that's not directed at me it's directed at you all in the end a live chat so let's he lets you handle that i think I think I've explained this before I'm sure how I've learned places where I've learned react from so unless you all have in the live chat have a turn now all right where we at let's see we have we need to get that some values in that side navigation the secondary navigation now okay so I guess this is where we're gonna do whatever we need to do so index okay so we still need a we need to check for this scroll all right so I have to check the okay so what we want to do inside component did mount we're gonna call track scroll and when we're tracking the scroll we want to add an event listener okay so we want to we already added this escape right yeah and how are we getting this girl position before was document.body scroll table yeah yes that's where we don't all right let's see if this works this state there's not as much see okay yeah matt said d balance that function yeah I definitely I don't want to leave it like this I just wanted to see if it worked but yeah you definitely don't want to run that every single time that there's any activity on the scroll so let me see something so inside here this is not this is not this it's not working so can I turn this I suppose if I use an arrow function then I would have access to it so we can change this too see oops okay Matt Matt's pasting in a bunch of stuff here so I just saw that Matt alright so let me let me go through okay sis it's a lot of stuff going on let me taste some of this so thank you bet alright so we had a handle scroll and then whoops here we go okay I think I got that copied over correctly in the right place so I guess we should let me check to make sure I did it right and it works and then we'll all explain what's going on oops I did not bring in do you sure I know I'm bringing this in somewhere else let me there we go okay great okay so let's inspect this and check the state and they're really scroll position okay so it's actually it's updating scroll while which is fine so let's get rid of scroll position here well we can why okay so that works let me explain what's going on alright so the first thing that happens and component did mount it calls track scroll track scroll then adds an event listener so that every time the user Scrolls this this happens right but then we're using D bounce from low right which is a JavaScript library so we've imported D bounce from low basically what this is doing is making sure that this handle scroll does not get called constantly so this is a 300 millisecond delay try think this there's a couple of different ways aside from so like there's D balance and I think there's throttle I can't remember for sure the difference in terms of what it when it's calling this but basically it's just going to make sure that this doesn't fire all the time so when handle scroll does get called then it's going to set the state and it's going to set scroll why because it's the Y position right to whatever is window dot scroll Y and we can see in our state oops so in our state we have the scroll wide position and let's see if I get these both on the screen at once we should be able to see a change as we scroll there we go okay so there's a scroll actually I don't think we want to use debounce we want to use so if I remember correctly now debounce waits until the action has been done so in this case it'll wait from the time I stop scrolling 300 milliseconds but I would like this to change as the scroll occurs so what we should do is should use something else so I think we can use throttle and let me I'm double checking on my other screen here yeah I think throttle is the better way to go so so debounce what it's going to do is so as I'm scrolling there's a bunch of actions going on it's going to group all those actions into one so you can see now that I stopped it's it's grouped all that it's only fire that once what throttle is going to do is it's going to make sure that it only fires let's say every 300 milliseconds but every 300 milliseconds it will check that scroll position so it's so I will get more of what we want if we're gonna use throttle so let's see I think we've got today where are we bringing the best does create react app come with with low because I'm not seeing it that's let's see if that works yeah that's there we go all right CeCe this is giving us let's see if I can get it to do so as I'm scrolling you see it's updating and I'm not stopped so that's more what we want once we get once we have the changes reflected here we'll be able to see if we need to set in terms of the delay in milliseconds you know maybe we need to go lower to make it you know more smooth we'll see okay but basically that's if you're going to use D bounce or throttle that's like debounce is really good like if you wanted to like do validation on an input field you would want to wait until the user has stopped typing right see you know you don't want like the error message to pop up right in the middle of what they're typing right you you want to wait because let's say like for the email address for instance right if they haven't got to the point where they typed like the at and then the domain obviously anything is that's going to be invalid so it would be annoying to show this you want to wait until they've stopped let's say for 300 milliseconds because at that point they've you know they're either thinking or they're probably done but in the case of scrolling in this case of scrolling since we want it to be like more a fluid thing that it will highlight as we're scrolling we wanted to go with throttle so that we know that it'll keep firing so anyway so hopefully this I've kind of feel like that's the most intelligent thing I've done this entire stream is explain the difference between throttle and D valves so that also said correctly that we need to unbind or remove the eventlistener so let's do that as well so component did unmount nice fellow impunity okay so on component did unmount we want to remove that event listener right so we we don't want that if we're not on this view there's no reason to have that going right so let's remove that so cease what I need to put I need to put do I need to put the rest alright let let me know if I need to put the rest of this for it to accurately remove it or not else component will I'm not all right so let's see let's check our lifecycle methods for rewrites see which one we want there is no component did unmount yes I guess we just need component will unmount which is cool since do we have it already no we don't oh we have component will mount all right we'll we'll announce that was a pretty useful error message that are actually it said exactly what we needed we needed to use okay The Times all right so at this point yeah at this point I'm not sure if I want to go ahead and try to implement this whole thing because we've been going for over two hours and I'm starting to get pretty hungry and I've used up a lot of my brainpower struggling through all the errors I was getting so I suspect at this point my my work is going to become the quality of my work is going to lessen as I keep trying to get past this point of being mentally exhausted and hungry so I think now would be a good time to finish for today and I'll answer any questions I'll try to scroll up a bit see if there any questions but in terms of the code I think we'll finish for today all I'll commit this so that you all can see it in github and I mean we've got a significant way a significant portion of this finished the rest of the steps would then be you know now that we have this simply comparing our values you know our Y position our header positions and then changing the step index based on that and then once we do that then we can do things based on the step index within here those things being highlight the correct I'm sorry this is what happens when we click on it actually so in here this is where we would want to actually scroll to the place that that we should be scrolling to but on scroll depending on the comparison of our Y position and our header positions we're gonna highlight something different here so those are the next steps we'll get to that either I may just finish us this up tomorrow morning and then just show what I've done we'll see unless something comes up and I can't get to it then we'll just work on it during the stream tomorrow but if you don't want to stick around for the question/answer thanks for watching and thanks for all your help I really appreciate that I'm actually a decent number of years stick around to this point so thank you thank you for that it's been long and somewhat difficult today now so I'm gonna scroll up a bit so I did get most of the way through all right I'm gonna call them you see I said I don't think there's any question so I'm gonna take this phone call and I will see you all tomorrow thank you so much for watching
