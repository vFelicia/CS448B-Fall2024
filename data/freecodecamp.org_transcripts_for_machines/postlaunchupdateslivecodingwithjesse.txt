hey everybody uh so yesterday at around 800 pm finally got this site launched T out I had I think I had a total of four hours of live streaming yesterday and uh spent a lot of time I got in at 8 a.m. and I left at 900 p.m. so it's a pretty epic day of uh of getting this site ready I hope I don't have to do that again anytime soon and uh I'm still still a little bit sick uh so my voice is not not exactly normal right now so sorry for that but I got my Trello board up right now and um somebody typed in the in the live okay sorry I was a little confused my analytics were showing that basically nothing was happening and nobody was watching which is weird because I had people waiting okay um so I got my Trello board up here just to show you last night when I left these were all clear I had nothing in in this ready for development section I had nothing in this section so just from the emails that I got this morning when I got in these were all filled up and I've already knocked some of them out i' I've done some of them uh so I got in a little bit later than normal today slept in a little bit um so a lot of the changes are not really like a big deal some of them were just like a typo here or there probably the one that was the biggest deal was uh there were a couple of links that were going to the wrong places that's that's kind of a big deal it looks like maybe I um like I skipped I was just copy and pasting links and I think I skipped like one link and just kept going and so the last like three in a row were off by one so got that one fixed that was that was important to fix um the other ones I think I pushed that live with with some um some edits to the text all this other stuff is not like a huge deal except for this part so I have these in the end progress and this is what I want to try to accomplish at least most of this today uh I'm not going to put in a full day today because I I put in so much extra time this week uh so I'll probably have a short stream today and then uh get out uh a little bit early all right hey hey to everybody in the in the live chat okay now we've got now it's saying 45 viewers that's that's up closer to what what we normally have I think I have had over a hundred concurrent viewers at once before but I usually hover like around 50 I think um so I've been working on resizing images so I want to show you some some stuff some crazy stuff so I've been having adventures with image resizing uh so I'm going to pull this over and it's going to be hard to see so let me let me try to zoom in no that's there we go I'm G try to zoom this as much as I possibly can so you guys can see when I do the zoom like this I can't see the live chat or anything else so um I won't be able to see anything while we're while I'm I'm zoomed like this um okay so this is that big image on the homepage and I'll I'll read this all out in case you can't see it because it's kind of small um is 2.1 megabytes of an image on the the homepage just by converting it from a ping to a JPEG we've bought that down to 184 kilobytes so that's that's pretty good uh conversion not bad I haven't even compress this and I haven't even attempted to resize it I'm a little bit nervous to resize this because I worked on the positioning so much I don't want to mess it up but for now um that's a big Improvement and it's going to be an even bigger one once I compress it uh also I have I have an even bigger one here so on on the page for um the court or for the events this was a ping 2.9 megabytes like that's crazy like I have whole sites like the homepage on a site that the entire page is less than that so that's crazy so just by changing this into a JPEG I got it down to 598 kilobytes and that's uncompressed so that's pretty awesome the other one that was a weird format and really surprising to me was this so this is a gif and I I don't know why this was in GIF format uh that's just it's weird to me why would I don't know why you'd use a gif unless you wanted it to be animated um maybe I'm just missing something but it was it was only 170 kiloby not nearly as bad as as these other ones so I expected that it would actually go down uh in in size when I converted it to a JPEG but it didn't it actually went up that was really surprising so then I went ahead and optimized it and I got it down to 104 so from 170 to 104 that's a decent uh decrease there uh but that was just kind of weird um so good to know a gif that's just a static image not animated gif is you know when you're talking about uncompressed it actually ends up being smaller than a JPEG so that's all I'm doing I'm also resizing some some things so I left I didn't delete the um the original versions yet because I wanted to show you this image is on the homepage look how huge it is 3,840 pixels wide okay so and that's it's actually not that it's only 270 kilobytes so compared to these the some of these other ones we were loading it's not as nearly as bad but that is just a huge huge image so um so resized that to 700 and look at that I haven't even compressed it yet and I got it down to 14 kilobytes so much better I'll show you uh where that was on the on the site let me bring this over so that gigantic picture was just this at no point does this image ever get wider than 700 pixels and we had it at over 3,000 so the images that I had on the site were embarrassingly large and uh normally I would never put images that large on a site but when I got them I was so rushed I just whatever images I got I didn't I didn't even look at the size I just threw them on the site just to get them on there and have something to look at and then when it came down to it yesterday just ran out of time and didn't get to compress them so today I'm compressing them so sorry to anybody who tried to view this uh using your data plan on your phone uh I probably cost you you know a dollar or something trying to load this page all right let me check the live chat real quick since I got the uh the view back to normal all right someone ask can you just speak out my name please okay I'll try my best to say your name say it's SSAT day I'm not sure uh let me know if I did write on the pronunciation um I really do try to pronounce the everybody's names properly everybody always pronounces my name wrong so I'm I'm definitely aware of that um okay uh Melissa says what if you need to preserve transparency they're talking about the um uh the file formats so um yeah if you have so normally like a ping can have transparency and um a gif uh can have transparency I'm yeah I'm almost positive it can have transparency uh but normally if I wanted transparency I would just go with the Ping uh I don't know why that's just like always what what I've had to work with um although it does kind of seem like maybe the if the GF has transparency too maybe that would be a smaller file format I don't know I'll have to look into that um some of them uh I didn't really need them to be transparent anymore uh so I just converted them into jpegs cuz it would be smaller than a ping uh so if they were on like if I could convert them to a JPEG from a transparent background and they were going to be on white anyway and I'd keep the white background then it would work I don't I don't need the transparency the same way there was um some of them are on a black background I don't need um I didn't need to keep the uh transparency for for that but actually I probably I see what you're saying with that um this uh sandano uh GIF that we just looked at I forgot to check and see if it converted it to a black background or a white background some of them were converting black some were white I don't know why uh this one did white I might not be able to use it if anybody know I'm using image magic on the command line to convert the and I'll I'll bring over my command line in a second and show you how I'm doing this if anybody knows why sometimes I'm getting white backgrounds when I trans when I go from uh like a transparent format like a gif or ping to jpeg sometimes it's black sometimes it's white I don't know why if you know how I can set that let me know because that would be helpful and especially like I need this one to have a black background and it would work and there are some logos here that I need to have white backgrounds but they're giving me black sorry yeah Melissa is saiding y in the live chat um Melissa was basically like answering me and and I wasn't looking because I had my screen uh zoomed in on everything uh a few minutes ago and I couldn't I couldn't see the live chat so uh Sam says ping has better compression okay how you manage to get all your mails directly to Trello board all right somebody asked how I managed to get all my mails directly to Trail board um I'm not exactly sure what you're saying I um did I meant did I say somebody emails so the mail the emails didn't come directly in I just basically checked my emails and uh sorted them out into these so I I typed these out the emails didn't go directly in there although that would be cool if I could wout my emails directly in the tro I probably could do that with zapier uh just set up a task to um check my email and put it direct directly in a trailer board but all right let's uh let's do some some comp I think out of all this list probably the thing that's the most interesting right now that needs done is is this image stuff uh and that's just because um if if you're not that good with Photoshop like me then it's a lot easier to just use the command line to edit your images so I'm going to show you how I'm doing that here I did do a video a while ago on image compression so if you saw that some of this is going to be the same but I I am going to show how to resize which I didn't show that on uh on that video so I've got this I just sorted things out by um like subfolders inside my image folder on my local version of the site just to keep things organized for me and then I can see how it looks and move it into the main folder later on I I'll clean it up and getting rid of all these sub folders uh before I push this uh to the server so basically I'm going through the the homepage everything's already good I I still need to get a black background version of this that's may be a JPEG this is not really a huge file I'm not super concerned but um I want to try to get as small as I can all right so this image was really big and now it's now it's smaller let's take a at these ones uh so man I go through and expect it I I have the files locally but you know otherwise you could just go inev tools and inspect okay see this picture naturally it's saying it's let me blow this up a little bit so you can see um it's saying that naturally this is 755 pixels wide but it's only displaying at 371 so that's a little bit wider than we need uh on my other screen I'm going to find this image real quick and move it to the folder the resize folder oh wow it's actually even larger uh than that it's um it's saying here with it's 1,400 pixels wide that's way bigger than we need all right so let me let me drop this in the resize folder and then we will resize it right on the command line and I might as well drop these two in as well so these ones that I've already resized in the folder I'm going to get rid of and I'm I'm doing this on my other screen so you can uh don't worry if you're not seeing it it's just literally I'm I'm moving them to the trash okay okay uh Patrick said he just looked it up try the um the background option so I can pass a flag as a background and pass it the color oh awesome uh let me finish getting these uh these images in the right folder first and then I'm going to try what what Patrick just uh suggested thank you for looking that up that's awesome if if you've ever seen the image magic documentation it's like super thorough but it is it's like trying to just take a dictionary and start reading it I mean it's there's so much um it's just it's hard to go through it it it's easier to try to find something on sack overflow than to go through that documentation uh okay pet oh man yeah we we definitely need to resize these images uh this one here is over 2,000 pixels wide um and then we have one more okay yeah and that that third one also needs resize that's over th pixels okay so let me let's check out our um our folder that we're doing for conversion so I'm going to go out hopefully um let me know oops let me know if you can't see uh this command line stuff right here if it needs to be bigger um I'm going to go into this folder I mean you don't necessarily have to be in the folder you could do the command uh and just go that path but it's easier uh to see what's going on like this uh convert there we go okay so we have our original sandano um GIF okay and that's what we want to have a black background so we're going to do convert and um we're going to use what was it background let me see where where was Patrick's helmet background and how do we get pass to the color we just do a space and pass it is that I didn't actually see documentation we'll try it like this this is a copy anyway if I mess it up but it's no big deal um so can I just pass black do I have to use a hex color um we'll just try it with black for now um and we'll go um the sandano GIF and then we want to convert that to the JPEG and we'll just we'll just overwrite that other one all right let's see what happened nope all right I'll have to look that one up but it's good to know now I know what to look up I'll look up the background option and see exactly how to do it all right Melissa says she's a Photoshop girl doesn't understand the programming yet uh command line is very interesting yeah um that's cool I have there's a guy that that works with me that is really awesome with Photoshop uh but he's on vacation this week so that's why normally I wouldn't even be doing all this stuff I would maybe just run like a batch compression uh for the command line on the whole like all my images but that would be it and he would handle everything else um so oh thank you Melissa Melissa said the website is beautiful uh thanks uh the code editor is Adam a I always do that uh people ask questions in the live chat and then uh they get answered like in the next line but I don't read ahead before I answer uh mobin ask aren't there tools to automatically do that uh yeah basically um there are tools I I've had um I've used gulp before and I've set it up to just use um image magic like when I do my build process it just goes in and resizes and optimizes all my images for me it works really well when you have a lot of images that are all going to be like a standard width and so you know what but if you have lots of different size images it's not quite as easy so I didn't set that up with this project cuz I'm using webpack and uh and I'm not using gulp I'm not nearly as knowledgeable about web pack and I'm not comfortable yet doing stuff like that probably I need to make like an just an npm script or something to do it but at this point there are not that many images so it's not a big deal to just do it uh by hand and if you're using a Content management system like WordPress you upload a file it does all the resizing for you uh someone asked is this python uh no um this is well right now I'm on the command line um and then the code over here is this is CSS and we've got HTML mixed in with JavaScript here uh it's a particular JavaScript framework called react so that's what we're working with um let's see oh uh Jac Jac Simon is that how you pronounce that Jac okay um sorry if I mispronounce it Jock's new to coding uh he loves free code Camp awesome Sam has a site uh he can um run uh images through for compression okay cool Melissa did ask about the programs I'm using I do have links to all of them in the um in the description so check out the description uh this is Adam this is my text editor I'm using the set theme that's s TI uh people are always interested in a theme and I don't have that listed this is iterm 2 I'm using for the terminal and then you know this is just Dev tools that comes with uh Chrome uh and then my project management stuff in the background is Trello all right so let me show you um how I'm resizing these images so I'm going to go back into the resize folder um and I'll show you I have those three images that we were looking at let me let me bring up the site so we can see it uh and the cool part is going to be to compare this local version to the version that's live after we do these compressions and we can actually just see like what the size of that page is in terms of like megabytes and there there'll be a significant uh difference that'll help with load times too um the site seems really fast like faster than it should be because it's prefetching a lot of stuff in the background and we're using a service worker uh but it's still loading more than I want it to load you just don't notice it as much uh since we set it up like this so I'm going to go in and uh we're going to use a command called mriy okay so this is from image magic 2 it's just like pretty much just like using the convert command except this is when you want to do like a batch conversion so we're going to do that and we're going to use the flight resize and I'm going to pass in well we need to see what we want how big we want these to be so basically I'll just check and I'm just going to insc this and see how big this is we have 409 pixels across and you want to try out because when we go down lower these are going to be full width and so I just want to make sure this might actually be our largest size the other one was what 204 oh and this one is let's see five 37 yeah 537 across I'm going to make these 600 I like to go a little bit over um it just gives us some leeway in case in case I missed something like I missed a break point or something where it was bigger I just round up a little bit uh so we're going to go 600 if you just type in one number into this command uh then it's just the width and it keeps your aspect ratio and changes the height height in proportion so that's what we want and the last thing I need to do is tell it uh what type of files I wanted to do this on let me let me make sure I get this um this is right okay um so we're going to use an asterisk and we're going to say all these are jpegs right yep okay so I'm going to bring over my my files again and I'm going to do a zoom again and we're going to see let me bring this oops that's not it is it a shoot I grabbed the wrong image I have to do it um one more time but the um the zoom feature on a I'm not great with okay here we go this is what I want you to see we're at 600 now so all these that were in this folder are now at 600 I didn't really want this one in here we'll just delete that what I really wanted so we we'll take these and um we're just going to move them in here into this folder and I'll say yeah I want them to replace that and that's it they're already replaced um I I have backups all these somewhere so I'm comfortable just kind of doing that and then but we missed an image we missed uh what was it the father Nathan's image where was that there it was yeah so this one's still huge yep let's just do a conversion right there in place on that all right so we're going to do just the the one picture version of this 600 and we're going to go if we wanted to do it just on one image father Nathan uh jpeg that's how we do it I'm not going to change the name I just wanted to convert that one oops I thought I thought that was the image name right we just had it there did I miss something or is that yeah that's it H that's really weird not sure what's going on there I'll work on that later maybe the syntax is different when you're trying to do one image um not sure about that um I'm I'm going to check the live chat I'm kind of having like a relaxed day yesterday was insane so uh a little bit more slow paac than normal uh live stream uh someone's I I mentioned I use I term and uh naine says it's only for Mac with a frowny face so yeah it's only for Mac I forget there's something for PC that um what do I use on my PC shoot I can't remember I'm sorry there's something like it term for the PC I just can't remember what it is I haven't worked I have a PC at home uh but I haven't worked on it for a long time I usually just use my um my MacBook okay so somebody asked what what did I miss so far um basically we're just going over uh image resizing and um image conversions and I'm going to show some image compression here in a minute and then uh then I'm going to kind of wrap it up I'll just you know go to the live chat and um and wrap it up uh shoot I totally forgot I wanted to show another uh video interview from the the conference I was at last week but I I totally forgot I'll have to remember and do it on Monday um because I want to make sure I um I tag that person uh on Twitter tter when I when I do the interview all right so let me just show you how I do these uh compressions then uh let's find an image that's pretty big so that we can do a nice a nice compression on so which one was big all right let's try Okay this monstrance image is huge it's 848 kilobytes so let's compress this thing so I'm going to go I keep I keep these um in my my Google keep in a note there uh so I can just copy and paste them real quick because they're way too long for me to remember so I'm going to go right in here and I'm going to copy that now this is crazy long I'll go through it in in just a second so we're using convert so this is just the single file version of this there's a a batch version and then there's a recursive version you can do on multiple folders which is really cool uh for now I'm just going to show this if you look at my video from a couple weeks ago on image um compression I think I went through all of them even the the uh more advanced ones so we're just going to do strip that's stripping out all like the metad data that we don't need some of these I'm going to be honest with you I don't know what they all do I just um I found this online somewhere and I can't remember where I wish I could remember because I would I would you know give the link and give credit for this but I've actually seen this in a couple of plac places so I'm not really sure where it originated from so basically these are all just various quality 85 this is about the only one I can understand the strip and the quality 85 uh percent I'm not sure what the other ones do because I'm not really into uh you know images and stuff so these ones at the end this is the one that you want to convert and this is what you want it to be named after you converted okay so that's it so let me go here and uh what was that M Mo here we go monstrance uh this is like kind of a basic command line thing but if you don't know all I typed was n and I knew there were no there's only one file in that folder that starts with m Mo so I just hit Tab and it autoc completed the rest for me so that saves a lot of time typing so if you only remember one thing from today's stream remember that and it'll save you so much time and I I just want it to be called the same thing sometimes I put like op at the end so I know that I can pressed it but um I just want this to to go in actually yeah I do want to compare it let's put the dash op just just so that we can compare the sizes just for uh for demonstration purposes okay so now it won't before it would have overwritten uh that that file now it won't all right and that's it let's let's check it out let's see what see what happened here okay so we have this one is 2,000 I'll zoom in a little bit so still a big image 2000 you know with but 848 kilobytes now let's check out how we did here there we go 429 9 kiloby so we got that thing down um almost half almost halfway down and considering where we started so this is what's on the live site right now this gigantic thing that's what 2 point it just going off the edge at 2.1 megabytes and now we're down we've got down to 429 kilobytes so that's what less than 25% of the size of that that's huge um so that's a huge Improvement on that image it's still a bigger bigger image than I would like to load but I'm I'm happy with that that's a pretty big Improvement and we can go back here and you know let's go back into this page Oops I meant to go to the homepage we'll go back into the homepage just to show that there's no loss of quality I think my server first again sorry whoa you okay can't appear as a descendant of actually got a legit warning that's weird oh UL cannot appear as a descendant of P we have to change that we did that yesterday um let's see if this work no it's still not working if you guys watched yesterday I was trying to I just put a a UL like an unordered list inside of a P tag and uh I wasn't sure what would happen I just wanted to see uh if it would work and evidently it it's giving me a warning so maybe I want to fix that it's not like breaking anything yet it's just a warning but I don't I don't want like a later update to you know break anything so basically here's that image uh all compressed and converted and compressed um these ones the same thing significantly uh resize down I'm going to bring in the this is the live site that has the UN uncompressed unres versions and we're going to look at them side by side just to show that there's really like no noticeable difference in quality all right so let's go up here I mean I see you know I can't tell the difference I don't know if you all can tell I mean I'll get we'll Zoom really close I mean even zoomed in look at that crazy this image on the left is less than 25% the size than this image on the right is and they look identical uh that's just awesome so no perceptible loss of quality okay and these ones will be you'll see the same thing same way zoom in on these this one you can actually see a bit let me show it looks to me like you can when you zoom in you can definitely see because of the letters so you definitely can see it on that one let's zoom out and see so I'm not that worried about people zooming in but yeah zoomed out it looks good but yeah you can if you look really closely you can tell there's a difference on these images so they don't look pixelated or anything but there's a slight change but you know once again we got a big Improvement on these from resizing these so I'll may maybe I'll look at them again sometime and see if I need to make make them a little bit uh larger but I mean these are 700 you know pixels in width and these boxes are not nearly 700 pixels so they should be fine all right um I'm going to go I'm going to check the live chat I'm gonna you know I'm going to wrap this up I'm not going to go really long today since I went so long yesterday so let me go to the live chat I'm going to answer all your questions now if you don't want to stick around for the for the questions uh that's cool uh I'll I'll be back oh maybe not Monday Monday's a holiday here um in the United States so I won't be working and I'll probably be at a picnic at my grandfather's house so I'll see you on Tuesday and um but if you want to stick around for question and answer go ahead and throw some questions in the live chat uh and I'm going to I'm going to keep going till I get to the bottom um and unless there's just an insane amount of questions then I'll have to cut it off but I'll keep going so I get to the bottom answer the questions uh as best I can all right so I'm I'm way I'm kind of back like halfway up the chat now uh I stopped where when Sam was talking about image compression the site where you can just drag and drop files right on the site I do use those sites sometimes um I but I have found that that command line that command on the command line has been able to get IM is smaller with no loss of quality than anything I've ever used before uh be it command line tools or or photoshop stuff or um even those websites where you can drag and drop I so this this has just blown me away in terms of the the quality uh and the the size of what you get okay all right Patrick actually did put the command that I needed uh in here so thank you Patrick I'm not going to try it right now um but I'm definitely gonna I'm going to copy and paste this right now and I'm going put it in my uh in Google Keep so that I can remember it I also um I do go back and look through all these live chats so if I don't get to your comment like I'll see it um you know or you could just throw in the comments in the video or direct message me on Twitter uh if if you have any you know something you want to ask me uh I'm I'm totally fine with that all right so far not a lot of questions where I'm going um I'm I'm looking uh you all were kind of talking to each other oh yeah somebody from um from Ukraine awesome thanks for watching all right homberto said are you scoped correctly didn't see the folder structure uh I think that was when I was we yeah when I was trying to use this um commands here um yeah I don't know maybe was I in the wrong folder I thought I was in the I was in the image folder oh well and I did Patrick mentioned I was um I I used uh mogrify last time I was using convert this time so it's possible that the syntax is just different between the two commands and I messed that up but uh if you're only going to do one image um then convert works for one image usually uh I think somebody so Hunter said there's um CMD R uh for Windows that's the program that I use on Windows and so it's the equivalent of I term for Mac so for everybody that was asking about that earlier it's cmde R that's that's the name of program for Windows um so check that one out definitely better than the default um command line for Windows Melissa says the smaller images will load faster that that's yeah the smaller images will definitely load faster it h a big difference uh especially if you're on like a mobile connection I try to test all my sites and on a 3G like I I just throttle the network in Dev tools um down to 3G so I'll show you here if you go into Dev tools into Network conditions you can turn it down so I usually go with 3G and then I'll go in and um refresh the page and just see like what um actually this is the wrong this is the wrong Dev tools I got my other one over here on this screen um maybe show you how this how I do this okay so I've set this to 3G I refresh the page and it will tell me like um how many requests so you can basically see like these are all the images that are requested um on your homage and you can easily see like you know how how big they were how much time it's taking this like never finishes loading uh because it's still doing things in the background uh so this oh yeah it finally did you see there's still there's like this T this thing that keeps on loading over and over again so that's insane I can't believe it took that long and I do disable the cash when I do this to simulate somebody coming to the site for the first time um anyway but usually when I test sites I that's how I do so I'll I'll compare I'll do a test like before I change something and I'll do a test after to see if I actually had a positive impact on the sight speed some says Hamza says you didn't change the name though after optimizing you're right I did not change the name after optimizing that's a good C I can't believe I did that all right that's why it looked identical because it was pretty it was pretty much identical um all right let's take this to uh okay so yeah so before I hadn't actually been loading the the new image still loading the old image uh so let's compare now let's Zoom that in all right so it's actually still really good I can't tell the difference all right so yeah that is the new one just to we'll we'll just prove it here just uh to double check yep it is it's the one that says op in there so yeah so that officially not the last time but this officially is less than 25% the size of this one on the right and it looks identical even zoomed in so once again that's awesome and it's actually legit this time so good catch you caught that again that was Hamza all right so uh or Hamza I'm not sure how to pronounce that uh so M Hamza thank you for that catch um someone asked Jesse Gulp or grunt I used to use grunt a few years ago but I switched to gulp um gulps gulps seem to me easier to configure like the configuration for gulp is just like writing JavaScript it's it's more familiar uh also it seems faster so that's why I made the switch um I think if you're like really used to grunt I don't see any reason like if if you're happy with it I would say maybe I mean I'm I'm not like an expert at this but I would work on learning webpack uh they're not exactly like the same thing uh because webpack does other stuff but uh check out webpack if you want to do like react and things like that if you're just doing regular websites I would try to learn how to do everything you're doing in grunt but using just regular um scripts so like npm scripts to do it you can do it all it simplifies things and um I've been trying to learn how to do it as well that's my my advice uh if you don't know gulp yet I don't worry about using it just go Um try to use npm scripts and webpack Melissa says I still have a question about which command line tool to use in Windows okay and naine said yeah that CMD uh works good so yeah that's that's the one that um that I use valenda just joined in from Brazil working as a software developer in the UK um in London so awesome thanks for watching uh you kind of joined in here at the at the end we did some image resizing and compression uh conver straight from the command line today um we got some good results this video will be available the recording will be available like right after I I end the stream um Bill asks what do you use for hosting the WordPress that you utilize and calling the API uh I'm hosting it on a droplet on digital ocean right now uh you don't have to do it like that if you have like a shared hosting provider you can still use the API straight from there it's built into WordPress now so um yeah any any place that let you host WordPress as long as they don't lock down your plugins like um like there there are some uh WordPress specific hosts I can't remember the there's one in particular I worked with that you there are only certain plugins you could add so I wouldn't go with something like that because you want the freedom to customize um but most of your shared hosting will allow you to you know you you can do WordPress or you can set it up on digital o I'm actually running it on a $5 droplet uh because since I'm only using the API I don't really need anything more powerful and I'm going to do a lot of caching and I actually haven't even turned on the caching yet on the WordPress side of things so the site's still like pretty decently fast I'm going to turn it on after we get most of the content in uh World boss asks Are You full stack I would not call myself a full stack developer I do some things that that would be considered full stack when I have to but I would say at least 80% of what I do is is clearly frontend stuff occasionally I do stuff that would be considered devops um like setting up you know servers and stuff and build processes and things like that and that's just because I don't have anybody I'm the only frontend developer at the whole university right now uh so there's not really there's another guy in my department that's he's he's really good with stuff um so he can help out uh but it's not like technically his job to do things like that uh so basically I got to do whatever I have to do um to uh to make the SC work but I would I wouldn't put it on my resume uh as a front end I that wouldn't be honest to me uh to do to say I was full stack I would but I'm confident saying front end which preprocessor do I use so Carol says uh is asking this what preprocessor um for my uh CSS I use SAS so I write it in SAS and then trans convert it over um I was editing just some straight CSS towards the end of this pro project um I just didn't I was really close to launching and um I didn't have the automatic conversion set up on the react site I had it on like the previous version of this site which was static and um so I didn't have time to go through and set that up uh but I do like SAS I'll probably switch up there's some new stuff coming out with CSS though so when that starts to get supported I'm I may or may not continue to use SAS we'll see uh ham Hamza okay so earlier I mispronounced um hamza's name uh it's I I said Hamza that's not correct it's Hamza so thanks thanks for telling me how it's uh how it's actually pronounced I I really do want to know and uh pronounce uh your names correctly uh Hunter says uh they agree the config for gulp is better it is also faster because it uses no stram okay so that seems like a a more knowledgeable answer than the one I gave even um he says in particular it's using node streams so it's faster actually yeah you're definitely right I I had forgotten that part of it uh so correct me if I'm wrong but this was my understanding whenever I switched is that um grunt would step through all your processes like one at a time but gulp has the ability to um do like multiple things at mons so that's how it can do it so much faster so I I it's been a couple years since I've actually even read anything about that but I think that was that was the reason uh Hamza ask planning to do a stream on the caching part yeah maybe I'll um I didn't show any of the WordPress side of things so if there's interest in that maybe I'll do that maybe I'll show like how I set up um I did a plugin uh like a custom plugin and PHP to set up custom post types um maybe I'll show that and then show um the plugin I I actually am using a plugin for caching so maybe I'll I'll do a little bit uh of that as well um if if you all want to see that uh all right Melissa said thanks for taking time out other day uh you're welcome Melissa um this is awesome and it's not just I don't see this as like me helping you out so much as us like collaborating because uh you all you know catch my mistakes and uh give me a lot of good uh good feedback and and good ideas so I think it's a mutually beneficial relationship here that we have going on YouTube um all right I think we're at the bottom we only have two more two more um comments here to go through um man Adia all right I'm sorry if I mispronounced that it's looking like Adia um asks are react components responsive by default if not then you use materialize or just medic yeah so a react component is is not anything by default really it's whatever you want to make it so these are responsive because I use materialize and materialize is a frame workk that's responsive and then also I added my own media queries where I needed them so um there were there were some spots where I just needed some more like fine grain control over the positioning of things so I added in some extra media queries on top of what comes and materialized uh but that's that's how it was so um so I guess react by itself doesn't really um it doesn't come with any markup by itself so whatever markup you give it it'll just do that so if you give it responsive markup it'll be responsive if not it won't all right last one of the day unless somebody puts something in here in the next couple seconds from Val um he asks join the show late and asks um how long have I been coding in JS in JavaScript um okay so I'll give two answers I first started when I was in high school with like super basic stuff um and I didn't do anything with it for a long time so we're talking like early 2000s right so maybe 15 or 16 years ago I didn't do anything with it for a long time until I was already um probably maybe like five years ago four or five years ago I got back into doing websites and things and uh as I as I kind of got deeper into it and had to do more complicated things for my clients I was freelancing doing like some subcontracting work I started clients started asking for things I did not know how to do and so I had to learn more JavaScript so probably I would say like four or five years ago I can't remember off the top of my head somewhere around there is when I really like made an effort to learn javascripts so I'm not like super Advanced at it I don't I don't think I'm super Advanced um and uh I will I'll you know have this disclaimer I don't I don't mind giving the disclaimer like this is my work and this is how I do it I'm not claiming that this is the best way to do it this is just a way I do it like this I have fulltime job and I have clients on the side and I produce sites that work and I get paid for it and I can support my family with it so um is it the best way probably not I don't really know but it gets the job done and I'm I'm generally proud of my work uh and you know I'm I'm happy with the results so uh that was a super long answer to that question sorry for that um I'm still feel a little out of it from from the uh from the cold that I have so sorry for rambling um oh we get we got three more comments while I was talking all right I'll go through um like I said today's a relaxed day I worked 13 hours yesterday so I'll I'll take some time to go through these um have you used polymer Giovani asked how you use polymer have you used polymer uh I I've never used polymer on a site um I've looked at it and messed around with it a little bit and I'd like to learn more about it I'm really intrigued by it but I've just never had the opportunity to use it on a project yet I don't know is anybody else watching use polymer what do you think about it uh you don't have to answer now you can put in the comments if you want um but I would like to know you can message me um on Twitter in general all my Social Media stuff is up on my YouTube channel so whatever you guys uh you all are comfortable communicating with I'm fine with that I'm not going to get like Matt if you you know try to find me on some other social media channel um all my information is out there so there's no sense in trying to hide anything at this point it's already out there um but if you try to call my phone if you get my number I I never answer if it's a number I don't know so leave a message or else I won't answer because my cell phone is actually on the internet so it's the same number I used when I was freelan think I have my own business um I hate the data cap couldn't watch any live vid oh man was there um uh Muhammad Ansari is talking about a there's a data cap in phow Indian so in India there's a wow I did not know that so evidently in India um or at least that part of India um there's a data cap so it was hard to watch live videos so wow that stinks um sorry about that I have a we I'm in the United States and um I do have a data cap but um I don't at work so I'm at work right now that's how I can stream this for so long in like 1080P and it's it's decent quality um at home I don't really know if I could stream this this long uh at this quality I might hit my data cap as well all right Val says thanks for answering and sharing live you're welcome thanks for watching and homberto says you should be proud of your work it looks really great wow that that means a lot that really means a lot y all it's really great to um be able to interact with you like I said I'm really kind of aside from one other person that's that does some web stuff with me here and uh and he's great he's one of my favorite people but aside from him there's really nobody else here that I can talk to about web stuff so I really appreciate uh the opportunity to get some feedback from some other Developers and uh and to help each other out and share share the knowledge so my voice is kind of going my throat's hurting a little bit and um I've been streaming for longer than I wanted to so I think I'm going to cut this short uh thanks so much for watching uh any questions you have put them in the comments or on Twitter and I will see you Monday no not Monday it's a holiday I'll see you Tuesday I'll be back Tuesday probably 2 p.m. again on Tuesday I'll uh I'll put it out on Twitter sometime on Tuesday when I'm going to stream next uh so have a great weekend
