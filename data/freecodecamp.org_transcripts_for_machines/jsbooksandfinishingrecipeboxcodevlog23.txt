this episode will be quite short because this week i focused mostly on reading about javascript and finishing and testing recipe box app so the two books that i've been reading this week uh the first one is eloquent javascript uh this is available at unlock when javascript.net and it's available there for free when you look in the contents um you can notice that there are some basic parts uh like you know functions values types or um how to deal with bugs and error handling however um revising them after writing some time in javascript it is helpful because uh you see the things a bit differently than you said for the first time when you um when you read about functions or about objects for the first time so it's worth doing really the book has also exercises so at the end of the chapters you will find small exercises um with the console to practice what you've read to practice the theory the second book that i started reading uh this week and i chose parts of it is speaking javascript speaking javascript is available at speakingjs.com i will put the link to this book in the video description below and when you look at the table of contents again you have a quick start with javascript where you have basic javascript issues like syntax uh where to put semicolons where how to put the comments there's something really basic really but later you go to to more complex chapters like javascript indepth right now i'm choosing the chapters from it that i'm reading on my reading list there's also you download js so you don't know javascript and this is a series that's also for free on github i got interested in this series uh listening to freecode.com new year's eve um livestream javascript 30 with westboss it's also for free and it consists of 30 challenges that should be implemented in vanilla javascript i will look into them and choose some to implement so next week i'm going to connect this javascript 30 with reading the books this is how the recipe box has changed this week finally i pushed it to the live server it's at the one who does slash recipe box during testing it turned out that i have to change a bit the storage logic the reason for this change was that um my previous storage logic took everything while the user had installed so for example on chrome and there was no problem but on safari and some other browsers well there were things in the storage that were from previous apps from previous actions the user took so i had to change up the storage logic it works right now correctly and it remembers just only the issues connected with recipe box i also added the formatting and ingredients and instructions so in ingredients each enter causes a new line to create um an impression of the list that's unordered of course in the instructions uh each new enter gives a new paragraph and so it's also formatted in my opinion it looks better right now because it's more natural the way a user introduces ingredients it's usually one below the other and also when a user hits enter in such a long text as instructions they get the new paragraph the new thing from this week is also the favicon it's quite simple but still better down on the default that was before here one more thing that was also corrected this week is that during the addition mode these labels and these things were overlapping right now they are not so it's fixed and i'm happy because of that generally this week in this app was a lot about testing introducing some small style changes fixing some small bug issues and this is how it looks when you have more recipes on mobile it looks like that there's one below the other and this is the look on tablet size of course as always there could be more improvements in it and the iterations however version one is finished unfortunately in version one i didn't introduce uh the image resizing uh to prevent the situation when there is not enough storage for uh for the images i wasn't able to do it right now maybe in the next version um it would be better to connect it to the database and to make this image resizing on the server side not sure right now i'm not able to do it this project turns out to be quite complex i'm happy that it's done that the first version is ready to go this is the last episode in this series thank you for all the comments thank you for being with me and thank you for all the feedback i got from you it was a great experience and i leave you with the rest of playlist in free code camp remember to keep on doing and stay motivated
