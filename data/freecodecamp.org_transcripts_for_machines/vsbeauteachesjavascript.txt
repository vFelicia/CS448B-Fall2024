what's the difference between double equal signs and triple equal signs well double equal signs test for abstract equality while triple equal signs uh test for strict equality the difference is that abstract equality will attempt to resolve the data types via type coercion before making a comparison while strict equality will return false if the types are different let me give you an example if we test for abstract equality with two equal signs here we get true in the console however i'm going to just copy this and paste that we're going to put a third a third equal sign and run this again and you can see true that's the first one false that's the second one here so in this using two equal signs returns true because the string three is converted to the number three before the comparison is made with three equal signs it sees that the types are different one's the number and one's a string and then it returns false here's another example you can see that it's showing that true is equal equal to one for abstract equality equals one however if we check it for strict equality so that's the equal equal true equals equals one here is true equal equal equals one with the two equal signs this one is convert to true because in javascript true is one and false is zero however the with the three equal signs this one is not converted so it's false i want to show you another interesting thing with this if we clear the console and run this you can see the last one here um this is true however if we copy this line and we do three equal signs and run this in it will show false at the end this is interesting because it illustrates that string literals are different than string objects so this first part is a string literal this is a string object with the two equal signs it converts the object to the literal to compare them but then when the three equal signs the string literal is very is different than the string object so which one is better to use the two equal signs or the three equal signs well in general it is always best to use the three equal signs that test for strict equality this will increase the clarity of your code and prevent any false positives caused by abstract equality comparison if you do need to compare values of different types first do the conversions yourself and then compare this makes your code more explicit which is always better well thanks for watching my name is beau carnes and remember use your code for good
