what does the developer do daytoday well one thing that I had to learn when I first started learning to code and I still have to do today is creating user stories what are user stories well stay tuned to find out now user story is a highlevel definition of empowerment for your application that gives just enough information so a developer can give it estimation of how long it's going to take to complete that task simply put a user story describes how customer or user is going to use your application so in my experience an ITP M and K a project manager will go out and interview customer observe their environment and see what types of problems they're facing and then based off that research they create a user story so when I was first learning how to code I had to play every single role there was and developing a project so that included being a project manager I mean I had to create user stories on my own now this helped me learn about agile method methodology and it helped me to understand how important it was to make user stories and organizing a project and visualizing the workflow of a user so I encourage you to make user stories for all the projects that you have now that you're creating on your own before you get a new job or as you're transitioning into agile a team so the syntax is simple it goes as a blank which is a role I want to blink which says what and then so that I can why why do you want to do the what so let's say that we're building an application for dogs to meet other dogs in their city let's call it sniffs and wolves now this is kind of like meetup but for pet owners and dogs so from a user's perspective or customer aka a pet owner I might want for that for my pet to have a profile page and this is a requirement so my user story might go something like as a pet owner that's the role I want my pet to have a profile page that's the what so that other pet owners can see my pet before the initial meetup that's the one or a good one might be that as a pet owner I want my dog to have a profile page so that I can share stories with other pet owners so what do you think about creating a user story so far does it sound easy do you think you can put it into your next project tell me a little bit more about how you're gonna employ this in the comments below now I want to go a little bit deeper into why it's so important to create user stories so if you know who your target audience is you know exactly what you're building this application for this is your opportunity to have a conversation with them to figure out what they like what their problems are and to build that application so that they'll enjoy using it and then it solves their problem now if you don't know who your audience is this is the opportunity to figure it out this is the opportunity to create those audiences and to understand who they are and give your application towards them instead of trying to please everybody because fYI you can't also that last part of your user story that says so that that is something that should be testable you want to have test subjects later on and you want to have some words to push them so say the sole that says so that I can create stories and share stories with other pet owners now when I'm going through that as a developer or as a user who's about to use this application I should be able to see somewhere that I can create those stories and be able to share it with other users it's always good to test your applications so I also want to discuss two terms that you might come in contact with as you're diving more deep into creating user stories of your own and those terms are and personas now epics are kind of like user stories but they're way bigger and you really can't complete them in the two weeks that you're usually allotted to finish a user story so an epic allows you to get an overview of a feature without committing to any details they're really big and they're usually broken down into user stories so say for instance this was a book the epic might be the title of the book it's an overview it gives you an idea of what the book is about and it doesn't really give you too many details whereas a user story would be the chapters or even smaller they might be the sections in those chapters so an example of an epic might be to allow a customer to manage his or her account for their pet now as you can see this epic doesn't say what type of user it is it doesn't even tell you how yeah they're gonna manage the account it's just a broad overview of the feature and it's going to be broken down into various user stories so just know what an epic is so the second term was personas a lot of teams like to create personas instead of roles when they're creating user stories and personas are fictional characters that you create based off what you've learned about the people who are going to be using applications and those personas contain a name a picture a relevant characteristics and attitudes and they have a goal that should be solved by using your product so an example of a persona would be Natalie she's 26 she's an elementary school teacher and she loves to run marathons she loves pit bulls but she knows that they have a bad rep so she would love to help others fall in love with pit bulls by giving them good experiences through her own pit bull pets so that last part about Natalie wanted to help people fall in love with her pets through good experiences that was a goal and that goal should help me create epics which should help you create user stories and that epic should like the fiction out here but your application so now if you look back at all the work we've done for this fictitious there's an application called sniffs and Wolf's you should be able to have a great workflow to get you started on creating this app so let's go through them but persona Nathalie is 26 she is an elementary school teacher and a marathon runner she loves pit bulls but knows they have a bad rep she would love to help others fall in love with pit bulls by having good experiences with her pets the epic to allow the customers to manage his own account for their pet and finally the user story as a pet owner I want to have a profile for my pet so that I can share stories before the gettogether or with a persona Nathalie a pet owner wants to have a profile for her pet so that she can share stories with other users and they can fall in love with that pet before the playdate so at this point you should be able to create your own personas epics and user stories for your own application if you enjoy this video give it a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe below also I'd love to see you on Instagram and Twitter so join me by taking a picture of your user stories and acne or hashtag it coding like a boss see you later
