hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to make a reaction component from start to finish we're going to pull in data from my sql database uh using graphql and apollo and then we're gonna use that data to put into the components and render multiple components so this is probably gonna be a short stream uh so this is something that i've done many times i don't anticipate making a lot of mistakes but if you've watched the stream before you know i do often make mistakes so it could happen um so before we get started i just want to bring you up to date on how i fixed one how i and uh michael creole fixed an issue that we had uh i believe on the last stream so and i tell you truth i'm not a hundred percent sure that i don't know that we had the issue on the last stream or not now that i think about it but anyway we um we were trying to get the faculty list pages to work and we had made a new component and we made a new query but it just uh i found that when i was trying to get categories that had more than one word then they were hyphenated it wouldn't work it turns out i was searching for the name which would be the title in wordpress instead of the slug and the name of course when it has more than one word has commas sometimes and spaces and all sorts of things so that's what my problem was and i worked on it for a long time on my own couldn't figure it out i made a get up issue for it and uh michael saw it and realized what was going on and submitted a pull request that pretty much sorted everything out i still needed to make a few adjustments in my router because i had actually made another mistake in the routing function that i didn't even realize because it was kind of buried under this this other mistake so i had to adjust that and i adjusted some things uh in the component as well to deal with some errors that came up after that so there were just layers upon layers of my mistakes that i had to get through so that's all sorted out now so those pages do work i just don't have all the routes in yet so i did open up an issue for adding the routes if anyone would like to do that it's it's actually pretty boring work uh so i'm going to do it at some point um i just made the issue one to remind me to do it and then two if anybody really wanted to get a pull request for doing some like tedious work uh then feel free to take that one okay i think that's all my updates uh i don't know some i i for some reason i think there's something else i wanted to share but uh i can't remember it now so i guess we'll just get started let me make sure the stream all right stream health looks good let me know if anything's going on so i am streaming some from home today so you know sometimes the the health's not that good but uh i i think it'll work out so i'm gonna start my timer uh on my other screen so pomodoro session we're gonna try to do a 25 minute session of coding and then i'll take a break and do some some questions we may not need two full sessions today uh let's see let me switch my screen oops there we are okay so you probably can't see much because it's really small i'll make it a bit bigger for you and when you see on the screen with stuff i was working on previously so we're gonna we're gonna switch out of there so i mean basically i was working on routes uh cleaning up data on the wordpress side of things so nothing super interesting uh i did go through the analytics from the current site to figure out what pages are viewed most and so i'm going to focus my efforts on those pages before launch uh i'm gonna get the data for all the pages but in terms of how the pages look and the most the pages that get the most testing i'm gonna stick with maybe the top 20 pages in terms of views really the the top two pages get all the views and then every page after that gets like one percent or less of all the views so it's not uh it's it's it's kind of hard to say like hey here's the top 20 pages because the difference in views between like number 20 and number like 100 are like 10th of a percent so uh it's not not really a huge huge difference but let me show you what page what pages we're going to be working on what component we're going to make first so you get the visual then we'll go to the code um hey everyone i i see a lot of you saying hi now in the in the chat so hey michael's here michael thank you i don't know if you caught the beginning where i explained uh how you saved me from my mistake there with our graphql queries uh but i really appreciate that so thank you uh so let's go to localhost first and actually let's see let's go to that fine arts faculty because that's the one that was giving me the most trouble or at least that was where i first realized that i did something wrong because i couldn't get that data so i hope it works oh yeah it's taking long because of the stream i was really worried for a second but okay here we are so here's our page for fine arts faculty and i'm gonna go to the same page on the current main website just to give you an idea of what people see now because their expectations if they've seen one of these pages before are going to be based on what they're seeing now so i'm not going to recreate it pixel for pixel but we should at least try to have the same basic data so we're going to go to franciscan.edu arts and faculty so we'll go there and you can go to that site as well if you'd like we also have a um we have a test you know what i haven't updated the test site i'm not going to try update it now because it'll take forever while i'm streaming but i'll be sure to try and update that um that demo site i believe it's i forget the url i'll probably i'll let you know the url when i do the next stream so you all can check out the site as well but no sense right now because all of this stuff that we've done in the past week isn't available anyway um all right so here's how it looks so there's there's this huge i guess you could say kind of hero section that are on these pages which we're not going to try to replicate that right now these pages to be honest with you are rarely visited in terms of the total site visits so they're not a priority right now and we'd like to have input from each of the departments before we go in and start redoing things but basically what what they have now is an image the name and then title and a link so right now getting the image is gonna be if we're gonna get the image now based on the data that we have we're gonna have to maybe use maybe a regular expression or something to search out the url to the image uh because we don't have that you know kind of nicely available in its own field so we can grab that but that's going to be you know if we have time let's grab that because it'll be a little bit more difficult what we really need is the name which we already have we just need to make it look nice and we need this this link which we can get easily the title is also going to be a little bit different but if we can look in the markup and see that like hey all the titles are let's say in a certain type of tag or they all have a certain class we may be able to just grab these as well maybe with a regular expression we'll see so we may be able to display these properly with all the data we want without having to go back and manually edit the the data that we currently have so um if you haven't followed along for a lot of the project we're stuck with a lot of data and markup as is from um migrating the data from a previous content management system so that's why i'm trying to do these little workarounds to to be able to work with data that's not in an ideal format uh at some point i'd love to be able to change the data but we don't have enough time before the site is going to launch on june 4th okay so i'm thinking two in terms of design there's two options uh that i think we can take one is to do cards and have kind of a masonry layout with the cards for uh the professors the other layout would be uh just to keep kind of like we have here this list format and to keep some sort of of list format so let me know in the live chat what you think just to give you an idea of what the card could look like uh let's uh let's go to the main page in a new tab here and when that does load you'll be able to see you know potentially what what it could look like while that's loading i do want to remind everyone um in case or if you haven't heard yet um a few of the viewers uh that i believe are here in the live chat today at least i saw nikki um so nikki and harshit and javascripter who's occasionally uh in the live chat and i all um created a site for people to be able to share their github repositories and find cool javascript repositories that are are not really well known but are kind of worth knowing and that site is called javascript.af so oops i'll paste that in the live chat right now so if you'd like to check that out you know please feel free check it out so oops i didn't get the link it's just it's not a clickable link but if you just copy and paste javascript.af in the browser you'll you'll get in and see this after you log in with your github profile we're not trying to take your data uh but to use the functionality and actually add repos you do have to be logged in so uh we may make it so that you don't have to be logged in i open an issue for that um so you'd only have to be logged in for certain things but you could still see things without being logged in for now uh you do need to log in at first though but basically you can see you know we have some repos uh if you were to click let's just click on this the latest one that was added uh you can see the readme and some statistics so you'll have the ability later on in beta when we add more features to upvote uh repositories um so there there'll be different searching options so it should be i'm hoping what it'll be is an easier way to search through github repos um and uh like i said just a way to find really cool stuff out there that maybe is kind of just getting lost underneath all of the the bigger repositories that get most of the attention so please check it out let me know your opinion okay so this is an example of how a profile could look actually looking at this now it reminds me that i believe uh this image is too big i need to make some restrictions on on images for the cards it just is um it's taking up a huge portion of the screen there um but anyway it would be something like the faculty profile card name title um and then a link so our option is to do something like this or to do something that would be more of a list style more horizontally oriented so as i said let me know in the live chat if you have a preference i guess i'm going to make a um a decision on this here in about 30 seconds i will give you all uh a bit of a time for the delay to go through to see if you have uh any any opinion on that i'm just scanning through the chat to see if anyone has an opinion looks like not yet so about in about 15 more minutes i'm gonna answer questions in the chat so if you're asking questions uh just please um be patient with me okay cool so uh sasha says uh card style michael car style sasha uh forgive me if i'm wrong about this but i don't remember uh seeing you in the chat before so welcome uh if i have seen you and i just don't remember you know uh apologies for that but anyway welcome to the chat and thank you for uh letting me know which style you prefer prefer it looks like the card all right great so everybody likes a car this is actually going to make our job easier because we can probably borrow a lot of the markup from the current card component so let's let's see where we have that so we're going to go into our code here all this code is available and it's open source the repository link is in the description to this video feel free to check out that code use it for whatever uh new addition to the code just today was a code of conduct so no so far nobody has done anything remotely in violation of the code of conduct but um if you're gonna say something or do something that you're not sure whether or not you should do just check out the code of conduct uh beforehand um but uh it's nice to have one of those hopefully we never have to actually enforce it uh and so far everybody in this community has just been very pleasant um certainly to me and also with each other as far as i know those are the pages i need to look for components okay where's our component profile card so let's check out our profile card component and we'll see so i guess for now let's just copy this and i mean honestly it we'll see i'm gonna make a new component now but it's gonna end up being pretty close to what we already have this one needs to be a little bit more versatile i think because you're using it for multiple types of profiles but um i don't know if i really want to just change this one to work in our use case let's see profiles yeah i mean to me i there's a balance between making the component reusable for a lot of different situations and making a component bloated with all these different options so i don't know i kind of think this component is maybe like on the border of that right now uh so let's just go ahead and make another component you know at least it'll be good for uh educational purposes to make a new component and go from there so let's call this faculty list item okay so that's what it is right now it's pretty specific so like i said maybe this this may end up changing a lot or getting combined with another component or we may end up taking this component and making a little bit more general so that we can use it in other situations oops i name this improperly i'm meant to do a um a capital so usually uh components are capitalized uh and then at the first part in the camel case so not not always but that you seems to usually be the the way components are named let's see so i'm i'm running spotify on my phone and i went to press the skip the song key on my keyboard and it wasn't working like what's happening because it's on my phone okay so here's what we have let's scoot this over we'll scoot this down a bit just want to give us as much room as possible and okay it looks like let me go through this a little bit and just we'll see what the component is so i know i titled this creating a component so you know potentially you might be expecting to do this from scratch but to be entirely honest with you i never make a component from scratch and if you're trying to make it components from scratch other than for educational purposes then my personal opinion is that you you're wasting i don't want to say wasting but you're taking more time to create it than you need to right because it's it wouldn't be a waste you'd probably learn things when you do it but in reality the structure of components is there's usually a base structure that can be reused and you can always find a component that's similar enough to what you want to do that you have a starting place so this is actually how i do create new components i always start with some component that i previously made so what this gives us is a lot that we would need for most components anyway so we're bringing in things from react right we're bringing in our styles from material ui which is the material design framework that we're using uh we're bringing in components from material ui that we can build on right we're bringing in typography which gives us automatically styles for our for our text for font okay and we're bringing in a button right so these are basic things that we should not be recreating over and over again if we want to be able to develop things with with any speed at all so having said that we also bring in some styles right so these styles are going to be useful to us now we may not need to keep them all so we may take out some things that we don't need from this component so if you notice where we at you know we have this i'm trying to see this same component is used for multiple things so we don't really need to say what type of profile this is because on the page where we're going to use this on there's not going to be multiple profile types so we're going to be able to take this section out uh we're also let's let's go through it i believe there's some other stuff we can take out but we'll see once we get there so this category section right here we can take this out because we won't be using that and we will take out the corresponding prop for that which would be profile type so that's not going to be an available prop we're going to take it out we're going to use it here his profile type here right so we've removed all that you notice i have this commented out i'm going to keep this in here just to test it and see whether this gives us uh better dimensions for our images if it does not i'm going to delete it so we're not planning on keeping that the what we had before and by default in material ui with cards uh media that you have in cards so mostly images at the top of the cards were background images put in with css but we ran into some issues with that when i was testing with uh with my intern and some things that he had noticed and brought to my attention so we tested out using just a regular image tag instead and that gave us better results but i want to make sure that those are actually better results in a variety of use cases so that's why i haven't completely gotten rid of this yet all right so just a quick scan through here i'll explain what this is doing and we'll see if we can remove anything else uh where we have some of the props that we're passing in uh which are uh our profile image so this would be the url to the image uh this is the image title for the the title attribute on our image we have our profile name which would be the name of the person and then we'll have uh content and a profile link so the content is going to be the the quote portion so in our case the the content is just going to be the title of the person uh instead of an actual quote from that person so we may rename this to make it you know more obvious but for now just when we're testing it it's okay uh and then we we have a link with a uh just a basic button style and that's it it's going to be a pretty simple component so let's test it out let me make sure i've saved it and we need to test this out now in our faculty list so we need to bring in this component so we need to import it so we can use it so i'm just going to copy and paste this other component that we brought in from the same folder and that'll be easy to change and we've called our component faculty list item so now we'll be able to use that and if we go down here in our faculty list dot js this this template page we can see we're already grabbing our data with from graphql and we're already mapping over it and what we're doing right now when we did this just as a test was just through this into an h3 so we don't we don't want to leave it like that that's not really visually appealing so now we're going to replace this with our faculty list what do we call it again item so our faculty list item and we're gonna need to put in a bunch of props but we're not going to just just put in the props um by hand in this this case we're going to put in variables right there as we're mapping through this uh we're going to grab that data from the graphql the things that we're bringing in so let's see we need let's let's check here to see what we need to pull in and we don't need to pull all of these in some of these will be optional so for now what we're not pulling in is an image or a title so we're just going to pull in what we have for now just to see what it looks like on the page so we're going to pull in this for profile name we're gonna have whoops not that profile name is going to equal faculty dot node title and then we're also going to have our profile link and this one's going to be a little bit more tricky so right now our profile link is like a full url what we want it to be is let me see let's did i break it um i think i did all right oh yeah because i'm working on this page right now so we need sorry wrong page i need to find out what the url is to go to this page is this link not work oh i guess it it only works no it doesn't work at all that's weird oh maybe it's just so slow okay so faculty and then that's how it works all right so i just wanted to know how i had this route set up so it's going to be so let's do it like this so in react uh when we put these brackets in that means we can write javascript in here so we're writing javascript and uh we want to put in a template literally so we're going to do a template literal and it's going to be slash faculty slash and then here's where the variable is going to come in so we're going to put a dollar sign and then a curly bracket which lets us put in a variable so right here is a string this is the variable and the variable is going to be faculty node slug which i believe i'm bringing that in we'll find out in a second if i actually am so our link is always going to be to a faculty page and then that slug is going to tell us what faculty page to get to to pull in right and we've already set all this up in previous streams the only thing we need to be careful of is making sure in the data that we have that's uh in a mysql database making sure that all the slugs are are actually uh correct which since we're pulling the data in with the slugs and then we're taking that same slug and using it to grab the data again we should be fine so even if the slug itself is in a weird format that we don't like it still should work uh so now i can get rid of this oops you know what let's bring over this key let's make sure i don't already have a key on here i don't okay actually you know this is this isn't going to look great uh and i'll i'll tell you why in a minute after we see that it's not going to look great um but we'll add some more into here to make this look nicer so let me save that hopefully hopefully i did this right oh and i'm still getting this what was this faculty list item oops i believe i messed something up when i took out these styles yep i did i forgot a comma all right hopefully that was it oh when my timer ran out and i didn't even realize it so let me go i'm going to take a five minute break i'm gonna go to the chat and answer your questions and then we'll come back and see uh if if this will work how it looks what else we need to do steven says can you talk about what graphql does just a short description sure no problem um so graphql well i should say for those of you who are familiar with rest apis think of graphql as just another way to access data that is very similar to a rest api but imagine if you could tell the api exactly what you wanted instead of being restricted to the prebuilt api routes for those of you who have no idea what an api is at all it's just graphql is just a way for us to send a message to a server and ask for certain pieces of information and then that information gets sent back to us okay so in this case we have our react application is asking for data using the graphql format right it's just a certain way to ask right it's a way to format the question so that we get the answer that we want and then our database is connected to a wordpress installation we have a plugin called wp graphql and that plugin is able to recognize when we ask a question using graphql and then answer properly with the correct data once we get that answer then we can display it on a page using our react components so that is what all graphql is the reason graphql is better than a normal rest api is because uh going back to a really basic thing in a normal api there's only a preset list of answers that it will give and questions that you can ask but with graphql you can ask any questions that you want and assuming that that data actually exists you will get all the data back right the way you want uh i guess i'll give a real world example um like imagine if imagine if you called the grocery store to see if they had some certain items in stock and with the rest api there would be you called and there's one of those automated things and it says press one to find out how many apples we have press two to find out how many oranges we have right you could there was no option to automatically say i want to find apples and oranges you'd have to actually call back again and then press press one for apples hang up call back again press two for oranges with a graphql api you could just get on the phone and say hey i wanna know how many apples and oranges there are and then it would give you the apples and oranges right then you wouldn't have to make two phone calls okay that's why graphql is better hopefully that was a decent explanation let me know let me know if it was confusing uh steven says are these general javascript functions libraries etc or based on like react only uh you know what it's a mix so like some of the things that we do in within a component are just regular javascript other things are specific to react so uh to try to give you like this function here this git initial props is specific to next js which is a way to build with react but down here where we're doing this uh dot map and we're mapping over this is just regular javascript this is dot map and then we're using an arrow function within here okay but then once we jump back in inside of the arrow function we're back in react land where we're using this component okay but then um you know inside here we have a template literal syntax which is just es6 javascript so a react component is a very uh integrated mix of regular javascript stuff and then some stuff that is unique to react or unique to a particular package that you're using with react in our case next js oh cool and uh sasha says that this was uh uh first time in here so um awesome so yeah all right so officially now without doubt welcome and uh thank you for uh for letting me know which uh which option uh looked better there so let's see oh john hanson says still having errors to try to get the repo for uh javascript.af to work properly all right uh john if you haven't already done this open up an issue in the github repos for those projects and uh let us know what errors you're getting if you just want to copy and paste the error in there uh then harshit's probably going to be the one that's going to be able to help you the most since he did a lot of the work for this but if i can figure out what's going on from the errors and help you i will i will definitely do so and i'd like to have it in an issue and then that way if someone else has a similar issue later on then they can also benefit from it as well okay so my timer my five minute timer went off so i'm going to go back and check on this component and depending on if it works or not i may go right back to questions or we may work on this a bit more all right let me wait a second why am i getting there on that page that was weird all right okay so we have something now it just doesn't look like it's supposed to look and uh if you haven't already figured it out i'll tell you why in a second but what we do have is uh much nicer padding already uh we have some indication that these are separate we have our buttons with is the link properly going in there or not i'm not seeing it but let's let's see if there's actually a link in here since i don't see it hmm no i don't see a link what did i do wrong let's check out our component it's possible i omitted something important maybe and just double check what's going on that that looks like it's supposed to so there should be well let me try to click it let's click it and see what happens okay it does work i i assume that the link tag we were using would result in an a tag in the markup hey wow that so uh i i know i explained that this should work but i was still surprised that it actually worked the the length work worked and um there's a lot of information there the format is is decent uh definitely not ideal but decent wonderful all right so we're gonna go back at least we know that the links are working so i'm gonna go back and probably maybe the last thing i do we'll see uh did i accidentally click this again i think i did hopefully we'll just stop that all right um i'll i'll get these in more of a masonry look so let's go to our homepage where we already have a masonry layout working uh maybe home's kind of cluttered you know what let's go to our search page because that also has a masonry layout but it's not nearly as cluttered okay so is this it do we have a masonry layout on search or not now i can't even remember it's been so long since we worked on this all right so this would be a search result class you know what i don't think we do all right so let's go to our homepage not sure if i have it up already so i'm going to open up a little sidebar here and go down to our pages and index close that give us some space okay so what we're going to need right off the bat is a grid container and let's go with all right so let's go with the container i'm just going to copy this and then we'll close the tags after we copy it over but uh some of this whoops you know i don't i don't want all this right away i want these two first because these are going to go outside of here so these will actually replace this div and then so we just need masonry we are going to need to import mason so let's let's do that before we forget because this will get an error if we don't import it so we'll bring in masonry and then we also need to bring in grid which i don't think we have yet yep not yet masonry and grid okay so now we can go oops let's go to the right place here and let's just pull in a grid that we're already using we're also going to need to bring in these classes because we'll get an error from that as well if we don't fix that oops did i not get the whole thing nope i didn't let's copy and paste the whole thing so we're going to copy that and then paste in this whole grid element so if you're not familiar with with material uh ui you probably at least recognize by the name of grid what this is doing uh this this is gonna lay things out uh in a certain way certain screen width okay so here's our grid and let me save to get some formatting in here should format for me so right now we have it set on extra small screens to take up the full width of the screen which is fine and then on small screens to take up half the screen medium to take up half the screen large to take up half the screen um we can try it like that and see how it looks it might end result in cards being way too big on large screens though and so we may have to change it so i just had my at least based on what obs is telling me telling me my stream dropped off for a second so if it did i apologize uh hopefully it's good now okay so we have oh we need the the styles let's find it content container and we may want to adjust this and we need that grid item fix yeah i like we may want to adjust this these styles are um particular to our our home page so they may not work well with what we're trying to do here but we'll bring them in for now and uh we actually need to we need to create our styles here const styles so you see here this looks like a javascript object with css in it and that's pretty much exactly what it is it's a way to write css using uh javascript and have it live right in your component this really helps a lot with reusability but it is a little bit weird to get used to it first so hopefully this will work without me bringing in anything else i think it will but we can double check the styles nope i believe i need we'll see if i get an error i think i need classes is not defined i think i do need with styles then styles uh let's see what we have down here goes with root with data and then we also need with styles styles hopefully that'll work it should work since we're using uh compose but let's check oh no okay where is this at facultylist.js 41. oops i know why we never brought in there's so we did pass in we passed in classes here um so we're not gonna be able to do this in the same way but uh for instance let's see where's my other component here faculty list item so we're doing something similar um so you can see we have this inside of our render uh we can do const classes so uh we'll put it in here we weren't passing any other props in like that so this is called destructuring when we do it like that so basically allows us to omit this dot props before each one of our props so really helps to save a lot of typing and a lot of space in your component if you have a lot of props like we do here we're going to do it here as well although in this case not not really that much going on but there could be and most likely will be so we're going to anticipate that so we're going to say cons classes and equals this props let's say that that should fix our issue and i just keep uh manually refreshing because the auto refresh takes forever when i'm streaming but normally you you wouldn't like if you're going to work on this project locally you you would not need to manually refresh if your computer is at all capable no way why did it not work hmm all right what did i do wrong all right let's compare our use of classes here so pretty much the same okay let's make sure i copied this in properly so we have const styles equals theme arrow okay all right everything looks fine there let's see uh let me make sure what i did bring in yeah it should be fine like this oh let me let me check the live chat and see if you all see something that i'm missing all right i don't see anything all right let me i'm just gonna check my imports again to make sure i'm storing that's interesting so not sure if this will have an impact at all but i'm definitely using a different way to import that it it shouldn't make a difference but i'd rather do what we're doing here because these are both no actually it's not this isn't uh a regular component this is a page component so i will try it the only other thing i can think of is what we're doing down the bottom within compose maybe is is not working for those of you joining me for the first time uh i do mess up in this stream quite frequently and um because this is supposed to be my normal everyday work and i do make mistakes every day so i don't practice this beforehand and uh i think part of the value of the stream is that i make mistakes and and we work through it together and try to come to a solution and i think that's a more realistic view of what web development is than if i were to pre you know rehearse all this and do it perfectly all right with styles let's see what we did here okay so we didn't do it there i wonder if let's look at this page and see what we're doing here i guess we're not we don't have any styles on this page there's got to be a page where we're both using styles uh in our component and we are bringing in data so let me think where would we be doing that let's check the search page so i think that's probably where we would be all right so do we do have styles and maybe we're bringing in data now i think about it we're not using graphql on this page so we probably aren't yep that's not gonna work all right let's check out our major page yes alright yes this is god styles all right excellent with her there we go so this is probably the problem i was just doing this wrong down here uh there is something different going on up top as well so we may need to change two things so let's correct this and we're gonna add in well we should just be able to add this i believe that's that's what we want to be doing let's check it out yay it works cool all right so this is more of what we're going for uh you can see we have what's it's kind of a masonry layout um let's try to drop down so we can see so you see once we drop down to a certain place it automatically changes kind of has a nice of like switching effect and cool all right so that works um like i said before i may not want on a large screen to have let's let's get rid of this for a second if my lag will allow it all right it won't but you can imagine on a larger screen maybe too big uh you know consider once we do put an image in you know if that's the width of the image and it's a tall image it's going to be huge right we don't really want that so um we may limit the size of the card but so far i mean it it's still very plain but our lengths work it looks a lot nicer than it did when we started and uh i'm not gonna mess around with trying to pull data out of our our content right now uh i'll just um maybe if i have some time i gotta take my kids to a soccer practice today so i may not have time today but if i remember maybe i'll make some issues and if any of you all are interested in pulling out the proper data you can take a shot at it as well i think that's that's not bad for right now all right so i'm going to scroll up to where i left off and answer the rest of these questions um i didn't stream yesterday uh because i was at the google i o extension conference in pittsburgh which ended up being really awesome uh if anyone is thinks it may be interesting for me to do a um like a little video recap let me know i'll do one um and i'll post it on my youtube channel which there's a link in the description for my channel if no one's interested at all just don't say anything or you could say no if you want to be really direct about it uh and then i i won't make the video but it was a cool experience so i thought i would share if if you're interested let's see so i'm just trying to figure out where i left off at right now okay found it uh john hanson says should it be just a functional component and then have it brought into a container component um yeah actually to tell you the truth i haven't looked through a lot of the components to see if they can become functional components and i suspect a lot of them could i like to start out with um with like normal components and then later on i can turn them it seems to be easier although now there's a plug in a visual studio code that can switch your your components back and forth uh so i guess i don't have to worry about it but it was usually easier to switch to a functional component instead of trying to switch back so i i suspect you're right about this one and about a lot of other components in there that they could just be functional uh teo says i want to follow along with you on these live streams what is the schedule how do i get into your code so um the schedule is it varies i try to stream monday through friday i usually don't get all five days in depends on when i have meetings or what's going on um so probably the best thing to do would be subscribe to a free code camp channel and turn on notifications on youtube and then if you follow me on twitter uh and or instagram i usually post about when i'm gonna stream i'm most consistent on twitter occasionally i i don't have time or forget to do it on instagram uh but then at least you'll know a little bit beforehand when i'm going to stream uh so that's if you want to get into the code the the link to the github repo is in the description it's totally open source you can see everything and then feel free to ask questions if you need to okay johnny carter says i find that component packages are quite restrictive when trying to match design specs such as material ui have you come across any issues yourself um yeah yeah i mean we need to occasionally when i come across issues like that what i'll do is make a i can either make a completely new compute component and do all the styles myself which i find to be not a great option it does give you the most control but you end up recreating a lot of things that you don't need to uh the other option is to create a container component around some material ui components uh and then that way you can kind of manipulate and do what you want with them and then the other option is to actually manually go in to your node modules copy and paste the code for a particular component from mature ui pull it out make it your own component adjust it enough so that it actually works in that new component folder that's kind of at that top level and then you can you can change it to be what you want the only downside to that is material ui is going to continue to advance and update and your component is not so there's a tradeoff but that gives you the maximum amount of customizability without having to recreate a lot so i've i've done those things that's how i do it so yeah i but i found what you give up in going with the framework in terms of freedom to do what you want uh it's it it really is worth it for me because you save so much time sorry you save so much time not just in terms of building the components themselves but in testing you go with a wellknown ui framework there are thousands of hours of tests that have already been done by the people to build it and by the people that use it so you it's very very difficult for one person or even a small team to replicate that amount of of testing figuring out all the different ui bugs that happen in different browsers and devices and things so uh that's why i generally am okay with you know the small annoyance of the inflexibility that occurs sometimes uh michael creel says i might want to build a card template then extend it to more specific uses yeah for sure um you know i like i kind of mentioned before in reality we probably could just could have used that profile card template and adjusted it uh but for the sake of the stream i thought it might not be a bad idea to just copy it over do our own thing and um simplify it rather than complicate an existing component so i thought that might have been a slightly more kind of slightly easier to understand for people who weren't that familiar with react but that's definitely a candidate for refactoring uh let's see michael creel says um is dangerously shot enter html something you made because the name intrigues me no no it's not what i made uh the the team that made react actually made that uh the reason is it's titled that is because you're pulling in the raw html when you do that and if you if the source is unknown or like let's say you're allowing users to input things and then you're displaying them on your site that could potentially be dangerous if if you're not checking that data first to make sure they're not throwing in like script tags or weird things in there that could harm another user so we in this case we control the data and where it's coming from so it's okay to use but you definitely want to be sure like i mean let's say you were building some sort of forum or a discussion board or whatever and you let users put in data and then the data could be displayed to other users without any sanitization uh going on then that would be that would be really bad so that's why it's labeled dangerously oh no john hanson said uh things are fuzzy can't read a thing okay now it's fixed all right so i'm sorry about that if that happened to anyone else uh my stream for whatever reason the stream occasionally just keeps dropping off uh like in terms of the like uh kilobits per second it'll just go right down to zero and then a few seconds later it'll pop right back up and be like 2500 uh so i i don't know why it's doing that nino says uh you've been working on this project for a really really long time yep yeah i have so i've been working on it for a long time um mainly the thing that's slowing me down the most is just the amount of data that needs to be brought over and the this the quality of the data it's not in very good shape it's not it's not organized in a way that allows me to just bring over large pieces of data in bulk um and it requires a lot of cleanup so that's what i've been working on a lot in terms of the react stuff i really only work on the react stuff whenever i stream um which is only you know an hour or so a day and sometimes not every day so it has been quite normally it would not take nearly this long just to build a react site and a pretty simple one at that the data is what's really slowing me down so i i agree this is a lot longer than normal uh albert says how long until you finish this project uh well it it is supposed to launch on june 4th that's our our date for launch i mean potentially if it didn't launch then we have a little bit of room you know but should be launching around then uh so after that i'll probably still work on this and be constantly updating it but i i already have another project lined up that'll be my main focus uh after this launches michael so so earlier when i was explaining graphql and rest apis and things uh michael creole had mentioned uh rest would tell you every fruit you have all at once then you'd have to search for apples and oranges yeah actually you're right yeah there would be potentially you would just get everything and have yeah that is a good analogy uh a good piece of the analogy steven says the graphql explanation is pretty good trying to decide if you want to dive into it for a job you have at work oh okay cool i really like it i'm definitely not as good at getting data yet just in terms of like the how you format a query i was just so used to rest apis in particular the wordpress rest api that i could get data a lot more quickly without having to look up how so i think once i work more with graphql it'll be a lot easier for me to get data michael creole says you should change the link text to would you like to know more yeah i don't know if i want that much text for the link i i don't want it to wrap onto a second line when it's on a small screen so for just for a button if it were in a different context in a different layout i would be okay with that but generally i like to stick with smaller you know one or two words for a button john says i actually can understand like a second language what's happening today all jesse's fault that's good michael creel says i know i'm ocd but the ordering uh of your import statements make my makes my eye twitch yeah my import statements are a mess if anybody really wants to uh organize the import statements feel free if there's some plugin that does it automatically uh let me know because i'm i'm pretty bad at that i just throw them wherever when i'm working because i just like i don't want to get sidetracked and forget what i'm about to do you know you know how you like you get it all in your mind like this is what i need to do and then if i try to like okay how am i gonna organize these i might forget where i'm at so i try to not let myself get distracted by the order so it ends up a mess albert says i've been learning react in redux for a year and i still don't know how to make a website well keep at it i mean you'll get um you get to that point i mean it might be best i i would definitely make use of things like create react app and next because basically you run those and you have a website you know it it already works you know you you have a progressive web app that already works as is uh you just need to add you know your own styles and content and just kind of add on to it so uh that's where i would say if you're having trouble with it definitely start there if you haven't already i i would for never do i don't want to say never but like there'd have to be a really really good reason for me not to use something to build out a react app and then i just start from already build you know setup already configured webpack like you know all of that alright i'm going gonna try i gotta end the stream here soon so i'm gonna try to uh maybe skip some of the comments and just get to the questions and i mean if anybody's interested you can go back and read the the replay um let's see okay john hanson said instead of limiting card size full screen it might be better to have a containing div that sits uh in the middle and then media query with of that div will have auto margins on the left and right yeah you know what actually i think that's that's how i had it set up uh with the styles that i brought over so um i'm i'm thinking though it may it may not be enough so maybe i'll just have to increase the margins in that case but i don't want to increase too much it might be better to go to let's say three columns and have it display a little wider than to have keep two columns but i would only take up just this tiny section of the screen i think that that may look a little weird stephen said i don't stream because i make more mistakes than you you're the you the bomb thank you i appreciate it but i don't i make a lot of mistakes sometimes like today was today maybe it was like average amount of mistakes but um i i don't know i try i mean i ought to be getting good at streaming i've been doing it for over a year now so i would hope i'm i'm at least okay at it by now uh johnny carter says thanks for answering i like that you're smiling about messing with the node package that's exactly what i ended up doing yeah i mean normally like you don't want to get in there and mess with it but i mean what other sometimes that's your best option you know so i don't mean i guess the the other option be like maybe adjust it to the way you want it submit a pull request and hope that it actually makes it into material ui or whatever framework which i mean that's valid too but you're uh it's going to take longer and it's not guaranteed so i mean maybe doing both is the best way all right uh neeraj says hi hey how's it going and dextroyer of world says what is your visual studio code theme it's the seti theme so seti um oh nikki's got it so seti uh seti icons and uh um fr fire code font there we go fira code is the is the font so that's why we got little things like i'm trying to find an arrow function i know i got one over here yeah so that's why the arrow functions look like this a little bit different and then there's some other things that look different too i don't really have a good example of it right now but okay well i gotta go gotta take my kids to soccer so thank you all for watching uh really glad uh it was really really glad that i had your opinion on things and your help with some of these things so i should be back tomorrow i'll be streaming from the office tomorrow um maybe maybe the afternoon not sure yet i'll let you all know on twitter and instagram uh when i'm gonna stream and uh subscribe to this channel and uh turn on your notifications and you should get a notification as well um anyway uh i'll see y'all tomorrow uh until then have a wonderful day
