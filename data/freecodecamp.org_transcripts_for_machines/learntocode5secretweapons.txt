real tough candy from realtofcandy.com back on the bike with you guys today how's everybody today we're going to talk about the five secret weapons that help me learn to code better you guys know i don't like wasting time let's get to number five number five books we understand the power of a great udemy course the great lecture style that team treehouse has some of the code samples that free code camp has but there's something about a book i don't know about you but when i'm on a computer like i'm doing a udemy course or whatever i have like seven other tabs up and i'm getting distracted all the time and a book just minimizes those those distractions the other thing about books is that the topics are indexed so you can very easily flip back to whatever you're trying to learn about if you really want to double down on the secret weapon of books pair them with a video course because you get the audio of the video you get the visual of the video and you also get the visual of a book and it really reinforces that information number four a mentor i was lucky enough early in this youtube thing to have someone actually reach out to me this guy's a super talented developer he checked out and he has been so helpful with me coming to him with for realtime information and realtime help when i'm stuck on a problem and mentors mentors are great when you're learning to code because you can come to them and they make you feel comfortable it's not like stack overflow where there's this peanut gallery just waiting to rip you apart for asking a newbie question and i still have him as a mentor i have my job but i'm still asking you questions um about work stuff when my senior developer is busy or just on the weekends when i run into something but real tough candy where the heck am i gonna find a mentor i don't do youtube chat i don't have a freaking youtube channel that is a perfect question to segue into secret weapon number three tech communities the irl the best irl groups to get into in my experience are meetups you go to meetup.com search for your technical interest whether it's javascript ux ui you name it it's out there they're in most major cities um even around the world these meetups take place and if you live in a rural area or a smaller town make a point to go to that city once a month or whenever you can every couple weeks and just make those connections and don't be shy about introducing yourself because they're people of all talents there's a lot of people out there who really want to help newbies because they remember how frustrating it was and a lot of people just like the challenge you know it gets them out of their comfort zone online communities are super diverse and can be very helpful as well uh free code camp has a great community the real tough candy getter chat room there's newbies there are seniors there's people who've been doing it for 5 10 20 years plus and these online communities are great places to find that support get the questions answered that you need answered and progress in your learning in your career number two in achievement journal this is a lofi method to track your progress and really just flip the pages or go through your digital notes and see how far you've come you know you're delving into so many technologies and coming to a lot of dead ends getting a lot of success points in there too but after a while a lot of it just kind of like melds together once you start writing things down you can start organizing your thoughts and that organization that decluttering of your mind really makes learning and retention of information a lot easier i keep a journal at work i have something you know there's like todo lists i have a todo list so i have a physical journal with a todo list and sometimes i'll keep notes on my personal machine as well and you can just use something as simple as you know a little note program where you date it and then you just give bullet points on what you accomplished that day after a while after a few months of doing this you're going to see some big time progression and that can be a huge confidence booster and a lot of times confidence is what you need to learn more and keep pressing on to practice these technologies and feel confident in applying for jobs and getting to that next level and finally the number one method for learning how to code go for a walk go for a bike ride you like gardening get out and garden go get some physical activity where you're not focused on a computer and coding one of the quickest ways to burn out and just get sick of it and just stop learning is by staying on a computer for 18 hours a day our bodies weren't built for it and our brains weren't either i mean the more you try to stuff into your brain the less you're going to remember it doesn't have to be this hardcore thing where oh three hour bike ride followed by an iron man like it can just be 15 minutes but it really is important to just take a little break from the computer from coding and let that information process and again going back to writing in a journal getting your thoughts organized i've had a lot of revelations about coding problems just taking a walk going for a bike ride being out in the woods thanks for watching guys i'm gonna go run over some more pine cones go get a fizzy water maybe go get a kombucha or something oh yeah i'm living it up
