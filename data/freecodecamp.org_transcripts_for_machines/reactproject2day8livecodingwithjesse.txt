hey everybody its Jesse and streaming a little bit earlier than normal today I have a meeting at my normal streaming time so it's actually my lunch break now which obviously I'm not taking today but it's also gonna be kind of a shorter stream so since I have a meeting in an hour and a half I want to try to keep this to about an hour to give me enough time I'm actually gonna walk over and meet with people face to face today so I'm not gonna meet um you know via my computer but yeah like I normally do and usually prefer to do so hopefully you know look you all got my message on Twitter so sorry for changing up the times on you the last stream and this stream hopefully tomorrow we'll be able to stream at the normal time so a lot has happened with the project since the last stream and Wow the analytics just jumped like from like 7 to 57 all right so let me catch you up as quickly as I can on what's changed and then let's try to get as much of the rest of the layout done so then we can actually start working on something a little bit more interesting so we got some some form data that we have to handle and uploads and we got to work with an API for a project management system so we have some some different stuff that we haven't really handled on on any of our streams yet that I really want to get to but I do need to go over a little bit of what happened with all these pull requests these awesome pull requests that we got since so much has changed so let me just bring this over and show you so these are for pull requests I'm just gonna give brief descriptions of these obviously you can go in yourself and see what has changed oh if there's also a live stream going on on Instagram so we do have someone watching right now on Instagram so if you want to see the code for this Instagram stream go to free code camps YouTube channel and you can see what's going on on my screen okay so the first pull requests so Sebastian basically fixed all the the app trees so if you'll see if you remember I didn't really have things organized that well so I had started to make I don't think I even made a components folder yet I think I did make a Styles folder but I still had some Styles in our main source directory so Sebastian went in native components directory put everything in the Styles directory that you know all our style sheets put all the components in here so it's a lot more organized definitely more clean I actually need to move so this is certain some later pull requests so I need to move this into the components as well but basically that was just like super super helpful the next and I'm sorry if I'm missing anything from these pull requests I apologize I'm just gonna try to get through this quickly so he can get to the code rohit made a i talked on friday about it would be really cool to have a component that depending on what you passed in as props it would make a card with basically any potentially with anything that you would normally have in a material design style card so check this actually let me bring it over from from n grok yeah and let me let me give you the I always forget to do this at the beginning so I have the N grog server running so it looks like maybe someone got on already I don't know maybe it's just me is that one person yeah it's probably just me I'm gonna paste this in the live chat hey everybody I see everyone's saying hi in the live chat hey thanks for watching everybody so there's the link if you can't check out the live chat right now it's this highlighted link right here I'll leave it up on the screen for just just a little bit longer give you a chance to you put it in a few if you want the URLs are there I understand why they have to be a long string of numbers like that because there's probably a lot of them but not that easy to type in alright so let me move this over now so we can get back to it so basically if you want to use if you want to be able to see the site you know live as I'm developing it go to that URL and if you go there you'll be able to see cool stuff like this okay so now I remember what else Sebastian did he gave me different placeholder images random ones so I think like this is always going to be architecture tech animals and probably like nature some landscapes or something so that's really cool let's see what we keep good didn't refresh for us oh well if it has refreshed since I merged this pull request this morning so it'll provide refresh again at some point so just let me show you so this is the card now so you can see this one has all the options in here so we can have you know the title with a little avatar image the main image here and overlay with the title just a title inside here our action buttons are content so really cool and then all this is controlled by the props so if you want to check out that component go ahead on github and you can check it out in more depth we will be using it as we go forward so you'll see more of it but that was just really awesome that was perfect exactly what I was kind of envisioning for that component so thank you and then we have to pull requests from from Kevin and one is you remember last week on Friday we finished up with this this form alright we had our form elements and the only thing that I didn't like was the button it's not it wasn't terrible but it just wasn't it didn't have the effect that I was used to with the other buttons because we had used materialized CSS before on previous projects and the material UI button styles were just a little different so now we have the exact styles and it's really cool that actually we can still use the same component name but and you can see it in the code but basically that component is now wrapped in a materialized button style component so just adds these this effect on to it so I think this actually looks better because of the mainly because of the drop shadow or the box shadow if you see it I don't know depending on the video quality you could probably see but anyway that's that's exactly what what I was thinking of what I wanted it to look like so that's awesome and then also we have testing so we now have a nightmare Jas and we have some test setup through there and I'm gonna be honest I have not done testing like this other than just reading about it or doing some a little bit of like a tutorial on testing but I haven't actually done any testing on my projects so this would be the first time I'm using that so I'm not even really sure how to use it at this point but I'll be figuring it out so I have one of the tests up right now so it seems pretty straightforward right so this is for the homepage test obviously home test is when we say it contains Resource Center right so we're checking to make sure it actually has the right title that's cool we're checking to make sure it's showing six cards based on the class of the the columns so it seems straightforward I'm gonna have to read up more on on how to do this now that we have it on the project but really cool that this is on here cuz after I saw this pull request I remembered that I had said I was going to try to do testing and then completely forgot about it so sorry for forgetting about it and thanks Kevin for the pull request and putting it in alright so this now looks good I mean we'll we'll come back and add in the correct text and everything in there when we go to make this form actually work but right now yawning I don't know why I'm yawning I actually got a decent amount of sleep last night this weekend was crazy I basically coded like Friday all day like I got him I went home from work earlier but then just immediately started coding and then all night and so like 330 a.m. and then I went to sleep woke up on Saturday and then coded all day Saturday and took Sunday completely off but I just I had a lot had a site that I had done previously in a database crashed on it and it was I just couldn't figure it out I was insane so I ended up just completely creating a new droplet on digital ocean and making a lamp stack installing WordPress put an SSL on it I just made a new subdomain pointed it to there and then pulled in that data through WordPress API into a react site like we did with our last project from the new then ooh drop that luckily I actually had the development version of the WordPress installation on a different server that that I used just like manage some shared hosting account with SiteGround and I had never deleted it which which end up being really good because I was able to just export everything from there and import it in so it took a lot of time and it was pretty crazy and then I decided hey let's like just update the react installation too and I tried to upgrade next and react to newer versions and just completely broke it so for hours that night the site was down luckily it was in the middle of the night and it's basically the the audience is in the same time zone as me so it probably was okay but I then I needed to get the site back up and running which is why I stayed up so late so anyway just a heads up as this that was what my weekend was like I'm sure some of you have been through similar things you know I guess it kind of happens sometimes site breaks you gotta fix it all right so let's go to I've got a posters done don't really have much okay service request form this is going to be a little bit more kind of indepth in our other pages were so let me bring up there we go let me bring this over and so we all can see what's going on here so obviously this is gonna have a form but it's gonna have a lot more form inputs than our last form did and not only that but it's gonna have some some pages that we need to put in before that so when I was first building this it was requested of me that I make it so that users can't just go they don't go straight to the forum all right so the idea was that users were supposed to understand the process first before actually requesting things from the department so I did think that that was going to be pretty annoying after a while so I was able to put this skip to form button so it's just a slight slight annoyance of having one more clip but click but you can skip to this form so the actual form is is this so we're gonna have a bunch of regular text inputs some multiline inputs we're gonna have a date date picker and then a file uploader then we're gonna have a bunch of check boxes a submit button and then we're gonna have a box here that's going to control whether or not you can submit the form so you have to check to say that they've read the planning guide all right all this form needs to be sent the data needs to be sent to someone in an email and then it also we need to send a confirmation to the user saying we've received your submission and then all the data also needs to be sent to our project management system and they have a REST API that we'll do that with so we're not gonna get into that today that's gonna be a bigger project but at least we can start to build some of it out so let's build let's see for this page yeah let's just do this page first I do at least want to show you what what else we're gonna have so we're gonna have this this guy this planning guide so we do right now I'll have having two pages of it or three pages so we have the planning guide page one then it lists a bunch of services then it lists the final page before you get to the request form there's also this other page of just terms so this is a glossary page so I'm thinking about maybe trying to combine some of these so they're not pages a bunch of different pages I think what happened at the time when I was developing this was I I think at one time early on I couldn't have anything that required a scroll it was really weird some of the stuff trying to figure out how to do this and make it work within you know the the system which was called J ICS from a company called Jenzabar so it was difficult trying to work within that so I think maybe that's why it ended up being separated so if there's not really a great reason why it's separated I don't see why this page and then that third page couldn't be combined but today let's actually work on that form that seems more interesting than just putting in blocks of text so oops alright so we're gonna have a lot I'm gonna move this over to my other screen and we're just gonna bring everything into here and build this form so there you go fuse service request okay oh let me check out the live chat as well I'm sorry I haven't really looked at anything in the live chat since I started taunt towing Laius hello Jesse redux and Redux augur bring me many difficulties where you have a course to mention this maybe that's something I'm interested in learning more about so it's a possibility I don't have I can't give you like officially when that will be but once I learn it if I feel confident enough to do a video about it I will Tunney mess it aside Jesse how are you I'm doing pretty good are you going if you need cos what Mac do you have it's an iMac is it late maybe like late 2015 iMac early 2015 I can't remember but it's it's an iMac I have a MacBook Pro too okay cool so Rowan says that this form looks pretty good as it was so the form that I just showed with you know having it inside the card we'll see actually let's let's think about that just for a minute do we want to keep this in the card you know we had said with the previous form that wasn't a card that we moved it and just had it you know right on the on the paper here in the back and not in a card now this card will be we won't be overlapping the header anymore because we're not gonna have this giant thick header so should we keep it in a card or should we put it you know just inside the page I don't know I kind of think if we're gonna get away from having everything in the cards maybe we shouldn't have it in a card so I think some of the issues that we talked about last week still remain for this as well and that it looks somewhat like a pop up the way it is now this is not exactly really what cards are for in material design so I don't know I'm gonna I'm actually I'm gonna leave it outside of a card and see how it looks and then we could always have the possibility of just wrapping it in a card later on but I would like to see how it looks not being in a card because I do I agree I think it looks it looks pretty good right now but just for the sake of consistency I want to see how it looks outside of the car all right so I'm going to I see there's some more questions in the lad chat but I'm going to work a little bit on this and then I'll come back to that so if you ask the question stick around I'll get to it later on yeah so I'd at least like to get most of this builds out before I have to stop so if you didn't catch it at the beginning this is all the streams only gonna be about an hour long okay I did have someone ask maybe listen to comment over the weekend and I don't know if I ever responded to him I'll have to make sure I tried to respond to as many comments as I could this weekend but I don't think I got to them all but they had asked about why are all these components like have like the class you know component why not why aren't they just like functional stateless components and I mean the short answer is like well a lot of these are just placeholders right now and if it ends up that we don't need them they have you know their own state or anything if it's possible to make them functional components then you know we'll do that but for right now it's just just a placeholder and some of them will definitely need to have more like this form one will obviously need to have more so so we'll leave it like that okay so probably the best thing to do will be to copy over some of this from another page let me see what was the page that we just had probably the story page this already does have some form elements on it so this will be the best and we do have some some of the imports that we'll need we could just bring in and let's pull in this whole container okay so we don't need any services actually we will need so we do have some text it's actually in the header now it just says please use this form to request services so I'm not gonna leave that text in the header just because of the way our headers definitely different for this so we will have some text at the top and right now I think this this is actually a H it's in each okay we'll see what it's like it's an H to see if it even makes any sense as an h2 I'm gonna get rid of these paragraph tags and put it in h2 and we're gonna say okay now we can actually put in some of our fields so we're gonna have a lot of fields let's see so we are gonna have a name email from Department and so one two three four so I think we'll need for regular text fields let's check out material UI and see what they have in terms of fields okay you should I want to see okay I just wanted to doublecheck and see like your different types of fields how they were controlled so it looks like it's all controlled through through props which is great so we can just copy and paste our basic text field and then go back through if we want to format something I'm thinking you know I have a field for a phone number right so we probably only want to take numbers in the phone number field you know things like that I have a field for email so maybe we should check that it's actually an email so basic like form validation stuff alright so we can take these and copy then again because we need two more and then from there we want I have a lot of like large text multiline text fields I guess it's better to have it in case users have a lot to say some some of these fields could be answered in less than you know just a few words but I guess potentially you might want to do more so let's leave it sub 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 so we need 8 multiline text fields so we have one already Sushi's need seven more so it's two three four five six seven this components going to be long me quite quite large I I suspect once it's finished then after that we need a date picker and we need a file uploader so let's check out in a separate day there we go date picker not a time alright so let's see what we want below the inputs I think I'm gonna go with the modal yeah let's go with the modal and we'll do it in portrait that'll be close as to what we have right now this is this is what we currently have so it won't be yeah it's not gonna be exactly the same but I'm okay with that I mean obviously we'll want to you know customize the colors but I think it'll actually end up being better I think I like this better I mean there's certain things about it I suppose that aren't quite okay so you can pick the year okay it looks like the the only thing that to me is not gonna be as easy is the ability to just pick the month here so you actually have to looks like go through a bit but I don't really see that as a huge huge problem okay so this this will work this date picker will definitely work so we're gonna have to bring in the date picker and let's bring in this woman and should have made the columns before but I well so let's do a call them first there we go alright and I'm gonna say that if something to see what it looks like ok cool hmm I don't want them all the way across so I had forgotten that I had these all set to be full with so let's change that right now there we go so we wanted still to be s slow but then we want to add an M right was it M what are we doing up here yeah M 6 so on medium screens we want this to take up half the screen meaning 6 of our 12 columns so now let's say that and see how it looks okay this is much more like I wanted it to look not really yeah not too bad okay cool but I didn't expect I think I missed I missed one too I think I was supposed to have eight of these so I must have missed one it's kind of embarrassing that I couldn't count to eight in front of everybody on YouTube all right so that's that's better I'm still not like what there's something about this that just does not look as nice and what is it maybe they just look too big actually let me check this for him so I just want to see what the color is on this font yeah I don't think I wanted I want it to be a little bit okay I think this font maybe is too light so I'm probably gonna end up changing the font I'm gonna finish you know creating our fields before I go in and do that but I think we did have a darker did we have a darker font all right no I'm not sure I want to see what font I had for this all right so I'm going to check the color that I'm using for this one I actually don't like either because it's it is an actual gray hex color I'd rather have black with set like I don't know maybe 54% transparency so I'll have to look after we get the layout done I'm gonna look at a project I did within the last few months that I know I did form stuff with and I was happy with the the color so I'll just go back and check that color but I think that's that's pretty much probably what's bothering any maybe these are a little bit longer than I'm used to but also probably better to see it with the real words here instead of having them all be the same let's see what else we need so we need our file upload and then a bunch of check boxes so hopefully there's a file uploader here let's see not seeing it it's okay if I'm missing it and someone has experience with with this framework material UI if it's in the framework please let me know otherwise I'm just gonna pull it from materialized CSS because I know that they have it and I've used it before it's gonna look look through this menu mmm excuse me again just more yawning so here's our check boxes which we will need those let me check the text field just really quickly I doubt it'll be here but it's possible yeah yeah definitely not there okay let's go to our check boxes then so we're gonna skip that for now I'll just put in something as a placeholder and we'll just need to put that in so let me just double up on this date picker for now I don't know I think I keep saying download button and it's upload I want people to upload things I don't know why I kept saying download all right so we want okay and I remember this so we're gonna use these checkboxes and I'm definitely gonna use these ones but I may change how the style of them at some point because it's definitely not exactly what we have so if you see what we're doing here it's a different different effect and maybe I'm just used to this because I've been using it but I kind of like this effect and let's see what this one I'm pretty sure this one is actually closer to what you're supposed to use with material design but this one is closer to what we've been using at the University for for all of our forms so at this point I think I would kind of just want to go with this but we'll see that'll be one of those things that if we have time to do it we'll do it otherwise I think that you know this will definitely be acceptable I mean this looks good it's just not gonna be exactly consistent with everything else we've done so we'll just add that to the list of maybe for now let's see where do we have the label at okay so we want the label on the right check box on the left okay I said check we're gonna import our checkbox all right so you have the checkbox and we'll pull in do we need these styles I'm just wondering whether or not I should bring in these styles but really all we're doing styles checkbox is just a margin bottom 16 let's say I'm not sure if I even want that margin so what we're gonna bring it in will leave out the style and see what kind of margin we have and we can always you know add in a margin later on right now I just want to kind of see how it looks like on the page so probably I think I want columns two columns with a bunch of the check boxes inside so we're gonna want another div with a class name just like we've been doing not really doing anything creative with our classes right now with our column classes so I'm just gonna add a few more of these just to give us an idea of what they're gonna look like and oops didn't get that top and put this here let's save that and see what it looks like oh and I forgot to take out the style so it's gonna be easier for me just to add so that was checkbox and I think at this point so let's do that whatever want to put this cost inside here right we'll see if it works in a second no don't want to put it outside don't want to put it inside the render function will not work because I didn't put this now oh sweet it did work cool all right not bad see that that other thing next with 259 you die cool actually this this effect is kind of growing on me I like that little ripple a circular ripple effect I don't know what do you think let me know in the live chat and in the comments do you like this first effect which is basically like the Box completely goes away and then there's a check or do you like the circular ripple effect all right so let me know I'll give it we don't need to decide right now we can I mean right now this is going to be in there and maybe we'll change it later but I am just at least interested in what you all think about this okay so the only thing we need to add I mean other than making sure that we have these I'm not worried about all these yet because before this goes live this is going to change so I'm not gonna worry about whether I have the same number as on the current list because we're we're gonna take out some things maybe add things I'm not sure the only thing I'm missing is that last checkbox here so let's just add that in and then I'll take your questions I wonder if and get away with putting it right there what it'll look like it definitely needs a little little padding but that's about about where we want it okay cool well we basically have the layout for this the only thing that we didn't get done is this file upload so we're gonna have to pull this unless material you I have something that I'm missing we're gonna pull all the code from materialized and we're gonna use that for our file upload and that should look good I've used it before so yeah that's it not bad this was actually the page that I thought would take the most time and it it hasn't been too bad now what will take a lot of time is actually making this thing functional and do all the behind the scenes things that we wanted to do in terms of sending data where it needs to go that'll take a while but at least the layouts done and I'm not I don't really like the look of this right now so we'll see maybe we'll do something with this but all the pieces are there and we'll just kind of shift them around a bit as we need to okay so let me commit this let me check the status see yep that's what we've checked all right that's what we've worked on okay so now this is all on github and she all can see everything that we've done see all the code now actually let me let me bring over or is it that I did want to see I want to see if we got any new images now so I mention the beginning I was hoping this would refresh and we get an images but didn't refresh all right let me check the live chat now I'll try to get to as many questions as I can but right around you know when I hit the hour mark for this video so that's in about 15 minutes then I'm gonna have to wrap things up hopefully I can get through all your questions and now looks like we did have a few people in the Instagram stream but it looks like they left I always forget about that stream and I wonder if people just happen to stumble upon it I wonder if they even know what's going on since they can't see see the code I don't really know any other way to solve that I can't really take the time to check that frequently okay so Jung asks I'm trying to start learning web development any suggestions where I should start from free code can't so I really I mean I realize I'm streaming for the free code Kent YouTube channel but I really do think free code camp is a great starting point if you're just getting into web development even if you already have the basics down there's still a lot to do in free code camps so that's a great place other than that if you happen to not really like free code camp for some reason code Academy also is very beginner friendly anything that has browserbased learning I think is very user friendly because you don't get stuck trying to set up your development environment and you can actually get to do some you know HTML CSS JavaScript and see how you like it before you have to commit like install a note on your machine and you know getting that up and running I don't know about you but I remember when I was first installed a note on my machine um years of god I don't know how many years ago was but it wasn't very intimidating and it was like am I gonna break my computer here like what what am i doing so that can be intimidating so those two resources are great there's also some YouTube channels that are good for beginners so learn code Academy is a good YouTube channel that has some nice stuff that I think is beginner friendly they have some advanced stuff too but and then dev tips it's another YouTube channel that has some pretty good things for beginners it's more geared towards CSS and less you know you you get you get some JavaScript but less JavaScript you know then then you'll get in learned code Academy and I don't really have a lot on my personal channel yet but I do plan hope hopefully at some point I can get some of those beginner tutorials up that I want to I'd like to include so I definitely I need to do some tutorials so this is just for a timeline for you all since I've been saying I was going to do these videos for a long time now I hope to have either some interns or student workers in the fall so coming up like making a month and I really want to make those videos so that every time I get new workers I don't have to train them continually on the same basic things I mean I still I'm gonna train them on things but there's a lot of really basic stuff that doesn't require me like personally taking the time to go through and that I want to do those in videos so it's going to be things like setting up your development environment basic you know get commands how to use github just a lot of those things that I use in my workflow and that anybody that wants to work in this department and work on the projects that we're working on will need to know to be able to contribute so those videos will probably be coming soon so assuming that I do have some students so I have some interest there's some students that are interested in learning and coming here doing some work and learning more so hopefully hopefully that will happen and there'll be an added benefit of there being some some tutorial videos on my channel for you all to check out if you like but aside from that there's a lot of great stuff on me or the other the other places that I mentioned are really good and a lot of those places are where I learned okay it looks like at the beginning when I was asking about keeping this form in the cart or not a few of you actually said keep it in the card so I'll keep that in mind well maybe I'll put it in it won't be too hard to put it inside a card so we can always put it back in the card if if we need to suppose where it says hey man shout out from Africa hey thanks for watching Philip asks when you work at home do you have an office or do you have to work where your kids are so actually I I just did kind of a different setup so for the the first few streams that I had done from home I was actually set up like right in my living room uhhuh so it was not really the best place now when I was working my wife had taken the kids somewhere else so it worked out but if the kids had been there it would have been hard to work now I have worked like that before and I just put headphones on and I turned the music up really loud and I've actually been so focused on my work that I've had like the neighbor stopped by came in my house sat down three feet away from me at a table talked to my wife for an hour and then left and I didn't even know she was there so I can focus enough to make that work but I recently moved to my basement in my laundry room and and that's a little bit more private and the kids are less likely to come down there the bad news is it's really noisy when the washer and dryer are running and it's also a basement so there's not really when I was in my living room I could open up I have a lot of windows there I could open up a lot of the windows I'd hear the birds and get a nice breeze blowing through so it felt like I was outside almost so there's a much nicer environment so we'll see how that goes I've always kind of thought about making a legit office but right now I do so much work you know in you know in the office here at the university that it doesn't really make sense for me to have Home Office right now my um is not that big I'm actually running out of space so as you all probably know from previous dreams I have four kids and right now there are two bedrooms for the four kids and which I guess isn't too bad but they're not really big bedrooms so I can't really take one of those and make it my office right now then we'd have one bedroom for all four kids so so we'll see that there have to be some construction involved if I were to have my own home office which isn't out of the question it may it may happen okay Roland says material design specs don't mention this anywhere of it even on Google's properties forms are usually in a card okay that's good to know Patrick doesn't think it'll look like you know okay so if you're not sure what we're talking about right now earlier on we were debating whether or not to have this form in a card like it is here or to put it directly on the page and it seems like so far everyone has said that they wanted in the card and not on the page so we may end up moving it into the card I was worried that it wasn't really you know proper material design style to put this in a card but evidently Google is using it in that way and you know putting forms and cards like that so off to check it out now that I think about it the new settings tab in Chrome I think that's I haven't been there in a long time but I thought they switched materials on yeah they did so the new settings tab in chrome is everything's in cards it's not exactly a forum but it's it's close enough so this is what I'm talking about settings I mean there are form elements within this so yeah that that seems kind of legit like it could it could work so it may end up doing that okay so Kevin says I think it's better in the paper for consistency sake also okay so we do have some some differing opinions here off to think about it Rohan says keep the background off whitish it looks better that way yeah it does do I have to see what the background was I thought I had it off it is off right white right now right it's I guess whatever the default is for material UI is what it is right now which should be slightly off off white I think yeah Sebastian said move the button component to the component folder I will I will move it in there I don't want to just move it right now because I don't have time to make sure that it's it's properly I'll have to change the import to where it's in I think it's only in one view right now actually now it's in two right we just used it again so I want to make sure I have enough time to change those when I move it but I will move it alright Roland says you can use h4 h5 for description just use h1 for the service request form yeah that makes sense maybe I'll go do that I am gonna kind of change this a bit and make it look better and if we end up putting this in a card then we'll have to see what we do about this Jordan asks why the early stream imperative associates a meeting yeah basically I have a meeting at 200 and I was supposed to have another meeting at 300 that ended up getting canceled so I but I figured it'd better just do the early stream that way I know I get it in in case the the other meeting runs long I don't expect it to but I really have no idea how long the other meetings gonna be so I was safer to just stream early let's see if someone in the live stream a Malia how's it going so someone someone who used to work in my department actually just watched on on Instagram so those cool she did web stuff too so that was good she moved on and and now I think she has a better job than all of us in the department so I'm happy for okay so Kevin says there is something in materiai that seat that works for a file picker hasn't tested it yet and I put he put the link in okay awesome off to check that out Oh Sebastian said I can add type file to a text field well that will that work will that look I'll have to check it out later right now yeah I only have another minute left but office it off to check out how that that looks okay Umberto likes the circular riffle so Sebastian okay since the rotate box thing looks choppy yeah I think it looks a little bit better in other implementations that was one of my early implementations of it but yeah it is choppier for sure okay it looks like everybody alright pretty much everybody likes the ripple effect on the checkbook so I think I will end up sticking with that and I think it'll be fun I'm not super upset if I have a slightly different effect on checkboxes for different sites as I go back and update old sites I can always just change it if I need to so I think I'll keep it with the ripple effect Vinicio says Jessie do you think JavaScript would be the best language to begin man I don't I'm not sure if it depends on what you want to do if you know you want to do web development then yeah go with JavaScript because that's that's what you're going to be using if you want to just get more into like programming in general then something else like like Python would be maybe easier to pick up I think you know a lot of places start with Python so yeah I did but it does it just depends on what you want to do so I kind of I started with JavaScript for the most part and it turned out all right for me I guess so it's definitely you know it's doable a lot of people start with JavaScript but I think Python would also be a good alternative if you weren't if you didn't really want to get into web design specifically then maybe Python would be better okay cool so Patrick says the file picker is in the docks under the race button stuff I want to see this unless I'm not seeing it maybe I'm looking in the wrong place there we go all right cool it's just the first one okay cool so you just wrap the input inside the race button all right good to know so this is what we use then and awesome awesome that'll work thank you Patrick for find a desk it's kind of a little weird the place where it I don't I mean I don't know but that just wasn't like obvious to me that I would find the file input under race button oh well it seems like it would make more sense if they had forms as a category and then on the dropdown you had all the different types I think it would make it you clean it up a lot more you think they're taking full requests for their documentation probably they might not care those since they're coming out with a new version for the old version but I think it would be better better organized like that okay cool so in regard to what we're talking about earlier with me trying to get work done with all my kids and no office Philip says I'm right there with you I have three kids and doing side projects is challenging yeah you need CEO says you have four kids that's awesome I have two little girls yeah that's cool isn't it having kids is it's like one of the hardest things I've ever done but it's also one of those awesome things I've ever done and my kids are still little I'm sure it even it gets harder and and more awesome as they get older Ellen says office in a shed or garage says you might have to do something about the network but it might work actually that's that is a good idea my sheds in terrible shape so there's no way I can put any electronic stuff in my shed cuz the roof has holes in it but I really really want to add a girl I don't currently don't have a garage so I really would like a garage and maybe I should keep that in mind if I do end up building a garage to make a space for an office there okay kevin says on the card /page debate there is a paper component that just adds the depth effect okay cool I have to check that out so I won't actually have to like put it in in a card we can just add some depth to the paper Rowan says meetings the nontechnical bane of developers that's for sure I like I just can't take all these meetings there's so many meetings and like some days I feel like I get no coding done because there's too many meetings and you you have to get ready for a meeting and then you have the meeting and then after the meeting you usually have to do something based on what happened in the meeting it's just like and then there's all the emails back and forth trying to find a good time to schedule the meeting for its so it's just crazy all the time spent on meetings I think I mentioned this before in a stream but just in case I haven't I I would love to make like a scheduling app or like maybe a Chrome extension that put automatically on your calendar the price of the meeting so it would just take how many people are in the meeting and then based on like an average salary or something per hour it would tell you how much that meeting is gonna cost and then I think there would be less meetings because people wouldn't just say like okay I'm gonna have like 10 people in this meeting and we're gonna meet for two hours instead they'd say like wow this is a $4,000 meeting maybe we don't need this this $4,000 meeting right now anyway I I think it'd be a good idea I don't and I'm it's not like I made this idea up I'm pretty sure that I saw this somewhere in the internet that someone had done something similar so I don't want to take credit for it but I have no idea where I read it how everyone says meetings discussing previous meetings those are true beauty oh my goodness yeah I hate when I have a meeting about something that we've already decided in previous meetings and we're just trying to remember what we decided in that meeting since like especially when like I remember for sure what happened in that meeting and it's just a matter of trying to convince everybody else that we actually did agree to that thing it's especially frustrating when it's about some some feature on something I'm building Tiffany said that meeting ideas hilarious I know wouldn't that be good right and I feel free any of you to steal that idea and build something with that and if you do then I I will use it but maybe oh I've actually like done it on paper like I've been in a meeting before like calculating how much meetings cost and then I'll usually just like text somebody or write it on a paper and show somebody next to me and we'll we'll smile about it in the heat all right well I made it through all the questions and I think I've gone over the time I said I was gonna gonna go so what else isn't it I'm always doing that so I really do have to go now because I want to get to the meeting and make sure I'm prepared for that so thank you all for for watching especially with the the time change that was kind of late notice so I appreciate y'all being ok with that and joining in and participating especially thank you to everyone who submitted pull requests over the weekend super helpful it's making this project just really awesome and I'll be back tomorrow hopefully at the proper time tomorrow which is 2 p.m. eastern time until then I hope you all have a great day
