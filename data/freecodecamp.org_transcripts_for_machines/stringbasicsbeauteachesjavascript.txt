a string or string literal is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes there is the string of my name which is bow if you need a quote character in your string you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of a string quote by placing a backslash in front of the quote so here let me show you that so here i made a string and it's he said hi so if that's going to look like this he said hi when you put a backslash in front of the quote character the program knows that you're not trying to end the string you're just trying to use the quote character in the string string values in javascript may be written with single or double quotes so so long as you start and end with the same type of quote you don't have to escape a quote character as long as it is a different type of quote character than what is surrounding your string so what you could do you can make this sentence one again you can not escape these quote characters and you can put a single quote at the end and at the beginning okay there are also other characters you need to escape which means to put a backslash in front in order to use them as a string so they have backslash single quote that's how you do the single quote here's how you do the double quote whenever you want to backslash in a string you just do two backslashes the first backslash is the escape character you can also put in a new line a carriage return a tab a backspace and a form feed you can concatenate or put two strings together with the plus operator so here it's going to put two strings together it's going to look like this and it's basically just going to be one string that has my name beau carnes and watch out for spaces concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings so you have to add them yourself that's why i have the space after the word bow you can also concatenate strings and variables so that would just be my name is beau carnes this is who my name is and it's going to add the full name which is this variable up here another way to concatenate strings is use is using the plus equals operator like this so the plus equals operator means that you are going to start with this variable and then add this to the end of the variable it really means full name equals full name plus is my name so the full name variable is now going to be so that's what the full name variable is going to be now the final thing i want to tell you about strings is that in javascript string values are immutable which means they cannot be altered once created now you can assign a variable to a new string but you can't actually change the original string we have sentence twice you so you can assign sentence to a new string but you can't actually change the original string like arrays you can change an element in the array but you can't change a character in the string after you create it thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
