we are here in the studio the virtual studio with none other than Logan Kilpatrick developer Advocate at open Ai and somebody whom I've had the joy of corresponding with for several years at this point uh huge advocate for Julia Lang which is a data science uh statistical language uh in addition to Python and R there's Julia and you've been very uh instrumental it sounds like in helping raise awareness of that and getting more people using it and learning how to use it and we're going we're going to talk about that we're going to talk about your time at open AI but of course I want to dive straight in and uh welcome you welcome thank you keep going say this is going to be awesome I'm I'm such a fan of of free code cab and I think the work that that you and the team and the entire Community are doing is is super important so um I'm I'm happy to to support where I can and uh just be a cheerleader from the sideline as well in many cases awesome yeah well we are very excited to have you uh cheerleading and I will continue to cheerleader for uh all the amazing tools you all are cooking up over at open AI as well both uh you know the foundational model the foundation model that I use many times a day and the open source projects that we're also using within free C Camp so uh I want to start by just diving in before you were Logan Kilpatrick you know uh you you have so many different hats that you wear uh somebody who has you know interned at Nasa somebody who has um who is working as a developer Advocate somebody who is going to lots of conferences and speaking authoritatively on a lot of these topics um and of course uh somebody who himself is like an angel investor in the AI space I want to go back a little bit way a little bit back to Illinois because my understanding is is is that where you you grew up yeah grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and I'm actually um and we can talk about it but I'm actually back in the sub not not in the suburbs now living in the city of Chicago yeah um bounced around to California and to Boston and then uh met met my girlfriend and then ultimately moved back to to Chicago uh about a year and a half ago amazing yeah so Chicago of course Central Time Zone like Dallas and uh slightly larger than Dallas I think it's the third largest metropolitan area in the United States a lot of people sleep on Chicago they're focused on the coast but you know Chicago's got a lot going on as well and I I'd love to hear a little bit more about Chicago and like your decision to move back there cuz you were living I think in the uh the bay area where which is where a lot of the AI action is happening but now uh I mean that that's a testament to the power of remote work that you can do that of course but let's let's go all the way back because I mean there's so much we're going to talk about during this conversation in terms of if you don't mind me using words like precociousness and uh you know you've studied so many different topics and things like that but but at one point you were just a kid going to school uh hoping to hoping to go to California like uh Danza Community College one of the uh famous uh community colleges in the legendary California community college system uh if you're looking to go to college Community College in California if you can get there that is a very good bet especially if you happen to live in uh California and can get like insay tuition but like maybe you can tell me a little bit about about what your your formative years were like yeah it's such a good question like I think you know I I have a lot of conversations with people and and in hindsight everything looks like it was supposed to happen the way that it did and I think like in the moment if I put myself back in the shoes of like high school Logan you know in 2014 in sophomore year of high school and like thinking about that experience like nothing nothing at that point like would have led me to think that I would get the chance to like do the incredible things that I'm doing today so I'm super happy about that and I think a lot of it was just like the it's fascinating to like be so abstracted out of that world now and like look back but like nobody cared about technology stuff like no one cared about like you know building things and like all the things that like I love so much today like it's really stuff that like I wasn't exposed to um like to the extent that I am today like I think of course like I had uh and have like incredible parents who like were you know giving me a bunch of opportunities to do a bunch of interesting stuff but like life was like so focused on like sports and like just trying to like socially survive and you know got a little bit of exposure to computer science stuff because my grandfather was an electrical engineer and um you know we spent a lot of time like taking apart old computers but like never really like building a working computer it was more just like destroying old computers which was probably not super safe in HS side especially cuz computers I'm sure had a bunch of like terrible stuff inside of them so hopefully that doesn't take any years off of my life in the long R were you like using the S ring iron and like tring trying to get like gold out of this the motherboard literally like pliers and screwdrivers and we were just like tearing these things apart I don't really understand again thinking back I don't really understand why we were doing that but um we had fun doing it and I think ultimately like I took um AP Computer Science in in in high school and like literally had no idea what was going on like I just remember thinking back to that class and like it was one of those classes where like you would they would just like kind of give you an a because you went through all the stuff but like I really pretty sure I learned like absolutely nothing and a lot of it and if I think back was like you know we were learning these Concepts in in such a vacuum that it was like hard to think like why will this ever be useful to me and I think the thing that actually really clicked was like coding and developing stuff that like made me want to like push myself to do more was the the game Flappy Bird like I saw Flappy Bird come out and I was like this is so cool and then I heard that the guy was making like $500,000 a day or something like that because Flappy Bird was going so vir and I was like wait this is does not look that difficult I should be able to do this um and I think that really like sparked much more of an interest in me to like actually go and and learn what was going on interesting Flappy Bird yeah like I mean phenomenal overnight sensation to the point that people are like selling the guy kind of freaked out at this success and he already had more than enough money to like live comfortably for the rest of his life in Vietnam right uh and uh yeah he and he he didn't like the way that people were like so addicted to it because he'd get on like the train or whatever and you just see everybody playing Flappy Bird and he was like oh they should be like learning or something like that right um but yeah like that is such an amazing story like how Flappy Bird of all things inspired you kind of like uh I mean it was a big hit obviously it was probably the app of the year um I mentioned earlier like people were selling iPhones that had Flappy Bird installed remember that a huge margin because he pulled it from the iPhone you couldn't get it anymore right and of course there were lots of clones but none of them were the original Flappy Bird something thought about that yeah so so that's what got you inspired and what were your first steps once you felt inspired by Flappy Bird like how did that change your data today activity and like your goals yeah I I started um so at the time I didn't have a Mac and Macs were like out of the you know we we my family had a bunch of Windows computers and it was like oh well let's go spend $2,000 on a Mac for for no reason and like that was kind of like outside the realm of what what we were going to do so the library um where I grew up in Arlington Heights like had a bunch of Macs and I went there and like start my mom started dropping me off so that I could try to build my own Flappy Bird uh clone and I found this guy um who I should try to reach out to and connect to Matt he Matt heinley apps Matt heene apps something like that and he made these really cool tutorials about like how to build iOS applications and if anyone's tried to do iOS it is very difficult it is definitely at least in my experience like not the place to start like there's just so much going on um ultimately tried to make something called Flappy Pig did it really work out that didn't it work out that well because I literally had no idea of what I was doing and had to like keep working with the library people cuz like they had these computers like pretty locked down and like the xcode stuff like wanted to do all these crazy things so it was like this very long and uous process but it made me realize like this is the thing that I probably want to do like I should go to school and study computer science and I think the challenge for me at this point was like you know I I was a decent like fine student but like I had never really like tried to make that my goal before and this was like junior year of high school where I really had this sophomore junior year of high school right where I had this realization like yeah I mean like suddenly you really have to kick into gear if you want to get into Harvard yeah foreshadowing a little bit but yeah yeah and I it was and which is kind of a one of those challenges of high school is like you're the timing is like very unideal like you basically like have to be mature at like 12 years old in order to like really be on the right curve to get into a great school right out of high school and like I was not on that curve so um I I did get into a bunch of point I was thinking about going to um Purdue to study computer science and um some other places and ultimately decided like in the uh in the yeah in the midwest is it in h Chicago Urbane champ or something like that u ofis in Urbana champagne uh Purdue in West laia Indiana which is like a a ston throw two hours uh East in in Indiana but um ultimately like I wanted to go to Berkeley and I was fortunate enough that my dad had started at a new job in California and um one of his coworker Sons had gone through the California community college system and they were talking and he told me about this I was like wait this sounds like a really great opportunity and you you foreshadowed this but like the California community college system is like very unlike every other community college system in the country like if you go to Community College in Illinois for example like it is not this like incredible opportunity that like feeds you into the greatest schools in the country and like the California community college system is that and they've done such a great job of like every every single person who is at those schools is like going to end up going to one of the University of California school systems which are like hard schools to get into and like really great and um yeah was fortunate that my my dad had started that job in California and I was able to move to California go to Community College at the ends for a couple of years and just like meet so many great professors who were like engineers at Apple or Google and their in their fulltime job and then would come teach a class about software engineering at deanza uh at night time or something like got and it was just such a cool experience yeah man that's wild just having these world class engineers at like big tech companies just dropping in teach some night school classes yeah that that sounds like a really amazing opportunity so so you go over you're able to move over with your dad to uh NorCal like uh it's in the the Bay Area it's like is it close to Palo where exactly is deanza it's deanza is literally like uh less than a mile from Apple's uh HQ in copertino yeah yeah that's wild and uh while you're there what what do you do like do you do two years there um and and do Community College before transferring to uh a university yeah so the plan um the California community college system has this program called tag so if you meet some certain requirements after you've gone through um it's actually not like year base it's just like the requirement base which usually takes about like two years actually some people takes three years depending on how long you're there but you ESS do all these requirements and then you tag into one of the University of C California school systems um so of course they only let you tag into certain uh UC schools so like Berkeley and UCLA because of how competitive they are not one of the schools that you can tag into so you just need to like straight up apply to those schools so I I applied to Berkeley um which was all the the school I wanted to go to got weight listed and um ultimately didn't end up getting in and was trying to figure out like what is the next thing like I I could have gone to one of the other University of California school systems but I think I had in this mind that I wanted to like go to the best place possible and um ultimately had also applied to a program at Harvard and that's that's what I got into um I think like people have this perception that like Harvard is this incredible school which it is um if you comparatively look at like Harvard for computer science versus Berkeley for computer science like Berkeley's a much better school for computer science like Harvard is a great School in general but like Berkeley is where computer science was started where it where like all the best uh computer science stuff happened so um it is you know people think Harvard upgrade over Berkeley but in some in some sense but like really like it was a downgrade for computer science so um again a nice expectation setting for for myself yeah well and and what you just said Ju Just for anybody who's listening who is you know considering applying to universities maybe your high school age maybe you're a nontraditional student thinking about going back to University uh what Logan just said there uh you know the university itself Harvard of course generally considered the greatest University on Earth by like uh all the uh the standard like metrics and stuff uh of course also amazing uh computer science program cs50 David ma over there uh but you know Berkeley is like in a a league of its own really um and so so don't just look at the University look at the programs and and the the college within the university and and so different colleges have different levels of prestige and different like caliber of instruction and things like that so so those are some things to think about also worth pointing out you got into Harvard which is often seen as like the most selective or one of the most selective and you didn't get into Berkeley so don't be afraid to apply to multiple schools because you know uh sometimes you might get into what seems to be a more selective institution and not get into a less selective institution and some of that comes down to just dumb luck circumstance whoever the admission uh person reviewing your application was maybe your extracurriculars any number of different circumstances this is very complicated and there there's not some deterministic path to getting into these different programs and so it's hardening kind of uh probably not for you but for me and for other people listening probably to hear that you didn't just get into every single program you applied for that that You Too Faced uh some degree of I guess rejection for lack of a better word yeah it's it's also interesting like the thing that I I would not have gotten into Harvard if I tried to go in through the normal door that everybody else goes in through so like there's actually an a bunch of other schools have this like my little brother went to the University of Pennsylvania um which is again is an incredible School through like one of these like nontraditional student programs um and that's actually what I what I went to Harvard through is like one of the nontraditional student programs that they had um and again I I don't think I would have been able to go if I was just trying and this is just like one of those lessons in life like if you're trying to do the same thing that everyone else was doing like there's just going to be like more competition and you find like sort of these weird like edge cases and you're able to go and do like I don't think I would have gotten into Harvard if I had not found that edge case for myself so look look for those programs um and I think it's more common now that like more and more schools do have those like it's like not the normal program yeah I I don't I don't know what the best way to to frame it is but Harvard has it upen has it a bunch of other grade schools have them as well so look for those things if you're a nontraditional college student especially yeah be like the Velociraptors in Jurassic Park like attack the electric prins from all the different angles and eventually you'll find a way over the fence into the general population right um so while you're there uh you know college or college job you start working at Apple and and I I heard about this on another interview that You' done and I didn't realize this but you worked at the Apple uh store for a couple years and uh like can you talk a little bit about what you learned from working at the Apple Store uh I mean Apple of course the Apple Store literally like ordained by Steve Jobs himself and so much of like Apple culture and philosophy and everything like kind of distilled into that um retail experience and and there you are working as a a retail worker like a everyday job that lots of people who don't have education hold and you were working there what did you learn during that experience so much it was I think like the Apple Store was like one of the most formative experiences for for me like growing up and it was again it's like one of those things that like I just applied onl and like got lucky enough to make it through the inter because like it's actually kind of hard to get those jobs too like there was this I went to this recruiting event and there was like a massive number of people there and end up being like a small group of us who who were hired and it was just such a like a few things that are extremely relevant to me today which is like how to talk to people who have like such varying levels of technical background like you go into a conversation and like one like especially being at an Apple store in California like one of the people who I'm trying to help uh you know their phone like could be an engineer at Apple or we were like a stone throw away from the Netflix uh headquarters like could be an engineer from Netflix the next person who comes in could be like a little old grandma who's 80 and like literally has no idea how her phone works and having to meet people where they're at both from like a technical perspective but also like an emotional perspective like I don't think people think a lot about this unless this has happened to you but like the Apple Store is like a really emotional place like from a bunch of different angles whether it's like the excitement of you know getting a new device and like this new cool thing that you're really excited about or like the frustration of like I have something that has my personal data on it has so many of my memories on it and it's not working or like it's not doing the thing that I'm expecting it to do so you you're really like constantly level setting and matching people across these like really wide spectrums and it's such a such a life lesson and I don't think like you you're not forced into that type of like environment on a very consistent basis like many many many like you would I would go out to help customers and like you're really helping someone for five minutes and then you're going on to the next thing for eight hours and like you you know you don't normally in life like get that many shots on goal um to sort of build those skills and I think it was just such a transformative experience for me interesting so like every experience like and you know there's so many other emotions that I feel going into like an Apple Store like oh my gosh I'm about to spend a thousand bucks on a phone or whatever right like this is like uh you know a week's worth of pay or more uh or you know um uh am I getting the right thing like like am I going to look dumb in front of the employee there who knows all this stuff am I going to look like I'm no more sophisticated than you know the geriatric you know person who just needs to use a few features on their phone right uh especially as a developer now when I when I go to like an Apple store or something it's kind of like you know they don't know how to talk to me and at the same time I don't want to see pompus and like oh know all about that you know so I can only imagine like the sheer number of interesting interactions there have been and you did this for like two two and a half years yeah I started as a specialist somebody who like just helps you buy your phone became like a technical uh troubleshooting person became a technical expert and the cool thing for me was like um so like apple does such a great job of like building this pipeline from the from the stores to Apple corporate so I ended up like lots of folks who I worked with were in college and like as they were graduating were fortunate enough to like get jobs at Apple corporate and someone who I knew uh my mentor Omar was uh yeah like got a job at corporate referred me for the internship program I ended up interviewing and they were like at the time I you know was was also going to Harvard and had done some internships and stuff like that so um they were like yeah this is actually like such a perfect set of experiences like they really wanted someone who had Apple retail experience and then when I joined Apple um I was a software engineer like working on retail store apps like there's all these internal applications that power the Apple Store so it was fortunate enough to do that and then uh yeah worked on some machine learning stuff for the Apple Store too so like it was all of these experiences again like in the moment I was like had no idea that it was going to end up being like extremely useful to my actual job in the future having had this retail experience and it ended up being like the differentiator from being between solving these problems like well and not being able to solve them at all well that that's also a testament to the Apple Store and like the administration of it that they saw that you were interested and curious and and you know willing to learn new things and and they gave you kind of the slack to be able to uh progress uh with your skills and and help in other ways rather than I mean amazing like you could be like the number one iPhone salesperson in the store or something like that and like maybe they would be like well we need to keep him here because he's already really good at what he's doing but like they actually let you kind of grow within the role a little bit that's that's really good um and I'm curious like I I don't remember the exact timeline because I spent a great deal of time on your website and your LinkedIn trying to like piece together okay what is the chronology of Logan Patrick but like at what point did you start interning at Nasa yeah so that's a that's a great question and there's so much um I think the the thing that I appreciated about my time in community college is like like it is not um going back to like the differences between like the regular like traditional fouryear college experience like it was not a very social experience so like I had a lot of free time to work at the Apple Store to do a bunch of other stuff because it's like people are like everyone is like so focused on like getting out of dianza actually getting out of Community College is like the thing that people care about like to go on with the next step of their Journey so um I spent a lot of time just like applying for random internships and was lucky enough at the time I was like cold reaching out to people on LinkedIn being who were researchers at Nasa being like hey I'm really interested in the work that you're doing like would love to hear more and like come in and talk and like see how I can help like I'm a have a computer science background and um somebody who I had messaged like three months prior ended up messaging me back being like Oh hey like super cool like you want to come in and like talk and I went in he was like yeah like would love to have you on the team and it was like really really it was like that that simple and that was the first team that I worked with and we were doing some stuff with um with NASA satellites ultimately left that team applied for a bunch of different internships at Nasa after I had a little bit more experience like doing that for a few months and um then joined the team that I ultimately spent like the next like three years on uh using Julia doing a bunch of other stuff so um yeah it's awesome well so again I'm just trying to like distill what you're saying down into actionable insights for people that are listening like don't be daunted don't don't be afraid to hit up some engineer at Nasa and just say like hey are there any roles for me there like that takes a lot of audacity as a community college student who's working at the uh you know Apple Store but we can definitely get into juliia and I'm excited to talk about that but I want to talk about how you transition from going to Danza to going to Harvard because again as we as we said several times before like Harvard is like kind of the educational mecca for so many students it it attracts so many ambitious people every year and it's extremely selective I think it's like three or 4% of people who apply get in uh so maybe you can talk about how you got in and what you did there and the difference maybe compare and contrast Community College where everybody's just trying to get through it to the actual kind of classical college experience that's existed for like 400 years in this country where people like you lived on campus in Harvard yeah it's it's an interesting I I've had a a very unique College Journey so I um at the end of my two years at deanza I was still in California and decided I was going to go to Harvard um started looking for so again I I was part of one of those one of the nontraditional programs at Harvard so I had the capacity like I had to SP spend I had two years left of college I had to spend a year on campus um to fulfill that requirement but I also had a little bit more flexibility like I didn't have to spend both years on on campus I was actually planning to spend both years uh on campus but I this was also when I was interning at Nasa this is also when I was working at the Apple Store um so I I decided and like all happened very quickly like I would have had to like move to Boston like the next month and like move in and like do all stuff I was like well this is a little bit overwhelming like I'll I'll move in in January and like do the next so then I'll spend like three semesters on campus um so I was still at the Apple Store I was still um working uh at Nasa parttime and I was going to I did my like first semester remotely essentially interesting like I didn't even know that was possible what year was this this was 20 uh 2018 okay so it was like correspondence courses or or was it like like Muk type where you're were you watch a lecture no it wasn't M I actually think one of them was more like more like traditional Muk type but the other ones were like live like we were actually on Zoom we were like doing all this stuff like like pre pandemic like I think Harvard was like a little like actually around that corner already like they had this infrastructure set up and like there were students in the classroom there were these like virtual um kind of like what again happens with like virtual classrooms today there was like uh TVs in the classrooms with like where virtual students were dialing in um because part of the part of the like nontraditional angle of this was like also making some of these classes accessible to people who are not um like based in the like who are't US citizens who could like take classes internationally so there people from all over the world like all walks of life which is really interesting um but it it ended up being like the fact that I had stayed at the Apple Store that semester while I was taking those first four classes um the fact that I stayed at NASA while I was doing those classes as well so things got very busy very very quickly that's ultimately when I got my interview and internship offer to come back to work at Apple as a software engine here so had I actually left and gone and done something else like I perhaps wouldn't have had that opportunity so in hindsight I'm really glad and then in the course of a very short amount of time I did my interview to join apple as an intern while I was doing my first semester at Harvard um and like the next week i' had applied for a bunch of other internships and and uh got an interview at Disney to go do um engineering down in Los Angeles and ultimately like got the offer to join Disney and it started at uh in January so I had this plan of like moving to Boston that semester um in the coming January and like that like kind of shifted under my feet as I was like hey this is a really really cool opportunity and also like had I been a part of a traditional program I would not have had the capacity to do that so I ultimately moved to LA in January of 2019 um and like reduced my course load uh and was only taking like two classes that semester because I was working fulltime at Disney at that point and wow uh left yeah left the Apple Store wow that's such like it sounds like you had to do a lot of on thefly planning and uh reworking of your schedule so you worked at Disney for a while uh as a software engineer yeah we we were doing like sis I think it was like system software engineering or something like that but we were building roller coaster simulations which is really really cool so we were part of um we were a like embedded team at the Walt Disney imagineering campus in in LA and focused on like again improving ride throughput and like all these really interesting like roller coaster engineering problems that like people don't think about but like it's a very very very Niche Disney thing but it was it was a ton of fun it was my first like as a as a junior in college was like really embedded in this team and like be was fortunate enough to work with like so many incredible people and it was like I was a real member of the software engineering team like I was doing the same work as they were hand inand side by side the same level of responsibilities it was like a very very like people think about like sometimes internships and like you're getting coffee for someone or whatever like this was like the very opposite end of the spectrum where I was like a true member of this team doing this work and it was so like eye openening to have that experience and be able to like be a real contributor and I I loved it yeah wow uh I saw a really cool like YouTube video about like Space Mountain and like the the throughput in terms of like the number of people how many different you know I guess trains they have going through the ride and like that's exactly what we would do we would literally like build those simulations so that we could be like okay as we tweak these like few parameters and like we change the show or we like slow down the ride here like how does that affect the overall number of people who we can get through this ride in one day without like lowering the experience for people so um we I I worked for a long time on uh the I forgot the Tower of Terror in Florida so we built that Tower of Terror simulation and like did a bunch of modifications so I wonder if it's uh made any impact on the actual ride yeah man that so I mean a lot of mechanical engineering types would that would be like their destination like after a long career they're like finally I'm at Disney where I wanted to be all along doing simulations on you know roller coasters and you're here as a community college student who like or recent like you're here as like basically like a probably like a junior at Harvard taking this reduced load and working at Disney in La like that's got to be a wild uh I mean did you ever have to like wake wake up in the morning and like pinch yourself that like things are actually moving this quickly did you have any inkling that this would happen when you were you know a kid like sophomore year like playing Flappy Bird that it would lead to this I I don't think so and I think like this goes back to like what is the value um like I think Harvard is an incredible institution to like learn a bunch of stuff but I also think like despite you know what what everyone says and despite like all the tradeoffs and downsides like it does open up a lot of doors and I think like had I had I chosen to go to one of those other schools like maybe I wouldn't have had that door open for me and um I'm fortunate and I'm glad that I was able to but I yeah the even looking back now it's like again in hindsight it's like oh yeah this makes a lot of sense but like in the moment it was like all of these like I'm like seeing the like splintering of the fabric of the universe in front of my eyes being like this is weird like I don't think this is what is supposed to be happening but it goes back to like I I didn't talk about this um but the the amount of times that it takes to apply to some of these things when you're somebody who's early career is just like is a little bit mind dumbing like to get my job at to get my internship at NAS at Apple during that time that I was working at the Apple Store I applied like 506 times to different roles and opportunities only specifically at Apple like that wasn't including all the stuff at Nasa that didn't include Disney and like all these other times 500 times just at Apple and I got probably like 10 or 12 different interviews for like different teams for like random fulltime jobs which I was totally not qualified for I don't know why they were interviewing me CU I was like working at the Apple Store in a community college student but somehow they were like oh this kid maybe could do something but then ultimately got the one interview that led to my internship which led to like my fulltime job offer out of those 500 and I think the the lesson is like so many people that I talk to even like folks who are very close to me who have like heard this story from my own mouth and like seen that this experience with their own eyes like they're like yeah you know I apped like five or six times or this thing and like it didn't work out and therefore I'm going to move on to the next thing and I have this posted note sitting above my computer with the with the simple phrase which is measure in hundreds and I think like people are so quick to measure things in a very like small way and like not see it work out and then move on to the next thing and like you really need to measure in hundreds when you're when you're that early in your career because it just takes so like there's just so much blind luck that's involved that that is amazing anecdote that you have a posted measure in hundreds that's definitely a candidate for the title of this podcast episode so let's talk about uh uh Harvard I mean when you eventually get over there as like a a student were you able to actually do three semesters there I I did one so in um fall of 2019 I moved uh to Boston to to Cambridge and actually at the time my little brother had started that program at the University of Pennsylvania which was a again kind of like a hybrid type program so he actually moved to Cambridge with me and we lived um right by uh uh this this Fresh Pond if anyone lives in Cambridge there's this uh Pond that that is really nice to go walk around and hang out near um but we lived right by Fresh Pond and very very overwhelming experience coming because at that time I was now essentially like a senior in college like stepping on to this campus for the first time like not knowing anyone um never having had that it was it was actually like my first time ever going to Harvard so it was just you never even been to the campus never even been to Boston before never been to the campus like first time experiencing that and it was just um yeah very very very overwhelming I think yeah like it was it was like a fine first semester but like all the like normal challenges you can imagine like at at by the time it's senior year of college like everybody has their friend group like everybody has all these other things going on so like again this was a very like I I don't think I was like you know very like um yeah I'm a I'm a a social person by default so like I always I find some like social Outlets like it's not like I was like sad because I didn't meet everyone like it wasn't like a depressing experience but it was just like kind of interesting to like have the observation of like going in as like a complete Outsider and like not really feeling a strong sense of like being a part of the culture um and that that ultimately led to like well we could talk more about it but like me having the time and freedom and desire to like want to go do a bunch of Open Source stuff because I was like hey I'm not connecting with this community that I'm there in person with really like I have this community that I've connected with online and like would love to like do more around that but yeah did my first semester on campus um and then Co happened and then and then spent the next spent the next six months hibernating inside of an apartment um again doing like it was it was you know a lot of bad stuff around Co and it was probably not the idea ideal timing but like it also gave me the forcing mechanism to like spend my time inside contributing to open source and like building my like next career step in in that sense well let's talk about Julia Lang now because that is again a a statistical language that's used by a lot of data scientists a lot of um scientists and maybe you could talk a little bit how you got involved in that community and became one of the more prominent voices uh teaching spreading the gospel of Julia yeah I was again another great example of like how you never know what's going to happen in life so when I applied to the second team that I was on um at Nasa I showed up the first day and they happened to be using a programming language called Julia and like that's as simple as The Story Goes and like as part of that um as part of that process they this was before Julia had hit the 1.0 release like one of the first tasks was like helping migrate some of the initial code bases to like the 7 release which was like the precursor to the 1.01 um and I like things were broken like it stuff wasn't well documented so I just kind of like had to get involved in the community um over time to like fix my own problems uh which is why I like met a bunch of people and then ultimately like I was like oh there's all these really cool opportunities where I could actually contribute and start doing some of this like educational and Community work um and just kind of like step Ste in and initially ran our I don't know if you remember Google codein but it was like Google's kind of Google summer of code but for high school students you could build these tasks and help high school students um so ended up running our initial engagement with Google codin we like mentored like 212 high school students um and it was like this incredibly empowering experience and I was like I really want to do more of this type of work and I reached out to the folks who were like running the actual language and the development of the project and was like Hey I L doing like I did this thing and like I loved it and I would love to do it in a more of an official capacity and they were like awesome we'll bring you on the team um join the team and then like a month in they were like oh we actually have this community manager title that like no one is using right now and like we uh yeah like would you want to would you want to have that title and I was like naively I was like really had never heard of a community manager at that point I was like yeah that kind of sounds fine like I'm happy to take that on and they gave me that title and all of a sudden there was a sort of uh commentator of explosion of like different things that now fell under the umbrella of what I was supposed to be doing um yeah and took on had to take on a lot more work once that happened yeah I can imagine so maybe you can just give us a quick rundown of Julia language obviously used by NASA huge endorsement of its Merit as a language for doing scientific computing uh what are if you had to like pitch the audience on Julia as like hey it's worth learning Julia like what would be your kind of elevator pitch for Julia yeah there's there's three things that so deeply resonate with me um as far as why folks use Julia today one of which is speed so um with Julia you can get like C or C++ level uh code execution um with a high level language still so like with a high level language which like python so it runs a lot faster than python but um yeah still still easy to use I think the second thing and this is one of the things that's a little bit slept on is the package ecosystem and the way that you manage packages in Julia just works they built the language and they're like let's really solve this problem and let's do a bunch of things from a core language design principle that makes it so that you don't run into all the annoying problems that you run into installing python packages so that's something that I love like I never I I still just literally yesterday was running a bunch of code and I was like why is it so annoying to install python packages um so you don't have that problem in Julia and I think the last thing is the language was really purposebuilt um to to make it so that you can like do everything in Julia but also tap into other languages where it's useful so like I I think a lot of languages are like oh like we are the one solution that is going to do this and like you need to move all your stuff to our language if you want to successfully use you know python as an example and um Julia has first class interoperability support between it and like every other large language um so if you have like a you know some python code that you're really happy with and you're like I'm not getting rid of this python code that's fine you can actually keep that python code put it directly into a Julia file and then use Julia for what it's great for and you keep using python for what it what it's valuable for for you as well so I I really love that as like a middle ground between like being super absolutist that you need to move everything to one language um yeah well that seems like a very pragmatic way to position a language when you've got you know the dominant like languages that have that are pretty entrenched like python is is you know a big deal right now and then of course you you've got like R and even mat Lab at like the University Research type level so the fact that Julia it seems very Savvy to them to to make it like uh you don't have to adopt Julia Whole Hog so to speak you you can just uh incorporate it a little bit into your your workflow yeah and really I I also think like Julia at the end of the day like python is so widely distributed that Julia is not really competing against python uh I think Julia is really competing against like the mat Labs of the world and like nobody really likes mat lab that much like matlb you have to pay like it's expensive yeah it's a it's a pain to use like Julia's really aimed at like targeting the core demographic of folks who are using mat lab not really P like I think people who use Python can also use Julia but it's really the mat lab users that were like the core reason that the language was built well I'd be excited to first of all I just want to take a moment to thank you for writing these excellent tutorials on Julia that we published on the Freo Camp Community publication uh tens of thousands of people have learned about Julia thanks to your your thoughtful tutorials so thank thanks for making time to do that yeah that's so cool that's one of the most like rewarding things about writing stuff is knowing that like people actually went and read it and then were able to like hopefully effectively like learn something new so that's that's so cool yeah and I also want to talk a little bit about num Focus which is this really important charity that is you know essentially overseeing like a lot of the key infrastructure that the entire scientific Community relies on uh and you're on the board of the charity so that's a pretty big deal I don't know how big the board is but um being a board member on a charity is like that's not an easy feat to accomplish and there's a lot of responsibility there maybe you can talk a little bit about numb numb focus and and you know they support like conferences like Pi data they're in charge of the projects like Jupiter notebook um numpy like projects that developers use all the time that are dependencies in so many important applications uh how how did you get involved with num Focus yeah it's a great question so num focus is the fiscal host for a ton of Open Source projects which what what that means for folks who aren't super familiar is like if you want to donate money to the pandas project or Jupiter or Julia or something like that num Focus basically acts as the legal entity and the and the bank account for these organization so that open source maintainers like don't need to go and try to figure out how to set up a legal entity and don't need to figure out how to like pay people who are working on code for them and accept donations and do all the taxes so um they take care of all that administrative overhead which is really incredible and and freeing for projects and um I just I got connected through the ecosystem as I was taking on more um ownership in the Julia community and um we needed someone uh we num Focus kind of wanted somebody who was representing some of the non uh nondominant language players on the board um so there was like six other board directors and they were they were looking for folks who like could represent that perspective of projects that like weren't the dominant players and make sure that that voice was heard so uh joined the board at numfocus like over two and a half years ago and it's been it's been super interesting to see like there's so many um how big is focus has today it's like six people um and how frequently do you meet every other week so there's very very active for a for a nonprofit board like usually nonprofit boards meet like twice a year or something like that at uh freeo Camp also 51 C3 public charity um yeah so so you're meeting with them what kind of things are you discussing like what what what would like I mean it's it's probably public information because you probably have to publicly publish the minutes and everything so I hope I'm not prying but like what would a typical board meeting be like what might be on the uh the table yeah we're we're usually talking about like things that are on fire um so there's a there's always a lot of things that are on fire when you have a like a really large like I think proportionally to the amount of developers that are like there is I was doing the numbers like I'm pretty sure the the software that num Focus use it that that like num Focus supports is like downloaded like a billion times a month or something like that so like it's a crazy amount of people and like scope for such a small organization to support so like there's always things going wrong and like as you know like uh nonprofits are like historically under resource so like we're trying to make a lot of things work with like duct tape and glue and like it's very uh it is very difficult so it's a lot of those things I think there's a decent amount of our time is focused on like how do we make sure that num Focus as a nonprofit like stays like financially solvent so like we're we're going and talking to large operations about like how do we how do we partner with them to like get money in the door um I know you you have to do this all the time to like keep the lights on at free code camp and like it's not the most exciting thing to do sometimes but like it's important and like at the end of the day we have all these open source projects that are relying on the services that we provide and like if we don't keep if we don't stay solvent if we don't keep the lights on we can't pay people to do the work that's required to support these projects so it's um that that is often times like priority number one is how do we make sure we have money coming in the door so that we can provide services to projects uh there's there's a bunch of fun stuff too like getting to focus on and like help support um a bunch of our PI data events which are just like this Global distributed network of um of events for developers who are building with the scientific tools that we support um but it's a lot of putting out fires it's a lot of um it's a lot of trying to make sure we have money coming in I can imagine all right so of course Logan a a little more than a year ago you got a job at open aai the company that everybody's been like focused on for the past um really since chat GPT dropped and of course a lot of people were interested in it way back in gp2 you know uh era using the playground and stuff like that and I really enjoyed watching it evolve from something that was kind of a novelty like this is cool I can see how this could be useful to something that I use probably like eight or 10 times a day right so like it's a dramatic uh shift and I'll say I didn't immediately see the value in chat GPT 3.5 but like GPT 4 I was like oh this is this is really cooking and um a lot of people were like H I'm not sure if it's useful because it so hallucinates and stuff like that but I I was able to kind of push past that and really start to figure out ways that I could use this really productively and the hallucination itself I think has has decreased but that's a whole lot of for me to talk about but basically what I'm interested in hearing from you is like how do you perceive this as somebody uh both from the outside as a user of uh these tools uh of the foundation model and of the many other ecosystem tools and uh then maybe you can compare and contrast that with what it's like to actually work at open AI yeah I'm it's it's incredible to see how much how how everyone when gbt 4 came out was like this changes everything like everything whether I'm an engineer or in some other job like this is going to change everything and I think that's true in many ways and then it's also interesting how subtly humans adapt to this change and then now all of a sudden it went from this thing is crazy and it's going to change everything to like hey I'm just using this as a tool in my job eight times a day and like that's how I feel as a as an engineer as somebody who's who's using uh chat gbt and gbt for or to like help me write better code honestly is like the main use case that I'm I'm playing around with these days um I want to ship some new feature and like I'm not a typescript expert and I want to go and have ch gbt help me write better typescript code and like honestly it takes the first pass at like most of the code that I write these days like I'm I'm not like scribbling things down by hand and like doing it myself I'm I'm having chbt do it and then going in and debugging and troubleshooting I think a lot of the like same skills that you learn and a computer science education which is just like trying to fix things that are broken essentially is my is my like gut instinct of like what programming really is um is like very much true in the world of chbt as well like sometimes it's going to make assumptions or hallucinate things or uh Miss some context that was that you didn't give it or it it maybe just gloss over um and it's it's just that that debugging trait I think as an engineer becomes like so much more important um and so much more like visible as you're using codee that's been generated by AI in some capacity um yeah and I I think for like on the inside it's like absolute cha not not absolute chaos from like the like chaos perspective but like the the speed at which people are moving is is incredible to see and I think it's like super inspiring and it's something that I really like how fast we're we're we're building towards um stuff and like also not from like this like very high level like changing the world speed perspective but it's like there are all these like very very tangible problems that like people have brought up because like now there's millions of people who are using our platform and our tools and like I appreciate the speed at which people are solving those problems like hey I'm a user I have this bug we go and tackle that like really really quickly and and I love that like hey it would be awesome if as a developer you know we had these higher levels of abstraction on top of some of the chat completions and completion tools and like awesome we went and built assistance for people so that they don't have to manage the conversation history themselves all those kinds of things like there's just so much urgency and in doing what users and developers are asking us for and I love that yeah so as a developer like you mentioned earlier just like using it to kind of Coach you on typescript like here's some typescript I wrote like how can this be more I guess succinct or how can it be less prone to errors or something like that right um can you give some other examples of how you use uh GPT just like in your daytoday workflow like do you have like a chat GPT window open or do you have some sort of like uh you know Chrome brow browser extension that like hits the API and like does other stuff like how do you consume GPT yeah I'm a I'm a big um I'm a big chat gbt user like I actually I I use sometimes I use like copilot and cursor folks have tried cursor before it's like a intelligent uh IDE that's like built with AI first Primitives um but really I like I like chat gbt I like having the same experience that our users do and like honestly what what usually ends up happening is I go into one of the code bases that I'm working in I copy a big typescript file and I paste it in chat gbt and I say hey like here's the file that I'm working with like this is what I want to do in plain English I want to add X Y and Z feature um it should do you know have these different characteristics like help me do that and chyt literally will like take that first pass at like writing all the code that I need um I think the challenging part today for using chat gbt to do this is like again there's like all this Nuance of the context that it's missing like it knows what's in that file but like it doesn't know the like seven files that I've imported and like I can't really like in some cases I can copy and paste multiple files but all that context is sometimes overwhelming to the to the model just like and and I love drawing these analogies like just like it would be overwhelming for a human like if I went and sent you like thousand lines of code and I'm like oh help me do this thing you're like okay hold on this is going to take me a while because that's a lot of code to digest so I think people uh often times like forget that these models are trained oftentimes in like ways that humans interact and understand and read things so like some of the limitations that we run into are the same limitations that um that the models are going to run into like hallucinations is a great example of this as as well like I might say something that like in my my probability distribution and my head is like very true and like that does not mean that like it is an empirical fact in the world uh just because like I feel deeply that it's true and like the models are exactly the same way like based on the the information the model was trained on it thinks something is true um does that mean that that it's agreed upon by everybody in the world probably not in a lot of cases but um it's interesting to have that perspective I mean eventually you start to get into philosophy and like epistemology and like uh what is the nature of Truth what is the nature of reality like how could this be expressed in how do you arrive at a consensus on this how do you uh Express like balance like some scientists believe this but there's some small contingent that believes this you know like it doesn't necessarily have the uh if it went into every single pedantic detail people would stop using GPT right they'd be like oh my goodness it's like it's like uh um ask asking a dictionary or something like that right like yeah it it has to figure out kind of like how to cut to the Chase and figure out what to uh assume away right in terms of giving tur answers that are actionable and at the same time you know GPT does apologize for itself a lot and it's always kind of like well there's not yet like consensus on this or there's not uh um like I don't have the latest version of information on this so events could have changed and there's all this kind of like almost boiler plate that that sometimes shows up in in the responses and um I I think a lot of that is just an admission that reality is incredibly complicated or complex even yeah yeah I think that's why I'm kind of excited for for agents to like go out and be able to like get some of that like in the moment context that would be like really helpful and like get like the yeah get a lot of the nittygritty details because it is like um like I I hear people in the feedback that like it's kind of uh frustrating sometimes when the model gives you answers like that where it's like trying to be nuanced but like it just ends up not being really nuanced and just kind of likeah um so I I hear people on that and like I I think there's like a bunch of really interesting like technical um and like social things that that we'll hopefully be able to to try and and see if that helps improve those situations yeah like what do you think the the most immediate wins that are going to be realized over the next few years with uh well we'll talk specifically about chat gbt and this kind of like conversational user experience uh what do you think the like is it increasing the context window is it uh speeding up the processing uh like like what are the the biggest things that you think are going to have the the most profound net benefit to people like me and you that just use GPT to get things done all day yeah this is a great question I think those two that you mentioned speed context windows are huge ones I think they needs to be some there needs to be more reasoning that happens at the model level today the model is like truly just a token predictor like it is going you're going to put something in it's going to predict the next token like there is like people like use that as some proxy for it like thinking behind the scenes but it's not it's not thinking like it is truly just generating tokens um so I think there needs to be some ability for the model to like actually think about problems and I I don't know what what that will what that will look like um I also think like from a tooling perspective I think the models need to be able to like go and fetch the information that it does not know the answer to it needs to be able to like actually go and get you empirical information and like today the modelist is too uh too likely to just kind of like give you the answer that it thinks is going to be true without like validating that in some cases and like often times it's it's still correct but like it would be nice to like see see some proof of work and like know that it's actually done this computation or it's gone and pulled up these certain things to make sure that something is true I think that's going to be awesome I think the very last like very tactical piece is today and again using the human analogy the models are so inclined to just answer the question that you asked it and I think that's partially because of the way that the model is trained and it wants to like provide value as soon as possible but in a sorry I don't mean to interrupt you but I just want to Riff on what you were saying like if you were to ask a university Professor they would step back and say well a better question would be XYZ but because it's a a bot essentially it's in this there's this power Dynamic like the user is so much more powerful than the the bot that's doing the user's bidding and it doesn't want to like upset you or get all uppity or something like that because humans are like I'm the user damn it you know like do what I say and so so to some extent it it might give you what it thinks you want to hear as opposed to like gently pushing back and saying well that's that's not the right question to be asking or something like that right uh yeah it beol there like professorial mode or something like maybe that's just a prompting thing like you're an academic you know you're an expert in this field and you don't mind pushing back against my naive questions or something like that maybe if I prompted it differently uh I could get that kind of experience but um sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your flow but I just wanted to point that out that a lot of the frustration people may have is just by design of like it is a product that it wants people to use it right like so there are some accommodations that have been made to make it not like you know extremely like contrarian or something yeah and to go like one level deeper on like why this actually happens like this is a very um very like intentional design decision that's been that's been made so like the whole like the model essentially it has this pre training stage where it has this large Corpus of information it's trained on all that like large Corpus of text and really the goal is like just predicting the next token based on all that text after it finishes that process it goes into this reinforcement learning with human feedback loop and this is where it sort of learns this behavior of like how do I interact with humans how do I give answers to the questions that they're asking and like you know if you were to like really plain and simple like look at the data that's being trained for these models for that reinforcement learning with human feedback cycle it's like I have this question here is the answer to the question I have this question here is the answer to this question like that's the way that the model has been trained which is why it it acts like that um and there are things you can do like the prompting is a great example of this like you can and I've seen a bunch of great examples online of people using custom instructions or gbts to be like like always ask me clarifying questions like always come to me and like try to help me get to a better uh like a better base question um and that really does improve the performance of the model but I think it's also like very fundamentally it's a byproduct of the way that these models are trained and I think like in the future we'll have probably models that are like trained in a slightly different way that like maybe push back on people a little bit more if they want that yeah and uh do you think that that's G do you think there's going to be like a bifurcation of products in the sense that like you can choose the model that's more like concerned with like probabilistic veracity and things like that versus just um you know being more amiable I think we've really focused on uh building like general purpose models that can do a lot of these different use cases well so I'm hopeful that like I think you know you actually probably could today take some problem space and like integrate like 25 different models and like have some really like complex logic about like what models are used in what situations and what types of questions I think like that's that's possible I I don't think you'll end up getting the best solution to a lot of the things by doing that because there's so much nuance and I think what probably makes the most sense is like just having one great model that hopefully is trained on like this really nice distribution of data um that can answer questions and like put it in different modes and stuff like that well that brings me to another question which is the developer ecosystem uh you know people adopting the open AI API you were open ai's first developer it higher famously and uh so one of the big things you're doing is trying to get people to adopt this and build on top of it uh and uh I'm curious like what are some of the companies in the space that are in your assessment doing a really good job of building on top of the open AI API yeah this is a great question I think one of my favorites uh people who have done this in a really thoughtful way is KH Academy KH Academy was one of the original gbd for launch partners and we we got them early access to the model and they were really pushing on like you know cellc cons uh and this is like hits close to home for you I'm sure because I think there's a lot of parallels between pre code camp and and KH Academy but um I think salon's vision is being able to give students like every student in the world the worldclass education and uh enabling that using like personalized AI tutors and they released this Con Mingo product and did such an incred like there so much Nuance in bringing AI to students around the world and having it actually be like an amplifier and not a tool that just like people use as a crutch and I think K Mingo has like really threaded the needle on this super well like if if folks have tried the product before um it actually like despite the model really wanting to give an answer and like being trained in many cases to like just give you the answer to the question that you asked they've done a bunch of things to add guard rails so so that students using Kingo don't actually uh just get the answer when they ask her the question they like actually get like the the reasoning and like they get more questions like the question goes back to them about like you know how would you approach this like how like here maybe here are some things to think about and like trying to guide people towards the answer and it it's a really great like they've done a great job of like the intersection between like the core technology and like the user experience like really matching up in this perfect yeah yeah and Khan Academy of course uh I think you and I have both read s Khan's book um and yeah like what they're doing for kids free Cod camps aming to do for busy adults essentially uh love we're we're not yet using um we don't yet have a chat bot uh we we decided to like wait until it was like a little bit more mature because there wasn't like any urgency we've already got this forum where we do essentially that like we use kind of a Socratic method of helping people answer their own questions essentially rather than just you know here's the answer right because I mean there's plenty of wikis and like every single Freo Camp challenge has like the solution is probably a million places uh all over the internet but if you don't want the raw solution if you want to be guided toward the answer and like make the same kind of like cognitive leaps that would be involved in discovering that for yourself like you can kind of do that just through conversation and that's where I'm really bullish on using uh GPT is one of the big things I use it for is language learning and so I'll ask a lot of questions like like you know can you guide me toward uh and I'll ask these in different foreign languages so but I'll ask uh questions about um what would be a usage pattern that would work really well in this situation and maybe try not to give it get it to give me an exact sentence but maybe just a structure and then I can say like this and then it'll be like oh yeah like that that's a that's a or not quite this is more like try try doing this try using this grammatical marker or whatever right so yeah I I mean that that's awesome what are some other companies that are using uh the open AI API in interesting ways that you think are impactful and that you think I think uh represent like um something that other companies could seek to emulate yeah another really interesting one on the topic of like interfaces that like really bring this technology to life I don't know if you've seen the demos of TL draw um it's this it's this yeah it says interface where it's essentially like a blank canvas and you can use prompting to like and drawing to like generate images and a bunch of other stuff but the the basic idea is like the form factor for AI today for so many people is like chat experiences and people like Chad they do text in text out maybe add some images and I think TL draw is really pushing on this idea that like what maybe could be more useful than chat in some cases is this like Infinite Canvas experience and being able to like you know take all these different like our our lives are very like I'm looking at my desk it's like almost this Infinite Canvas that I'm like have in my physical world and um it like brings to life all the things that I need and I'm really excited for the for AI experiences to move more towards things like that where like they're these very unique interfaces which like actually bring this technology to life and a different way than just like a chat chat in and out so yeah I think 2024 we're going to see so many more products that are like that where it's like this different user experience I'll link to uh a demo I'll see if I can find a demo but maybe you can just describe verbally like how it works so like I draw something and then it's like like this like does it does it enhance my stick figures or how does it work yeah exactly that so it's using like image models and some Vision models and and uh text prompting models to take what you draw and actually turn it into something something super crazy um and that's just like one like that that's like they've built all of these different demos but it's really like the underlying technology that powers that demo is this like Infinite Canvas experience where like you can go and like interact with like Ai and also like multiplayer with other humans and like really like bring some of this stuff to life that I don't think like traditional chat experiences really allow you to do so it's it's super cool yeah and multimodal is like a big thing that uh GPT has been incorporating and just the notion that you can like feed in images you can feed in uh potentially video you can feed in like all all kinds of different media into it and then it can kind of Riff on that um and and that's something that like what are some ways that you see that being impactful over the next year or two yeah that's a great question I think like vision is one of the biggest unlocks for these systems like I I when I was working at Apple as a machine learning engineer the project that I was working on was uh being able to predict the tradein price of an iPhone based on pictures of it so we actually if you go into the store today and you trade in your phone they do this they take pictures they run the machine learning model that we trained um and it predicts based on the condition of the phone the uh price of it and a very very difficult machine learning problem because of all these different constraints and I'm I saw Vision come out and I was it was this moment where I was like there's so many of these types of problems in the world and like they're very very narrow problems but they require this deep and nuanced understanding of the world and all of these different things and that model can actually do like the vision model can do way better probably at this problem than this like very domain specific custom model that we spend hours and hours weeks and weeks months and months training um and it's it's super interesting I think there's going to be like tons of those like really small use cases that are unlocked now because you have a model that like really understands the world I think like going back to language learning you mentioned like one of the coolest use cases I've seen for vision so far has been like people traveling in other countries and you can literally just like snap a picture of some random building in Italy and be like tell me the history of this and like really bring it to life for me and like you have this personalized guided tour now of everywhere in the world by just like pictures of things which I don't think was possible before yeah and probably even a lot of like very mundane things like like what bird is this like you know things like that like and of course there are lots of you know bird computer vision apps that have been in the app store for probably years at this point but just the the fact that there's a single model that's kind of powering all this stuff is new and and one of the things that surprised me learning more about uh gp4 and about llms in general is just how how surprising a lot of the emergent properties of just having such a massive model have been can you talk a little bit about that because that is just mindblowing the fact that like for example you can dramatically improve illustrations by teaching uh or essentially by having it like verbalize to itself like oh this this property like using English language as kind of like an intermediary step between one drawing and another drawing uh as I naively understand working can can you explain how that works yeah I I don't know if I'll have a good explanation or like what the right direction to take it is but I think the the what you mentioned is very true and actually to like abstract it to like developers a little bit more the text being this like interface layer like text for large language models is essentially like thought for humans like you know when I want to do something I think about it text is really that interface layer like as you're building different applications incorporating different modalities whether it's like image generation or image understanding or text generation or or speech even or or like audio processing the the layer between all of those is text and I think it's really fascinating that that's that's like what that's like one of the emergent characteristics of all of these things is like that it's text that's the interface between all those and I don't think like if you would ask people 20 years ago what would be like I think people have assume that like I don't know the models would be like talking binary to one another or something like weird and abstract and esoteric like that and it's actually really cool for us as humans to be able to see like it is actually T like they're actually doing kind of the same thing that we're doing which is really interesting yeah and like I mean text is kind of the stuff of thought language right and uh so it is really interesting that computers can work very similar to how humans work now obviously like kind of like your internal monologue and like all these different things there only one part of memory only one part of experience but I I think as a complete lay person who doesn't know much about psychology I do feel that like a lot of the ways I code things into my memory are how I kind of think about them in terms of language like it was a splendid day and man that Sunset looked just like you know a smash bottle of champagne against like a yacht or something like I don't know just like random like kind of ways that would like just have these little insights and and they stick with me you know ways to think or or when you read a book I mean books can be so illustrative and it's just words on a page and yet it can be this really um Vivid experience if you're reading a wellwritten book uh it can almost feel like you're you're like having a dream it it it can be that level of resolution uh so it it's very interesting that computers can work so similar like how humans work and that even though like a an artificial neural network is not exactly like the neural network that we're using in our brain that so much of it is Sim like the degree of similarity is staggering to me that that that is what we arrived at it wasn't like semantic logic or one of these other branches of AI that we've been going down for the past 60 years but it was uh neural networks that got us there and and I'm not saying that it's like the last step I'd be interested in your you're thinking like do you think that this that we've kind of hit on something here and that this is the way we get to artificial general intelligence is through using neural networks or do you think that it's going to be some combination of different disciplines or do you think this will get us there yeah it's a good question I think there need there fundamentally needs to be like additional layers like I still think there's a ton of breakthroughs my my intuition is that you could sort of take the existing gbt Paradigm and like it will continue to scale up like you know the gbt fs the gbt 6s of the world whatever in the future um but there will have to be like fundamentally different changes like just transformers just like next token prediction is like a very poor proxy for like what actual general intelligence and again maybe maybe that will turn out to be wrong and like this will be the thing that works really really well and continue to scale but I think they'll have to be like going back to that like reasoning piece like I think reasoning is something that has to really happen for these models to start like taking on much more complex tasks like that we as humans today yeah yeah well we can talk philosophically about like AI but I want to get back into the kind of the nittygritty of of Logan Kilpatrick and his journey into open AI so you joined like right after chat GPT hit the world and became like the fastest adopted consumer product of all time basically um what was it like because it was a pretty small organization uh it is a 51 C3 charity that's kind of like swallowed this giant whale of a forprofit entity but but like like and and you've got like Microsoft there you've got like so many different things going on you got this incredibly charismatic founder uh you've got all these uh brilliant and and many idealistic people that work at open AI like what was it like uh first of all I guess maybe first question how did you get that job and then maybe you can talk about what it was like starting that job yeah I started interviewing back in like June of 2022 and literally just applied online I was like hey this is was was thinking about doing something different and found a job applied online started interviewing and at the time they're actually um I by the time like I got to the actual like inperson interviews and started going through some of the rounds they I had moved back to Chicago and they were looking for someone in San Francisco at the time so I was like yeah it's not for me I just moved back I I love my girlfriend she's in Chicago um they ended up reaching out like 3 months later and they're like hey we're actually willing to hire someone remotely now um and like continued the interview process ultimately end up getting the job offer accepted did all this stuff the whole pitch to begin with was like hey we have these models like gbt 3. 5 like it's incredible it can do so much stuff but like developers don't really know what to build with this like come help us uh help develop like figure out how to help developers and build really cool things um and they were like yeah we also have these other like really really crazy models but like we can't tell you about it till you join uh which ultim ended up being gbt 4 um but again at the time like it was not clear that like it was about to be this Breakaway success of like all this like crazy stuff that people associate with open AI today and my first day was uh the Tweet by Sam of open AI of chat gbt hitting a million users and it kind of like started to like really The Narrative started to blow up from there um it when I joined I was on our like developer platform team and at the time it was like six or seven people who were like building the entire ire API and all of the infrastructure for developers like literally just that six or seven person team um really really small and like moving so quickly and I think the thing that like people uh don't don't pick up on sometimes is like you have this like moment of success and then all of a sudden we have like millions and millions of people showing up to use J gbt we have millions and millions of people showing up to use our developer platform um your intuition is like oh like perfect you know you money we we'd gotten we'd like rais money from Microsoft and we announced it at that time as well um you know just go hire a bunch of people and like I think people who have not been close to the hiring process don't realize like how it it like takes time to like spin up that hiring engine so even by the time we got to the gbt 4 launch and the cat gbt API launch in um in March of 2023 like we still really hadn't grown that significantly because like it takes time to interview people like people have to leave their jobs they have to move they have to do all this stuff it's really counterintuitive too just for uh anybody who hasn't worked on an engineering team like just what you were talking about earlier getting context into the Legacy codebase understanding like just the human element of being on a team and interacting with new people who's doing what like what do I do like there's so much kind of onboarding necessary to get somebody from being like I mean frankly like a net negative when they're first starting out they're taking time away from other things so they can gradually get up to the break even and then ultimately they'll be a net positive the longer they stay the more kind of return on investment you get on bringing them onto the team but yeah there's definitely like a spooling up process and I can only imagine what it would be like with all that pressure on uh basically everybody like the the dominant like like I saw like the top article uh on Wikipedia for 2023 was I think it was the open AI or Chad gbt one of those two right so so I can only imagine and then everybody's like expecting like magic Microsoft money to just instantly make everything better but the reality is there's still a lot of work to do even when you have the resources to bring on good people right yeah and we've been like the the caliber of folks who have joined the team is is so incredibly high and so amazing like I actually think a lot of people and this is like I think become implicitly part of open AI culture but like you join and I've worked with so many people who have joined and their first week they're like a major contributor to some like huge launch like i' I've like the yeah the Chad gbt API like we had folks joining like literally that week and they just like saddled up and like started shipping code and like it's incredible to see like so I mean there is that there is still that like spin up time but I think also when you like you can sort of mitigate some of that by finding folks who have experiences that that like really translate well to building what we're building and like we're fortunate enough from a API side to like get a bunch of folks from like places like stripe who have built this incredible developer platform and a bunch of apis that are similar um so it it does help like reduce that spinup time and then folks like ship stuff on their first day which is uh crazy and like not the normal there so many places like and again this is not like a a picking on Facebook or casting judgment on them but like you know I Facebook's like one of their core things was like you join and you go through like a six week uh Facebook like engineering like boot camp essentially to like learn the things that Facebook does and it's like a very different culture than like than at least in the context of well I mean to to some extent it sounds like you all didn't necessarily have the time and energy to build up that system uh I mean you said the engineering team was like six people building chat gbt and building the the opening so like maybe you could talk about the composition of the the company or the charity I'll just use the word company uh because I know like I'm not I'm from the charity owns the charity owns the the the actual capped profit company but like all the employ like the majority of the employees work for the cap like I work for a a capped profit that's owned by a nonprofit and the the ca Profit just in case anybody's curious what that means essentially it's it's like a traditional you know company where people hold stock but uh the people who invest like they they can maximum the maximum amount of money they can get out is 100x their initial investment or something like that right um yeah I don't know what it is specifically for us but that's part of the intent is like there's some there's some capped amount of upside for investors and employees and then the rest of the upside like flows back to that charity um which which has like a fiary duty to benefiting Humanity instead of a fiduciary duty to like maximizing profits for shareholders which is the normal structure yeah so so a lot of people might be like well why is this a nonprofit how is this a charity or something like legally you know I've I've spent a lot of time studying it like it it's a a different type of Charity from like the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders or Freo Camp uh but it it is still uh technically a charity and like I don't think that's a controversial thing inside the charity world or anything but uh I guess uh I'll just call it the company since you're within the the capped forprofit that's inside the charity um so uh one question I have for you is like you said that um like there were like six or seven people working on the actual products that people were using like What proportion of the team when you joined was just scientists like people actually doing the training of the models and and building doing doing the the basic science that that would ultimately be productized um What proportion of the team was that versus the actual engineering and product side yeah so we had like those six or seven folks on the just on the API side Chad chbt has like a separate um it's a separate team from like our API developer platform form team so I think there was at least a few uh probably like I I don't know at that time whether I was going to say a dozen but that sounds much too ambitious for yeah so it was even fewer than it dozen basically they built I think it was like the actual user interface yeah exactly and the research team is uh very intentionally small I think it it was probably a much larger portion when I joined I was like employee like 280 or something like that um at the end of the at the end of last year we at like 750 so a ton of growth and um it's interesting like the research team has not grown significantly and I saw uh a great tweet from one of the researchers on our team who is actually talking about how in many cases and this is kind of unintuitive um especially coming from an engineering world where I don't think this is necessarily always true but for every new incremental researcher you add to um a research organization it's actually like a net loss for every other researcher like independent of like the like helping that person on board you could never talk to that person in your time um as a researcher and it would still be a net loss for you for that person to join in general and the reasoning is because you have this allocation this pool of gpus and if you're a researcher and you need the currency of research at openai is gpus you know you now have to give off a thousand of your gpus to some other person who's going to try a bunch of other stuff in their research and like all of a sudden you know you're now less effective as a researcher because you can't try as many things you can't scale things up as much um and again there's Nuance this like you could come in with some optimization technique that enables everyone to be more effective and then now it's like a plus 10% gpus foreverone or something like that but it's interesting and that's part of the reason why our research organization hasn't scaled up a ton is because you need gpus and we live in a world where we're constrained by the number of gpus it's interesting it's almost like we're going back to the the days of like the Mainframe when like researchers would fight for time slot to actually use the computer because the GPU is so expensive and so scarce that becomes the gating Factor rather than the actual human Talent it's also funny that it's like you could have all the money in the world that doesn't actually matter like I could show up like today me I could personally have1 billion dollars of cash to go and buy and it doesn't matter because there aren't any gpus to buy like there are no free GP like the G yeah there back order for like years and it's like this super long spin up process to to get more gpus and I think that's why like us working so closely with Microsoft and Azure like they've been an incredible partner and like getting us the resources that we need to continue to push on the frontiers of these models and and serve traffic to chbt customers so I don't think anyone is um I have nothing but good things to say about Azure I don't think anyone is like pushing on things as as much as Azure is from a GPU perspective so are there a lot of efforts to try to figure out ways like I guess compression hacks to like reduce uh the size of the model dramatically so you need fewer gpus to be able to run it and and train it or like like I assume that there are lots of different branches of research into that to like kind of try to solve that bottleneck yeah 100% I think there's there's been ongoing stuff like there's actually been things that we've done that have led to like the model potentially in some cases being smaller but in in principle it's like there's only so much of that you can do without some like crazy new breakthrough like a lot of that work is actually like more like pure engineering effort like you can do a lot of things to like make it so that the models are smaller and more efficient and stuff like that and like it's more from a engineering perspective I think like there really needs to be some research breakthroughs and I think a lot of people are actually like Microsoft is doing some of this work I've seen others doing this work like the small model uh sort of movement of like how much can you get with some of these smaller models and I think it's important that people do that research because there's a lot of use cases that don't work or aren't feasible today because of how large these models are could there be like a at home type uh solution for training models or or is just fundamentally like a different engineering problem where like having a whole bunch of compute on a whole like millions of computers like said at home if you're familiar with that like that was like the search for extraterrestrial life they had a whole bunch of uh I guess data that they needed to munge and the way that you could help was you could install this thing whenever your computer was idling it would help crunch on the uh the data for seti and send it back to them uh I mean could there be like an equivalent type effort where you could you could have people opt in uh to to use their computer or is you're just you're digging for coins in the couch at that point like would that work in any way yeah I think at the scale that we operate today and like the scale that we'll operate in the next few years like and and I I'm just kind of making up this based on my intuition so I don't actually have the real numbers but like I don't think that that would make like even if you got every like like uh every iPhone in the world signed on to this thing to like give it spare compute I don't think you would actually it would end up giving like that much net benefit um just because like the hard it's like if you look at the hardware that's used to train models it's like the A1 100s and h100s are like custombuilt like science experiments that are like built for one thing and it is like very expensive and does that one thing really really well and like I just don't I I don't think like the hardware would actually allow you to do what you need to do do you know if like Google's TPU like the tensor processing units and things like that are those like competing for you know Foundry space over in uh Taiwan at uh uh what is it Taiwan semiconductor Corporation tsmc um like uh is there any like clear kind of like opening like uh I guess end to this bottleneck in sight or is it just going to be years and years of like having to build out additional Foundry uh capacity like I think we're doing that here in the US it's just kind of like an energy Independence for compute type movement but uh like like how long do you think it's going to remain a key constraint yeah I'm I'm guessing if you if you dig a little bit into this and I'm not an expert at all I've just like read a few articles here and there but um it's actually fascinating that there's like all of these all of these points of failure in that existing system today and it's unclear to me like how much is by Design because there's like lots of of corporate interests and and such involved but like you know one of the like machines that you'll need is like only made by this one company and like it's like the one company that supplies all of these types of Mach for every Fab and it's like well they don't make any more of those because like they're also constrained by these five other things and it's just like this incredibly complicated supply chain I think like there are a bunch of like bright uh opportunities like I think like bringing some of those back to the us bringing faps back to the us is going to be super important uh South Korea has become like a huge uh location for new faps you went South Korea I heard I saw on Twitter you were there for how long like three days like literally I was 36 hours flying 36 hours on the ground that is crazy what did you do while you were there what was so important that you endured all that jet lag and all that travel we we were doing an event with the um South Korean government the ministry for for small business and yeah we're fortunate enough to like get to hear from and and essentially be like see the pitch from um 20 plus uh South Korean startups and see some of the stuff that they're working on it was it was super empowering to yeah to see like The Innovation is not just happening in San Francisco it's not just happening in the US like there's people all over the world who are pushing on it and pushing on like the very Regional problems as well like so many startups in South Korea uh like Logistics and the supply chains of of Asia are like top of mind for them um and they're really really interesting Solutions and like using the models in different ways to try to solve some of that stuff so it was super cool to to see that it was a ton of fun well I don't want to tease any proprietary data out of you or anything like that uh but just like in terms of the next big model like I GPT 5 or GPT 4.5 or something like that like how how soon do you think we're likely to see that has has any of that work commenced in terms of like in Earnest have they actually started training models at this point yeah I'm not 100% sure whether or not like what the status of of training stuff is just because I'm I'm abstracted away from it um so I I won't come on on that I think my my assumption just like as somebody who's like followed the progression of these models mod um is like hopefully we'll have something cool this year and like um yeah I mean I'm I'm biased and like I love developer Stu so like I'm hopeful that it comes out on developer day like that'd be a ton of fun to like showcase something like that to the world but um yeah I think it'll be it'll be really cool and people have such high expectations for whatever we do next so um I think that adds a ton of pressure for us to to build something incredible that people want and I have a ton of faith in the team like I think the scaling laws are are in our favor and like there's there's a like gbt 4 was the first Model this was part of the technical report that we released it was the first Model where we could like reliably predict how powerful that model was going to be and the capabilities based on the amount of compute that we put in so I'm really fascinated to see like when the next iteration of this model comes out like does that scaling law hold true or not so it'll be interesting to see in terms of like using software uh on top of the model to like improve the quality of results and stuff like that like I this is a super vague question and it might seem like extremely uh ignorant but like what percentage of performance juicing can we get out of just like good software engineering on top of the model that we already have like let's say hypothetically there was never a GPT 5 and we just had to deal with the tech that we have today how much better do you think we could improve it just by uh you know new prompting techniques or um new you know Frameworks and things like that sitting on top of it uh consuming the a API and like mixing that with other uh techniques yeah I there's probably a a a pretty close like endof the line threshold I think people would figure I mean I think there's like always going to be interesting Innovation that you could do around prompt engineering and stuff like that but I do think like gbt 4 has a bunch of fundamental limitations and it's like just because of the data that it's been trained on and like how long it's been trained and all that stuff um so I think we need we do need new models I'd imagine you could probably like you know really cleverly figure out with a lot of engineering work like you know how to get like 50% better performance or something like that but even still it's like what does that 50% actually look like like what does it mean along sub probably right there will be like all all the benchmarks and stuff to evaluate it maybe better performance on some esoteric test that nobody takes right exactly right yeah um okay so so last question uh free form question what are some things that people could be using GPT 4 and and the open a AI API that they don't that they may not necessarily realize it's extremely good at and useful for like maybe if you could just list off some use cases that you think are really interesting and uh that people may not be aware of that they might be able to go and try themselves yeah I think that this is the most exciting reason uh for the GPT store so like the the reality is like as a as some somebody who's using AI like I I live in Chicago and I talk to people all the time who like aren't part of the AI or technology bubble and they go and use chat gbt and they're like what do I do like it's this blank thing and like it's not super clear to me I think gpts really solve this problem like you have this very tangible experience that you're sending to Someone Like You know it could be things as simple as like generating logos for your company like doing goal planning like I I was working on a GPT to like help me plan my uh like not not okrs but like the similar version ofr which is basically like a performance review uh for team members that you manage or something like that right exactly like planning all the different things that that I I need to actually go and do and um I my my girlfriend made uh planty which is like a house plant GPT and and for gardening and you can like get advice on how to like take care of your plants and hopefully none of my plants will die because I'm using planty to like help keep them alive like there's so so many like every tangible thing that you could imagine is possible with gpts and now we have the GPT store and you can go in and like search for some of these things use them and like there's so much more that we're going to push on with gbts to allow them to like actually take actions on your behalf so like plan a trip for you and like help you book the tickets and like find stuff like that we talked about like the tour guide example like I think all of those are are such exciting use cases and it's going to take a while for all these use cases to shake out like uh I mean we're still figuring out new uses for spreadsheets you know 30 years later right 40 years later so um well it's been an absolute privilege learning so much from you Logan uh hearing about your own developer Journey uh the tenacity the uh measuring in hundreds uh as you've applied for various jobs and and been incredibly successful at applying to uh companies uh applying uh to universities and uh getting on the board of num Focus again I just want to emphasize what a huge deal that is you have so much power and so much responsibility helping oversee and sustain these various uh you know scientific Computing projects that we all rely on whether we know it or not every day so uh I just want to thank you again for coming on and I want to emphasize that anybody who is interested in AI should definitely be following Logan on Twitter uh he's got a pretty active Twitter account there uh he writes a lot on medium uh hopefully we'll get some more free C Camp tutorials at some point when he has some time about various things if you want to write about like you know open AI API or something like that we we would be thrilled to publish some stuff on that uh but I I just want to thank you for coming on man uh I'm going to add some notes uh show notes that include some links to some various things we've talked about and also things that Logan thinks you might be interested in so uh thanks again for coming on man viny this was a ton of fun and and hopefully like the takeaway for folks is like you can do it like there's so much opportunity in the world and I think especially with everything that's happening in AI like this is such a such a moment to get involved in a new space and like the beautiful thing is like there's no experts like this just started like you can get in and like in six months like be the person that people are going to and like I felt this myself if like people think that I'm an expert in a like I'm I'm in the shoes of a lot of everybody else like I just started doing a lot of this stuff like super recently so U it's such a cool opportunity I'm excited for for the developer space thanks for having me on and um yeah I'm I'm happy that we got to chat absolutely well everybody thanks for sticking with us I hope you learned a lot until next week happy coding
