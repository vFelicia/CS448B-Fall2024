this week I'm building the leaderboard project so last week I designed it and this week I'm trying to implement it so I will start the project with the layout and uh later I will move the components um to to react components it shouldn't take much longer because uh it will be like um copy paste later to react components a n n it's Friday in the evening this is how the app looks right now uh I would say it's ready and uh ready to go uh when it comes for the iteration the default tab is last 40 days and the user can change the tab to all times where the total amount of points is the priority the list needs a moment to load that's why I introduced the intro screen here with loading deleters Graphics the app is built with uh bootstrap partially with flex box and of course with react and SAS according to the requirements I introduced a few changes regarding the previous design they were usually about the position where something stored or about the font sizes and for example here this fre code comp leaders headline is much bigger than in the uh in the designs and all also when we talk about wider screens uh in order to keep the visual hierarchy better uh I also um made the badges and uh the username bigger the app is accessible from the keyboard and you can access each um fre code Camp leader from here and go to the fre Cod Camp um profile the previous apps that I did revie JS were either bigger like GitHub bottle that was done with web pack or smaller as a result uh here I had to stop around and were think how to do it how to implement it what to start with do I really need web pack and things like that it was really problematic because for a moment I didn't know what to do and then I started copying uh and pasting from the previous apps uh and doing it step by step checking if what I cop it works and did um so that's how I uh that that's why I defeated this problem this was really a problematic moment this week because I didn't know what to do for a moment and your motivation falls down but when it started working it dries up again next week I'm going to start the new up it will be the recipe box it is quite a big up so probably it will take me longer than a week to do it uh if I want to really polish it um but I will started this week I also found very interesting uh resource about uh JavaScript about vanilla JavaScript I will share it also in the video description below it's the series called JavaScript 30 uh which is about 30 tasks uh and 30 solutions to these tasks um and this is the challenge to build 30 new products project with vanilla JavaScript all of them should be built with vanilla JavaScript so no Frameworks and you have to deal with them on your own just only with JS that's why it can be pretty challenging and pretty fun and I will really have to find time to look into it so the project is done you can see it at the one who does SL leaderboard I will will put the link in the video description below keep on doing and see you next week
