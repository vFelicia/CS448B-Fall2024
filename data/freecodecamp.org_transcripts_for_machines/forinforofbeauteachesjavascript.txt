four in and four of are ways to loop through objects four n will loop through property names and four of will loop through property values here is the basic usage we have four and you have to put a variable in and then the object name and then down here is what you want to do and for up for the variable name of object and then some statements of what you want to do so that's the basic usage let's look at some actual examples i'm going to create a variable here let person equal f name bow l name cards arms 2 because i do have two arms so i'm going to create this object person and i'm also going to create an array and we're just going to have three numbers in it 357 and then we're going to create a custom property on the array and call it hello so first we're going to use the person object we create this for in loop we're going to have a variable x in person here we're going to loop through the property names so i'm showing that we're going to add something to this text variable we're going to add person and then we're gonna get the property name this is actually just a way to to add the property value to text because when you have an object and you in the brackets you put the property name it's going to get the value of that property and we add it to text and then i'm going to console.log the property name and then we're going to console.log text which is all the property values that we added to up here let's see that okay so you can see we have fname lname and arms that's when we're console.logging x and x is always the property name and then here we're passing in the property value to text and we're going to console.log text okay now the of loop the for of loop will not work on person because person is not iterable the the for in loops through innumerable properties while for of loops through iterable objects such as array map and set so let's just give you an example we have this array here and i'm going to create another loop i'm going to show you four in and for of on this one if you use for in on arrays it will return the name of your user defined properties in addition to the numeric indexes this usually is not what you want when iterating over arrays you usually want to use a traditional for loop so let me show you what i mean so i made the 4 in loop i'm just going to copy that and turn that into a 4 of loop and let's run that when we do the let i in array and we're going to console.log that this is actually going to return the numeric indexes look the array is 3 5 7 but what we're returning is 0 1 2 and then foo because 0 is the index of 3 1 is the index of 5 and 2 is the index of 7 because arrays just count 0 1 2 and so on for the indexes and then we're also going to return any user defined properties and we've set foo foo right here is the user defined property now that's what the in loop is gonna do the of loop is gonna be a little bit more of what you expect it's just gonna go through all the items in the array the items in the array are three five and seven hello is not actually in the array it's just the value of this user defined property so that's four in loops and four of loops thanks for watching my name is beau carnes check the description for links for more information don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
