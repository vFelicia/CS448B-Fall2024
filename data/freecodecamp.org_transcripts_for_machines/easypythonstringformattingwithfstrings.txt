the best way to format strings in Python is by using F strings traditionally we use something called concatenation to join strings and variables together this is a way of joining strings and variables using the addition operator so as you can see right here this joins a string and a variable but it is quite messy so the best way to do this is by using F strings in F strings all you need to do is to add an F right before you start the string and whenever you want to include a variable you just need to cover it with curly braces as you can see this is way better and cleaner and it's also more readable if I run this you can see that both of them gives us the same response but this is a better way of doing it
