hi in this video we are going to talk a little bit about source code what source code is where you'll see it and how the computer makes sense of it source code itself is the actual text document that a programmer creates they type it up it's letters it's numbers it's symbols if you give that to somebody and have them look at that on their computer that's not going to run their email that's not going to be a web browser that's just a text document really um now the computer has to have a way of interpreting that and making something really powerful run from it there are two main ways this is done either an interpreter or a compiler now in every internet browser that works has an interpreter so javascript is run through an interpreter to make sense other languages like c plus plus are used with a compiler now that's unlike an interpreter the compiler does all of its work on the programmer's end so they send out their package their their product and it's already been compiled it can already run on a machine whereas javascript and interpreter languages you just write the javascript you don't compile it or anything and the computer itself the browser has a technology to interpret that and make something happen there now there are arguments this way in that everybody has an opinion about which is better and really it's a casebycase basis compiling languages and interpreting languages are better at different things as you know free code camp we do focus on interpreter language of javascript i also want to talk a little bit about what open source means just because it kind of fits in the language here source code open source free code camp is open source as are a lot of really awesome projects what open source means is that all of their documentation all of their source code is open and accessible uh now you may be thinking okay so what but what's awesome about that is if you have something you want to change about free code camper some way you think it could be improved write that improvement in and send it to us at free code camp and maybe get it implemented it's a great way to see programs grow and websites and products grow in a really really strong and fast way because there are so many people constantly seeing it and seeing how it can be improved the one thing that is kind of an unspoken rule with open source is if you're going to take something and improve it for yourself even if it's a piece of software that you can download generally you want to give that back to the community give that improvement to everyone else so that they can use it too
