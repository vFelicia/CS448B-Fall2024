hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we might not do what i said i was going to do in the title of this video uh so my plan was we were just going to start completely from scratch look up how to do this and do it but i had a few minutes before the live stream was gonna start and i couldn't really start anything big so i thought okay i'll just look up some documentation on how to do this and i realized that if we set up what we wanted to set up which i'll explain in a minute it might not work out because we can't use https so let me we'll get into it and we'll still kind of go through the process uh but we need to think about what effect this is going to have on our site and if if we really want to set it up like this so if if you have no idea what i'm talking about don't worry i will explain everything i'm going to give everybody a few seconds to to get in here um i know i i started to i announced the stream a little bit later than normal so in case somebody's coming in late let me give them a minute here um hey everyone it's it's here right now um looks like the notifications did actually go out for this video let's see yeah i think i just got one on my phone okay cool sometimes they don't work when i started so late so i had a pretty long meeting earlier in the day but it went well so that's why i'm streaming a bit later today and we may have a guest we may have a guest a little bit later on uh i was attempting to recruit someone to help me uh with this project with some of the uh the data work and so she might stop by during the stream depending on how long the the stream goes and so that'll be cool and why my face the light on my face looks super weird i don't know if it looks weird to everybody else but let me turn this light down a little okay i guess that's kind of better i don't know it's just looking weird to me um okay so let me let me switch my screen so you all can see what's happening nope that's not it this is it okay and the light actually looks a bit better in this use so that's nice uh so here's what we're working on today let me make it bigger hopefully come on bigger it's a little bit of lag happening so i'll describe what it is then since it's the text isn't getting bigger so this is a google cloud platform storage bucket uh and we set that up yesterday yeah we set this up yesterday we connected it to wordpress and got that working now i'm what i'm in the middle of doing there we go finally get a little bigger what i'm in the middle of doing is bringing over all of the files from the old site and keeping the same file structure and in terms of files mainly i mean images and i mean pdfs you know things like that that would appear on the website uh the reason being when we brought over the markup from the old site it still refers to a lot of these files in the same structure so we can take advantage of that and not have to redo a lot of things by just using um relative urls in the markup and then when they come over when they get to the react components we'll just prepen the url of wherever they're at in this case right now it's the storage bucket so let me show you how we've we've done that in react uh i think i believe it's here is it yeah this is it let's make sure we're up to date we'll do a get pull okay and let's take a component where i know we've already used this technique just to show you how this is going to work let me think the faculty dot js page i believe we're using this there we go okay so on the faculty.js page we're pulling in data from wordpress with graphql but then we're we're going through that data and we're manipulating it a bit before we actually render it to the page so you see here anywhere that we see a src equals right which is you're pretty much for an image we're prepending franciscan.edu because right now that actually works because that site is still connected uh to all those files right but when we switch over and point that url to our new site this isn't gonna work anymore so we're gonna need to replace this with that google storage bucket with that url so the idea that i i thought would work was okay well let's do a cname record and let's point it to that cloud storage bucket and that way we'll have like a cleaner look and it all you look like it's coming from the same place i don't think that's going to work though so let's let's check it out just you know to see how we would would go about doing this let me give you i have two examples i can show you one is the official documentation uh and the other one is just looks like maybe a tutorial someone else did it's a little bit dated though but i i think it it shows the same point let's try to go through the official documentation first if it's a little too too much to go through then we can always switch switch back and let's clean up what we have going on here and let's pull this over come on here we go is he gonna let me put it in there no oh well so i'll just zoom in quickly on the part that we need to look at uh so basically like right we make the cname record and then instead of having to type in this url we can now type in in this case they use travelmaps.example.com right and see they can type that in and then get access to that image right great that's what i wanted but if we look at this note it says you can use a cname redirect only with http not with https to serve your content through a custom domain over ssl you can set up a load balancer so it's not that it's impossible it just requires a load balancer so we could check it out see how hard that's going to be maybe we'll maybe we could do that we'll see if it's not that hard might be worth it i just i don't know if it's worth it to go through the trouble of setting up a load balancer for this i don't know let me know what you all think i'm not sure that that's you know how many people are even going to realize what url the images are coming from you know really probably only other devs that open up devtools also let me let me start my timer now that we're going to start to get into things here uh let's start that pomodoro timer if i have it there we go i thought i had it so i'm gonna mainly focus on on what we're doing here with this cloud storage bucket uh for the next 25 minutes and then i'm gonna go back to the live chat after that for about five minutes and answer any questions uh that you all put in there so if you're asking questions in the live chat please be patient and i will get to those i'll keep my eye on the chat though in case anything pops up that's you know maybe i should address immediately okay so there's our i lost my there it is okay so let's just check out this load balancing stuff let's see if we can do it uh realistically i don't i don't really know who would need a cdn that only uses http i'm right i mean everyone wants http now it just doesn't seem that useful to me anyway so i assume if we have to load use the load balancing to get https there are going to be other people that want to do it so you know this this would possibly be valuable for you all even if i don't necessarily end up going with this uh let me copy and paste this into the live chat for you all and then that way you can check it out if you'd like all right all right i'm just gonna skim over this at first and see if there's anything that stands out they're like oh we shouldn't do this all right so we already have a cloud storage bucket so we don't we don't need to create one so we've already done all this let me know if i have a fan running it's pretty warm in here so um let me know if it's too noisy and i'll turn it off i tried to like turn it down as low as it'll go and kind of point it away so it's not blowing right on the mic but i can't really tell with the headphones on if it's too loud okay cool so it looks like you'd create a second bucket to do the load balancing from hmm all right looks like there was one other thing it content base complete the guide for content based load balancing let's check out that guide as well uh if i'm going through this too fast you know feel free to click on the link or copy and paste the link from the live chat you can check it out a little bit slower more slowly is that the proper way to say that instead of slower i think it's more slowly hmm okay so from what i'm seeing uh when you set up the load balancer like this basically the load balancer has a static ip address which obviously if you have static ip address right you could point the domain name to that's what i'm assuming uh this is what happening so instead of a c name you could i guess make an a record use that for your domain i let i'm going to give you all a chance do you think we should go through creating a load balancer so that we can point a domain name and use our own domain i don't know let me know the more i think about it the more i think maybe it's not worth the trouble at this point uh so i'll give you all a minute because of the delay in the video uh to let me know we for sure have a lot of other things that we could work on so it's not like i'd end the stream we would just maybe switch over and work with the mysql database so i'm getting a few answers in there i'm going to give you all maybe like 20 more seconds to let me know hmm um all right so here's here's the answers that i've been so far looks like yes do it um just walk us through like children and put the reference material in the description john says there's always another way okay so it looks like you all want to i mean i've only heard from a few people and there's a lot more people watching so of those who responded it's you you all want to do this so i guess we can uh we can try it out and let's see how um might not be a bad idea then for me to move this documentation over to another screen so that i can reference it and then we can actually do everything here on this screen so the first thing we'll probably do is let me switch let me switch over and i'll leave this open you see this this particular page is since all this stuff is loading and i'm streaming at the same time it's it's going to be impossible to work with this page so what i want to do is open up another instance of google cloud platform here and i'm going to switch over to my account because i don't i don't want to mess with this in in case i decide not to go with this live and also um i don't want to mess up all the stuff that's being uploaded right now and let's see oh it looks like something must be wrong with freecodecamp.org right now but i i think they're just making some updates so okay uh yeah so if you're having trouble getting on right now uh sorry about that i i don't have anything to do with the update so i don't know for sure but uh usually when this happens it's not it's not too long you know things will go back to normal soon and okay we got a question what are you uploading i'm uploading data from the old website or i guess the current franciscan.edu website uh so a lot of the images and pdfs that are available on the website i'm moving them over to our new store so like right now they're hosted on a server on campus here at the university so we want to host them uh in that storage bucket that we set up yesterday all right so first things that first thing we need to do is create a bucket so let's do see what projects we have um i have so many projects i'm not even using let's just start a new project and create projects let's say i don't know just uh test project there we go this one i'll just use for um whatever whenever i need to test something no i'll have a project for that what happened where did it go oh okay it's it's going it's creating creating test projects if you'd like to follow along i'm going to paste the um the url in there one more time for anybody that missed it that's it there now awesome all right so we're now on test project and freezing all right and uh the link that i just gave you the first step is gonna uh tell you to complete the guide for a uh con for content based load balancing so let me put the link in for that as well so that second link i just pasted in is a link for that uh if you've already gone to the first section you know you could just click the link that's in there so all right so we need to go to the create a virtual machine instance all right let's check this out this is cool this will be some new stuff that we haven't worked on before um i've never gone to that page before let me see which one this is um vm instances there we go it's under compute engine we're going to go to vm instances and we're going to go to create instance oops all right it's getting ready so we get the little spinner there so while that gets ready i'll check the chat oh a noob thank you i didn't i didn't see that comment but anu said the vms are found inside compute so thank you for that i should have just looked over immediately hey nikki's here how's it going i guess i'll take a drink while i'm waiting it's always important to stay hydrated right oh i've never done this before in google cloud didn't realize it would take this long uh i'll check in the chat and see if there's anything else in here that i missed love johnson says can i use this to run ubuntu on an old mac or to run python uh i don't know i mean i guess if you're creating a vm i mean you can do what you want with it so i never thought about doing that but i guess it will work so i don't i don't know for sure if it would work uh but it seems like it could all right cool so now we're ready now let's create create the instance and we're going to set the name to www and we'll use we'll just keep the default zone uh let's see machine type yeah that's fine i'll probably keep most of this stuff default we need to find management disk networking ssh keys there we go and just blocks okay startup script field so we want to insert some code into the startup script field uh let's check this code out so aptget update app get installed okay so we're installing apache ssl and then restarting apache and then echoing uh html a very small html page okay cool uh we're gonna leave everything else as default and we will create that okay all right cool so that's there now it says it says to do the same thing with video i guess i'll do it just for the sake of being consistent with the instructions um let's do that so let's create another instance and name this for those of you that are joining us recently in order to create a cname record no no in order to create a custom domain name for our cloud bucket that actually uses https you have to set up load balancing so that's why we're setting up this load balancing stuff first in order to make that work okay and i'm gonna put in a custom startup script in here that's almost identical to the other one but it just has some different data here in the index page and let's create that now we're going to make a firewall rule to allow traffic to our vms so let's go to firewalls page which let's see how we're gonna get there no i saw firewall there we go firewalls was it the right page i don't think so i was firewalls i need to find firewall rules there we go firewall rules all right actually did my all right i still got five minutes um in about five minutes i'm going to go back to the live chat answer some questions so if you have any questions uh please put them in the live chat sometime within the next five minutes okay so here's our firewall rules page we need to create a rule and we're going to name it www firewall and let's set let's see networks default and our source filter we're going to allow sources from from any source so basically to do that we're going to do 0.0.0 dot zero slash zero okay and let's set our our ports and we'll go for right now let's do port adn 443 port 80 is your normal http port port 443 is your um https port since we're just testing this out i'm fine with allowing both um but in a production environment i'd be more comfortable if i just ran port 443 and you know had port 80 disabled okay and one more target tags here um let's do http tag um and then we're gonna do https tag since we're doing both we'll put both in there and now let's create and as soon as this spinner's done we can go on to the next step yay all right cool uh so let's go back to our vm oops no what happened i'm going to refresh because it just froze up i'll go back to the menu there we go vm instances okay external ip let's check this out so we're going to copy the ip and paste the ip see what happens so we should see that um those very tiny little html files uh that were there that's that's what should come up so i don't know how long it's supposed to take here let's click the other one too to just get it started since it seems to be taking so long let's try the http explicitly hmm not working okay all right why is it not working open in browser window all right let's try that let's allow popups and try this again open and browse window all right my timer did go off so let me set a short break here okay so uh so it did allow me to go in here so i had thought that i would actually see the html maybe i'm not supposed to see that maybe that's not how it was set up it's not exactly clear all right well let me go back to the chat i'm going to scroll up make sure i don't miss any questions and go through as many questions as i can in five minutes uh not really a lot of questions so trying to find some uh john asks if the google cloud platform is feasible for small apps uh it i've never tried out for small apps but it seems like a lot of the pricing is based on usage excuse me it's all based on usage so it might it might be affordable i never really tried to figure out how much it would be for something small so i don't know if it would be cheaper to go with you know a different service that focuses more on small things i don't know has anybody has anybody ever used use it in that way i mean it seems like it's there's a lot more features than you would normally need for something small so if in terms of complexity you know they're definitely you know less complex ways of doing it but in terms of costs i'm not really sure what would be cheaper uh says what what language is more future proof i'm trying to figure out which language to learn first thanks oh um well it's hard to tell the future right uh if you're if you're going by trends i mean realistically javascript has been gaining ground for a long time now more and more things are being built with javascript that couldn't be built with javascript before um right like when when i was in high school and just learning how to do websites you couldn't do javascript on the server right that didn't exist and what you could do with javascript was actually pretty limited now you can do a lot i mean you you do everything you wanted anything that you can do normally in a programming language you could probably find a way to do it with javascript so just the growth there makes me think that if that trend continues it's it's going to be you know continue to be one of the main languages but there are other languages that are so entrenched in a lot of big companies in the in the code bases for these huge companies that they're not going to go away anytime soon so like there's so much stuff built with java python php like those big languages like there if they ever go away it's going to take a long long time i mean just consider like there are still companies that use cobol right which is an ancient by computer standards it's it's ancient but you know there are there are code bases out there that change infrequently uh but they still need people to maintain them so i wouldn't worry so much about your language not being around in the future as long as you pick a language that is you're kind of one of the top languages you're safe if you go with some really obscure language that's not used very much right now that could potentially die out and and nobody will use it right so if if you're i think probably like what are the the top like i mentioned java javascript python php this is not in any particular order python php um those those are your big ones if i'm leaving one out let me know uh but oh i'm forgetting like uh c sharp i mean there is still even stuff done in c plus plus right so but i'm gonna say this is my five that i'm gonna say are probably gonna be around for a long time c sharp java javascript python php if you pick any one of those you probably don't have to worry about you know that language not being used anymore for a long time so i mean as for smaller languages there's a ton of small languages uh there's i'm sure there's lots of smaller like computer languages that aren't used that i've never even heard of right i probably will never hear of them that's not necessarily a good thing if you're trying to get a job right so there's not a lot of jobs out there so anyway i i know starting out that's like a huge question and a source of anxiety like what should i pick but it's always easier to learn your second computer language because you have the concepts down so even if you decide later on you don't really like the one that you chose to learn you know don't worry about it too much you can always switch it'll be a little more work but not quite as much work as learning it you know the first time all right my timer is up so we're gonna do another pomodoro session and then i'll come back uh and i see there's some more discussion going on there so i'll check that out after i come back uh so we'll probably just end up doing one more session uh and then i'll do some more questions and then we'll finish up for today oops where am i at uh back here all right well now that i'm in here let's just look around see what we have hmm okay it looks like we're running apache right based on the code that we the startup code we're running apache so we should have um we're going to go into that oops this is probably really small i'm sorry everyone let me try to make this bigger so this is this is all that i've done i just uh backed out two directories from my uh default directory that i was in so and then i went into the ver or var directory and then www which is your default directory for serving websites in apache and so now i'm just listings and that's our index.html file uh that i was thinking that we'd see if we actually went here whoops so uh we can see like obviously things are there um there is stuff there the stuff that we did worked i guess we can verify that that that step did work uh if we go in i'm assuming nano is here no no index and yep there it is so there's that html that we had there i'm going to get out i don't want to edit that okay so that's that's there i'm just gonna leave for now hopefully i don't need to go back in right away let's see all right so now we need to make a an ip address so we're going to go to the external ip addresses page which is there we go external ip addresses and let's reserve a static address and the name i'm just going with the name from the tutorial uh we're gonna go with the ipv4 and we want it to be global and hopefully i don't get charged too much for all this i'm gonna cancel it all as soon as i'm done uh and click hey now's a great time to bring up my patreon page so if you'd like to help support my streams uh check out my patreon page and help me out when i do stuff like this and just not sure how much i'm gonna get charged for all this experimentation all right let's create an instance group now and where do i go for that let me see um instance group i'm going to create a new one just got a message from work i need to answer this hold on one second okay all right so we're going to create one um let's set the name to resources and we're going to set the zone to us central one b i'm not really sure why where you take picking that particular zone uh the instructions here uh don't really say so if you want to follow along and see if see the instructions yourself click on that link that i i put in the live chat a little earlier we're going to set the group type to unmanaged instant group instance group and let's see for vm instance where are we on unmanaged it says no available instances yeah that must have been a mistake in the documentation because um obviously we didn't make instances in that particular zone so let's set www and so that's going to be our instance and then we're going to create another instance group for our other for www uh dash video okay create and let's just go back and create another one and this will be whoops let's call it video video resources unmanaged and let's add a video create that see all right cool those are finished oh all right sorry i lost my place i was looking ahead and lost my place in the documentation now i'm back um let's set up we're going to set up a lot of stuff so now we're going to name our load balancer so let's go to our load balancing page which where did we set that up at why is it this is freezing up somewhat frequently all right so i don't know where i load balancing pages um there we go load balancing and load balancers under https load balancing click start configuration interesting i'm not getting the same all right maybe i'll keep click create okay i had to click create first that was the problem um https load balancing let's start and let's name it web map and back end let's say create a backend service let's name it web map backend service all right let's say all right i'm just going to leave since it'll be faster i'm going to leave that as default um instance group www resources port 80. let's do it i'll check i never set up a health check all right let's set up a basic health check um http basic check and i'll just leave everything default okay okay all right so i think we're good and we'll just repeat that for video video service do video resources and health check let's yeah let's create the health check um all right let's create that okay all right let's go to host and path rules and okay so let's go with hosts um and then we're gonna set our pass to video and video there we go okay wonderful let's do front end and let's say http content rule and we're just going to do http to save some time normally you'd want to go with https though all right ipv4 there we go and good ipv6 let's go with http content ipv6 rule i thought earlier in the documentation we didn't do an ipv6 um all right and let's review and finalize and click create i guess you have to wait till this is done the good news is it seems like we're almost done i'll check the chat while this little spinner is spinning see hey phoenix is here how's it going what the specified ip address is in use and would result in a conflict involved value for resource iphs okay then it's not going to let me edit this ah here we go edit hmm well everybody i think i just failed i think i just failed pretty bad so i'm not sure i even remember where i put in that ip and how far back in the process that was i mean was that when we went to set up a static ip all right so let me i don't really have enough time to go back and fix that so let me say assuming that would have worked we would go back to these original directions that we started started at um you would if you haven't already created a bucket you'd create your bucket and then you'd go back to the load balancing page you'd go to um the back end configuration and i i think you would just add your static bucket you would add the back end for your static bucket and for your host and path rules you would just add so we had already added that path for video we would do the same thing in there with static and then we would just set up our addresses to get to that static bucket where we put in our our external address so the rest of the steps seem really simple and straightforward so we went through the hardest part and we went through most of it um at some point though i messed up i i suppose um so yeah so i don't have time to fix that and i'm not really sure so i p address already in use okay so yeah i don't know i don't know what happened with that but if you wanted to set up load balancing for your buckets so that you could use a to you could have a static ip address that that you could use um and point an a record to that so you'd have your custom domain that's how you would do it that's a lot of steps so i guess it's something to consider uh in my case i think i'm not gonna do it i think i'm just gonna stick with the url that is the default that google gives me uh i i don't think i don't really think it's worth me going through all these steps and paying all the extra money for those extra for all the extra setup just to be able to do that if it happens at some point in the future that i find some reason why i should do it like that then i will um and at least we've gone through it once and i know what's involved but i mean it was it was cool to go through and find out more of google cloud platform because there's still a lot of it that i've never even seen and never used uh so that was kind of cool hopefully this this was helpful to somebody out there uh to go through some of this and i guess the last thing i'm going to do is make sure i'm not going to get billed for any of this so where's my billing can i turn it off for this project test project disable billing yep there we go and i do want to disable for this as well and i'm going to leave that here for now but at some point i need to move that onto the university account all right cool so hopefully i don't get built at all for that small amount uh that i used but uh you never know if i do get built it'll it'll probably be very very minimal so i'm not too worried about it all right i'm gonna now go to the live chat and i will i'm sorry i'm still trying to chat with my my coworker here and figure figure this out there's something going on with one of the links on the main website we're trying to figure it out okay all right it looks like he he found it so that's good all right let me uh so if you have any questions right now uh please put them in the chat now i'm gonna answer all the questions that i can okay uh sabin are you hosting wordpress as well on a google virtual machine no i'm actually not so uh i'm i would like to host wordpress with next um and that's a service from zeit it's the same company that makes um next js i'm sorry did i i think i said that wrong i want to host wordpress with now which is from the same company that does next um potentially we could host it on on a vm as well so right now i have it running on digitalocean uh but so if for some reason it doesn't work out using now it'll probably just stay on digitalocean but i'm i'm pretty sure that it uh it can work i've successfully tested it i just want to make sure that it's it works as well and as easy as i expected to uh jacob says google cloud versus digitalocean uh sabin says i think digitalocean is more affordable just my opinion uh honestly for me i'm i'm not 100 sure about the price uh i've never really looked into it like that deeply but digitalocean is easier and in my opinion digitalocean is easier although you know i've worked more with digitalocean so it may just seem easier to me uh their google cloud just has so much stuff going on it's it can be overwhelming there's a lot so that's good because you know potentially you can add in all these extra services as you as you grow you know as your app grows and they're all right there so i mean there's a benefit to that complexity if you think that you need it later on nikki says there's that rule from someone on twitter every program that can be written in javascript will eventually be written in javascript yeah i can't remember who who said that originally but i do hear that repeated from time to time um matt that's just saying i'm hearing loads of great things about digitalocean and javascript is popping up everywhere for full stack everything yeah for sure for sure i do like digitalocean um i've used it i'm hosting a lot of stuff there right now so i i like it and javascript i mean i've used i've done some workshops where you've got we've used javascript to create um internet of things stuff um which is so cool right made like a little um a little car that you could control through like i don't remember if we did wifi or bluetooth but you could control it through your computer keyboard right this it was cool and it was a node.js um program that was running it so i mean that that's just cool uh i've seen people on youtube do machine learning with uh javascript um there's just there's not an area right now um where something's happening with programming that there's not a way to do it in javascript that was a really confusing way to say it let me say it differently i said if there's something happening with in the programming world right now you can do it with javascript i think that's a better way it's a better way to do it is javascript always the best option i don't know probably not but is it an option hey i think this is our guest so i am on youtube let me let's expand this screen a bit and i'm going to show more of the screen fiddle at me is that your camera the light yeah that's the camera i can't i need to change my settings real quick i have my camera zoomed in so i'm going to change it a bit so it's just a little bit um filters a little bit wider oh hello so let's i'm going to zoom it all the way out all right all right cool this works this works all right cool do you want to say hi hello youtube world all right so hopefully you'll be helping me with some of the data yeah so i i just happened to run into her in the uh the office kitchen and um we started talking about websites and so she has some experience with websites so she was a student here took a web web design course and also had a job where she was stuck trying to make the best of a terrible website uh so as she was telling me all of her experience with this website i was like wow you're already a web developer like this is what we deal with right like we have problems and we figure out how to solve the problems um and so she was saying that she's she's looking for a job and so i said hey i'm uh i'm offering a job so yeah so we got to work out the details but hopefully she'll be she'll be helping out so you might see her on a future stream if you want that's cool sure i am cool with anything all right cool so at this point in the show i was doing some question and answer isn't that cool yeah all right so this is the last thing i do so after this will be done and then i can show you some some other stuff all right so i lost my place let me find it sorry okay so nikki that quote that we just said about everything that can be programmed in javascript will eventually be programmed in javascript it was from the cofounder of stack exchange so thanks for that nikki and all right sabine says lenode also offers a cheap virtual machine but i prefer digitalocean uh okay cool yeah i've done some stuff with lenode but only like i've inherited lenode based sites so i haven't really done anything like from scratch uh john hanson says i thought firebase firestore was free um maybe free is in google maps api yeah a lot of google stuff has like a free tier that's that's limited it's good for testing things and maybe doing like um i don't know small projects small apps so i'm assuming it's like that for firebase as well uh matt duchess says heroku has a free package yeah i think they do too i need to check into heroku because i one of the conferences i was at i got like a card that with a code on it that i could use to get a bunch of free um uh free dino minutes or hours on heroku michael says so uh for some context in case you weren't watching earlier when i was setting everything up with the google cloud platform i said i'm not sure how much they're going to charge me for this because we're just experimenting uh and michael says i don't think i've used the phrase i'm not sure how much i'm going to get charged for this experimentation since i went to mardi gras in new orleans so um hopefully you didn't get charged too much for that michael i've never been to mardi gras that would uh would be cool and i'm hoping i don't get charged too much either i just resized my font now i'm lost again on the live chat okay cool i found it martin asks does serverless architecture mean using prebuilt apis like firebase or doesn't mean something totally different um i mean you can do there's a lot of different options yeah but like essentially serverless this is not an official definition but like you're always going to have a server it's just is that going to be your server or somebody else's and are you going to maintain that server so serverless is going to allow you to just like send off your code have it run you don't have to worry about any server maintenance at all so however you set that up um you know it just it depends depends on what you're doing what is aws has lambda i think um i'm not sure what the equivalent is called in in google or microsoft azure but i don't know that's my take on on serverless though and nikki and michael were talking about lil wayne songs or lil jon song so i'm not i don't i was don't know what's going on on that side conversation john says i need some of what jesse's drinking mind altering in order to heavily focus energy okay so i was just drinking water during the stream but i did have g fuel beforehand so uh once again if anybody from g fuel is watching i'm open for sponsorship you gotta give this a g fuel sponsorship even if you just send me some g fuel every month i'd be happy with that jacob says ola from stevenville ohio jacob are you in stupidville right now let me know oh uh nikki said so at the end whenever my my ip address wouldn't work and it just it completely failed um nikki had an idea that i would open that terminal session and i may not have ever closed it i closed the window but i didn't like exit it from the terminal so that could have been the cause of the error so that's a good idea i didn't even think of that at all um powwow says how often do you record live coding uh i try to do five days a week but oftentimes i don't get five days a week uh just because of meetings and things so um i mean usually it ends up being more like three three days a week world's asked if digitalocean is easy to use and easy to see costs yeah for sure the pricing on digitalocean is really upfront totally totally easy to figure out what your your cost is going to be michael says what main package would you need to do machine learning with js ah i can't remember what it's called um i mean there's more than one i can't remember uh check out what channel is it um learn code dot academy is the channel will stern does that youtube channel one of his recent videos i think his last two videos that he put out was doing machine learning with javascript so check those videos out they're pretty short i think maybe 10 minutes each or so that'll give you at least one way to do it and if you can't find that channel go to my youtube channel the links in the description and i link to his channel from my my home page okay nikki says there's a tensorflow.js now okay cool so check out tensorflow that's not the one that will stern was using in his videos but um uh tensorflow is really well known so if they have a javascript library now i'm assuming that it's pretty good oh you never mentioned your name do you want to know your name sure i'm sorry guys my name is haley all right so no i no i so just a y no no y either it's just haley haley super basic all right cool so haley so you said john says uh joe murphy says future show live coding with jesse and haley sorry i didn't introduce you that's it's okay i've never been on a stream before guys so sorry not used to it jamallah says give me free google credit can i do that do they have a referrer program if anyone i do have referral codes for several other things so like if if anybody's interested i could i could give you my referral codes for stuff so you know usually you end up getting some something free alright looks like i'm down to the last question uh so unless somebody puts a question in there uh in the next minute uh we'll finish things up so world says have you ever had issues and react with sizing several components to fit the viewport i've wrapped them but the bottom component never fits um i don't know it's kind of hard to say worlds if you have the code on github let me know um you could send me a dm on twitter and i could check it out more i'd kind of have to see the code because i'm assuming that that's more of a css issue and not necessarily a react issue so um i could i could probably check it out though and and give you at least point you in the right direction matt duchess says to build a blog or a site to advertise your affiliate links i've been thinking about doing that my personal website is so old i haven't updated it in years like i don't know like three or four years so i need to just change it and and put my links on there and update it with stuff that i've actually done uh within the last three years um but i think that's a good idea uh john murphy says do you use ssh keys or just password for root on digitalocean i always use ssh keys i usually try to disable root user and disable passwords completely just go with ssh that's a lot more secure although i do make sure i have more than one computer that has ssh keys for it michael says she knows how to do product placement yeah they wanted to know what i was drinking missed twist i mean i've never even heard of that it's the big k brand which i wouldn't be drinking but it was the only kind my sister had when i visited her earlier today you could try to get a sponsorship for that that's what we want we want cocacola that's what i should be drinking uh nino asked well right when i said uh we're all with the last question everybody started asking questions all right so um nino says i learned javascript uh redux what is next i would say what is next is build some awesome stuff uh you definitely know i mean try maybe learn some graphql so that you can pull some data into your react applications uh if you want to move into back end stuff then learn some node i mean otherwise i mean if you know javascript react in redux you know you're definitely in a good position to make some awesome things i'm had dutch it says it's okay haven't you built mine yeah i'm terrible about working on my own website all right i'm officially at the end of the chat now so thank you all so much for watching sorry i didn't get what we were working on to work almost we were so close um if anybody gets it to work let me know if you try to do this on your own i'd like to know like does it work is it awesome um yeah so i should be back tomorrow see i have meetings in the morning tomorrow so it'll probably be another afternoon stream i'll be back in the office um yeah so anyway thanks again and until tomorrow have a great day bye guys
