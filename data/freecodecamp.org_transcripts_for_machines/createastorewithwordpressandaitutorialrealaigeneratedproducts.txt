welcome to this course on how you can use WordPress and AI to create a fully functional store that sells products created by AI I'm Bo KS and I teach this course I recently received this package in the mail and let's see what it is I haven't actually opened this yet so um okay it's a sticker I ordered this AI generated sticker using the ecommerce site I will show you how to create in this tutorial with this method you don't have to mail anything yourself but even if you don't want to create an ecommerce site this course can still help you you'll learn how to create a WordPress website and get help from artificial intelligence to create any website you need a domain name and a place to host the files in this course we'll be using hostinger hostinger provided a grant to make this course possible hostinger is optimized for WordPress sites and they offer a 99.9% guarantee they also have recently Incorporated some AI tools to make web development easier this is actually the first time I've seen this sticker and it looks pretty nice so to get started with your domain name and hosting you can go to hostinger.com or there's a lot of other hosting providers as well they may or may not have some of these AI tools that hosting or offers you can choose the plan premium or business for you if you want AI tools you do need to choose the business plan so we just do add to cart and basically you're just going to go through these steps to add this to your to your cart to create an account and to buy your hosting and your domain once you get logged into to hostinger and you have your account you can click claim domain it may not look exactly the same as my button but you should have that button somewhere and then you may have to experiment with some different domains to find one that's not already taken but I'm going to try coder stickers coders stickers.com because I'm creating a website to sell stickers for software developers okay and the reason why I was able to get on my first try is because I already checked some domains and that like the first mini mini I checked didn't exist but I already had this one in mind because I I knew it wasn't taken yet so I'm going to claim that domain okay and good I have my fake contact information because uh one time I accidentally put in my real contact information and then I got tons of uh spam calls in marketing so you either want to use you're supposed to use your your real contact information but I I if you do make sure you uh choose the option to hide it because they will contact you okay finished registration now that you have your domain depending on how you purchase your hosting uh you can connect your website to your hosting there may be a different method depending on if you got your domain first or your hosting first but I'm going to connect it to the business web hosting so you may have purchased the business web hosting you may have purchased the premium web hosting or completely different one but I'm going to connect it to the business web hosting cuz it has the most AI tools associated with it and this course is all about how to use AI tools to develop a website quickly so we are going to create a new website and then so we can either do WordPress with AI or hosting or Builder with AI hosting or Builder is part of Hosting or it's their own builder now WordPress with AI is obviously WordPress and WordPress is going to give a a lot more plugins so there's going to be a little more customized you can do so it is a little harder it says right here needs more experience so if you just want something simple you're going to be able to build a website very quick with this website builder you just basically type in the website you want and the AI Builder just builds the whole website for you but we're going to go with WordPress because that's going to give us a little more uh customization options so I'll go select WordPress with AI and then we just have to set the language administrator uh email and the passord password and now we can choose what plugins we want now a lot of these are going to be helpful I mean this is going to help us track the statistics and this will help with email Subs subscribers if we want to email list all in Wise SEO is kind of this builtin thing that will help with search engine optimization which we want if we don't forms we're going to want WP form and then woocommerce we're going to add this because we are creating a store so now I I'm going to skip the Google site kit and just hit continue now we can choose our theme or our template and there's going to be a bunch of different options depending on what we want to do so I could click show more and we can see a lot more now if uh if you're creating a Blog the hosting or blog is actually pretty good one because a lot of stuff is set up to work with it since we're creating a store I'm going to go with storefront and now here is the AI one of the AI tools that we're going to look at automate your text Creation with AI so I just have to put in my brand name my business details and then uh chat gbt or probably more realistically the open AI API is going to generate some piece of content for the website so I'm going to put for the brand name code stickers and then we'll just put a description here and then here's a description which I actually did create with chat gbt I told it what we wanted and just put it right in it then it came up with this description I'll just read a little bit we are your goto destination for the expressive and whimsicle developer theme stickers that add a spark of creativity to your workspace our extens extensive collection of design is designed to celebrate the quirks and culture of the programming community and that kind of gives a little information little some examples bug related stickers language specific decals uh way to Adorn your laptop notebooks and Beyond so all this information is going to be taken by the the AI Builder tool to create the content that the the initial content for our website so I'll just hit continue oh you can also um look at like it has an example and then these green lines here will indicate how good of a description you have created so if your description isn't very good like if it's like a short description um you're you're not going to have as many green lines so see it's going to be just yellow here but I'm going to put that all back and then we'll hit continue okay so I'm going to you can either uh claim a domain which we already have or choose a do domain we already created the domain so we'll choose coders stickers.com and then I'll just click finish setup and so now it's uh just putting it all together it's initializing the setup and creating all the pages okay we can see that content Generation by AI is underway so it's just happening in the background so we are going to either go directly into editing the website or the hosting or control panel let's start by going to the hosting or control panel and then we'll go into the editing the website okay uh we can see that the SSL is installed automatically which is really good I'm not going to update my address right now but uh this is good that the SSL was installed so we can have a secure website and that just happens automatically through hostinger before we start setting up the website let's set up the email so you get a free email and it's pinning setup so I'll just click setup and uh we you can see we have a few different options we're just going to get the free basic one and I'm just going to be at Bow atcoder stickers.com and then we put the password and Recovery email and create new account okay so now we can access the web mail right here so if I put in the password and that is my recovery email okay we are in the email account so insert emails sent by you are not marked as spam we can set the DK dkim so let's do that for now so it says setting up the dkim record for your domain will help prevent your emails from going to spam which is definitely something we want to do so let's so to set up the dkim record we need to be on the hosting or control panel and then I'll go to the emails tab email accounts and then we'll go to manage here and it's actually giving us an indication of what we need to do your email reputation is currently po add SPF and dkim Records to improve it can click here or I'm going click down here where it says email reputation and then we here have here I'm going to scroll down a little more and it's going to basically give us the instructions here so we're going to get the DNS host name here and then back on the the main hosting or dashboard I'm going to go to domains then I'm going to manage the domain and then I'm going to click on dnsname servers okay now where it says manage DNS records I'm going to go to the type txt and then for name I'm just going to paste in the name we had before that I copied and then I need to get this txt record value and paste that in here the TTL is going to just stay the same and I'll click add record now you may not need to do this if it's already if you already have the record but whether you're creating a new record or you're adding a record you're going to say I've added txt records to my DNS control panel and then verify changes oh it's verified okay and so now both of these are verified and we should be all good so we can get rid of this we definitely don't want notifications and there is a desk type desktop app if you want to set that up but other than that you can now email and receive emails to your email address here okay now that we're we're back on the hosting dashboard and now we want to start making modifications to our website so there's a few ways to do it one of them is just to click on this admin pan panel here okay our website is published and it's going to give you a list of things that you can can do the first thing is upload your logo and then you'll notice here that we have an AI assistant which we'll talk about in a little bit but first of all let's actually do this and you can see that there is an AI logo maker so I'm going to go to the AI logo maker this is from hostinger and I am going to put the the website name which is coder stickers and I will put the brand description from before and just click Start creating and then we just see what type of logo do we want I'm going go with an abstract icon and then we can we have we start with one credit so you can generate a logo but I'm just going to use a logo I already have so after you have your logo we can just go to appearance customize and here is going to be the customizer to customize the page and it's going to kind of walk us through it through us here and when it says uh add your logo so let's do that right now so I'm going to select the logo okay and this is actually an AI generated logo and I'll just click select now it's kind of a busy logo I could have gone with something more simple but it's just up to you what you want and it's going to walk us through it's also going to walk us through how to customize the navigation menus and so you can see the navigation menus that we have right here home C check out now you can see this is very simple but we are going to um actually customize it to make it a little nicer and we're not going to go through all this stuff right now um we're actually going to come back later to do some of these you can choose your accent color your color your buttons and then you want to save and publish when you're when you're ready um we'll just save and publish this with our logo so then let's just kind of look at what the page looks like so far so you can see it says express your uh developer theme stickers from Cod stickers.com now un unfortunately when I put in the the description I put the URL wrong and it's supposed to be coders stickers.com but we can easily go in and update that stuff but one thing you can see is that this text is all just created uh by AI so uh we can see um there's basically different blog posts that's created for our our our uh store express yourself with developer theme stickers from codes stickers.com and then it gives a whole description of what's on the site express your coding Persona with whimsicle developer stickers and so it's going to create a a few different articles another one express yourself with wisle developer themed stickers so it looks like some of these articles have very similar titles and uh text but we can actually go through and easily update this so add a spark of creativity or workspace with code stickers express your coding personality with codee stickers so it has all these builtin articles that we can go through and update if we want right now let's look at how to more quickly update what this looks like so this is the homepage with a different blog post and we're going to be updating what all this looks like pretty soon here but we have the cart uh cart is currently empty checkout um where you can actually check out after you order something we haven't added any products yet though uh my account and Shop so shop there's no products but we're going to add some products now I'm back at the admin page and we are going to get to the AI system in a minute but let's do some basic things to make our website look a little better for now so I'm going to go to appearance and then I'm going to go to storefront now that is the name of our theme so if you use a different theme there may be a different way to customize it but since we're creating a store I'm going to customize it through this page here basically it's going to walk us through it so I'm going to go to let's go so now it's already going to uh make the page look a little different from before before it started with the blog now it's going to come right into this welcome page shop by category and you can see we have new in we recommend fan favorites uh but if we click here accessories it's going to have some products so these are just some sample products that we can and uh customize later basically now this store is looking a little better it's it's filled out a little bit and you can see what it's going to look like and right now there's just 12 sample products here but we are going to update all this so it can be customized for our our use so let's start customizing this a little further for one I think this is kind of a little too tall so I'm going to switch this out to a shorter version of this logo and we're going to put this whole big thing in the welcome page so let's see how we would do that I'm going to go to site identity and then change logo and then I'm just going to change to one I I basically use an image editing software to uh make get just the text and not the stuff inside the text so I'm going to also add an ALT text so I can put coder stickers logo and then hit select and then crop image okay and now we have this so it's not quite as tall okay now I'm going to add a site icon so do you remember in the full version there was like a computer with a little face in it so I'm going to use that as a site icon so I already cut out that picture but now I'm going to use this upscale program this is a free program for Mac OS and I think there is a Windows version too and I can just bring in this is that little face that I cut out and now I'm just going to upscale it and I have on the digital art setting and now you can see it's going to look a lot better now now we can get it to be the right um the right resolution of 512 x 512 and then I just use an image editing to get exactly 512 x 512 and then I can set the site icon and just bring it in here and then I'll put icon okay okay so we got the icon and now I can go back here and now we can go through if we want and update a lot of these things like the header image that be behind here we could update the the footer so that's what's down here like if I um change the background color to Yellow you can see it changes to Yellow well we we don't want to do that let's change it to the same yellow in this coder stickers logo so to get that that that color we're going to have to figure out the hex value if I click here um I I already got the hex value in my image editor program and then I can just paste it right in here so if we go down here now we have this as the same color in our logo and then you can see see we can go through and basically change any colors we want and then you can just keep customizing a few other things and then once you're done you can hit we can hit publish now I'm just going to actually just go copy this this website and go to the website so this is what it looks like so far so you can see now it's actually filling in all these things like the we recommend fam favorites on sale best sellers we're going to make some additional adjustments so let me go back here and then I hit X we'll go back over to here so if you want you can get some other designs and extensions like here we're not going to do it but if we click check them out we can see some other um other themes that we can get now some of them are going to cost money some of them are going to be free but like if I click here we can see this one is a free download for this theme we're just going to use the basic theme that we already have for now visit the site here and once so I already have had it open but I could also just click here visit site and then once I'm visiting the site let's see how we can edit this page well I'm just going to go different pages are edited in different ways but for this main page I'm going to just click edit page up here and then it's going to kind of tell you about the the block editor but I can kind of go over that so what I'm going to do is get rid of this heading um I'm going to actually just get rid of all this text and we are going to add some more text but first i'm going to um type slash and then we can add an image and we'll go to the media library we'll use this one that's already in our media library and then I'm going to make this a centered a line Center and we can change some settings about it so instead of it being so big we can go to medium we can go to thumbnail and I'm going to go to medium here and obviously this doesn't really look good on this other image so we're going to put a different image in the background and uh you can kind of do a mix of creating images with AI or we can go and get some royaltyfree images so I'm going to have the background image selected and I'm going to click replace and we'll do open media library and here instead of using this image I'm going to go to pixels which has some royaltyfree images there's a few pages for royaltyfree images or you can use an AI image generator so I'm going to say code background actually let's try software background okay I don't like these with chat GPT I can create an image so I'm going to say create a light colorful background image filled with software code now there's plenty of other image generators if you don't have access to Dolly 3 or chat GPT uh and you can also use the royaltyfree images okay I'm just going to go with this one so I'm going to download this image obviously you could spend more time on this if you wanted and then I'll upload the image and then I can make some adjustments like if I go to block um I can click here and now I can make it lighter I am going to make it lighter so then the logo will stand out a little more now we could spend a little more time making this match a little more but we'll just continue if you want when you're making your own store you can uh spend as much time as you want on making the different things look good actually we'll do one more thing we'll put in a heading here and I'll say heading now we'll just put our slogan which is going to be stick with code code with stickers and I'm also going to Center that now we can see that there's these short codes that can put in different things like uh the short code it's going to put in all the categories on top and then it's going to put in different products and these products see if I click on here it highlights this whole new product section and if I look over here it's going to say display a grid of your newest products so this section is always is going to show newest products this section is always going to show the handpick products display a selection of handpick products in the grid and fam favorites uh this is the ones that ra the the top now these are automatically generated based on the criteria um so if we go to we recommend you can choose what's going to show up do you want the the pro you can turn off product image um you can turn off product title takes a little bit to update but you can change the price you can turn on on and off the rating and stuff like this and then here here products here's where you can choose the products the you can see we have hoodie hoodie with pocket hoodie with zipper so the products can be chosen right here for what you recommend but then some of these are just developed automatically like fan favorites these are going to be automatically based on the rating and but there's an other settings you can do for each section and then you can choose the on sale products now personally I think this is too much so you don't need all these set these sections so I'm I'm going to get rid of some of them I'm going to get rid of on sale uh best sellers I can just basically delete it I'll I'll just keep fan I'll just keep the we recommend and fan favorites and then we also have no no we won't even have fan favorites we're trying to simplify this store and we're just going to have um new n and we recommend except I want to uh change the order of the SE so I want to get this we recommend above the the new end so see this I can select this section the we recommend section and then just do move up move up move up and then I have to go to the we recommend um you can obviously make changes to the font the style and every and the text so I'm going to just click up up up and now we're going to have shopy category we recommend and then the new n and you can also change what the the preview is this is like in Google if someone searches it will show this uh preview of what's going to be on the page and you can make updates to that you can make updates to the page title The Meta description and there's a bunch of things that you can uh change and you can see it also even gives you a page analysis so you can see the Met description is over 160 characters so if we change that I'm going to just delete that so let's try this description if we go down here we see that we have a good content length and then you can go through here and fix all these and we see we have some other problems we can go through each one and fix them I'm not going to take the time to do that right now but you can do that on your own okay I'm just going to click update and then we can view the page and now we can see the updated page and it's getting more customized okay let's customize it further we want to uh customize the links up here and we can see we actually do have the the blog here so you can see these blog posts and we're going to actually customize all these pages to make it work better for what we want first of all we want the shop to be the second link at their home it's the most important part since this is a shop so to update this menu here we're have to go back to the wp admin the WordPress admin page and then we're going to go to appearance and menus here I'm already on the menus page then we're going to create a new menu so I'll just put Main and then we will make this the primary menu and create menu and we these notifications we don't need to worry about that and now I can add items to the menu so for first going to add the shop top page and then we're going to add the cart checkout and let's just look at what's already on here we got cart checkout my account shop so we're going to basically add all those same things but just change the order so I'm also want the the blog page and I should have been clicking add to menu here okay so it's going to be the shop first then Blog then cart then checkout then my account and then I will save the menu now let's go to the page and I'll just refresh the page okay that works shop blog cart check out my account we don't have the main page anymore but that's okay CU when you click the logo here it should load the main page and most people are used to that so we have shop blog cart checkout main account great and actually I'm gonna go back to the main screen we go to get started and we're going to go to AI assistant so now we can see how we can create content with AI and it's going to be uh efor lent timesaving SEO friendly and so we can see what type of content do we need want to make a post a page a product so we can make all sorts of things with AI so um this this is going to be why Developers should put stickers on their laptops and we can change the tone neutral formal TR I'm going to change this to Friendly and witty and it'll make it long okay so now I'll just do generate content okay good we have an image and then we have the the article sticker up your laptop why developers should embrace the art of personalization as a developer your laptop is the most prized possession and then it talks about uh adding a touch of Personality we're talking about stickers and it gives all show off your interest Foster creative environment stand out from the crowd it's just plain fun so I'm just going to publish it we just now have a new article on our blog and I could have done edit as draft to personalize it but now we can see we have an article on our blog just like this and so here's the blog post we see this we see everything and people can even comment on it and log in and comment on it if we want to customize what these blog posts look like well one way to go about it is to click this edit post so edit post is is where we can actually edit the words we can say as a developer your laptop is your most important possession good now it's a now this is an article actually written by me since I put at least one word into it and you can change all these things and even has a page analysis here okay we know how to add a blog post now let's get to the real the real stuff of what this is this is a store so let's customize the shop specifically let's add new products we are going to add stickers that people can actually buy in real life so if we go back to our WordPress uh dashboard we go to products and then it's going to show all the products um so before we were just using these products as examples we don't want any of those products so I am going to select here and then I I'm just going to move to bin and apply so I just select all the products and I deleted all the products so now we we are just about to start adding new products but first we have to create the products so remember these are this is a a sticker store and we are going to use AI to create our sticker designs so for that we need an AI image generator there's a plenty of them out there like I've mentioned I'm going to use gbd4 with uh Dolly the beta version and if you don't have access to this version there's plenty of other ones you can use some of them are open source and you can run locally or on a website and this is what I'm going to do I'll say create some sticker designs for my sticker store here is the description of the store and I'll just put the description we made earlier welcome to coders stickers.com the premier Online Marketplace where every sticker tells a code story okay now I'm going to say create a few more but the website name should not be on them but some of these stickers I like I'm still going to use some of these uh this one I like so I'm going to download this one and this is interesting because uh I guess they're a bug I don't know what that's supposed to be but sure we're we're going to create that as a sticker and then this is going to be a sticker I'm going to just download that let's see what else it comes up with oh yeah this is I like that one nice okay and I'm actually going to take all these into an image editor to kind of cut them out to to process them better for our store now create a few more sticker designs for software Developers now uh let's I'm going to actually change the prompt now make a list of sticker design ideas for software developers then create the best ideas so we're going to see if it can create better stickers if it first creates the list okay let's look at these oh these are really cool actually I'm G to do that one that one actually I don't know if I can do this one because it's um it's kind of cut off on the edge uh but this one is also going to be a good one this is almost like a devops sticker now what I'm going to do I'm going to go into my image editor okay I'm using Affinity photo but you may be using Photoshop there's also canva and there's a lot of free online image editors you can use so you can basically do this in any image editor so what I'm going to do is uh basically delete all the parts that are not going to be in the sticker uh we want it to be uh transparent around the actual sticker so I'm going to select this I will um select this let's see if I change the tolerance that's too much so I deleted everything around but then I need to add some stuff back I'm I'm going to add a white outline okay now I just have to delete a few extra things here and then I'll crop the image so we can see we have the transparent stuff around the image and then we do have a white border around everything and then I'm going to save it and then I'll just start on another one this should be pretty easy to select out usually I like to put a white line around it but this one I'm not I'll just save it just like this and then another one and then I'll just do a few more off camera so I made a bunch of stickers and I want to make it so people can actually buy the stickers I found this website called printful there's a few other websites like this where they will print on demand uh this is not the only one you can use there's a few other ones but I'm actually going to create the stickers on printful and then add them to my WordPress site and then people will actually be able to order and then they will print them on demand so first I have to make a new product so if I go to product catalog um actually so if I go to product template I'll say create product and then I just go to stickers I can search for stickers and we want kiss cut stickers um mainly this is the cheapest type of stickers and a kiss cut sticker means it will be cut out along the edge of the sticker that's why we needed the transparency because uh the transparency is where it will be um cut off so I'm just going to drag my sticker design into here and I could add a few other different types of products but I'm not going to but we can see what it's going to look up look like I can click mockups and then you can see what it's going to look like on a a a computer or a car and you can see the transparency it doesn't become any part of the sticker so that's why we need to create that transparency okay so now that we have the sticker we can also choose what sizes we want I'll just keep all the sizes though I think the small sizes will will be better for the sticker and I'll just do save to templates and then I'm going to add the rest of the stickers just like that but we still see we have a a few of them here so I'm going to do add to store and I need to connect a store so let's just click connect store and then I'll go to choose platform and then I just want to find WordPress oh W commas it's right here so connecting to woocommerce and it's basically going to give instructions here but I'll just show you how to do it we're going to go back to our WordPress settings we go to Blue Commerce and then I'm going to go to settings if I go to Advanced and uh it's going to keep showing this this we can do this if we want but we're not going to connect but I'm going to go to um Legacy API and then enable the Legacy rest API so the next thing we need to do is make sure the Perman links are set up correctly so go to settings Pera links and then I'm going to swi switch it to post name so this is something we probably wanted to do anyways where the links uh in the the default was just going to be like P1 23 but now it's going to actually say the name of the post right in the URL which I think looks a little nicer and it's going to be better for SEO as well so I'm going to go to save changes for that and now we can see if the woocommerce API is working so to do that I'm going to go to the code stickers.com and I'm going to type in WC API that's woocommerce V1 and so now that we're getting this Json that means the API is working correctly okay now I'm going to go back to um plugins we haven't really talked too much about plugins but they can be used to add extra features to whoops they can be used to add extra features to your site and we talked about some of the default uh plugins that get installed we're going to install the printful plugin so I'm going to click add new and then I'll search and then install and then I have to activate it and now we'll have a new tab here the printful tab so let me click here and it says almost done just two more steps so I'm going to so I'm going to click connect follow link and I'm going to approve this now I just have to log in again and connect store okay now I'm just going to add product my product templates and I'm going to okay proceed to mockups and we'll just do basic mockups so we're going to do this mockup or just has the computer in the middle and then continue and we don't have to become a member that just gives us different rates so the retail price must be higher than the printful price okay now we can basically set the price so I'm just making it so they go at least a little more than the printful price I'm actually just going to make it so I make $1 for every sticker okay and submit to store make I know it's called Bubble free stickers but I want to change what the the title is so this is GNA be called coffee coding sticker I'm going to click where it says View and woo Commerce okay we have all the different uh computer mockups here and you can choose the size add to basket it and then we can then if we go to cart we can see that we have the sticker I'm going go over to printful and add some more now I'm just going to upload the rest of the images and create the rest of the products okay just added a bunch more stickers well not a bunch but a few extra and so you can all obviously customize what the images and what the mockups going to look like but now that they're all added I'm going to go to view in woo Commerce let's look at what our woocommerce store looks like I'm going to go right to the shop page and now we can see the the different stickers the Bas and Bug sticker bug catcher cod's art coffee coating sticker devops coaster sticker idea machine sticker uh USB tree I guess I forgot to type in sticker there uh so these are all the the stickers you can get in the shop and so if we go into one then we can select options so I'll just select the depending on on what you select it's going to uh change the size it's going to uh change the skew and it's going to make it look a different size on the the laptop mockup so if we go to 3x3 I can add that to basket and then go to the cart now we have the two things we have the coffee coating sticker we have the USB tree and then we'll just do proceed to check out so if if we look down here we can see it's just basically another a normal cart and uh there's a few things we can see one is that there are no available payment method so we have to set up the payment methods and the second thing is that I don't think I want to see these recent blog post on the side here so let's fix both of those things to remove this sidebar on the cart page and some other places um depending on what theme you have you can click customize and there for some themes there will be a way to customize it from in here however with this theme it's going to be a little trickier we have to go to our dashboard and we're going to actually have to edit a PHP file uh it's sounds kind of tricky but it's not as it's not not as hard as you would think we can go to appearance and then theme file editor and then click I understand now we are going to edit the functions.php file so I'm just going to scroll down to this bottom of this page and we're going to ignore where it says do not add Cod custom code here because we are going to add a custom code you just have to remember that if you update it's it's going to um remove it so you may have to add it again if you update so I'm just going to paste in some code here and this is the function remove storefront sidebar it's going to check if it's woocommerce or if it's the checkout then it's going to do a remove action and we have ADD action where it's going to this is where it's going to call the function remove storefront sidebar so I'm going to update that file now I just have to update one more file which is the CSS file so going to style. CS CSS and then I can just scroll to the bottom of this one and I'm going to add this I'm going to make the width 100% for by. woocommerce and body. woocommerce checkout and then I'll just hit update file and then if we go back back to our page and we go to the checkout page you can see we don't have the sidebar anymore here so here's the checkout page and you can see it says sorry it seems like there are no available payment methods please con so we basically have to add some payment methods that's that's going to be the next step here so I'm going to go to the dashboard and then I'm going to click on payments right here so we will install woo payments and you can see that there are no step costs or monthly fees it just takes a fee basically out of each sale that you make okay I'll just go through the setup process I decided not to show you that because there was a ton of personal information to get the payment set up that I don't want to share with with everybody but we got that set up and you can figure that out on your own if if you're doing the setup it's pretty straightforward and so it says congratulations your store has been verified so you can see that we are paying 27 cents per transaction Plus 2.61 or it normally be 30 cents per transaction I'm only making a dollar so that would be basically 70 cents per sticker we also have to make sure we set up our our shipping and taxes so to get our shipping set up I'm going to go to settings woocommerce settings and then I will go to ship to all countries you sell to I also want to enable tax ring calculations I might as well turn off the coupon codes right here and then I'm going to save changes and then go to shipping so I'm going to go to print full shipping enable this shipping method disable standard wo Commerce rates for products fulfilled by printful so we want to enable sh the shipping this shipping method the printful shipping method we want to disable standard woocommerce rat for products fulfilled by printful so printful is going to just handle all the shipping and then we are going to set which shipping methods we want printful use so we have to go to the printful tab here then I'll go to the settings tab and then I can allow printf to calculate the sales tax and I'll keep going down to these shipping methods so these are all the shipping methods that are offered from pimpl and I'm just going to keep all of these I mean I I could if I didn't want to offer some I could could take them off but those all look pretty good to me okay I'll save the changes because of the tax button I clicked here now let's go to the site look at the cart my cart's empty I'm going go to the shop and I'm going to choose this USB tree 3x3 actually I'll do the 4x4 I'll add the basket now I can go to the check out oh air missing or invalid printful store Key we have something not working for that so let me go to the dashboard again I did notice when I was in settings I'm going to try reconnecting the store okay now it's actually showing the shipping so I can click a flat rate so we're paying it's kind of an expensive sticker $3.40 for the sticker and then $3.99 for the shipping so it's it going to be a total of$ 783 okay sure and then I place my order and it says order received okay so let's see what the order looks like in the dashboard so I go to the dashboard and if we go to woocommerce and orders now you can see there's going to be two orders I tried an order before that didn't really work out be um so this is the the other order I made that I kind of messed up on so if we go to this order so hopefully this order will go through if we go back to printf and we go to orders hopefully we'll see the order that's going oh okay it says it's failed no billing method added okay I have to add a billing method because uh stripe took the money and then we have to send it over to print full so addit building method so I just set up the build method on printful and how it works is first the customer pays me and then I have to pay printful and then hopefully I make some sort of profit so the first money comes to me and then I pay printful based on the money that came to me so let me try just uh purchasing the sticker one more time so I'm going to click USB tree add the basket check out okay I've placed the order now I'm going to look at PRL again on the order dashboard if I refresh this okay it didn't fail it's it's waiting for fulfillment so this sticker is actually going to be sent to me it says orders waiting for fulfillment estimated fulfillment October 20th through 25th that means our store is pretty much done I me we can go through and customize things more so all that's left now is to add more products and use the AI tools to add more blog
