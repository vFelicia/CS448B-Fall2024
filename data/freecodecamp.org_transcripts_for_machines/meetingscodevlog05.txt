this week was focused on meetings i've just had a call with the client and i'm super happy i've also developed a few pens using flexbox and sauce i practice another ui elements using flexbox i just got disappointed because because great layout and it's not ready for production yet because it's not supported by the browsers uh so well let's keep it for a while maybe i will come back to it somewhere in the future because it's not able to be used without very much hacks yes so traveling here in spain you see how much you lose when you don't change something don't go out sit in one place and do not notice what's all around you the same as in programming when you stay in one language when you don't try another stuff when you don't try another framework you get stacked of it you feel safe but you don't don't get out of your comfort zone if you are frontend you cannot just only close yourself like oh i will do that pages and bootstrap and or in you know i will just only design or i will just only use um angularjs because i hate react it's like specializing in one is great but being aware of what's around you and trying new things is even better variety has its reason you cannot close yourself just only to one thing and stick to it it's the end of your life so the fact that today for example you are learning react doesn't mean that you're programming viago or throughout your life if you stick just into this one framework language and not try anything new by ears it's like getting old a bit because idea is such a fast pace branch that you have to be at least aware of what's going on and especially if you work on projects where later you can design or you're a team member who has an influence on choosing the framework the solution that you know the database whatever player it's like if you are not aware of what's around you and what's better for what then you choose and suggest your clients yeah well go for this you know framework go for this solution and you jump straight to it just only because you know it not just because it's the best one great that holiday season is almost finished because all of the meetup starts living again so this week i'm going to usb tech we are trying also to organize next from the malaga and another coffee end code meeting there are at least three kinds of meetings worth considering while learning to code number one meetups at this page meetup.com you can find local meetups that are being organized in your city or you know close to your city it's thursday today i'm going for the first unofficial uh meeting of yes we tech this season yes we take its focus on diversity and equality in tech shall we begin let's begin number two project meetings i love this book it's reworked by jason fried and th as they say meetings are toxic in this book they also give the quick simple rules how to you know deal with meetings this is the list set a timer when a drinks meeting is over period so you know to schedule amount of time that you really want to devote to the meeting it would be perfect invite as few people as possible and always have a clearer agenda begin with a specific problem meet at the side of the problem instead of a conference room point to real things and suggest real changes end with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it meetings are like time stealers and when i meet with a client and to talk about the project i try firstly to prepare it and uh to to prepare the ground for it to send him some list of questions firstly and to discuss just only the doubts and you know some unexpected uh things that he hadn't mentioned so far i'm learning it i'm learning also it's how to schedule the meetings uh in order to be more productive with them and in order to get as much as possible from them i've just had a call with the client and i'm super happy and i want to share with you that why i want to share it is because it teaches another thing about being freelancer and developer the thing is that because of asking properly the questions because of clarifying the details because of making from the general concept something that is tangible we reached the solution that seems to be really really awesome and really interesting to to design connecting learning with working as a freelancer is seems to be a really nice solution because you have extra time for learning but also you know money to survive and uh it it gives you the real the real life experience i would suggest going for smaller projects and for for the tasks that you really feel you know at least comfortable with they should be challenging they should be challenging in order to make you grow in order to make you develop and in order to like their work and you know the projects to make them inspiring also for you this real life experience is like a real training before bigger projects and bigger jobs remember that you don't need permission to start coding to start designing to start freelancing and to start taking projects and to start you know working with clients being selfaware and being reliable you can really start doing it right now and the third type of meetings of topics so meetings with friends and meetings you know connected with your hobbies meetings connected with staying alive in other fields of life there are some myths about people who close themselves and you know in like in cabinet and eat shitty pizza and simply learn coding in order to stay focused but it's not a way for me to do it i need variety in order to stay motivated in order to learn coffee isn't the fuel of my coat variety is it's after 6 p.m and i'm going out to the next meeting this week and in order to use the time on my way i'll be listening to the podcasts i've just finished listening to the podcast to the last late night with travel noise about productivity and about selfawareness it's really worth recommending in order to stay motivated you cannot sit all the time in front of the screen you have to go out we are trying to find the gift for our friends we are going for the meeting this will be more tonic and we are also presenting foreign thank you this week i took part in a few meetings and was trying to organize a few next the main problem of this week display grid and the fact that it's not supported by the browsers i gathered few brownies helping other people on twitter but also i need some more to reach my 500 brownie challenge so i will keep on helping other people next week next week i will have to put the priority to the new project that i'm starting it's connected with design but from learning to code and my personal learning to code projects i will start implementing the new portfolio using flexbox and sas keep on doing go for productive meetings and see you soon you
