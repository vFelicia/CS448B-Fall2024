hey everybody its Jessie and today we're gonna do some more beginner friendly stuff I guess so we're gonna work on styling so mainly be dealing with CSS with sass and possibly some of we'll be looking at the material UI documentation and trying to work with some of the options that already come with the components I'd rather work with the options than try to override it but we may have to just you know try to override some stuff with our own CSS if we have to do that that's okay too I want to catch catch everyone up to what I've been working on I guess the end of yesterday and for this morning so you can check out my Trello board and see kind of what's moved around there's a link in the description but mainly I have set up a server so I have a droplet on digitalocean I talked about going through the set up in a stream but I decided well for one I already did the exact same set up for a last project and I stream that so anybody who really wants to see that can go back to the last thing I stream the the other reason is simply because a lot of it is just following documentation and copy and pasting commands and that's much easier to do without making mistakes if I can focus and not have to worry about talking when I'm doing it and I was able to get though everything set up and in probably 40 minutes or less so it went it went really quickly you know I was able to focus so it's all set up it has its running ubuntu 16.04 nginx is the reverse proxy node and it's set up with a SSL and I pointed that obviously I pointed a domain name to it and set up the SSL and so that's already the last step is simply to just bring in the repository I'm just going to use git for that so right before the stream started I was just trying to set up the SSH keys in my github account so that I could just bring the bring the repository right in so the flow of updating will be I push from my local machine to github and then I pull from github into the server and then rebuild everything and the updates will be live at that point all right so let me say hate everybody in the lab chat get a few few you in there Alex asks is there a playlist for these videos yes there is a playlist and it's called I don't know this code let me check I think it's like maybe Jesse builds a react app live something like that I can if some if somebody knows put in the live set otherwise I'm gonna look it up on my other screen I add videos every day to this playlist you think I'd remember what the name of it is alright flail is okay the playlist is called Jesse builds a react project live that's the playlist for just this project project too if you want to see all the videos including project one the playlist is just live coding with Jesse at some point I should probably split them out into two different playlists but for now that how they're divided up so we are on day 29 no one day 30 so there are 29 videos currently in the playlist this is number 30 we will be finishing this project up pretty soon assuming there's not a lot of changes whenever this gets reviewed ok so quickly I'm gonna go over the the changes that I've made and then we're gonna start into style some things there's a few things that are really obvious that need style because they just look a little bit weird and some other areas where it already looks ok we're just gonna make it look a little bit better I am gonna start my comodoro timer I'd like to get at probably like 2 or 3 sessions and depending on how many questions we have and how many you know how many people are in the in the live chat so I'd like to get at least two sessions and we'll see how it goes if you're not familiar with the strain the way things go is this is just my everyday work that I'm doing so whatever I need to work on in my normal job as a frontend developer I work on and I share it all with you I organize my work normally with in Pomodoro sessions so we do 25minute code sessions and then in between we take fiveminute breaks and I answer questions in the lab chat at the end of the stream I answer all the questions that that you all put in the live chat I welcome any questions and also comments and advice in the live chat as well let's see I think that's my normal I need to write down like my normal explanation for the channels I don't forget and then I can just rattle it off at the beginning also I have a secondary stream on Instagram so if you're watching on Instagram you can see my my monitors and all the code at free code camp on their YouTube channel so check out that YouTube channel and this video is titled styling react components in this project to day 30 so check that out if you want to see the code otherwise you'll just be seeing my face which won't be that helpful if you'd like to know more about styling react components all right so let's let's get started just you know really quickly showing what I've done the mainly my work has been other than setting up the server my work has been on this service request form if you remember we had a branch that was the file type check branch and we were doing some work with form validation on that branch that's now been merged into master I got it to the point where I thought you know it was it was ready not perfect but functional and so that's merged now in the master so if you're checking out the repository the links in the description the master branch now has has everything in it there are no side branches that are being worked on currently so here's what I've done and you can see so this is what it it did look like with the check boxes so we had basically you know these icons when you clicked it it just came up with an alert basically just to say like hey it works when you click on this and we had the check boxes now I've redone the check boxes so that a few few improvements so this was a really big step done by Sebastian and I just kind of finished that up over here and that now depending on what data you pass into the component you could get an icon that icon could be whatever you want it doesn't have to be the information icon and then when you click on it a modal opens you can pass in a title and then you can pass in HTML style you know however you want and currently this is this is what we have so just you know regular unordered list I'll show you all the code for this also you know the check boxes work now we have a separate component that so we're passing you know the click event up to the parent component which is this whole page I'll show you how that works so what I ended up doing was I split if you remember our problem was trying to get the check box and the icon together and being able to click on it get different information so that was we were just trying to figure out the best way to do that I think at some point last week so this is what I came up with so now instead of doing all this in the service request form which is already getting quite large I just separated out into another component so this is called the icon check box component so here's what we're doing the only state that we're even tracking here is just for the modal we're leaving the state for the check box itself whether or not it's checked here in the parent component of service request j/s because we want all that data all that form data to stay in state here so we can send it you know we can read that we can send it off to our server j/s file and then handle all that form data from there so that's why I left it here otherwise normally I would handle you know component state I mean assuming I wasn't you know using some other state management technique but for something basic I will probably just handle state right here in the component like I'm doing here but it makes more sense in this case to do it the parent component and I'm not using Redux or anything like that for this so I usually get people are you using redox or why don't you use redox so this is a simple enough react project that I didn't really think it needed Redux I'm also not that great with Redux yet to even be confident and implementing it but I am trying to learn currently on on another project okay so pretty basic we just have a handle dialogue open handle dialogue close okay this is nothing different than what we're already doing in this component with our dialogue for when when you submit the form so we actually didn't have a handle dialog open because that was handled in the form submission function so we just added that in now down here we have our check box and this is our material UI check box but then depending on the value for icon I think it's passed and let me show you on on the right side where we pass this in you can see this is a very large component it's yeah down here down here there we go I'm think I'm gonna make this a bit bigger a bit wider here it'll be a lot easier to read okay so here we go here's our icon check box components and you see it's capable of taking in a lot of a lot of properties so we're passing in things for the check box and these are all just normal things that you pass in for the material you I component the same thing that we're doing right down here this these checkboxes are the old way that we were doing it okay so it's the same thing the only thing that's even you know slightly different here is and on check we pass the event up right to our handle check here and then it calls handle input change and passes that event on right you see otherwise right we all we had to do was on check call handle input change but now that we've put this into another component we have to pass that event I actually had I had a big I spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this because I couldn't get it to work and it turns out I was doing everything right except I was passing in label here instead of name so it was trying to update the information in state for a component that didn't even exist I'm sorry for a checkbox that didn't exist right because the labels uppercase but the name is lowercase so anyway that was pretty frustrating definitely would have saved like a half an hour of kind of backandforth troubleshooting if I would have just passed in the right prop so that happens sometimes so anyway the checkbox like I said other than this it operates exactly the same and here's the kind of the new portion so if this is true so we have C we have icon here so basically within our data I guess I should share the data because that might make a little bit more sense so here's our data for our checkboxes so we can pass in a lot more now than we were before see before we basically a name info you can either put an icon false like we're doing here or it'll check and if the icon data doesn't even exist it'll automatically pass in false so I filled this in before I put this check in for that so but it really doesn't matter I'll probably end up taking out the icon false just to keep things a little bit a little bit shorter in here but in this case for that first check box you can see we're passing in the name the info text I'm actually not using this now so I'll get rid of this this was Sebastian and put this in just kind of more as an example like hey here's where you put in your data so we do have icon true now here's where we have that everything for the modal so we get passing the title for the modal and then for dialogue text we put in our HTML and I have this inside a template literal that way I don't have to worry about using single or double quotes inside of here it's just it's kind of easy I think I'm only using a single quote yeah so you know right here but potentially I could be using them you know in more places so if you can use template literal definitely recommend that if you're gonna put a lot of content in there so you can see this is just you know regular HTML normally I wouldn't want to have like huge blocks of HTML in here but we're not really gonna do this often in fact this my be the only checkbox that even gets extra info so we'll see maybe once the people in my department see that this is possible they might want extra info for some other things as well but I don't think we'll have anything nearly this big otherwise our data file is gonna get huge okay so there's our data and you can see we're passing that in so here's the icon so we have this as an image and then our source is just gonna be our source from the source with the SVG is so let me go up to the top here's who we're bringing in that so we're importing info logo from image info dot SVG all right so we're pulling that in here and then we're passing it in props so we could pass in anything we wanted in terms of a logo really we could bring in a source for an image if we wanted to I guess I don't know how great that would look probably not that good since we're intending it to be a logo but and then we are also putting in an alt tag currently I think I just have hardcoded let me double check on that I do it just says info button really I think we just need an alt or else it'll react I'll complain either reactor I don't know if it's specific to create rec react app but I'm pretty sure that's what was happening before so I mean it's a good idea to have alt text anyway if I get a new situation where I have lots of different logos in here then I'd probably want to put it in our data file and pass incorrect alt text but right now the only thing we're gonna have our info button so that works all right and that's it to get the the logo and we have you know some positioning here but other than that we have our dialogue so this is our material UI dialog component and we're just passing in the title and then here this is how we can use the HTML so inside of this dialog component I have a span and we're dangerously setting the inner HTML you can't do that on the actual dialog component itself because this component ends up outputting you know several other divs inside of it so I've tried tried it it does not work so you need to put a span inside and then anything inside here is going to be put in the right place within that modal within that dialog so we just have a span here we're setting the dangerously setting the interests UML if we didn't do it like this then the user would actually see all the HTML tags when you do this though it's a good idea to only do this if you have complete control of the data you're not gonna have like users submitted data in there but as long as you have control your data this is fine even though it it seems dangerous it's it's completely fine if if you know for sure what's going to be coming through here okay and that's that's pretty much it that's all I've done yeah at least that's all I can remember that I've done since yesterday so I just need to apply that same thing to this side and we need to do a bit of styling so that we don't have this huge gap between checkboxes so we can come back to that styling but I'd like to work on the home page first all right because this is what this will people are gonna see right off the bat if there's any page I want to spend the most time on in terms of style it's definitely going to be the home page it's entirely possible that the majority of people won't see you know a lot of these other these other views but we know you know this looks really plain I'd like to put in I have some ideas for what I'd like to put in so let's just try them out and see if you all have any ideas for what make this look a bit less plain I mean I'm I'm really I like the clean look but this is almost sterile you know it's it's like beyond clean at this point so like to add a little bit in maybe a little bit of color possibly some icons we'll see I don't want to go crazy with the icons then it's it's just kind of hard you know you want to try to find different types of icons when you end up throwing things in there that don't even they don't then make sense so I'd rather not put an IKE I'd rather not just throw in icons just for something to look at if they don't mean really mean anything so first we're just going to try adding in some color and see how that looks like I said I wonder trying to get about the screen this is more like the screen size that's common here at the University so I'd like to try try to keep that in mind as we're styling this so my monitor is way bigger than the normal screen size of people that work here yeah I think that's about it off the double check the analytics and see what kind of screens we get mostly I do want to double check the live chat let's see okay I just want to remember to check in case you know occasionally I'm doing something really wrong and you all let me know a lot in the live chat so didn't want to go too long without at least taking a peek at it here's what I'm thinking I'd like to maybe put a border on the left of each of these titles and I'd like to mess around with some of the different colors that are available in the university's color palette and just see how it looks I'm not you know I kind of have an idea in my head of how it will look but you never know until you really you know get it on there and see not really sure how would it look to with the colors you know should we do more than one how many more should we alternate so let's just do it and see what it looks like so this maybe we'll put I think I'd like to add a class to this I guess to this span yeah we're gonna have to do it to this span let's see let's check out our components see how this is we may not be able to easily add a class but if we just select the first fan I think we should be fine so let's see we're using the component for a components generic car that's it yes we're using a generic card and card header so there's the title okay so it's in the card title okay I don't want to put it in this style here because like we saw here this applies I should make this a bit bigger it's easy for you to see see if you can see here that styling is applied I believe that's applied to this div and if I try to put a border on this dev it's gonna be bigger than we want so I want to target that span yeah all right let's do that let's just try to do it in in CSS then unless I mean it's possible that there's a way to target that interior span with material UI but I'm guessing not just from what I've seen from the other components that we worked with so let's go leave our home dot s CSS file and let's actually bring out our home component and the card container all right let's see if this will allow us to to get that span there we go so we have okay all right that should work I guess I could have just used flex then like I did up here but if I'm using what I want to avoid is having these styles spill over into other places where I don't want them so that's why we added this here okay and I will say when you're doing styles for react there are so many ways right now to do it this is just one of those those ways there are a lot of different ways to do your CSS right in the component and then in this particular way we're using sass which certainly don't have to use so I don't I don't want to make it seem like this is the way to do it this is just one way to do it and in fact we did it very differently on the last project so if you want to see an alternative you could check that out but we just you know we happen to be doing it this way on this project I I have not made up my mind as to what way I like the best so I'm still kind of trying different things out and hopefully at some point I'll settle on on some consistent way of doing it but I'm not there yet okay and let's go with for now we can just target the span because the other span right now is a height of zero pixels so I mean we'll see in a second but it shouldn't it shouldn't do anything if we put a border on that so let's go the border left and solid let's try let's try two pixels we may have to go three but I want to see what looks like first and then I don't what color I want to try first I'm gonna grab let's grab this color and I need to set up my sash right now is not set up it's not taking advantage of a lot of things that SAS can do and it should it should be just haven't really taken the time to get everything set up properly yet you know normally we would want to be importing all our variables into our SAS files so that we could use those variables so you know for sure our color variables your color palette we want to have them be all variables but you know probably some other things as well all right yeah that's terrible I don't like that okay here's what we need to do all right so this definitely needs to be more than two pixels I'm gonna go three pixels right now and yeah I don't like that all right let's try this out so let's decrease our line height we're gonna make our lion height the same as our font size now that brings this kind of shrinks it up a little bit too much but okay so that's in line so we're gonna have to use important we're gonna have to use important to override those inline Styles you do want to be careful when you use important because obviously it's it's going to be more difficult if you you're basically undoing the cascading nature of cascading style sheets when you use something like this so you don't use it all the time but in this case this is just so much easier than trying to dig into the components and figure out I just really don't want to edit the material UI components directly I'd rather try to do things on top of that and we want to add in some padding left of let's try four pixels we'll see how that looks okay all right yeah I like that and we won margin what a margin on the bottom and the top of let's go with eight pixels and then went zero on the sides okay yeah that gives us back to the same spacing that we had originally or at least pretty close to it now I think I'd like to have our text lined up so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go we'll go we'll keep our eight pixels on top we'll go zero on the right and then we'll do eight pixels on the bottom and then on the left I'm gonna go with negative let's see we're doing padding there four pixels let's go negative let's it's gonna probably gonna be too much we'll try it first just to start okay that's not bad it's pretty close yeah I think seven seven is better right that makes sense because we've added a 4 pixel padding left and then we have a 3 pixel border so 7 pixels puts us back where you were that way we have our text lined up I think that looks a bit nicer let me know what you think though okay so we have this did we put our padding in already I think I'm gonna copy both of these and we're gonna have to use did I add these I don't think we'll have to use important because I think I added these both in so let's see if it works I'm gonna save that yep all right so it did work so now we have a little bit of color I'm not I don't really know if I like it or not let's see my timer did go off a few minutes ago and I just wanted to finish that up so you have something to look at I'm gonna take a short break now and go to the live chat and see what you all think and also if there's any questions I'll try to answer as many as I can in this is five minutes okay so John John Hanson says I believe most react components work best passing down function rather than passing up is this true JavaScript and suffer from bubbling can this happen in react to yet I guess I think this question probably came when we were going over the icon checkbox and passing us up so basically yeah normally you do want to pass things down to from parent to child and react but sometimes you have to in certain situations like this one you you do have a child component and it needs to let the parent component know what's happening normally I've only had this situation happen where I have inputs that are in child components and I need to let the parent component know if something is changed with that input so there are probably other situations where you'd want to but I haven't dealt with them yeah yeah probably inputs are the the main thing so in that case I I think I haven't found any negative let's see side effects from from doing it like that not to say that they don't exist I just haven't encountered them yet pravin ask what is react learning curve I mean how much time will it take for basic JavaScript developer angularjs new developer to learn react jeaious and react native it's hard to say how much time really because that depends it depends on how much time you have to dedicate to it every day that I get to learning it and how quick of a learner you are and how much you already know so it's really it would be hard to say I can only speak for myself I started working with reacts I want to say it's been less than a year since I've been working with react so it took me it took me probably a few months before I before I actually launched a react site for a client before that you know I I just done some some things just to learn really I didn't have all day to dedicate to it I was working on other projects that weren't you know where I wasn't using react so I would I would say if you could dedicate let's say you could dedicate all your time to it you can get pretty good with reacting in a month or less you know I'm talking like fulltime learning you know building things otherwise if you're working a fulltime job you know you have those projects you know I'd say a couple of months but like I said it's really hard to say it's it's kind of an individual thing there's a lot of factors that would go into that some guy responds respond to that question learn JavaScript first at least the basics up to objects and go through x6 then start learning concepts of react mainly components yes I mean you're definitely going to need to know some JavaScript to be able to know react you don't need to be an expert in JavaScript oh certainly you'll your JavaScript skills will get better as you learn react as well so if you if you did want to jump into react it's it's probably fine you know if you have limited knowledge of JavaScript it'll just be harder to get through react but you know eventually your skills will they'll have to get better if you want to be good at react perviness is es6 necessary to learn react I don't necessary to know all of the Essex but es6 will help make things easier I mean even even just the syntactic sugar part of es6 will make things easier but yeah I would say it's not like there's that much to es6 or es2015 whatever I I read a comment to a blog post earlier where somebody was so mad that someone said es8 instead of es 2017 so I don't wanna make anybody mad officially I think it's we're going with the es 2015 16 17 but in any case yeah you can get started with react without great knowledge of es6 but it's your life will be easier if you learn it and then Praveen says can you suggest some links or references to learn and let's see some suggestions were Codecademy yeah I've done their react stuff that's good Udacity has a react course it's paid though so it depends on your budget for you know for learning materials for react if you want to stick with the free stuff code Academy is good and then I mean there's so many YouTube videos that could be helpful lets trying to think learn code Academy is a YouTube channel that has a lot of good videos and has some serious on react actually earlier today I was just watching a video on Redux on that channel I think will Stern is the guy that does all the videos on that channel so you can check that out the react tutorials on that channel are a little bit older so there might be some updates to the way things are done but the overall concepts are still the same and react so those would be just off the top of my head that's probably one of the best channels that I've personally watched for react stuff on YouTube and then certainly you know these streams you'll pick up a lot about react on these streams but these you know it's not really a tutorial so there'll be a lot of gaps like this is not a systematic way of learning react it's just you get to see what I happen to be doing at 200 p.m. every day okay all right my time I did go off so I'm not through the chat so I'm gonna have to come back to that so if I didn't get to your question yet don't worry I'll get to it in our next break or towards the end of the stream and if you can't stick around for the live stream to get the answer you can always check out the recording that's available on a free code camp YouTube channel later on and then you'll be able to hear the answer answer there let's see all right let's reset this do another 25minute session okay I'm gonna scroll down to the bottom and see if anyone had any comments on the styles okay all right so John Hanson is not a fan of the border on the left okay I don't think I'm thinking anybody else so if anybody else has an opinion on this let me know like I said after I saw it I'm not I don't hate it but I'm not I'm not sure that this is exactly what what we need here I mean I think maybe it's better than nothing it's part of the thing that that is bothering me about this too is that we have this this one card this the title is going it down on the two lines there's not really anything we can do about that yes I mean we can try you know know what I would like to try I think I want this text this how can Markham help you text to be permanently closer to the top and then have these centered so basically right now this is vertically centered but the entire div is vertically centered including this so what what happens is all of this appears to not be centered it appears to be towards the bottom more so what I'd like to do is take this out of that div so this isn't taken into consideration for the centering and then have these come up a little bit I think depending on the screen size it's not going to be that big of a difference but I do think it'll help it will help out a blank space on the bottom is not as big of a deal as blank space on the top when there's blank space on the top it really I think feels like there's something missing but the bottom of the page is you know that's just the bottom right it's not as big of a deal at least I don't know at least in my mind that's that's how it seems to me so let's uh let's do that I want to do that for sure and then we can think more about what we're gonna do in terms of color in here John says how about a four pixel top border on each card with the same color okay so we could do yeah I guess I guess we could try that so we'll try that too let me get rid of this because I know for sure that I want to kind of mess with this vertical centering a bit and then we'll try that border on the top so John just just to be clear are we talking like border that stretches completely across the card I think that would look the best I'm assuming that's what we're talking about okay John also says don't take the heading out of the div just add padding to the bottom to Center it better all right let's see that's it we'll make this bigger just to kind of exaggerate the issue as well so we can see what's going on here I'm just I'm wondering would it look see it because in this case it's really obvious you know if we had this so that it was always up at the top you know there's a huge difference here I'm kind of wondering if maybe it was a mistake to vertically Center this maybe it would be better if this was just you know at the top I don't know let me know what you all think about that is originally we did not have this vertically centered and I said it's not as big of a deal on a smaller screen when you end up getting into larger sizes it's just there's just so much space up here I don't I don't know that that that looks right all right so let's we'll try a few things and see see what looks best okay so here's our actually let's just let's take this out and see what it would look like that'll be the easiest thing to check so here's what it looks like without being vertically centered okay I yeah I like I think this looks good and it looks like at least a few you agree much better okay great yeah I agree I think that does look a lot better I can't I can't remember what we were thinking originally with that vertical Center I mean it was cool when we did it at least it was a nice demonstration of how to do a vertical Center with with flexbox but yeah definitely definitely looks better okay we'll leave it like that now let's try out that that top border actually though I didn't think about this either but we could potentially do a a border on the side that takes up the entire height of the card so what do you think well I'll try them both we'll try a top border and then we'll also try the side border maybe I'll do it on on two different cards here so we can see it side by side okay maybe I can just do it right here in dev tools I'll get fry just copy copy this edit it a bit okay so here's our left our left border and let's do the same thing over here but we're gonna do top and we'll make this 4 as well okay all right so what do y'all think on the side on the top or I definitely don't think bottom would look good but we could we could try on the right as well okay Zachary asked if I'm feeling better I don't know I feel kind of the same so if you watch the last last show I was not feeling well so still about the same my throat hurts a little bit less than it did though so that's good but I started I'm a little bit congested so I don't know if I'm getting better it's just transitioning into something different but I'm still so just tired that's that's the worst thing is like I just I feel like I have no energy but I'm starting to get some of my focus back I feel like today the last like two weeks I just feel like my work has not been great I don't know if it's been evident in the streams or not but it just feels I don't know I feel like I'm not doing good work like I'm having trouble focusing on my work and so anyway today I finally like really made an effort to really try to focus and like work through the the tiredness and I think I did I think I did a decent job on that logo checkbox component and I worked through some some bugs and stuff and so hopefully this is the start of me getting back into it but just just tired and just lack of motivation that's what's bothering me the most anyway thanks for asking Zachary sorry for the big explanation I know you all may not have wanted that much information but it I wanted to give everybody a chance to weigh in on these anyway so it was a good point a good time to talk a bit all right so I'm gonna check out what everyone said okay so it looks like left left just listening to service okay so oh man so we did have a bunch of votes four on the left on the side now we have some for the top someone did say so Laura said make it at the left border when you mouseover all right so we don't we don't really have consensus here here's what I'm gonna do I think it might be better if we saw what it would look like if all of them had had the border so we'll try I'll do all of them with the the top border I'll take a screenshot and we'll do all with the border on the side and then we can look at them side by side that might give us a better idea since we're we're kind of torn right now so let's take let's take this for now and okay so for now let's do this and instead let me check okay so try this one first oops and I'll get rid of this whoops I said it order laughs we were to that one okay so let me screenshot this loose let me make sure that worked I don't think it did and I can't remember I just do one of these then I can't remember how to do a just a regular screenshot on on a Mac this one is gonna copy it to my clipboard how do I do it alright somebody help me out on a Mac what's the shortcut to do a screenshot that will automatically save to my desktop I always just use the one where it's copy to clipboard that's the command ctrl shift 4 is it okay there we go now I now I heard the little click command all right now weird this safe I think this is it all right great okay so now we'll change it oops okay so not exactly equivalent here okay what do you think top or side now that we can see them side by side also I'm not opposed to some sort of hover effect so I mean obviously we already have I don't want to overdo it right we already have a hover effect going on here so if we were add anything else having to do with this border it wouldn't it would need to be subtle so I'll give everybody maybe like 20 seconds more to let me know what your thing okay it looks like all right we we have we have a lot of votes for left now we definitely have one for top we have an undecided Patrick says we could change maybe change the border color on hover yeah I think that's definitely I definitely want to see how it looks I'm not sure try to picture in my head I'm not sure if it'll work or not but I think it's worth a try I think we're gonna go with the left then it seems like it's now that we've seen them side by side it seems like it's pretty almost unanimous oh my goodness I keep my my slack channel for work is just going crazy I keep hearing the the noise that I've got a new message so I don't think I keep glancing at it it's nothing that I need to respond to you right now but it's a little bit distracting all right so let's go with this I do want to check let's let's see about changing the color also yeah we'll see about changing the color and then we'll see you know is this enough to make the page not quite so plain you know not not so stark so I'm still thinking about it now that I see this I wonder if I should get rid of the borderradius on this side if that would look nicer I know cards normally you're supposed to have a two picture borderradius of material design but with this border on the side I don't know that I like it being slightly rounded I mean that maybe I'm worrying too much about that but let's try that I do let's try getting rid of the border radius on this side with the border and then also doing a change of color on hover where it is top left oops I'm going bottom shoot how does he area let's try I don't know if I have any of the other colors we'll put this color in for now just to see may want to go with a different color there are a few there's a dark blue and a light blue that's in the the cool color palette for the University which is generally what I like to use for websites we have a warm color palette that has some Reds in there but I just I'm not crazy about how it looks on a screen it's definitely better for print materials let's show this up they don't get the auto reload hmm I bet you that I have to do all right so that works but I think for this I'll probably have to do important so I'm not even gonna check I'm just gonna do it since we're just testing this out anyway there we go okay so hmm you see the difference well I guess that's on the top hmm okay so I guess two things one what do you think about the color the change of color and the second thing is what about the borderradius I mean is it even noticeable let's I'm gonna get rid of that here and just try it try to just do it on one and dev tools okay so now we can see I guess better the difference so the top one has no border radius for this side and then this bottom one it has the normal two pixel border radius I don't know I want to know what you all think for me now that I look at this it I don't think it looks right it almost seems like this is now not part of the card especially around the edges like it just looks I don't know it looks like it's just added or like this definitely looks like it's within the card here I don't know what do y'all think use the green did I use the green yeah okay this it's it's probably just some type of weird thing going on with my eyes when the transition from the yellow but that this looks blue to me when I hover over it like this obviously looks green but for some reason this board is looking blue all right so Johnson keep the border radius okay alright Johnson the border color needs to be a bit softer so I'm assuming you mean like this yellow and so it seems like we're going to so we're not going to change the border radius and okay and then we're probably gonna soften this color or we could try different colors I need to bring in the some of the other the colors from the like the blues and stuff and see if one of those looks look good here as well I mean normally this yellow ends up being like the accent color anyway but I have used some of the Blues before and especially the the dark blue is nice I've used it before and it's it's pretty nice occasionally to use it's just not it's not really recognizable as a color for our University even though it is in the color palette it's not it's not often used but that was the end of my Poe Maduro session so I'm gonna do another five minutes to go back to the live chat I'm going to scroll back up to where I left off on our last break and go through and and just answer some more questions so I'm scrolling all the way up to the way the timestamp is 227 p.m. for me it'll be different depending on your timezone but that's Eastern Time 227 p.m. okay say god says by the way great work all at precode camp thank you I appreciate that and at least thanks for the little bit that I'm doing things you're saying that I know there's a lot of people a lot of people don't work for free code camp and a lot of people that you never even hear about or don't you know don't know about so definitely the just a ton of volunteers making it making it have everything the free code camp does the YouTube channel the website the the blogs the forum a lot of a lot of volunteers behind all that Oh pravin mentioned YouTube's new darkthemed yeah I think the dark thing for YouTube is really cool so I just I just wanted to read that comment out so if you haven't checked it out yet check out the settings on on YouTube and try the dark theme I think I like dark themes for pretty much everything so I was really excited when that came out Juno says greetings from Costa Rica welcome thanks for watching Kat bill says styled components is is quite nice library for creating beautiful react components yeah yeah definitely I think before you know I was saying there's lots of different ways to style react components that's definitely one of the ways that that I've seen and like I said I'd like to try more of them out before I decide which one I want to stick with mainly no beer says hi from Bangladesh hey welcome thanks for watching Daniel says hi Jessie and guys from Romania hey Daniel welcome no beer says hi I'm new here well welcome really glad that that you're watching thank you and thanks for for letting us know that you're here in the live chat feel free to contribute or ask any questions and try to try to give you the best answers that I can and there's a lot of the really knowledgeable people here in the live chat that can definitely give you some great answers some guy asks are you using bootstrap for mobile responsive no I'm not using bootstrap I'm using the tier of UI so I guess it's not exactly the same as bootstrap since material I comes with these premade react components but it's the same concept in the sense that there's a lot of styling things that are that are already there although now that I think about it in terms of the responsiveness right some of that we did borrow from a framework called materialized CSS so which which is very much like bootstrap so essentially materialized is a material design CSS framework that does all the same things that bootstrap does but just in the material design style so we did borrow the mainly we borrow their column class system to help you know with the different screen sizes and kind of stacking the columns and things and we borrowed a few other things so so that's that's how we're handling responsiveness right now all right timer just is up so last one sir key gaming says I started free code camp about five days ago and got to the tribute page but it seems like hardly any of the things I learned stuck would you say that's normal or is there other things I can do let's see Lara's response to that it's normal just jump back and look over things go search on the web if you can't do things you want to do asking the Gator channel if you're really stuck yeah yeah definitely sometimes things don't stick the only way to really have things stick in your head is repetition I found and I don't mean in the sense of like getting it flashcards and memorizing like commands but just actually building things like day in day out you know building things with whatever you're trying to learn a little bit every day is much better than you know like twelve hours one day and then nothing for two weeks right so if you were to spread that out and just do you know an hour or so every day you're definitely going to get more out of that it's going to stay fresh in your brain and you know you you will remember that so alright let's go let me check the time okay what do you I'm trying to decide whether we should do another session or whether I should go to questions now we're already at about an hour and 20 minutes for the video if I do another session it's definitely going to be a twohour video for sure I will my throat is I can feel my my throat just getting more sore as this goes on when I keep talking man let me see how much we have left in the in the chat I'm only about halfway through right now all right front so I think I'm not gonna do another Promotora session we only got two in but I think at this point I'd rather I'd rather end now and save my voice so that I can do sessions for the next two days then try to overdo it and lose my voice so at least we got we got through the homepage which as I said I think the homepage is the most important to get styling right this is the first thing people are going to see and they're gonna make a judgment on the site based on this so I don't know I think this looks a lot better from what we had just an hour ago definitely got a lot of good advice from you all so thanks and I'm definitely gonna mess around with the colors a bit and see see what color combinations might work and then I you know tomorrow we can we can check it out and review you know which colors look the best but for now so I'm gonna stop the code portion and I'm gonna go to the question and answer session so if you just here for the code and you can't stick around for the question answer session thank you so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow so you know come back if you can and otherwise if you can stick around you have a few more minutes and if you have a question please put that in the live chat now I'll do my best to answer it and any any type of question don't worry if you think it's like a new question or anything you know don't worry about that you know I definitely want to be as welcoming as possible to people who are new and help you out any way that I can if you don't really have a question I appreciate you sticking around and helping to answer questions and a live chat you know if you can if you have the time so I said I'm about halfway through the live chat now so I'm just gonna keep on going down and try to answer things once we get through all the questions and I'll I'll be finished with the stream so I'm thinking we'll see probably streaming for at least another ten minutes kind of based on how many how much is left in the live chat but we'll see sometimes I talk for a while so we'll see definitely want to keep this below two hours just cuz just because I'm pretty tight alright shine as what is better react or view in the future well I mean I don't really know about what's gonna happen with them in the future and I'll say I don't think I can answer that question properly because I haven't used view yet I certainly have seen you know people who are well respected in the industry I guess and they really like view and they use it so I've you know I'm assuming that there's some really good things about view but I don't really know enough to do a comparison about it but in terms of react the only thing going against react right now that I see is like a serious thing that could threaten how widely it's used is the whole license thing you know there's a there's a lot of people that are freaking out over the license and I don't really know how many people but based on what's going on on Twitter it seems like a lot of people are now I know Twitter is just a small a small portion of all the people in the world and all the developers so maybe it's not as big of a deal as it seems like on Twitter but other than that it seems like react is pretty strong this there's more and more people developing with react if you look at like the trends just in terms of like Google search trends and things or the number of jobs that are you asking for reactive elders it's it's going strong it's still on the on the trend upward so I'm not really worried about react going anywhere anytime soon also I think there's a lot of opportunity in terms of react native and being able to use react for VR stuff I think that's really cool and potentially like depending on how quickly VR grows react could grow right along with that I don't know you know there's just a lot of a lot of whatifs there but I think you're probably either either way with react or review you got at least a few more years before you'd have to think about learning something different okay you know what I did notice this before but Oh Morris had mentioned when we were doing these boxes to expand the boxes and it would be better huh that's interesting okay so yeah potentially I mean obviously on a smaller screen right there the boxes are fine but on a large screen there is quite a lot of space you know maybe maybe I should think about expanding them maybe adding some sort of at a certain breakpoint you know just having a minimum height and width well maybe I'll have to mess with that a little bit and see see what works if that looks a little bit better than then all this blank space I'd say thanks for that suggestion Omar okay our reo says thing is mouseover already add shadow effect so we're talking about the shadow yeah I I agree there we do already have that shadow effect which is why I'm still not a hundred percent sure even about the color change thing I'm not I'm not totally against it but I just wonder is it necessary since we already have the the shadow you know getting the shadow increasing on hover I'm just I'm not really a big fan of doing too much on hover so we'll have to yeah I'll have to think about it I mean one bonus is if I decide not to do the color change thing and then we don't that's one less color I have to worry about picking so it simplifies it a bit if we do that I mean in terms of code it's it's trivial to add that effect you know it's just one line but in terms of thinking about the best color combination for that that's what that's what takes a lot that's what all second guess okay now I see a lot of people help me out with the shortcut for screenshotting on a Mac so thanks everyone who who answered that sorry I just totally forgot that that's your cut that happens sometimes I guess okay scrolling through actually a lot of the stuff in the live chat was based on just kind of what we were doing here so that's why I'm skipping over a lot of it because we've already talked about it somebody put a hex code in I want to see what the hex code is so I'm just I'm gonna put it in here but it's just popping in the background to see what it is okay I like that green color I can't use it here because I'm really kind of limited to the official color palette for the University but that's a really nice color anyway thanks you that Pavel thanks for they sue putting that X color in I kind of really it's like a nice like chill color green anyway just wanted to check it out we're not we're not gonna use that but I do like it get get seen says talk about sanitizing user inputs once you style them with styled components I guess did we do I don't think we've done anything on a stream about sanitizing input so maybe there's not going to be a lot of streams left before this projects finished but maybe I'll think about talking about that more on an on an upcoming stream one thing we don't because we don't have a database for this I'm not I'm not super worried about sanitizing inputs in terms of like I don't have to worry about something like like sequel injection there's something like that so I mean where I don't want to just allow anything so but it's not there's no danger of something weird happening with the database but anyway that's if I can in the few streams that we'll have left for this project I'll definitely talk about sanitizing user inputs Gouffran says sometimes using material design looks too generic for me no offense yeah that's the I think that's that's kind of what's happening with material design I don't completely disagree so I still like material design and I'm still going to continue to use it there's I think there's a lot of good reasons to use material design one of the main ones being it's there's just really common patterns design patterns in material design that a lot of people are familiar with now because of how widely it's used and I think there's a real benefit to that so that a user coming to your site or to your app would immediately be familiar with how the navigation works what certain icons mean you know not everybody will but you have there's a good chance that a decent portion of your audience will already be familiar with that and that to me is a really big benefit so I agree that sometimes it just looks generic and and that really is it's because it's used so widely it's just not you see it everywhere now so I like how clean it can look I mean that's really nice but I mean I agree to some extent that it's not I wouldn't use it if I was trying to win a design contest or something like that you know if I was doing some project on the side where I could be as creative as I wanted to be I would not use it but if I'm designing something and use your experience in terms of just usability ease of use was the main focus and you know design aesthetics where we're still important but not the main focus then I'm definitely going to use material design so anyway that's just that's my opinion on it I'm certainly open to hearing more one way the other about it but but in a sense I mean I don't I don't use material design necessarily because of the the look of it itself there's definitely other benefits that that it brings to the table you know more so than just the look John said gargle with warm salt water one of the best things for a sore throat thanks for telling me I'll definitely have to do that I always forget I know that helps but for some reason I always forget to do it oh I'll have to remember to do that bobble says thanks for the stream oh you're welcome papa thanks for watching and joining in in the live chat Bob also says my first time but I would like to continue these sessions no beer says me too yeah so that's really awesome that it's your first time for both of you and I'm really glad that you want to you know continue on with the sessions so definitely if you if you can make it four lives for the live streams that's really awesome because then we get to interact you know in real time but if you can't you know you can always check out the recordings one of the benefits of watching the recordings too is that you can watch it at a faster speed and get through it more quickly I listen to I had heard some of you say that you had listened to it at kind of a faster speed and I tried it over the weekend listening to my one of my streams at two times speed and I actually liked it a lot better into time speed I think I sound like I know what I'm talking about a lot more just because I'm saying it all faster and it looks like I'm typing faster too so it definitely makes me look better at two times speed so if you can't catch the lies chain check that out Antonius Asiya follow you in and Twitter best regards awesome well you're probably not here since you he said see ya but anyway in case you are here you see they're recording I appreciate refreshing you watching and definitely I hope you can come back for some more livestream soon no beer says I agree this color is so soft and looks nice yeah isn't it isn't it I I like I don't know what it is about this color but I'm really liking this color anyway alright so I'm at the the end of the live chat and I still have my voice so that's good but I think I need to get a cup of tea or something now I have her my throat but thank you so much for joining in in the live chat I really appreciate you all were so helpful especially when I do things like this and try to add some design elements that kind of go a little bit beyond this the general material design specifications it's so nice to have all of you be able to take a look at it and let me know what you think it just it's really nice I really I appreciate all your input I really respect your opinions on on this and so this is really awesome when we get to collaborate on something like this I think the end result is just way better than it would ever be if it was just me doing it so anyways Blake and Michelle said thank you you're welcome thank you so much for watching and for for being in the live chat and all right so I'm gonna wrap things up now thanks again everyone and I'll be back I'll be back tomorrow probably at the same time and yeah have a great day you
