a lot of people ask me what i do day to day as a web developer one thing for sure i have to do is a daily stand up what's that you say stay tuned to find out okay so what is a daily standup or dsu for short so basically it's when everybody on your project or team gets in a literal circle or they get on a video chat and each person takes turn saying what they're currently working on it's overseen by itpm or project manager and it allows your team to stay on the same page on the project and the structure is simple you basically answer these three questions what did you do yesterday what do you plan to accomplish today and what are your blockers or issues that you are currently having i know my first time doing a dsu i was a little bit scared and if this is sounding scary to you put in the comments below why but hopefully i can give you some examples and we can hash out those fears now so let me give you an example of something you might say during a dsu say you are starting a new app you grab the tags from a combine board which i'll talk about later and your task was to create the home page so you might say yesterday i created the home page today i plan to accomplish applying this styles from the designer and i have no blockers easy right well my first time doing a dsu i was super nervous i swear a little bit i was scared but i think by following these next few tips you will make it successfully through your first esu okay so tip one dsus are usually at the same time every day so that means you can prepare for the dsu by writing down exactly what you're going to say either the day before or the morning before now i usually have uh the notepad app open on my desktop and i just write out what i'm going to say so by time they get to me all i'm doing is reading it out and eventually you're going to use to it and so you won't have to do this anymore but it's definitely a good way to not be nervous tip 2 don't be afraid to talk about your blockers now when i first got started i didn't want to seem like i was incompetent so sometimes i wouldn't say what my blockers were but what wound up happening is i would waste time trying to track down the information and all i had to do was ask and somebody could point me in the right direction and that's what dsu's are for it's so that everybody's on the same page and if you do have a blocker then people who know the answer can share that information with you and you don't have to waste any time getting the necessary tools that you need okay so tip number three and the final tip is to listen to your teammates now i know i know you might have a lot of meetings throughout the day and listening to people before you had your coffee might be the hardest thing to do in the world but understand that a dsu is not just there for you to get the information you need but it's also a chance to share information that you have so say yesterday you were working on a problem and you solved it it was easy but today somebody is having a similar issue and now it's your chance to step up and say hey i know exactly what you need let me help you after the dsu or it may just be your itpm saying okay you have you have training that you need to do before the end of this month i want everybody to attack today so we don't have to worry about it later whatever it may be this is an important time to listen to your team and to get what you need to push you through the day if you enjoyed this video give it a thumbs up i would love to continue sharing with you some of the daily things that i do as a web developer and don't forget to subscribe also i would love to see you on twitter or instagram so take a picture of your current dsu script and hashtag it coding like a boss alright see you later
