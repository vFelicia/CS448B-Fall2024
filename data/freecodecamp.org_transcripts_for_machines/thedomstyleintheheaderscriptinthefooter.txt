let's talk a little bit about why you put your CSS tags in the header and your script tags in the footer maybe you've been told to do that but you're not sure why if you're going to be linking in your HTML document to an external CSS or script if you're going to put those in it's important that you put those links in the right places let's talk about why maybe you've seen a web page where all of the text is loaded and it looks like there's no additional font there's no formatting and as the page continues to load then it all kinda goes into place and starts to look prettier that is an example of a page where the CSS is not necessarily in the header and the script is not necessarily in the footer there's an event called Dom content loaded why that matters is the Dom the document object model is inside the browser and it's seeing all the information from a web page from the HTML the CSS and once it has all that information loaded to a certain point that do and we'll say okay it is loaded enough for us to display it for the user what could happen is the CSS is not in the header the document object model can think that it's ready to show the user but the formatting hasn't actually loaded yet same goes with the JavaScript or whatever script you are using if it's not in the footer that time where the event happens the content loaded for the document object model might not totally line up for the best user experience luckily the fix is easy do as you've been told and put the CSS in the header and the JavaScript in the footer to ensure that your users have everything load and be viewable to them when it's actually the way that you want it to be seen as all of these videos this is just a simple and basic explanation check out the link in the description for some additional resources
