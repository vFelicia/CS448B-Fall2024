hi my name is luke siciliano i'm a web developer and i'm also selfemployed i've decided to do this video for free code camp on the topic of how you can make money as a freelance developer or as someone who has just started up their own independent development business i feel that this is an important topic to talk about because a lot of people learn to code and then strike out on their own and quickly realize that running a business is a whole lot different than learning the code or working at dev job somewhere so the goal of this video is really to provide some tips and some framework for those who have decided to strike out on their own to hopefully make the whole venture a a little bit more enjoyable and be and most importantly a little bit more if not a lot more profitable so in this video we're really going to talk about a few different things number one is we're going to lay out some basic rules for making money as an independent developer and you may think well making money is easy i do work for people and i make money well some developers make a lot more money than others and the things we're going to focus on in that segment will touch on why and how you can actually increase your profits and make more money as a developer the second thing we're going to talk about is planning your new business and what i mean by this is the fact that you don't want to just run out and you know hang up your sign and say woohoo i'm in business now you really need to have a plan in place that deals with things such as what type of customers are you going to serve what types of services are you going to offer and you know what kind of company are you going to form and so on so forth if you have all those things nailed it from the getgo then you wind up making a lot more money and having a lot less stress on the back end so that's the second thing we'll be talking about the third thing we'll be talking about is actually getting started and at that point you've made your plan you've decided who you're going to serve what services you're going to offer and all that good stuff but now you've actually got to form the business you've got to get your infrastructure in place and all those things and that's what we'll be dealing with in that part of the video and in the fourth segment of this video we'll talk about managing your business on a daytoday basis from both an administrative standpoint as well as a development standpoint and you're gonna find that doing both are equally important and if you manage yourself on a daytoday basis correctly you can really make a lot more money so before we dive into it let's talk about who this video is for if you're someone who has already decided i'm going to go the freelance route i'm going to start an independent development shop or you've already done that you know in other words you're already on your own somewhere then this video is for you if you are debating whether or not you want to be a freelance developer whether or not you want to start your own dev shop or just kind of debating whether you want to get a job for somebody and that's a topic i've already discussed in a prior video and we're going to link to that in the description below with a time stamp so i would suggest watching that portion of that video before deciding whether or not you know this video is appropriate for you so with all that said let's get to it and good luck okay so the first thing we're going to talk about is the three basic rules to making money as a freelance developer and you've gotta nail all three of these things otherwise you're really gonna find yourself feeling like you're always stuck in second gear if not first gear and you're gonna feel like you just can't get ahead in your business and you may very well quit right because what happens when you feel like you're not getting ahead you certainly don't want to continue with something so understanding the three rules to making money as a freelancer is key before we get into anything else so what are the three rules number one is understanding that the amount of money you're going to make is in direct proportion to the amount of value you provide to other people so in other words you other person provide value okay that's rule number one rule number two is understanding the need to focus on your highest paying activities which may sound like duh but you would be surprised at how many people struggle in that area and rule number three is the need to understand that you have a fulltime job and put in the time as soon as you strike out on your own again may sound common sense but you would be surprised so let's go ahead and take a look at each of these three rules all right and again you have to do all three number one the amount of money you're going to make is in direct proportion to the amount of value you provide to other people what do i mean by this and first thing you got to do is put yourself in the shoes of a customer all right the customer doesn't care about your experience the customer doesn't care about you know what languages you know they don't care about how much time you're going to put into something all that matters to them is the amount of value their business receives from the product you provide to them right let's say for example you're building an app for let's say a little restaurant and uh you know the restaurant owner says hey i want an app where people can order food online i want an app where people can make reservations online uh see my menu things of this nature somebody comes along and offers to build this app in a content management system like wordpress or joomla or something like that and they tell the restaurant whether they'll do it for three thousand bucks you come along and you tell the restaurant owner that you'll build them something from scratch you'll write your own html you'll write your own css you'll write your own javascript and you're gonna charge them five thousand dollars well here if your five thousand dollar app is right here and someone else's three thousand dollar cms bait pace app is right here and you provide no more functionality and no more value to the client in other words you don't make the client's business any better with your app than this person does with their app then all that all you've done is propose something that's more expensive right if you're not providing additional value to your customer they're not gonna pay more money okay why would i pay five thousand for something i can get the exact same functionality for three thousand um so what you've got to understand is the more you improve the customers situation the more money that customer is going to be willing to pay you okay so in other words it's not about what you think is important it's about what the customer sees as value so instead of saying mine's better because i'm not using a cms and i'm writing it i'm writing all the code myself again that doesn't make the customer's situation any better right but i hear from developers all the time and i've had many conversations with freelance developers who really do think that simply by coding things from scratch instead of using you know different tools that they're somehow providing a better product like well these are people who don't understand it's about providing value to the customer so if you're going to write something from scratch for the customer what you need to do is explain how your app provides value that the other one doesn't so for example hey that person's building you an app in a content management system here are some of the limitations in the content management system it may limit you in terms of how you want to grow your business with the app i'm going to write for you however you won't have those limitations and then you explain to them about how your app provides additional value that the other one does in other words value meaning your app allows their business to grow more than the other app does okay so taking the approach of understanding that you've got to explain value to your customers is how you're going to make more money always put yourself in your customers perspective and ask yourself what is it the customer is looking for what does the customer see as valuable the more you provide that value to the customer the more the customer is going to be willing to pay you okay that's rule number one provide value to the customer rule number two is the fact that you need to focus on your highest paying activities way too often i mean way too often people get themselves in this trap of focusing on work that has the highest total price tag but doesn't necessarily pay the most per unit of input let's use a simple example let's say i'm going to write a dinky little app for somebody pretty simple um it's only gonna take me maybe five hours uh i'm gonna charge them twenty five hundred bucks for it let's say that's five hundred dollars an hour right now let's say but it's also only twenty five hundred dollars now let's say the opportunity to write another app comes along and on that app i'm going to charge 50 000 but i have to put in a lot and i mean a lot more time for obvious reasons on that big app well the first app you know let's say i made 2505 hours okay it's 500 an hour second app let's say when i sat sit down and look at it later i realized i only made 350 an hour on it a lot of people will get in the trap of saying well you know i made more money over here because i made 25 000 as opposed to 2500 but what they're not recognizing is that you only have so much time in the day you only have so many resources to go around and you need to put those resources into the higher value activities so one was just enough the higher dollar amount in that scenario was just a chance to work more basically so what you want to do is look at the kinds of services you're providing and let's say you're providing three different services four different services to customers whatever service you're providing pick the one that pays the most per hour of input per resource that you put into it and do more of that so using my scenario from a minute ago the 2500 app that you can get done in five hours go out and find as many customers as you can to churn those apps out forget that larger work just try to turn those other things out in mass because again you make more per unit of input on those think of it in these terms if you have a choice of going to a job that pays you ten dollars an hour and you can work all the hours you want you have a choice of going to another job that pays you 15 an hour and you can work all the hours you want i would hope you would go to the 15 an hour job all the time and never show up at the 10 hour job again right i mean that's only common sense so you've got to take this same approach into your freelance business whatever's paying you the most focus on that and do as much of that as you humanly can we're going to talk a little bit more about this in a little bit later section in this course but for right now understand that the second rule of making money is focusing on the activities that pay you the most per unit of input your highest value activities okay so rule number one provide value to the customer rule number two is focused on the activities that are of the highest value to your freelancing business rule number three is you've got to put in the time again that may sound simple but you would be really surprised once you decide to go out on your own you have a fulltime job you need to work fulltime at your business this may sound like a sound like a shock but you don't get paid for not going to work okay so let's say you've got two customers um you're just starting out and right now those two customers keep you busy for say 15 hours a week a lot of developers are going to do that 15 hours of coding work and you know customer service every week and then after that just kind of sit around twiddle their thumbs you know wait for more work to come in the door but again what they don't understand is like i said once you strike out on your own you have a fulltime job so let's just say you call a fulltime job 40 hours a week well if your customers are only taking up 15 hours a week that means you have 25 more hours that you need to be out trying to hustle up more business so 15 hours working for customers 25 hours trying to hustle up more business equals your 40 hours and think how many more customers you'll have if you put in that time in other words there is something you can be doing on you know to fill up your hours and make it a fulltime job treat your business like a fulltime job you're not going to make any money unless you work at it and as silly as that may sound again you would be surprised i i've talked to small business owner after small business owner after small business owner who doesn't work 40 hours a week a lot of times they don't work 30 hours a week and they're wondering why they're not making any money well you don't make money for not working okay so rule number one focus on providing value to your customer understand that your customer only cares about the value they receive and focus on providing as much value to them as humanly possible rule number two is identify the activities in your business which pay you the most per unit of input your highest value activities to yourself and focus on those rule number three is put in the time if you follow those three things you really are going to be ahead of a very large percentage of other freelance developers out there and i mean a very large percentage of them you are ahead of the game from the getgo just by understanding those three things okay and because you're going to understand those three things that's why you're going to do well working for yourself so now that we've talked about the three basic rules of making money let's talk about the planning stage of your new business okay let's go ahead and talk about the planning stage of your new company and what i mean by the planning stage is the fact that these are uh tasks and plans you should have in place before you even start taking customers if you do already have customers which is common freelance businesses then before you go out and try to bring in a whole lot more business you should really be knocking out the things we're about to talk about the reason why i say it's common for people to already have customers before they've planned out their business is a lot of times people start freelancing as a result of getting a random phone call and someone asking to complete a project and then bam next thing you know you're a freelancer so wherever you're at in your business whether you've already got your first customer or two or whether you're decided to strike out on your own and have not done so yet the following tasks that we're about to talk about are things that you need to get planned and in order before you start trying to take customers at any kind of scale okay um so we're really going to talk about four total things excuse me when it comes to planning your business number one is funding your operations um you may be thinking well what funding we'll talk about that in a minute number two is deciding what niche you're going to serve in other words you're not just going to provide random services to as many people as possible you want to actually pick a niche that you're going to serve and stay within that lane number three is figuring out what services you're going to offer within that niche and number four is going ahead and getting your company formed once you've got all those things figured out so let's go ahead and look at each of these things in turn okay so the first thing we need to talk about is how you're going to find your new business and right now when you hear that you might be thinking what funding is involved as a freelancer all i need to write code is my laptop and i already have that you will quickly be surprised at how fast expenses do start to add up for even someone who's selfemployed you're going to have different service costs those service costs can include paying an accountant at the end of the year they can include paying for liability insurance for your business they can include the cost of a payroll company because you're going to want to form what's called nest corp which we'll talk about a little later um also if you're going to uh rent server space you're going to that's the service you're going to pay for in other words expenses will add up a lot faster than you may think and the one thing i cannot stress enough is that you want to be profitable from day one in your business and profitable every essentially every month after day one and month one it's really common in the technology industry for people to think it's okay to lose money for the sake of growth that is not okay it is not okay i know there are some big companies that have operated that way but trust me that is the exception it is not the rule contrary to what you see in the media what i would strongly suggest is for that you read a book called profit first we're going to link to it in the description below it talks a lot about why it is not okay for you to ever be losing money so in other words you want to be profitable from day one and you want to never be unprofitable okay so since you need to be profitable from day one the first manner of business is figuring out how to fund your operations do not go into debt to start your business okay mark cuban is on record as saying that only idiots would uh take out a loan or worse yet use a credit card to start a business if you take out a loan trust me the bank doesn't care if you are making money or not you've got to make those payments if you borrow money from relatives if you want you know not paying your relatives back might be a good way to destroy your relationship with them and if you start using credit cards next thing you know you're paying extremely high interest rates so do not go into debt it's essentially digging yourself into a hole that can be very difficult to get out of if you're someone that's just starting out and you've already got your first customer then whatever they're paying you essentially needs to sit in your business bank account and not go into your pocket it needs to sit in your business bank account and serve as a source of funding for when you get your next client if you don't have your first client yet and you're striking out on your own then as we talked about in our last section you need to be working 40 hours a week at your new business but you also need to be making some other money on decide to support yourself so whether that's for some kind of side hustle whether it's driving for uber or whatever you need to be selffunding in this in other words your business needs to fund itself and if you're just starting out then you need to fund your new business from whatever your other form of employment or income is in other words be uh selffunding and profitable from day one do not take out debt do not take out loans this is something i cannot stress enough so best ways to fund your new business there are quite a few like i said if you have a fulltime job and you've decided to go the freelance route then guess what you now have two fulltime jobs stay at your current job while working fulltime at your freelance gig until you're in a spot where you can quit the fulltime job which if you're hustling up at the freelance gig and working full time at it you will be able to quit your fulltime job pretty quickly okay so your current source of your current employment can be a form of funding uh if you've got your first client again what they pay you should just sit in the operating account there's funding for your business don't take it out and spend it leave it in there to fund the business if you don't have a job currently and you are striking out on your own as a freelancer and you don't have any clients then again what you need to be doing is driving for uber or finding other ways to make money and live off of that and live off of that and leave some in the um you know in your reserve so you can also fund your business going forward but fund your business with cash that you have in cash that you earn do not fund it with debt that is something i cannot stress enough one of the best ways to make sure your freelance business fails is to start taking on debt okay and just think of it like this it's pretty hard to go broke if you don't know anybody any money right when you think of people who go broke it's usually because of that avoid debt in your new business i can't stress this enough this is something i'm not going to go on and on about instead again read profit first it's linked to in the description below okay so since we've talked about the biggest rule of funding your business avoid debt and fund it from other sources let's go ahead and talk about picking a niche for your new business okay so let's talk about choosing a niche for your new freelance business and what do i mean by niche by niche i mean you need to select a relatively narrow group of customers you're going to serve and or a relatively narrow group of services you're going to provide you do not want to take the approach of saying i need work i will take whatever is available and whatever comes in my door picking a niche is this strategy for making more money taking whatever comes in the door is a strategy for making less money so let's look at two things number one let's figure out why it is you need a niche in the first place and number two let's go about how you pick that niche okay so number one why do you need a niche in the first place well as i just said a second ago it leads to you having a less scalable business let's use a really simple example suppose i own a restaurant and i come to you and i say hey i want you to build me an app that for my restaurant that does a b and c okay to get that app working you may have to incorporate some thirdparty applications into it which means you have to go out and research those thirdparty applications you have to figure out what you need to do to incorporate them in the app when you build it and so on so forth you also might not know anything about the restaurant industry and as a result of that you need to take the time to learn a lot about the industry in general so you can learn about my business and build me a quality app and you charge me five thousand dollars for my app now later when the second restaurant comes along and wants a similar app you're already familiar with those thirdparty applications you already know a little bit about the restaurant industry that is all learning that you do not have to do a second time in order to charge the same amount of money the second time when you're building that second application so in other words by staying within the niche under this example restaurants you make more money unless you make uh more money by providing the same service in less time right to the second customer that's what happens when you choose a niche you're not in a state where you're constantly learning new languages learning new applications learning new industries and so on so forth the value of experience allows you to scale up your business and make more money by charging the same rate for your services but getting things done in less time okay what happens when you don't pick a niche well then you're constantly learning new languages you're constantly dealing with different kinds of businesses you're less likely to be able to reuse old code bases that you've written and so on so forth so picking a niche allows you to build a scalable business i cannot stress that enough now it is really really easy when you're first starting out to say i'm gonna take whatever comes in the door right um because after all you're just starting out you need clients but let's look at what that leads to you take whatever comes in the door as i said a minute ago you have to maybe learn a new language you have to learn some new frameworks you have to learn new applications you have to learn about a new industry and as a result you make some money but you don't make as much as you could the second time around right and now when your second client comes in the door the problem is because you're just taking anything and not sticking in a niche your second client is in an industry or field that has nothing to do with the first one so again you gotta learn some new applications and learn some new frameworks so on so forth you're constantly in a state of working more hours for less money and as a result of that you never get ahead and because you never get ahead you find yourself saying i need work so i'm going to take whatever comes in the door and it just becomes a vicious cycle that you literally never get out of so while it may be tempting to say i'm going to come whatever or i'm going to take whatever comes in the door i should say because i need money right now you have to recognize that that is a trap and it becomes very difficult to get out of taking work simply because it's available when it's outside of a niche you want to serve is like stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime it is not a good idea to step over a dollar and pick up a dime so when you get those work opportunities early on that are outside of the niche you're trying to serve it's hard but it's important to say no and trust me i completely understand it is hard to say no to revenue it is hard to say no to a potential customer but if it's outside that niche you want to serve whether that niche is working with a particular class a customer or providing a particular type of service or a combination of both it's important to say no when something falls outside your niche i just cannot stress that enough picking a niche means a more scalable business so how do you go about picking that niche right um that's a that's an important question uh that's really a broad topic and which could probably be i would say the subject of a second extremely long video the general rules i'll give you for picking a niche are pick something that you either are either one of two things one interested in it or two uh passionate slash you get excited about it um you know or you're good at it i guess would be a third thing so why do i say to pick something that you are excited about passionate about something your excuse me something you're really good at or something you have a particular skill set at number one is the fact that those are going to be things that you're likely to stick out the grind through right think of it like this if you're trying to do something that you're not good at and you're not excited about start and you're in those hard days of starting a business where the chances you're going to stick with this thing that you're not any good at and not excited about when you're already facing the struggles of starting a business the chances of you sticking with that aren't very good right so by picking something that you're either good at or excited about the chances are you're going to stick it out you know through the grind a lot more number two is the fact that if you're picking something that you're already good at and passionate about you're gonna find that that gives you the ability to provide more value than your competitors in that area so you're going to have a competitive advantage in large part because you are willing to put in that time so willingness to stick it out competitive advantage are the two big reasons why when choosing a niche you need to pick something that you're good at something that you're passionate about something that just kind of gets you excited um so on so forth the things i mentioned one interesting question i would say i get a lot is well how do i pick a niche and then i say what i just said i say well what are you excited about what do you like to do what are you good at and people didn't look at me a little bit confused and just to be frank the question of what do you like to do shouldn't be a hard question i mean what is it you like to do right um you know find things you are interested in personally and then try to make those your business and then that's something you're going to be more likely to stick with over time don't over complicate the idea of finding something that interests you and then just kind of rolling with it i cannot stress that enough so number one pick a niche number two is when you're picking that niche find something you're interested in something you're excited about um you know so on something you enjoy so on and so forth okay so now that that's out of the way let's get on to the next part of our video okay now that you've decided what niche you're going to serve it's important to figure out what services you're going to offer to that niche and then how you're going to charge for those services so let's look at each of those and we're really going to break this part of the discussion down into three sections the first section is going to be what services to offer the second section is going to be how to charge for those services and then the third part is going to be the need to make sure you're adding recurring revenue okay so let's look at each of these in turn number one what services should you be offering your potential customers that are within the niche you've picked out for yourself well what services to offer really comes down to three things and the first of these three things is how much are you interested in the work the second of these three things is to what extent is it scalable the third of these three things is to what extent can you outsource some of the work those three things decide what services you should be offering your niche let's look at each of those the reason why your level of interest is important when you're deciding what services you're going to offer is simple if you're performing work that you find boring that you find dull that you don't care about whatsoever the chances of you wanting to stick with it long term and build a business are slim to none to if there was a way to say negative it would probably be negative think of it like this if you have a nine to five job you certainly don't want to go to something that's completely boring every day right well trying to do that in the grind of your own business is even harder so when deciding what services to offer it needs to be something that interests you number one even if something interests you though to have a viable business it needs to be something you can scale out in other words something you can do at scale and the scalability of your idea really has two components to it number one is the fact of is or is the question of is there enough of a customer base out there you may perform a task for somebody and really enjoy the work and then find out it's just something that doesn't come up that much if there's not enough of a market out there that's not something you're going to be able to do at scale but the other aspect of scalability is the extent to which you can do the work without having to completely do everything over each time so in other words if you want to build a particular type of app for somebody and you realize it's a code base you can reuse and build similar apps for a large number of other people that's scalable because you're reusing that code base for similar customers over and over and over again so in other words you make more money off the second customer then you make off the first customer you make more money off the 10th customer than you make off the second one because you're refining this process every time because you're charging the same amount of money for the app each time right so scalability which again is size of the market and your ability to not have to replicate or to not have to start work over every time those are really how you look at the scalability aspect of this okay and number three in there again when deciding what services to offer is to what extent can you outsource some of this work even if you work 24 7 365 there are only so many hours in the day which means you can only take on so many customers if you want to make money as a freelancer and eventually scale up into a larger business you're going to have to get some of the work off of your plate so you can continue focusing on high value activities so when you're putting together a service that you're going to offer you need to say how much of this work can be performed by people that maybe have like entrylevel coding skills how much of it can you outsource for you know like a decent price to other developers and so on so forth if for some reason you look at your service offering and realize it just cannot be outsourced in any way or that there aren't even components of it that can be outsourced that's probably not a good service offering to get into if you have something you're interested in if you have something you can scale and you have something where at least a good chunk of the work can be outsourced at a later time now you have something that a you can make a lot of money off of and b eventually scale into a larger business and that's why you're going to do that threepart analysis in deciding what services to offer within your nation again not to sound too repetitive but that threepart analysis is your level of interest the extent to which you can scale it out and the extent to which you can outsource some of this work so that's how you decide what you're going to offer once you've decided what you're going to offer it's important to look at how you're going to charge for it and i cannot stress enough it's important to charge flat fees or charge a set price for products as opposed to charging say by the hour charging by the hour would be you know telling someone you'll build them an app and you'll charge them x number of dollars per hour and at the end of the day you know you give them a bill and again the problem with this is the fact that there are only so many hours in a day you're trading time for money which is always a losing proposition by charging flat fees you get to take advantage of the work you have already done so for example if you build an app that serves a particular type of business you charge the business three thousand dollars for that app and then later on a second similar business comes along and wants a similar app you've already done a good amount of the work okay so you can reuse a lot of that code base and then charge three thousand dollars for an app the second time and the customer the second customer should say is still getting full value even though you're charging them three thousand dollars because they're getting the value of your expertise you became an expert in this area the first time you built the app they're getting the fact that you would have already worked any bugs out of the app because you probably debugged it as part of dealing with the first customer and so on so forth so by charging flat fees you what you make more per unit of your own input and you actually give better value to the customer so it's good for both sides you make more profits the customer gets a better experience and then the last thing i'll say when it comes to choosing what to offer pricing that offer is third thing would be the need to add recurring revenue and this is revenue where you don't necessarily have to make a brand new sale every month in order to bring in some income into your business and one of our businesses for example we have virtual private servers and then we offer the clients the option to have us host their app on our servers which we do and then so we essentially resell server space and then the clients pay a flat fee for that every month so on top of the fact that we just have money coming in every month for new sales to new customers there's a certain aspect that we can just count on coming in every month you know again for that recurring reselling revenue having recurring revenue really helps to kind of take out some of the highs and lows of working for yourself otherwise you might have months where you make a whole lot and months where you make a little having that recurring revenue really gives you some flexibility to let you kind of go along with your business okay so we've just talked about what services to offer how much to charge and we've talked about the need for recurring revenue so with all of that said let's get on to the next part of our video okay now that we've talked about what services you're going to offer and how you're going to charge for those services we need to talk about actually forming your business and this is going to be the last part of our discussion in the planning stages of starting your own freelance enterprise okay so forming your business really takes on a couple of different things number one is choosing the type of business entity you're going to use for your company and number two is actually getting it formed uh here's the one thing i want to stress before i get into these is this video should not be considered legal advice i'm not holding myself out as someone licensed to give you advice in forming a company on legal consequences and things of that sort those are things that should really be discussed with an attorney i cannot stress that enough that there can be serious consequences to choosing the wrong wrong form i should say for your business so it's always good to discuss these kinds of matters with a business lawyer when it comes to picking a business entity it's not a matter of just running out and starting to service clients once you decide to become a freelancer in most places you're going to need some kind of a business license okay working without that business license can be a crime in some places and usually is but also you want to really start to think about forming a company and in other words instead of just going out and getting a business license and working as a sole proprietor there can be benefits to forming a company such as a corporation or an llc which is a limited liability company um forming an s corp or forming some other kind of corporate entity again the kind of it that excuse me the kind of entity you choose is going to depend on the overall goals of your business and that's why it's best to talk to a lawyer what we do in our company is we've chosen to operate as an llc a limited liability company the benefits of an llc are number one it is an actual separate entity in other words it's considered a separate legal entity from my partners and i so what the llc means is that when our customers sign a contract they don't sign it with us as individuals they sign it with the llc they don't pay us as individuals they pay the llc when business expenses come up they don't get paid by us personally they get paid by the llc the llc has its own bank account and things of that nature um if the if you know we need a contract for services like if we have to rent server space the llc signs the contract with somebody else not you know we don't sign that as individuals the many benefits of having an llc include protections from liability so like let's say for example we were to sign a longterm contract with a vendor let's say we signed uh signed up for server space and had to sign a one year commitment for that and let's say after six months for whatever reason our business fails and we don't want to be in business anymore and the server space vendor decides to try to take us to collections or to even sue us to collect the rest of the money they were owed they could only sue the llc they could not sue us as individuals generally speaking so in other words it protects your individual credit your individual assets and um things of that nature can also protect you under the right circumstances from liability from your clients so you know if a client ever comes along and says hey you know i hired joe developer to do the software work for me and he bungled my app and i'm suing them for damages well if they're contracted with an llc generally speaking they can sue the llc and not the individual so having an llc really does provide you with liability protection which can be really crucial when you're going into business one of the other big benefits of having all an llc which again is what we have is that comes with several tax advantages namely allows you to save on uh what would be selfemployment taxes that you would pay if you're just working as a sole proprietor the discussion on how uh having an llc can save you on selfemployment taxes it can be quite lengthy and i've actually done a separate video on that previously for free code camp we're going to link to that video in the description below okay so when you're trying to decide what to do i would suggest watching that video but again the first thing i would suggest you do is talk to some kind of business law attorney or corporate counsel on what is the best fit for your particular situation in your particular location to meet your particular goals so the one thing i want to stress in this is don't just run out and start doing work figure out what kind of entity it is you should probably form and get that entity formed before you go out and and get the appropriate licenses before you go out and start trying to hustle up work for your new business so now that we've talked about the need to form some kind of business sanity or to minimum get the appropriate licenses we're all done talking about the planning stage for your new business your new business is officially planned congratulations it is now time to actually get started on doing some work and making some money so let's get to it okay at this point of our video we've just talked about the planning stages of your business in other words you've decided to become a freelance developer and you've done all that initial planning so you can have a business that's going to run well and run properly and be well thought out and you're not just going to go out and try to open up your own shop and haphazardly go about your business in other words because you've planned things out you're set up for success now we need to talk about some things you need to do initially to actually get the doors open to your new enterprise okay and those three those areas that you need to get knocked out first are going to really fall into two categories one is administrative tasks that you need to get set up and ready to go before you start taking customers and the second is marketing items that you need to get set up and ready to roll before you start taking customers and the third thing i would say you need to do on top of those is before you even start taking a customer is decide right now you're going to be a continuous learner and i'll talk about all three of these in a minute and what i mean by each of them but the one thing i want to stress before we get into your checklist and things to do when it comes to starting your own business is the importance of starting off on the right foot okay in other words you need to have all your administrative and clerical and legal requirements met before you start taking customers you need to have a lot of your marketing infrastructure in place before you go out and start taking customers and you also need to be just learning about new things before you start taking customers the reason i say especially when it comes to your administrative and marketing stuff that you need to have these things organized and have all your ducks in a row before you really start trying to run your business is because if you don't get these things organized now then running your business later is going to be much harder just think of it like this um you know you don't get you don't get very well organized uh when you start up shop as a result there were documents you were supposed to file with the irs or the secretary of state that didn't get filed but then you just started taking customers right and then you're right in the middle of a coding project and you get a notice from the secretary of state that some items need to be taken care of immediately otherwise you will no longer be legally allowed to do business this means you would have to stop your coding project in the middle of what you're doing to go deal with an administrative headache that should have been dealt with before as a result your project's probably going to be delayed to the client the client is going to be unhappy you may have to give them a partial discount if not a refund and it's just going to create a whole host of headaches for you okay so in other words by having all your administrative tasks lined up completed those initial tasks just done and organized you help avoid those fires from popping up later that you then have to stop what you're doing and put out and by being organized in the beginning you make more money later and the same is true with your marketing if you've got your marketing infrastructure in place then you don't have to stop what you're doing later in in a mad panic to try to drum up clients okay so the one thing again i just cannot stress enough is get your all your get all your ducks in a row and get organized before you even start taking customers so again let's look at it from an administrative standpoint a marketing standpoint and then things you need to be learning about on an ongoing basis okay when starting your company there are going to be several essentially what i call administrative tasks that you're going to need to get taken care of and out of the way and again as i stress in the introduction of this section you want to get these tasks taken care of now so that they don't become problems later so by getting all these things out of the way you can actually focus on the important thing which is doing dev work okay so there's a few different things you want to get out of the way up front number one is you got to decide if you're going to form a company or work as a sole proprietor i talked at a previous section of this video about why we use an llc in our business talk with an attorney or a lawyer um you know get a consultation with a business law lawyer about whether you should form a corporation whether you should form an llc uh you know uh whether you form some kind of partnership in other words talk to an attorney to see what's best for your particular situation uh we use an llc in our business and i know a lot of times that's what an attorney is going to suggest to you but talk to a lawyer and figure out what actually is the best course for you given your particular needs your particular circumstances the laws and regulations of where you live and so on and so forth so number one is get your company formed but after your company is formed it's important to make sure that you're keeping up with the business requirements of wherever you live so for example in ohio where i live once you form your company and you get your business license you don't need to renew your business license every year but there are other states where you do need to renew your business life license every year in nevada for example along with renewing your business license every year you have to file what's called a list of officers every year so the reason i'm telling you all this is the to stress the importance of the fact that the rules and regulations you have to follow are going to be different depending on where you live so it's really important that you know the regulations and rules of where you live and you keep up with them and again having a lawyer will help you to do these things if you don't keep up with those regulations and you might lose your ability to do business um if you're you know if you're in a place that you have to renew your business license every year and you don't renew it you may actually be committing a crime by engaging in business without having the appropriate licensing so in addition to getting your company formed make sure you're aware of your local regulations and that you're keeping up with them so number one is decide what kind of entity you're going to form and keep up with your local rules and regulations number two is to get a separate address for your business generally speaking i personally consider it a bad idea to use your home address as your business address there's no reason you can't but that means for example putting your home address on your company website that means putting your home address on any contracts you sign with clients that means having business mail come to your house so on so forth for just personal peace of mind reasons it can be a good idea to have a separate address for your business and then also if you're going to be forming a separate entity like an llc there may be other benefits to having a separate address and you'd want to talk about those benefits with an attorney as well in terms of where to have a separate address uh lots of uh excuse me lots of freelance developers will use just a post office box since a lot of freelancers are working out of their house if you're working at a shared space such as a wework or a regis a lot of times you can have that shared office space and receive mail there so if you're considering one of those kinds of spaces ask them what kind of services they offer in terms of you know using uh their addresses your business address receiving mail there and things of that nature so post office box some kind of shared office space there in other words there are low cost options for having a separate mailing address for your business third thing is to get a separate bank account for your company for this you'll need an ein from the irs that's an employer identification number you'll need that ein if you are starting a separate entity such as an llc or corporation or something like that you want to have a separate bank account for your business for a few reasons number one if you're starting a separate entity such as an llc or corporation that entity is a separate you know essentially a separate person from you so your bank account needs to be kept separate from that number two it helps you keep your book straight in terms of uh what's a personal expense and um what's a business expense number three having a separate account for your business allows you to stay a lot more disciplined when it comes to budgeting your business finances one of the biggest reasons though for having a separate bank account is the legal reasons that an attorney will tell you about you protect yourself and your business by having a separate account for your business and that is something to talk about with a lawyer after you've started a bank account and you know you've got your business address and all that stuff there are certain software software services and just professional services you want to sign up for you know for your new business and that brings us to the fourth thing on my list which is software and services that you need to sign up for the first of those is to get some type of a business suite such as g suite from google or office 365 from microsoft these will make it much easier for you to have a branded email so in other words instead of you know instead of your personal email or instead of new developer at gmail.com you know you can actually have an email on your own domain which you don't have to have a business suite like g suite in office 365 to do this obviously but it makes managing your email easier and the big benefit of those types of business suites is they include other services such as uh calendaring uh uh cloud drive storage and a few other things that are specific to business um i'd they're relatively inexpensive and i would strongly suggest signing one of them up we use g suite in our business and it makes our life a whole lot easier you want to sign up for your accounting software that is uh you know how you're going to do your bookkeeping there are a lot of options here there's quickbooks online there's wave apps there's freshbooks we personally use wave in our business i find it to be very easy to use and the price is right because it's free for you know for certain services so again we use wave but that's not what you have to use but definitely you want to sign up for accounting software um you know so you can do your uh you know so you can do your uh bookkeeping i can't stress enough the importance of regular bookkeeping and that's something we'll talk about a little bit later in this video the next thing you want to sign up for is credit card processing uh you know you sign up for square uh get credit card processing through into it wave who we do our accounting through also offers credit card processing your clients are going to pay you with a credit card or debit card the overwhelming majority of the time um and so a you want to have something where you can send them an online online invoice all the services i just mentioned do that you want them to be able to pay it online with credit card or a debit card one of the reasons i say to get this set up now even if you don't have a customer is just think about it for a minute it's a little bit awkward if client number one calls you talks to you on the phone says okay i want you to build my app you tell them it's three thousand dollars and they say great send me an invoice and you don't even have your software set up yet to send them the invoice so in other words get your software set up now and your billing set up now and your credit card processing all set up now and you can send them the invoice right away it doesn't take long to get this stuff signed up so just get it done now there is no reason to be doing it later when you know when you need to send some to the client just get out of the way and sign up right now the next software next service i should say you're going to want to sign up is a payroll service we use the full service payroll offerings from intuit which is the parent company of quickbooks if you are starting an llc an s corp or uh an llc to be taxed as an s corp i should say or a corporation you're going to need to pay yourself as an employee and again the specifics of that or something to talk about with a lawyer but you are going to need to pay yourself as an employee in addition to taking distributions from the business and once you start doing payroll as an employee you'll find there is just a lot of paperwork that's got to be filed with the irs get filed with the state and your local governments and all that fun stuff by having a payroll service to do that for you you save a massive amount of time we pay a fee every month to intuit full service payroll and they take care of all of our paperwork for us i mean 100 of it and it just makes our life so much easier it is so worth the cost and it allows us to stay in compliance in terms of everything we need to be filing in terms of payroll so there are other services you're going to need to sign up for and other software products you're going to need to sign up for but the ones i would stress immediately to make sure you're ready to roll with are again your business suites this is g suite office 365 zoho any of those companies that have similar offerings excuse me your accounting software we use wave but again there's offerings such as quickbooks online uh freshbooks and several others sign up for a credit card processor such as with uh stripe wave square uh into a cr into it credit card processing any of those and the fourth one um on that list is to get signed up for a payroll service i just cannot stress all those things enough the next thing you're going to want to do as part of your administrative task getting going this is the fourth thing on our list remember first one was get your company an entity formed and know your licensing requirements second one was get your business address third one was get your bank account set up fourth one i'm i'm sorry so fourth one was your software and services fifth thing you're going to want to do is uh get your contracts ready these are the contracts you're going to send to customers so in other words let's say i'm your customer i call you i say i want you to build an app for me and then uh you give me a quote me three thousand dollars i say great send me over a contract so i can sign it this is a form contract that you will send me or mostly form contract at least that you would send me to for me to sign agreeing that you're going to do the work and what i'm going to pay you and so on so forth there are places you can get these types of contracts such as legalzoom there are problems with just getting forms off the internet though they may not be the right call for your situation it is very much worth the money to pay a small business lawyer to look over some for form contracts for you and give you some feedback and help you make sure you're on the right track in terms of the forms you're sending off to potential clients to sign so you know like i said you can pull a form off of legalzoom my strong advice would be to talk to an attorney though and have them go over any contracts uh that you may be thinking of putting in your document bank to send the clients and then you know once the attorneys reviewed them you know you can start sending them off and because contracts are so important in your business what we're going to do is at the end of this section of our video we're going to have a separate lecture from an attorney named carrie ross carrie is a business law attorney in the dayton ohio area and she's been kind enough to put together some information on things to look out for and to make sure of when you're putting together the contracts the next thing and last thing on my list to sign up for and this is item number seven is insurance for your business uh specifically professional liability insurance what this is some what this does i should say is it allows you to be protected from liability in the event that one of your customers ever sues you so let's say you know a customer hires you to build a website and they say hey you know you did something wrong as a result they don't appear in search engines or um you know they hire you to build an app and they claim you did something wrong and they lost business as a result of it and then they want to sue you having insurance it means that you could just turn the lawsuit over to your insurance even if you don't agree with the lawsuit again your insurance will cover it and your insurance would pay all your legal bills i mean we've never been sued in our business but given a really small cost of carrying insurance it just lets me sleep better at night so i think right now our premiums just went up so right now we're paying call it a hundred dollars a year it's really not very much at all in the grand scheme of things so sign up for professional liability insurance um for your business uh just call geico or you know any similar company and they can get you pointed in the right direction as to who you want to sign up for with that so your administrative tasks again to get out of the way before you even start taking customers are get your company formed and know your legal requirements get a business address get a business bank account get your required or needed software and services signed up get uh your contracts that you're going to be sending clients ironed out preferably reviewed by an attorney and also get an insurance policy signed up and as i mentioned a moment ago let's get to attorney kerry ross for her lecture on contracts in your business hi my name is carrie ross i'm a business attorney and an estate planning attorney with ross legal services in dayton ohio i've been asked to speak with you today about the importance of written contracts in your software development business we're going to talk about a few key points in this segment first the importance generally of wellwritten contracts throughout all aspects of your business and then specifically in connection with your software development services second we'll talk about typical formats for development service contracts and some key provisions that you may want to include in your form to use with your clients last we'll talk about some resources available to you for purposes of preparing your contract to use with your clients the first thing i'll say is having a wellwritten contract is very important for all aspects of your business you might be entering into a lease for office space employment agreements hiring your own independent contractors or simply purchasing goods in each case review the contract negotiate it make sure that the final product matches what your intentions are so that the contract cannot be questioned a purpose of a contract is to memorialize your business transaction it's your reference guide throughout an ongoing transaction if there's a question about who's obligated to do what and when it's also your first line of defense in the event of a dispute your contract may even have provisions that say what to do in the event of a dispute do you have to go to arbitration for example or are there notice requirements before you can take any kind of legal action when not reduced to writing a handshake deal or something you've agreed to via email or if it's just poorly written in a written contract you're open to disputes he said she said problems coming up down the road including maybe not getting paid maybe having to sue someone or being sued for breach of contract or maybe additional damages and sometimes it's all of the above a real world example in the software development field would be if you agreed to develop an app for a customer and it has certain functionality delivery dates you comply with all of that at the end of the agreement once you've delivered your app and been paid you're asked to provide ongoing maintenance and rather than memorializing the terms of that specifically in a contract you think that everything's gone well with this customer you agree to provide maintenance two or three years go by and all of a sudden the technology on which your app was based is being phased out it no longer functions and your client is looking to you to say g as part of your maintenance maybe you need to rebuild the entire app and you may say well that wasn't in the scope of the maintenance agreement so where do you look you look at your written contract and if you haven't memorialized the terms of that clearly you could be left in a lurch so at this point let's turn our attention to the typical format for software development contracts and some key provisions you may want to include so as we discussed in the last section your written contract with your customer is going to be the place where you protect your business's interest and in the context of app development or software development you're protecting you your talent is what's delivering the project and the product at the end of the day so that's really what your contract is geared to protect clients will ask you to provide a contract nine times out of ten unless you're working with the microsoft's or amazons or large development houses of the world your clients will not normally have their own development contract form so you want to be prepared when you make that sales pitch in advance so that you're not holding up your sales process or closing your deal because you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with your own contract if a client does present you with their own form it's really important to read this closely understand what you're agreeing to before you finalize it you may not feel like you have that much leverage and you may not but as long as you know what you're signing ahead of time and make sure that it's not going to impact your activities going forward then that's important things to watch out for would be restrictive covenants that prevent you from creating the same or similar software or applications for people in competing industries so noncompetes nonsolicitations those types of things should really be watch outs the common format that i typically see for services agreements is an independent contractor agreement plus a statement of work that is attached to the back of it you can call it an independent contractor agreement you can call it a services agreement software development agreement that really doesn't matter as much as the fact that you're going to have your general basic terms that stay for the most part the same from customer to customer in your independent contract agreement and this attachment on the back where you can customize the transaction to match what you're actually being asked to perform common provisions that you would see within the independent contractor section clearly you're going to identify the parties the date you're signing the agreement in each of these right off the bat but in the contractor agreement section you'll cover things like termination rights who has the right to end the contract for what reasons and what procedures in place when that happens do you get paid for partially completed work or how does that work things like insurance indemnification obligations where you're risk sharing with the other side in case something goes wrong those would be negotiated in your independent contractor agreement if you're granting any warranties for your work or specifically saying you're not granting warranties for your work that's typically handled in this section as well a word of caution there depending on where you are most state statutes have specific requirements that imply certain warranties unless you disclaim them specifically and if you are going to disclaim them you may have to write that in a certain way in your agreement to make it enforceable so please check in with local council or really do some statutory research if you have that available to you to make sure you're complying with the restrictions you may also handle things such as the venue for any lawsuits that potentially come up governing law that would apply to your contract particularly if you're located in different states than your customer or alternative dispute resolution provisions that may require arbitration or mediation prior to starting a lawsuit now the statement of work is the juicy part this is where you get to customize the work or customize the language to match the work you're performing so you really want to get into the deliverables here in specific detail what are your deliverables and when are you expected to deliver them is this a pretty specific project that's due all at one time is it a phased timeline for delivery what is due when and what are your obligations related to that payment terms you want to make sure that you're specifically saying when you want to get paid and for what if you're delivering parts of the project along a timeline will you get paid as those things get delivered do you get paid on an hourly rate a flat fee rate what are the terms of your payment and when are they due and keep in mind if this is your form start where you want the payment terms to start and let your customer negotiate a change from there if needed you may want to deal with specifically customer responsibilities depending on what you're doing you may need the customer or a customer representative assigned to you to provide you with information or access to systems to make sure their app works what happens if they don't do that and that delay is your timeline are you responsible or are they responsible here is also the place where you deal with ongoing obligations after the ultimate project is delivered will you be maintaining the project are you responsible for updates for the project do you have any kind of other ongoing application or i'm sorry ongoing obligation uh after the delivery is done so these are the kinds of things that you're going to want to really nail down inside of your independent contractor agreement and the attached scope of work so now we've gone over the need for written contracts throughout your business and we've specifically talked about the format you may want to use and some provisions that you might include in your software development agreement to be used with your own clients this may seem pretty overwhelming at this point a lot to think about the good news is there are some resources available to help you as you start to develop your own form the first and most obvious choice is to contact an attorney to help prepare the contract on your behalf you can explain your needs what the contract will be used for and have the attorney prepare that with those views in mind this may not be in your budget i understand that it is possible to negotiate a flat fee with a lot of attorneys which may save you some money over an hourly rate arrangement it may also be possible to negotiate a reduced rate for a startup business if this is still not within your budget i would encourage you to contact your local chamber of commerce or if you have like we do in dayton a small business startup incubator firm you might be able to contact them and receive some free or reduced cost professional services including legal services and others such as accounting banking etc through their programming if that's not available in your area there are numerous internet resources that you can use to start a form such as nolo.com might be a good starting point you can find these forms and i keep stressing starting point because as i mentioned in the previous segment there are specific statutory requirements depending on what kind of services you'll be offering and what you want your contract to cover i would encourage all of you to at least have an attorney read your form remembering that this is an investment in your business that you'll be using hopefully over and over again with your clients if you have any questions about anything we've covered here please feel free to contact me directly good luck okay a big thanks to kerry for talking about the importance of contracts and what to look for in a written contract now let's talk about what you need to be doing to market your new business okay now that you're ready to start up as a freelance developer let's talk about some things you need to get out of the way immediately so that you'll be able to market your business properly and there are other items other than the ones i'm going to talk about which you'll need however these are just the ones i'm stressing in this video some of them may seem obvious but you would be surprised how many people decide to open up their doors without having all these items for lack of a better word ready to go so let's go over a few things to make sure you have you know before you start trying to market yourself to customers number one is you need a website for your new business number two is need a branded email you need a phone number uh you need to have business cards you need to sign up your various review profiles on uh websites such as google my business and yelp and things of that nature you need to flush out your linkedin profile and again these are just some of the musthaves i mean obviously there are other ones so let's go through each of these in turn number one start a start a website for your new development business you would be surprised i have actually seen people who go out and hold themselves out as freelance software developers freelance web developers and they haven't they have not actually put up a website for themselves or if they have just to be frank it looks like garbage so put up something nice um your website is important for multiple reasons number one it's essentially your storefront right think of it like this if you were going to hire somebody to build you a website would you be a little concerned if they didn't have a nice website for themselves of course you would so have a website up for yourself before you start trying to hustle up business and make it nice make it look like you actually know what you're doing make it look like it's something you actually care about if you're looking for inspiration or patterns or even some good foundational templates to use for a website for yourself i would suggest going to the website html5 up these are free html5 templates that again are pretty good to use uh you know if you want to just get something up quicker and sooner rather than later again that website is html5 up or at a minimum you know if that's at a minimum i should say or build yourself something really nice from the ground up again this is you showing off yourself as a developer so have a website and make sure it looks nice number two is a branded email for your business um you gotta realize as a freelance developer you're gonna be dealing with a lot of people who can barely use a computer or barely use their newfangled smartphone so you know having a branded email goes a long way towards validating you with people um if you email somebody from you know your name at gmail.com you might as well be emailing them from brand new developer at gmail.com it goes a long way towards legitimizing you having a branded email we talked a little bit in the last section about signing up a business suite such as g suite or office 365 you'll get a branded email as part of that but don't start emailing potential clients and interacting with potential clients from um you know a free email account such as gmail yahoo you know outlook.com or anything like that the third thing to get is a phone number dedicated to your business there are a lot of reasons uh to keep your cell phone and your business line separate do you want your personal number on your website probably not uh there do you want to be able to go out at night and have your phone ring and not be sure if it's a customer or if it's just a friend of yours or a family member calling i'm sure you would like to be able to separate your work in your business lines fortunately having a separate business phone number doesn't require you to go out and pay for a second cell phone you certainly can if you want but you don't have to you can use a free service from google called google voice and that will allow you to essentially have a free voice over internet line that will go to your cell phone so you'll basically have two numbers on your cell phone google voice again is free you know you can talk and text talk text make calls from it receive calls um you know uh my wife has a google voice line uh for her business on her phone and it's free it's easy to use i mean i would suggest for uh your business phone number uh using google voice uh the next thing you're going to want to get is business cards you're going to be dealing especially as a freelance developer you're going to be dealing with or are likely i should say to be dealing with a good number of local businesses and it is important to be able to hand them a business card uh with that being said i personally don't think it's worth it to spend a lot of money on your business cards you can get something that's adequate from vistaprint you know usually 50 bucks for a few hundred cards uh but having a business card that you can hand out is definitely important you will be surprised at how many people say to you oh okay do you have a card and you looks kind of silly if you don't have a business card to hand them so have your business cards with you and you know like ready to roll before you even start trying to hustle up business the next thing you're going to want to do is get your various review profiles lined up these are your profiles on websites such as yelp um the review section of the facebook page for your new business uh the review section on google my business and things like that these are places where uh your customers will leave you good reviews you're going to want to ask them for reviews we'll talk about that a little later but as i said these are places for your customers to leave you good reviews after you've completed work for them it's important that you get these review profiles signed up and they be proactive about getting reviews from customers because there are there are meaningful number of people who will not want to hire you unless they can find good reviews um about your services and the reason i say to get your review profile signed up before you even get your first customer is because then you are ready to ask that customer for a review you don't want to you know finish your first customer's project and then you know and then um not be in a position to ask them for reviews because you haven't even signed up the profiles yet so before you even start going out and trying to hustle up business get your review profiles signed up the primary ones i would focus on are again google my business yelp uh the review section of your facebook page um you know those would probably be the big ones uh the next thing is to completely flush out and uh uh come and uh kind of make your linkedin profile look really nice and complete make it really clear what skills you have uh you know hey you know if you hey i know css i know javascript i know html you know i'm fluent in other languages make sure those are all listed on your linkedin profile make sure your linkedin profile says that you are available for uh freelance work any certifications you've gotten from free code camp make sure your list those are listed on your linkedin profile there are also quick certification tests you can take from linkedin for example uh they have one for css uh only takes a few minutes to do maybe a half hour to do the test and you'll have a note citation on your linkedin page saying that you're you're considered certified in css and if as i said have your profile say that you're available for freelance work and you'll be surprised at how many people just start randomly reaching out to you through linkedin um you know for potential freelance work and also link even if someone's not reaching out to you linkedin is a place where people are going to look to validate you in addition to looking at the review profiles i mentioned a minute ago so those are the initial musthaves in terms of being ready to market your new business again just going through them real fast in order get a website up go to a website such as html5 up if you're looking for inspiration or for a quick template you can grab get a branded email again g suite office 365 zoho those kinds of services uh are going to give you that anyway get a phone number for your business uh dedicated to your business uh i would suggest using google voice that's what my wife uses in her business i've used it in the past it's free so i don't really see any reason starting out to pay for something get business cards again something from vistaprint is typically fine get your review profiles signed up uh you know we're talking about uh yelp the facebook review section google my business and get your linkedin profile completely fleshed out and nicely filled out and you do those things and you're in a good spot to start marketing start i gotta stress marketing your business so with all that said let's talk about why the last stage of getting your business officially started is to begin a process of lifelong learning and then we'll be done with this module okay so the last part of getting your business started is recognizing that you are now going to have to be a lifelong learner if you want to be a successful freelancer and what do i mean by this i mean the fact that successful business people are always trying to learn about new topics uh rel that in some way relate to their business it is a mistake to think that okay i'm you know finishing or i have finished uh the coding education i'm going to do at free code camp and i'm now done and i'm ready to strike out into the world completing free code camp is not the end of uh learning how to code it is the beginning of starting a career as a coder in other words it is just the first step and now you've got to start learning about a whole lot of other topics if you want to be successful as a freelancer because what you will quickly find out and when i say quickly i mean almost immediately find out once you go out on your own is that there is a whole lot of things that going to be go into being a business person uh besides learning how to code so one thing i cannot stress to you enough is um in your spare time just be reading on a regular basis uh you know try to read 30 to 45 minutes a day at a at a minimum and i gotta stress the at a minimum and when i say read i don't mean um you know just random articles and magazines or fiction books or whatever uh i would really suggest trying to learn um as much as you can about people who have been very successful in their fields look at what traits made them successful and then try to emulate those traits in your own business and there's also just a lot of other books you can read that help you figure out what it is that successful people do in terms of the habits they keep the thing i can't stress enough is that you would when you read about successful people and people who have achieved a lot what you will see is common patterns common behaviors and common habits between all of them and it is important to remember that those people don't have those habits because they're successful they're successful because they have those habits so if you choose to have those habits in your own business and in your own life you can be successful as well so my my advice is just read early read often um about people who have been successful in their field and it doesn't even have to be a successful software developer like bill gates i mean just people who have been successful in any kind of business a few books i would suggest to get started with if you haven't read these already number one is profit first what this is is a book that talks about essentially accounting in your business but also how to set up a financial budget for your business a lot of businesses go out of go out of business due to poor financial management and now that you're a freelancer you are a business person like it or not and you don't want your business to fail due to poor financial management profit first does a pretty good job of putting together a system that is easy for people to follow um so if you're somebody who already has a lot of discipline and is already really good with managing finances and you're good at keeping personal and business finances separate on top of that this may not be the book for you but that being said i am willing to put a large number of people watching this video would be open to admitting that they've struggled with personal financial management at some point so reading profit first is good in a sense that it will give you an easy to follow system and just follow the system and your business's finances will take care of themselves so profit first is book number one book number two is how to win friends and influence people this is a good one to read because it really goes a long way in terms of giving some tips that can be useful in dealing with potential customers dealing with people after they've become your customers dealing with other vendors and just individuals you're going to have to deal with in the business world on you know just on a daily basis while the book isn't specifically about dealing with people in a business setting it really gives a lot of great information on how to deal with individuals in different situations in a broader context and if you're somebody that feels like how do i endear myself to people how do i sell how do i make people want to hire me this is probably a good book to read so number two is how to win friends and influence people by dale carnegie number three is the millionaire next door this is a book in which many millionaires were studied over a long period of time and it'll really dispel a lot of common misperceptions about individuals who are millionaires how they became millionaires the habits of millionaires and things of that nature it'll also go a long way in showing how millionaires stay millionaires through certain financial habits i personally think this book should be required reading before anyone graduates from high school in the united states so it's one i certainly cannot suggest enough that people should be read reading number four is a small time operator this is a book that deals with small business in general um everything from habits you should be keeping uh in terms of financial management to daytoday operations to getting your taxes paid on time to you name it for anyone who has never worked for themself and is now going out as a freelance developer small time operator is a must read number four is the i'm sorry number five is the innovators by walter isaacson this is essentially a history of uh computing and computer science and it goes all the way from the creation of the first computer and the concepts of the first computer of ada lovelace all the way up through essentially where we are today and it'll really give you an appreciation of how no one person not even steve jobs not even bill gates not even name an individual no one person had an outsized impact on computing and has really just been kind of a brick by brick building of uh you know of uh computer science from the from its founding and through now and it really just gives you an appreciation of uh what what different individuals has done it's an inspiring book to read and i i just think it's a muslim must read for anyone who's just learned to code and is striking out on their own and the final book i would suggest reading is the everything store which is a story about amazon and the founding of amazon by jeff bezos and how the company grew uh to where it is today the thing you will really take away from this book when you read it is that amazon got where it is today in large part by a neverending focus on customer service i mean whether it's just you as a freelance developer you know in your basement writing code or whether you're jeff bezos writing amazon running amazon and everything in between customer service has to be your prep number one priority there's can be no other priority that comes before customer service and reading the everything store will really uh help you understand this so like i said these are just a few suggestions um to get started and i would really suggest reading 30 to 45 minutes a day um for those of you watching this video you know if we could line everybody up a year from now for people who have succeeded as a freelancer and people who haven't i guarantee you the people who have succeeded have probably read more consistently than the people who haven't so you know with all of that said let's move on to the next part of our lessons okay we're to the point of our lessons where we're going to talk about how to get clients for your new business after all as a freelance web developer freelance software developer you're not going to be in business very long if you don't have customers right so really we're going to look at a few things number one we're going to look at how to get customers in the short term because you need revenue today and number two we're going to look at how to build your business over the long term how you get customers over the long term is going to be very different than how you immediately get customers today for your short term startup business all right so before we dive into those let's look at number one why is it important to understand the difference between the long term and the short term and then let's quickly talk about how to sell your services to people once you understand the need to focus on the long term you'll see the difference between that and shortterm business building and then you'll also see that once you know how to sell yourself to people you can just be far more effective in terms of growing your business so first the need to focus on both the shortterm and the long term in your business the need to focus on the short term is obvious right because as i said a moment ago if you don't have customers today you're going to be in business for about 30 seconds so you need to get customers today no one disputes that you may not be taking your dream jobs you may not be getting the work that is your first choice but you need work so again you're gonna go about doing things to get work today that are getting you work through not necessarily the most uh how shall we say sustainable ways okay but again you need work today so that's what you're gonna do over the long term however you're going to build a brand meaning that you're going to build a business where instead of you going out and getting work through nonsustainable means people are just coming to you and you're getting the work without having to put much effort into getting it this is work that will be higher paying this is work more along the lines of what you want to be doing long term and more importantly if you're not putting time and resources into getting that work it becomes much more profitable for you so if you only focus on the short term you can get some business and that's what you're going to have to do in the beginning but if that is your sole focus and you're confident you're just constantly and i do mean constantly in that state of trying to hustle up new work looking for the next job things of that nature and you just never really get your business out of second gear if however you keep your focus on building a longterm brand you grow your profits in your business really fast so that's why it's important to in the short term go out and get some clients do what you have to do to hustle up work but also be building a longterm brand so i cannot stress that enough number two is how to actually sell yourself to customers and eat whether you're trying to sell the people in the short term or whether you're trying to sell the people in the long term i cannot stress enough that you need to view yourself as a problem solver we talked about this in an earlier section of the video when we were talking about the need to provide value to your clients when you are selling yourself to your clients and trying to sell your services to a client what you need to do is come to learn about the client's business and identify the client's problems and explain how your software is or your website or whatever you're building explain how your product is going to solve those problems okay don't come to them and say here's my experience here's what i've done say you have this problem here's how i'm going to solve it people are going to be much much much and i mean much more receptive to that kind of an approach and you'll wind up doing a lot more in sales this is something i talked about at length in a previous video for free code camp and we're going to link to that video in the description below so we don't rehash too much of it here but when selling yourself to customers i cannot stress enough present yourself as a problem solver so in short you need customers in the short term we're going to talk in a moment about how to get those it's important that you keep a focus on building your brand long term and when selling yourself to customers it's really important that you present yourself as a solver of their problems all right so with all that said let's get on to how to build your business over the short term okay let's take a few minutes to talk about some things you're going to do to get clients in the short term as we just said in our intro the need to get clients in the short term for your freelance business is obvious right because after all if you don't get clients immediately you're not going to be working for yourself for very long so in just a moment i'm going to get into five different ways that you can go about getting clients immediately getting customers today and generating some revenue before i get into that though the one thing i want to stress is that the things you're going to do in the short term to get clients are going to be a little more labor intensive and a little more costly than the things you're going to do over the long term to get your business and that's all right again these things like i said while they in the short term while they may be costly while they may be time intensive the bottom line is they're necessary because if you don't have clients today you are not going to do that very well and you're not going to be around for very long so let's look at five things you can do in the short term to get clients for your startup business number one is simply gonna be people you know and i'll talk about this in a minute you're just gonna put put out there to people you know that you're now engaging in this kind of work number two is to be lead websites such as upwork and fiverr we'll talk about those in a minute number three is going to be leveraging your linkedin profile number four and people are surprised when i say this is going to be leveraging websites such as craigslist and number five is gonna be good oldfashioned networking so let's go through each of these in turn number one is as i said just putting your name out there to people you know you would be surprised at how much work you can get by simply making everyone you know aware of the fact that you are now engaging in this type of work i'm not suggesting that you go around the friends and family members and continuously harass them into letting you do build them a website or letting you do something for them what i'm saying though is that you need to simply put out there hey just so you know i'm available to do this type of work let me give you a few examples of what i mean by that in one of our businesses our main service is building websites for very small to mediumsized companies and usually you know kind of like the small momandpop shops type companies so just as an example when we started that business i made i just kind of casually mentioned to one friend of mine hey just so you know we're going to be doing this type of work you know like etc etc if you know anybody that needs that kind of work just let me know and very quickly that friend said to me that her her mother had actually recently started a church and then we wound up building a website for the church i also mentioned to a neighbor that i was doing this type of work and very quickly that led to another referral the same thing and i had similar situations with other people that we knew so when i told people hey we do this kind of work that was going to be the only time i tell them i'm not going to like sit there and tell them over and over i'm not going to like harass them i'm not going to sit there and say just a reminder i do this kind of work just casually make people aware that you're doing this type of work and do it in a way where you don't sound like you're trying to sell them something again hey just letting you know and you will be surprised how quickly referrals can come in that way as i said we started that little side project business i just talked about and very quickly we started getting referrals simply by letting people i know know that we were doing this kind of work so just putting yourself out there like that can go a long way and i can't stress that enough as a place to start the second place to look for getting clients for your business is lead service websites such as upwork and fiverr what up work is it's a website where essentially people looking for services such as web development or software development will go on upwork state what it is they want and what they're willing to pay and then you can go online and bid on the job a lot of times you'll be bidding on work at a dollar amount for which is way less than what you would normally charge for this kind of work but again in the beginning it's work so you know it can generate some revenue for you while you're getting started the thing that i would say is important to do when you're using websites such as upwork from tac things of that nature is to make sure that your profile on the site is fully completed make sure you list all your experience include examples of your work and um things of that nature make sure make sure people review you on those sites after they're happy with your services all those kinds of things will make your bidding process more effective so the upside of these kinds of services is the fact that people go on there looking for the services you're providing so it makes finding a customer a lot easier the downside is again you're working for a reduced rate a lot of the time and you're also paying for the lead so it's not going to be the most profitable thing in the world but in the short term it is work to do and it is money to be made another option as i mentioned a second ago is fiverr fiverr works a little different than a website such as upwork what fiverr is is you essentially go online create a profile people can come to your profile and say what they're willing to pay and then fiverr will take a cut of that so again you're usually going to wind up working for reduced rates on a website such as fiber and on top of that you're paying a percentage to fiber so when you're looking at those kinds of things it's important to consider the reduced profitability weight against the fact that the customers are typically being or essentially i should say being brought to you so again pros and cons on those third thing on our list is leveraging linkedin it's really important to on your linkedin profile make sure that you are stating that you are a freelance developer that you work for yourself put the name of your business on there and make sure you list in your bio and in your bylines that you are available to do this kind of work on a freelance basis make sure you're including all your qualifications uh include examples of your work on your linkedin profile and there is such a shortage right now of software developers and web developers that you will be surprised at how many people will reach out to you and ask if you are available to do work for them so linkedin is a good way uh to get business again just as i said make sure your profile is filled out all the way on there number four and this is one that people kind of raise an eyebrow when i say it is to have a nice ad on your local craigslist section so for example if you live in name of city go on the name of city page for craigslist and you know under certain the services section you can put in that you are available to do web design or whatever kind of work it is you're doing don't just put up a quick craigslist post saying that hey i do this work call me at this number actually take the time write out a nice ad put it on craigslist include a graphic uh the craigslist supports a graphic uh at a width of 450 pixels at a height of 600 pixels put a nice graphic on there put as i said a nice ad on there and you will be surprised at the fact that you get some calls through there to this day craigslist remains a highly valuable and highly underutilized resource for getting work now the work you're going to get through craigslist is not going to be the most profitable type of work there is these are typically going to be low dollar websites um you know people want to spend a few bucks for just some basic coding or something like that again it's not you're certainly not going to get rich off it's not going to be all the money in the world but it only costs you five dollars to run the ad and you will get some work out of that the important thing is to post consistently and to stick with it the last thing on our list is good oldfashioned networking and by networking i mean going out and meeting with other business owners to drum up work for yourself what i don't suggest for networking is going doortodoor or going around at different kinds of businesses trying to introduce yourself i also don't suggest going to functions that are mostly attended by other developers that is something i see in a lot of different professions so for example attorneys tend to network with other attorneys uh you know accountants tend to network with other accountants a lot of software developers tend to network with other software developers and to be honest that's just not a very effective way of leveraging networking into getting customers instead what you want to be doing is meeting with people who in turn work with your customers so for example if you are let's say starting up a freelance web design business and what you might want to do is get hooked up with a digital marketer who doesn't actually do web design but maybe manages payperclick or something for somebody those type of people are almost always looking for people to build websites on behalf of their clients so that would in turn be a good referral source for you one of the best ways or i should say best resources to find good networking opportunities is a group called bni that's business networking international they're throughout the united states and with lots of local chapters and pretty much everywhere so go on bni's website and find local chapters in your area and join up there is an annual fee for joining bni it is well worth it the idea of bni is has a few aspects to it number one is they only allow one person in a chapter per an area so for example if you join bni as a web designer they're not going to allow another web designer in that chapter so which a lot gives you some exclusivity and for obvious reasons is good for you and then you'll have a chapter with one web designer one auto mechanic one accountant one finance manager one local doctor just name that one real estate agent just name the type of business and he will have one of each in there and then once you attend it and then you'll attend weekly meetings and once you attend these weekly meetings the goal of bni is for everybody in the group to essentially open up their referral books to one another so in other words you are a web designer in the bni group friend of yours needs an auto mechanic you refer them to the auto mechanic in the bni group the auto mechanic nobody knows somebody who needs their house painted so he refers them to the house painter in the bni group it turns out that there's a doctor in the or you know physician in the bni group and it turns out he knows somebody that needs a website he just refers the site he refers them to you so in other words it's not something where person one and person two are directly referring things to each other all the time it's just that everybody in the group is referring things to other people in a group and a lot of that business will have a way of coming back to you so attending a networking group such as bni is a really good start for a way to get business in the short term networking can be very very time consuming so that is why i've got it on our list of things to do to build business in the short term it is a very time consuming so a lot of people like to say well i go out and i network because it's free well it's only free if you value your time at zero okay and your time is worth a whole lot more than zero so in the short term networking functions and networking events and joining networking groups is an okay way to get business but as you build a brand long term those are things that you're going to want to get away from so to sum up we're really talking about five ways to build business and grow your company over the short term number one is people you know as i said just put it out there that you're doing this kind of work you know uh don't harass your friends it's a good way to make sure they're not your friends anymore number two excuse me is using services such as upwork thumbtack and fiverr number three is leveraging linkedin number four is a website such as craigslist and number five is good oldfashioned networking so now that we've gone over all of those let's talk about how it is you're gonna build your brand over the long term which will greatly increase your profits okay let's talk about building your business over the long term now and having a longterm sustainable business is going to look a lot different than the things you're doing to get business in the short term as we talked about in the last section of our video your shortterm business activities are really going to focus on using lead websites going to networking events things that are either very expensive things that are very time consuming things that lead to you taking work at reduced rates those are all good ways to make a few bucks today to keep your new business running and to help you make a little extra money while you're focusing on building a longterm brand the reason why building a longterm brand is so important is having an actual brand that you have ownership and control of allows you to number one charge more for your services you'll actually be charging more of what you deserve to be making for the work you're doing number two it also allows you to save time and resources on getting work in other words instead of you putting out money instead of you putting out a lot of time to get work people are going to be coming to you so think of it like this people coming to you and saying let me pay you full price as opposed to you going to people and saying here's uh reduced work i can do so for obvious reasons having a brand is way way way and a whole bunch of ways more profitable than the things you're going to need to do in the short term so while you're engaging in those short term activities that we talked about in the our last section i cannot stress enough that you need to be making time for the long term activities that were about to talk about and if you don't make time for those longterm activities next thing you know you've been freelancing and working for yourself for five years and you are still engaging in those shortterm activities and not making very much money that can be a trap that is actually very easy for people to fall into so the best thing you can do is just set aside the time every week to say you know what i don't care how busy i am i'm going to focus on these longterm activities so what are the longterm activities that you're going to engage in to make sure you're building a brand and that you're charging more for your services and that you're not putting time and effort into getting customers number one is simply building a referral base and we'll talk about that in a second number two is going to be leveraging a blog for yourself and number three is going to be leveraging platforms such as youtube if you focus on these three things then next thing you know like i said people are coming to you instead of you going to them and people are paying you more instead of less so let's look at each of these in term again number one is simply getting referrals from people and getting repeat business referrals and repeat business i'm saying that so saying that so many times because it's so important it's so important i'm going to say it again referrals and repeat business here's the important thing to understand about getting referrals from former customers and having other former customers come back to you to do additional work in the future when you look at very successful businesses they don't get a proportionately higher number of phone calls and what i mean by that is let's say you've got developer one and developer two here's developer one here's developer two this developer does five times the revenue every year of this developer let's go with 5x that does not mean that this developer gets five times as many brand new client calls every month as this developer if you want to get to where you are making substantially more than other people you have to do it by getting referrals from former customers and getting repeat business from former customers it is simply too expensive and too time consuming to constantly be getting brand new business that's not stemming from work you have already done it's just not possible to succeed without doing that think of it in these terms a customer comes to you wants a website you build it for three thousand dollars right you do a really good job for that customer three to six months later that customer refers you to somebody you then build that person a website for twenty five hundred dollars three to six months later that second customer the referred one they refer you somebody you build that one website for say three thousand dollars your marketing or whatever you're doing to get clients from the outside world only yielded one phone call it yielded the phone call from the very first customer however by doing good work that one customer turned into three new customers or i'm sorry two new customers and a total of three customers and as a result of that you also have three potential referral sources out there right now all from one phone call right and some of that can also happen with repeat business and so on so forth in other words if you get one phone call you do a great job for the person and over the course of three or four years you know you do three or four different projects for that person one phone call yielded three or four different jobs essentially so that kind of an approach and focusing on referrals and repeat business is the way to grow your business exponentially so how do you make sure you're getting referrals and repeat business well it may sound simple but you'd be surprised the first thing is good oldfashioned customer service call people back return respond to people's emails be honest with them about how long something is going to take do what you're say you're going to do if you tell somebody you're going to have something done by thursday have it done by thursday if you're not going to have it done by thursday make sure you call them thursday and or email them thursday and explain to them that this isn't done i'm sorry here's why it's not done here's when it will be done don't make them chase you around saying hey you said this was going to be done on thursday where is it good oldfashioned customer service and saying that that what you're going to do and doing it are the most surefire ways to lead to that repeat business and those referrals that we just talked about i cannot stress this enough you may think duh when i'm saying provide good service to people but you would be surprised at how few people out there actually provide the kind of service that you would probably want to receive yourself so going that extra mile going above and beyond can really go a long way and as simple as that sounds it takes work to you got to remember it takes work to provide good customer service right so do that work and put in the time and you will be shocked at how fast your business grows um and this is true whatever industry you're in whether you're a freelance developer of some sort whether you're a real estate agent whether you are you know an accountant or some other type of professional i just cannot stress enough good service leads to a whole lot more business and that is how you grow your business exponentially through referrals and repeat business so that's number one number two for building your freelance business over the long term is leveraging a blog and by this i mean you need to be blogging regularly attach your blog to your website you need to be blogging regularly on issues important to your customer base one of the big mistakes a lot of people make with a blog is they start writing on things that they think are interesting the focus of your blog needs to be providing useful information to your customer base and this is something i see all the time like for example i have on our blog on our business for our business which deals primarily with software answers for law firms we have provided a lot of information about how law firms can be more efficient in their daytoday operations we've written a lot of information about how they can leverage different software applications in a law firm and so on so forth attorneys doing google searches on making their practices more efficient then land on those articles and they explore our blog further when they start to look at some of the solutions we provide they realize that they may need our services and they pick up the phone and call us so in other words by providing useful information to our customer base through a blog our customer base lands on our website they then turn and they in turn then call us so leveraging a blog that provides useful information to your customers is one of the best ways to get business and this winds up being incredibly time effective there are blog posts that i wrote three four five even in some instances even six years ago that are still yield still yielding phone calls to our business today so in other words a couple hours to write a blog post five years ago people are still calling us because we own it no one can take it away from us okay that is incredibly time effective in terms of going out and getting a business in addition to a blog another great source to leverage is youtube uh youtube is one of the most popu actually one of the most popular search engines in the world people go on youtube all the time looking for information if you're gonna do a youtube channel to drum up business the thing i cannot stress enough is just like with a blog provide information that is useful to people so again provide information that your potential customers are looking for so for example let's say you want to focus on websites for small businesses which is something we do in one of our businesses i'm just using this as an example i want to build websites for small businesses i start a youtube channel on it a lot of small businesses might be trying to do their own website say with wix or like wordpress or something like that and then they'll get frustrated with it and maybe decide to call a developer so what we can do in our business is do a youtube channel on how to's like here's how to do x in your wix website here's how to do why in your wordpress website and then those small businesses start to use our youtube channel as a resource to meet their needs and over time when they realize that wix and wordpress actually can't meet their meet their needs fully or their needs go beyond wix or wordpress they then turn around and call us because we're the people they've been getting information from this whole time so again providing useful information to people is the best way to leverage a youtube channel so doing these three things i've just talked about really again i can't stress enough allows you to build a brand it results in people coming to you instead of you going out hustling up work and it allows you to charge more for your work so while you're growing your business in the short term and while you're doing the things you need to do to get clients in the short term the things you need to be focusing on is making sure you're building a referral base and a repeat business base and you do that by providing the absolute highest levels of customer service meeting your deadlines and doing the things you say you're going to do you want to leverage a blog again while you're busy in your business you need to make sure you're setting aside time to blog and that you're writing on issues that are answering your clients questions addressing your clients concerns and providing the kind of information your potential clients are looking for you want to apply that same approach to the third thing which is a youtube channel and again providing value and usefulness to people is the best way to make sure that they are excuse me that they are potentially interested in calling you if you do these three things you start to see yourself as i said having a brand that in turn leads to more leads to much more money it also leads to you having much more time because you're not doing things like going to networking events and the other things that you have to do to get business in the short term so with all of that said let's move on to the next part of our video which is how to go about managing your business on a daytoday basis okay we're on to the part of our video where we're going to talk about managing your business on a daytoday basis and we're going to break that down into two parts first we're going to talk about managing your administrative tasks on a daytoday basis and by administrative tasks i mean anything that is not actually related to development things such as filing your businesses taxes doing your bookkeeping filing paperwork with your secretary of state so on so forth so managing those kinds of tasks and the second thing we'll talk about will be managing your substantive work on a daytoday basis and your substantive work is the actual development work and you want to make sure you're doing that in a way that yields as much profit as possible so we'll talk about administrative and substantive and how to make sure you're managing yourself now before we get into those two things the biggest point i want to stress is that it's time for you to start thinking of yourself as a business person it's really common for me to have conversations with selfemployed individuals who will say something like well i'm not a business person i'm a software developer or i'm not a business person i'm a real estate agent or i'm not a business person i'm an attorney or something like that once you start working for yourself if you take the attitude of you know i'm not a business person i'm an ex then you really don't need to worry about being a business person and i say that because you're going to be out of business so fast that the problem of being a business person will take care of itself and when i say that i don't mean it to sound to flip but it really is true and the people who succeed as freelance developers and essentially and eventually i should say grow their freelance business into a real business are the ones who understand that as soon as you strike out on your own whether you have one customer whether you're running microsoft you are now in business for yourself okay so you need to understand that things like working efficiently and dealing with your administrative tasks those aren't optional these are things you're going to have to do and you just don't have a choice in the matter anymore and that is a choice you made once you decided to strike out on your own so understand that you are a business person doing so will one allow you to stay in business and to allow you to make a lot more money so with all that said let's move on to how to manage your administrative affairs on a daytoday basis okay so we're going to talk about the importance of dealing with your business's administrative affairs on a daytoday basis and the reason i am talking about this first before i get into talking about how to manage your substantive work is that the administrative work is a crucial topic to address lots and lots and lots and a whole bunch of lots of businesses especially freelance developers get themselves in trouble not because they're bad at development or they service their customers poorly it's because they do a really bad job at their administrative work and then that creates problems down the road for example suppose just as a hypothetical you need to file a document with the secretary of state and you fail to do so and you're right in the middle of a coding project for somebody and because you didn't file that document to secretary of state six months later while you're in the middle of that coding project a notice shows up from the secretary of state saying you've lost your right to legally do business so now you need to put that coding project on hold and take a day or two to deal with uh your administrative snafu as a result of this you miss a deadline to the customer the customer is unhappy uh you know obviously the customer is never going to refer you anybody the customer is never going to uh you know come back to you again for more work and that's just a simple example of how not dealing with administrative tasks can get in the way of you doing your substantive work and i totally understand that it's not fun to do administrative tasks right it's not fun to you know fill out stuff for the secretary of state it's not fun to do your bookkeeping it's not fun to do those kinds of things that's not why you signed up for free code camp that's not why you became a software developer in the first place but unfortunately those things are part of the job and if you don't pay attention to them failing to complete those administrative tasks timely and to handle them correctly will lead to problems with your actual substantive business okay so this is why i'm talking about the administrative tasks first so the first administrative issue i'm going to talk about in the management of your business is the biggest one and that's your daytoday financial management i could do easily a very long video course on how to manage your freelance business from a financial standpoint and because it would be so long i'm not going to dive into all of it now what i'm going to do is suggest you read a book which i suggested earlier in this course and that book is called profit first what profit first does is it lays out a framework which can manage your businesses finances for you so in other words it puts a framework in place you follow the framework and your business's finances kind of manage themselves at that point and financial management is one of the biggest things where a lot of people get themselves into trouble one of the biggest things you want to avoid is what's called bank balance accounting and lots of small business owners are guilty of this where they go online they look at their bank account they see a balance you know on the screen and they just assume that's that's how much money they have without any thought of you know what they've got to be paying what's coming out of it and so on so forth following the methodology laid out in profit first can a help you avoid bank balance accounting but also just help you make sure that your business is staying on path and in addition to reading profit first just remember that your businesses bank account is not your personal bank account you just can't go rate it whenever you want some money what you want to do is set up a system where you're only allowed to take a certain amount of money out of the business at any given time and a certain amount of money has to stay in the business at a given time and the profit first book really does a good job of laying all that out for you so if you can avoid financial mismanagement you will avoid a lot of the problems that or i should say administrative problems that get freelance developers into trouble and what i would suggest to you as an easy to use method for making sure you are following good financial management habits for your business is to read profit first and follow it again it's not enough to read the book you actually have to follow the methodology it's laying out for you the second big part in addition to following a methodology like the one in profit first to making sure that your finances are managed properly is to do your accounting regularly this is so important i cannot stress it enough do your accounting regularly you should be using bookkeeping software like wave or quickbooks or something of the sort in our business we use wave and i see way way way way way too many small businesses that don't do their books until the end of the year or even worse at the end of the year they essentially just print off all their bank statements and dump it on an accountant and say okay here figure out how much money i made last year well not doing the books in your business on a regular basis means you never actually know if you're making money or not and if you are making money how much you're making and if you're losing money how much you're losing and then it becomes easy for you to think well it seems like i'm doing good well seem can be a very tricky thing and you can get yourself in a lot of trouble by going off of how things seem what you need is objective data in front of you in other words you need a monthly statement showing here's how much money my business took in here's how much went out here's how much i've made here's how much i lost you've got to do your books on a regular basis if you get up and the first thing every day before you start work just do your bookkeeping for the day before in other words download the prior days transactions and reconcile them in your accounting software then you get in the habit of doing that and your books are just done all the time and it doesn't take more than a few minutes a day when you're just starting out if you have very few transactions at a minimum do your books once a week or at worst once a month but do your books on a regular basis i cannot stress this enough that is the only way you're actually going to know how much money you're making or how much money you're losing and what you need to adjust another benefit of doing your books on a regular basis is it also helps you catch expenses you might not realize you've signed up for that you're still paying so do your books regularly so in terms of managing your finances read profit first follow the methods laid out in profit first avoid using your personal bank account or i'm sorry your business's bank account as a piggy bank you can't just rate it whenever you want and the fourth part of managing your finances is doing your books daily so that's keeping your finances in order which again is one of the biggest administrative problems that a lot of freelancers run into and in terms of the second aspect of your administrative problems or administrative tasks i should say that you've got to manage on a daytoday basis that is just really all the different things that come with being a small business person too having to file your business license every year if you're in a state that requires that two having to file any documentation you need to file with county sales tax boards let's say you'll find that as an entrepreneur there is an endless flow of paperwork that you need to fill out and you need to stay on top of it so the best thing to do is don't take the approach of i'll do this later when a piece of paper comes across your desk and you look at it and you say oh okay i have to file something with the secretary of state just deal with it on the spot don't let these things pile up okay letting these kinds of tasks pile up is another of the big mistakes i see from entrepreneurs and again they might find out they've lost the ability to do business legally because they've let these things pile up if you just deal with them as soon as they come up then they're done you don't have to worry about them they're just taken care of and they probably don't even take that long what takes a long time is when you let these things grow into a stack this high and then you have to stop everything you're doing and spend days if not weeks dealing with all that stuff so deal with your administrative tasks as they come up just treat them as a priority that has to be dealt with because by getting them out of the way you can focus on the substantive work more okay so deal with those things immediately after they arise that is just something it is so important and if you do that you will have an advantage over other freelancers so in short if you want to get a leg up in your new business you got you have to take your administrative test seriously you have to manage your finances appropriately which cut which entails everything we just talked about reading profit first following the methods in it not rating your bank account doing your books on a regular basis and you have to deal with your administrative tasks as soon as they come up and if you need help with them retain a business lawyer to help you okay but if you do those things you prevent your administrative tasks from getting in the way of your actual business and then you make more money so with all that said let's get on to our accounting and financial management course from aaron lear of kpi bookkeeping hey code campers my name is aaron lair i'm the owner of kpi bookkeeping and consulting and i'm excited to go over with you today how to manage your finances as a freelancer i know this isn't everyone's most exciting or favorite topic but it is so important if you can get off on the right step and create good habits you'll be so much more ahead of other freelancers as well as business owners because you will know your income your expenses you'll know how to manage them and you'll know what decisions to make and what changes to make within your freelancing business so i'm going to divide this up into three topics uh this first one's just going to be the real basics 101 second topic we're going to do a brief overview of your chart of accounts or your income and expense buckets and once you get inside your accounting software and then the third topic we're going to cover a profit and loss statement just kind of how to read it and what it looks like all right i hope you find this helpful and best of luck thanks okay so if there are just three things to do if you don't want to watch anything else past this just three things is number one keep your business and personal finances separate number two save at least 25 30 of your gross income and number three have an accounting software and actually use it so let's get back to number one um keeping your business finances separate um from your personal so this one is just if there's one thing you do just at least do this one this is huge it'll save you so much time so much of a headache and money when it comes to getting your taxes done and it's as simple as when you're ready to start freelancing go open your own business bank account checking business checking account and savings account and any business transactions you occur those all need to come out of that business account as well as if you need to get a credit card open a credit card just for your business expenses and then keep all of your personal expenses separate just like the way you've had them running through your own personal accounts this will be huge when it comes to tax time and you'll be able to separate the differences between your freelancing and business activities versus your personal activities number two save 25 to 30 percent of your gross income for taxes i know that sounds like a lot i know it sounds crazy but it's definitely something you need to do and i also think you really need to factor this in when you start to give quotes and create your pricing structures the government wants right off the bat 15.3 percent for selfemployment tax now that other 10 to 15 percent is just on the other income you receive so this is why you want to set up that savings account so as you get your business income coming into your business checking account i would say immediately or at least once a week take that income take that percentage of 25 to 30 percent and then dump that right into your savings account so you're into your business savings account so that is stored away tucked away for taxes and then when tax time comes there's no big surprises you've got the money you're good to go um so that is huge i think this one surprises a lot of people a lot of freelancers they don't realize how high selfemployment taxes and how much taxes will be taken out so do keep that in mind when you go to price when you create pricing structures and then number three have a accounting software and actually use it so i get a lot of clients that have accounting softwares they have things maybe synced up but they're not necessarily using it and i understand you get busy and if you can't use it or you don't know how then then reach out and get some help with it but when you go to select an accounting software i would get three major things one it can connect to your bank accounts and credit cards so these are typically gonna all be your cloudbased accounting um accounting software programs number two you can send your invoices from that platform or software whichever you choose and it has a pay now feature this will save you so much time and hassle as far as tracking your your invoices and then number two is you can pull a profitable loss report at minimum and profit law support ideally you'd like to be able to pull a balance sheet and a cash flow statement but you at least want to be able to pull a profit and loss report okay so let's move on to some accounting softwares um these are just a list of probably my top four the first two wave and freshbooks these are great for if you're just starting out they're very user friendly they've got a great interface on them um they're for the most part pretty intuitive i'm going to go over a little bit of things you need to to keep your eye on on the next video but these are great to just get started that you can invoice from them you can receive payments it'll track you can connect all your bank accounts and credit cards so these are great starters now if you you know let's say you want something you just want to stick with one and you want something that can grow with you those next two would be quickbooks online and xero these are great for more fullon businesses i mean you can still use them as a freelancer um these are more robust there's a lot more kind of going behind the scenes and i would say if you're just starting out they might have a little more too many more bells and whistles than you might need but that doesn't mean you can't use them you can still certainly use them you might want to get some training on those and even if you feel like you need to get training on the other two wave and fresh books i would definitely reach out and look for those but going back to quickbooks and xero these are great but again these will grow with you so you might not need these starting out you can certainly start in them but they're they will grow once you start having employees and you've got a lot more going on within your finances so this is just a brief overview um the next step or the next video we're going to get into is i'm going to kind of get into once you're in your accounting software what you really need to do and what you need to watch out for all right thanks let's move into your accounting software so you know how to get paid faster you know how to manage your receipts let's move into that accounting software and kind of get an idea of what we're looking at and what we're dealing with so just a warning this is a brief overview this is not going i'm not getting into any particular software so i do want to advise you that if you have questions reach out get help or get training from someone or take a course if you feel like you need to kind of get a better grip on this because if you start this out right it'll be much easier for you in the long run okay let's get started so what we're looking at right here is what's called a chart of accounts i'm going to just refer to these as income and expense buckets but these are chart of accounts a lot of these are going to be preloaded in your accounting software i will attach a pdf of this into this program but i want you to take a good look at the types so we've got income you can call this income or client sales or services that's going to be a revenue type any kind of expenses such as insurance or office supplies or rent those are all going to be expenses so as i said these will be already most of these a lot of some of them will be loaded in your accounting software you can change the names of them you can add more to them but as you start to do that use this as a guide as to what kind of type what one put a name on it whatever name you want and then you're going to use the type of account it's going to be and you can put it you can put a description in it's not a have to but this is very important because this type is going to tie to all your reports so depending on the type that will tie to your whether it falls on the p l the profit and loss report the balance sheet or the cash flow statement most of the time they're either going to just fall on the profit and loss or the balance sheet um so these are general expenses this is revenue um let's go to this next page okay so right here on owner's contribution or owner's pay this is labeled as equity this type is called equity and the reason for that is because this is not an income event so if you were to add money which would be owner's contribution add money into your business account that would be considered you're adding equity into your account if you were to take money out or to pay for any kind of personal expenses from your business account i don't recommend doing that on a daily basis or on a regular basis but if you made a slip up and you accidentally had an amazon account that got charged to your business account but it was a personal amazon purchase you could take that amount and code it to personal expenses or owner's pay um and those would not be that would not be considered an expense because you're it's the equity out of out of the money out of your business account these others right here some of these are kind of accounts that are working in the background so as you put in an invoice that accounting software is automatically going to code that invoice under the type accounts receivable because you're waiting for that money to come in you're waiting for it to be received to you accounts payable any kind of bills you owe if you go in and put a bill in but you haven't paid it yet and this isn't a necessary way of doing this you can certainly do it that way it definitely helps with your cash flow but if you're just paying your expenses as they come that's fine too but if you do decide to put your bills in and then pay later that would be an accounts payable and that will be labeled as accounts payable and that kind of automatically happens in the background of your accounting system um if you have any loans that's going to be a liability any taxes now taxes can be both a liability or an expense that's something you probably need to talk to your accountant to as far as how you're managing your filing and when you're filing your taxes that makes a big difference any large pieces of equipment are going to be considered assets and then retained earnings so retained earnings is any money that you made from the previous year so let's say at the end of your p l you had a positive of ten thousand dollars on december 31st of 2018 so come january 1st of 2019 that 10 000 is now going to move into retained earnings and now that p l will essentially start at zero so again use this as a guide um i will have a pdf of this and when you get into your your accounting software you're going to want to create these buckets or name them and like i said a lot of them will already be present um but use this as a guide to make sure you've got the right type so then your reports are correct as well okay um i have a weekly checklist a monthly checklist and a quarterly checklist so weekly you want to review your outstanding invoices and make any followup calls as needed you want to make sure you're organizing your receipts sort your bank transactions in your within your accounting software that's taking all those income and expenses and sorting them into those buckets we just talked about pay any bills and don't forget to pay yourself you can pay yourself monthly if you want to do it that way weekly if you have a good client flow it's not bad to pay yourself weekly because it kind of just helps you stay on track and helps you know your cash flow a little better monthly you want to reconcile your bank and credit cards this is so important i could create a whole other video on this i'm not going to but i suggest you really look into doing this is reconciling those banking credit card accounts against your bank statements and your credit card statements is like a big double check of what's going on within your accounting programs um review your profit and loss review your income i'm sorry review your expenses and subscriptions sub subscription creep is real i've seen it a lot so make sure you stay on top of those subscriptions and you know what you're using and ditch any of the ones you are not using and then after you review all that get a good idea of your cash flow once you kind of get a good grip of your expenses you'll really start to know what your cash flow situation will be like as well as staying on top of those invoices any overpaid invoices so quarterly you want to make sure you pay your quarterly taxes you want to review those pricing structures and then another one that i have not mentioned that's pretty important is make sure all your clients have a w9 from you so any client that you pay or i'm sorry that you invoice over six hundred dollars they should be requesting a double knight excuse me a w9 from you um if they do not be prepared they may be requesting it around mid to in january that's when we have to file those w9 so keep that in mind if on my next point if you ask for any help or you get any 1099 contractors to help you out you need to ask them for a w9 and it's just a onesheet irs document that basically just says you're an independent contractor um you can look it up google w9 and it's one of the first two or three things to pop up in google um you need that as well and you as if you hire any 1099 contractors you need to make sure you file those typically it's the last week of january i'm not going to be a specific date because the dates change every year around the last five days of january those need to be filed they're very easy to file it's 1099 filings is what they're called um so be prepared you're going to get asked that from your clients and if you happen to need to get any help with coding or design work for a client that you're working on you you need to make sure they hand you a w9 as well all right that should wrap up your checklist let's dive into the p l all right you've made it we're not at our last video um so i'm going to talk about the profit and loss on this one and hopefully this will kind of wrap up everything and help you understand why it's important to do good financials and really pay attention to those income and expense buckets okay so let's get started okay so as you'll see on the left there is a profit and loss example of a profit loss statement i have blocked out the names any dates anything that could possibly reveal whose profit and loss this is so let me just start off with saying why you want to run a profit and loss i think we all want to do what we love doing and i'm assuming you love being coders but i also think we all need to know how much money we're making and a profit and loss is going to tell you that it's going to take your income minus all your expenses and then tell you what is left over and the more you focus on this the more you're going to be able to realize what changes you need to make maybe what kind of pivots you need to make with pricing maybe where you can cut back on expenses where you could actually add more in expenses so a profit loss is very important in terms of giving you a snapshot of where you are and you can pull a profit and loss on a weekly basis on a monthly basis quarterly yearly it'll just tell you exactly how much money you've brought in and how much you've brought out this will help with cash flow i'm not going to tell you this is the best report i'm going to tell you that a cash flow statement is a best report for cash flow but for just getting started this will give you an idea at least on your expenses what you could expect each month or even each week so this is why it's important to have an accounting software that will provide a profit and loss statement for you i also suggest in terms of getting overall health of your business and trying to make business decisions just is pulling a balance sheet and a cash flow statement and if you don't understand those to have someone help you understand those and make uh decisions moving forward anyway that's my soapbox let's get started on the profit and loss so profit loss you're going to have top line is going to be on your income you might have different income types client services client design work client code work however you want to do that but that is going to go back to those revenue buckets so that's why back in the other video when i talked about the buckets that's what's forming this p l in the background okay so you're gonna see revenue slash income and expenses so that's why that's important to make sure those types back on the previous video are correct so all of that information lands on the right report okay so you've got your income cost of goods and i'll get to this in just a minute and then your general business expenses so cost of goods is going to be if you have any kind of product that you have to purchase and then you sell that product to your client that is going to be your cost of goods sold i don't think most of you will incur any of this if you're just doing servicebased business you're producing websites and codes and apps and things like that you really shouldn't have any cost of goods but that's just what that is here for um so you'll have top line income cost of goods and now you have a gross profit and then from that gross profit these are going to be your general expenses your rent your phone your internet your insurance anything that you incur on a regular basis or any kind of business doesn't have to be regular basis any kind of business expense and then that at the bottom that will give you your net operating income so this is going to tell you this 8 000 and 99.38 is going to tell you how much money you brought in in that given time period whatever given time period you selected okay so profit and loss statement should only have your business related expenses income and expenses um in terms of what it should not have i'm going to jump back to that interest expense in just a minute but i'll go ahead and i'm going to go ahead and jump to the loan payment first so if you have a loan a loan payment is a little interesting in the fact that you have to have you kind of have to split that payment and you put the principal amount to a liability account and the interest amount can be on an expense account and you can see that loan interest amount on the profit and loss but the principal amount is on the balance sheet i know that's a little confusing if you have any loans i would suggest getting help setting that up once you get it set up it's not that hard to manage but that's just something that i see a lot of mistakes made so bottom line is don't put the entire loan amount on the profit and loss statement it is not an expense it's kind of a mix of an expense and a liability i'll leave it at that for now i don't want to get too far in the weeds with that um profit laws should not have your owner's pay so again this goes back to that previous video about how the owners pay is equity anything equity related will be on a balance sheet so if you want to pull up your running owner's payout or running owner's contribution you will find that on your balance sheet as long as it's coded to equity mileage is not on a p l i get that question asked quite a bit you can't really put that on a profit and loss you can track it i would suggest using mile iq but you cannot really put it on them on a profit loss so if you have mileage if you are running from client to client track that mileage and turn that into your tax accountant and then bottom line is any expenses that you do not feel confident in justifying to the irs should not be on your profit and loss period so if you i get a lot of clients that try to want to put their kids soccer club in their business they want to expense that out because they want to call it networking or they want to put their botox so they want to put every amazon charge they've ever had to their profit and loss and label it as office expenses i'm never going to tell clients what to do but i will tell you this is you always want to feel confident and if you were to ever to face an audit which i ever hope you do not have to do but if you ever have to face an audit that you can comfortably and confidently say that it was a business expense here's my receipt and here's my invoice so just keep that in the back your mind if you ever in question on i don't know if it's a businessman's i don't know if it's personal i don't know how to code this just keep that in the back of your mind and then one other item that depending on how you have your books set up is any kind of what they call bad debt so if you have any lingering invoices let's say they're six months old or old or a year or even more that you

daytoday basis okay so it's time to start talking about how you're going to manage your substantive work on a daytoday basis and by substantive work i mean the actual dev work which is the whole reason you started free code camp and got into being a developer in the first place and managing your deb work appropriately daily will allow you to maximize your profits and proper management of your daytoday activities really focuses on two things first is the fact that you have to put in the time in other words you know you have to put the time into your business you have to go to work you would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs don't even put in a 40hour work week and the second thing is you have to make sure you're working efficiently and why do i say that both of these are important putting in the time and working efficiently think of it like this suppose you go to work and i go to work and you're 25 more efficient than i am and you work 30 hours a week and i work 40 hours a week well if you're 25 more efficient than me then in 30 hours a week you will accomplish what takes me 37 and a half hours but because i went to work for 40 hours in a week i'm going to accomplish more than you and because i'm going to accomplish more than you i'm going to make more money so with that being said if you and i both go to work for 40 hours and you're 25 percent more import or efficient than i am then in 40 hours you will accomplish what takes me 50 hours so this is why if you can work efficiently and put in the time you will make an astronomical amount of profits compared to what you would make otherwise now i think it's important to stress these things because you would be surprised at how many people don't put in 40 hours a week into their business so just as an example if you're going to work and you're not uh you know keeping track of your time which a lot of selfemployed people don't it can be easy to feel like oh man i worked a lot today when again at the end of the day you're really not putting in as much time as you thought you did right so making sure you're putting in the time and tracking the time is rule number one so let's start by looking at that and then let's look at what you need to do in terms of making sure you're working efficiently and we'll give some tips for improved efficiency okay so the first part of being successful on a daytoday basis is putting in the time when it comes to your business and putting in the time means that you've got a certain number of hours that you're going to work and that is just going to be a minimum that you're going to work every week there may be some weeks where you have to work more right because you may have a deadline you have to meet a project may be taking longer than expected and you have to work over to meet that deadline or something of that nature but the crucial part is to pick a number of hours you are going to work every week and make sure you put in those hours so in other words let's say you're you're going to work 40 hours a week at your business you get all your development work done in let's just say 30 hours then that means you've got 10 hours left that you need to be devoting to marketing your business you know that's you use that extra 10 hours to write blog posts make youtube videos uh go to networking events things of that nature so again set a number of hours that you're going to work every week and make sure you are putting in those hours and there is always something for you to be doing so there's are what there are ways for you to make sure you meet those hours me personally in my business i'm i put in a minimum of 43.3 hours every week and when i tell people that number sometimes i get weird looks because 43.3 is obviously not a round number where i came up with that is the fact that by working an extra 3.3 hours per week i wind up accomplishing in 12 months what would take someone working 40 hours a week 13 months in other words 3.3 hours more a week adds one more working month to my year and i find that combining that with trying to work efficiently really increases the amount i produce over a year over the course of a year i should say and as a result my income goes up so pick a number that you're going to put into your business and make sure you stick with it again if you don't have work to if you don't have development work to do put that extra time into marketing your business now it's really important that you do this in a way so that you avoid burnout let's say you decide you're going to work 45 hours in a week you know on average okay and then let's say you have a week where you work 47 well that means you can go ahead and take off two hours in another week and still be averaging 45 so in other words when i say i work 43.3 hours a week over the course of a year i make sure i average 43.3 some weeks i might work more some weeks i might work less if deadlines make me work more one week the next week i might take some time off or things of that sort so pick a number and stick with it and make sure that you put the time into something trust me there will always be something you can be doing in your business i cannot begin to tell you how many entrepreneurs i see who don't don't essentially know how much they work in a week like if you were to ask them how many hours do you require that you work in a week they don't have a number which i can understand someone saying they don't know how many hours they work in a week as a required number but then they also don't have for example set times of when they start work in the morning they don't have set times of when they go home they don't have set vacation schedules or requirements or anything like that so think of it like this those entrepreneurs don't get to work at any particular time just they just get to work whenever they feel like it they leave whenever they feel like it at the end of the week they're not making sure they've worked a certain number of hours and they just take vacation time whenever they want and people wonder why so many small businesses fail well one of the reasons why so many small businesses fail is just to be frank people who start up their own business don't put in the time so pick a number of hours stick with it and then make sure you're meeting those requirements and if you do that this may sound really simple but you will be ahead of a lot of your competition because your competition is just not going to put in the time it's just not going to happen put in the time for your business and you increase your chances of success just exponentially i can't stress that enough if you fail there's pretty good chances because you weren't putting in the time so again if you're going to make a fulltime if you've decided to make your new development business a fulltime job my suggestion is actually put your hour requirement a little bit over 40 hours because 40 hours is considered a normal work week right so challenge yourself a little bit do a little bit more again i get an extra month a year only by doing an extra 3.3 hours a week if you say 3.3 hours a week sounds like a lot ask yourself how much time do you spend looking at facebook how much time you spend you know watching television i mean how much time do you spend you know engaging in other you know like idle activities just cut out a few of those things and make sure you're putting the time into growing your business and then if when you combine those hours with high efficiency you'll produce so much that so many people are going to look at you and go how did that person produce all that they just won't understand it and they and you will understand it was a function of the time you put in plus the efficiency so pick a number of hours and stick with it and hold yourself to it show some discipline you know get your work ethic in and put put in that work ethic and you will succeed so with all that being said now let's take a dive into how you can actually make sure that those hours are going to be working are going to be spent doing something efficient okay in our last segment we talked about the need to put in the hours when it comes to your freelance business but now let's talk about how you can be productive when you're putting in those hours it's i'm going to talk about this because it's really important to remember that putting in time it does not necessarily equal getting stuff done um i've seen plenty of situations where someone might actually spend literally 14 15 16 hours a day at work and leave the day leave at the end of the day accomplishing virtually nothing i actually know of entrepreneurs who and i feel bad for them literally work 16 hours a day probably six to seven days a week and are just so inefficient in terms of how they go about their day that they accomplish probably what an efficient person would accomplish in a 30 hour work week so if you take putting in the time and combine it with efficiency that's how you become productive and that's how you make more money so the thing i can't stress to you enough again is you got to put in the time but don't think simply because you're putting in the time that you're being productive you have to put in the time but you also have to be efficient in your use of that time in other words you need to produce a lot per hour so think of it like this let's say you put in a lot of time let's say you put in 50 hours a week and now let's say you're twice as productive as somebody else that means in other words that you get twice done in an hour what someone else gets done in an hour which there are people that inefficient so there will be people that you're doubling their productivity if you put in 50 hours you're twice as productive as somebody else they have to go to work for 100 hours to you know accomplish uh you know what you did in 50 and if they're only working a 40 hour work week it takes them two and a half weeks to accomplish what you accomplish in one work week and that's how you make a lot more money you know as a freelancer as a selfemployed developer so again just simply going to work does not mean you're getting stuff done you have to be efficient in your use of time so let's look at a few pointers and again these are just a few this is by no means an exhaustive list let's look at a few examples in terms of how you can be more efficient with the use of your time number one is what i call the ohio method ohio stands for only handle at once i'll talk about what this means in a minute number two focus on completing one thing at a time don't always have nine different projects that you're trying to complete simultaneously number three when problems come up deal with them immediately and number four is going to be improved management of communications and by this i mean things like email text messages so on so forth if nothing else if you nail those four areas you will be working so much more efficiently than so many people out there that at the end of the work week people will just wonder how you got so much done and the answer to how you got so much done will be you didn't let time just waste away to and get lost to inefficiency all right so let's look at each of the things i just mentioned in term number one the ohio method ohio this stands for only handle at once and this concept applies to anything whether it's an email whether it's a piece of paper sitting on your desk um you know an issue that comes up or anything don't deal with issues more than once so think of it like this a piece of paper comes in you open it open up the letter it's something from the secretary of state saying you've got to file something to renew your business license well don't just set it over here because as soon as you do that now then when you decide to deal with it later you've got to pick it up and read it again which means you took the time to read it when you first opened it and then you took the time to read it uh when you deal with it the second time so you're reading the thing twice instead of once right so when as soon as you pick up a piece of paper deal with it and under that scenario envelope comes in i open it i read it it's from the secretary of state's office saying hey you've got to renew your business license i'm immediately going to put this down i'm going to go online i'm going to renew my business license it's done i only touched that piece of paper once in other words i only handled it once think of how many times in your life have you opened an email read the email and then said i'll deal with this later right well then when you go to deal with it later you have to read the email again which again you just read the email twice so imagine if you could cut your time spent reading email in half right so only handle it once applies to anything from a piece of administrative paperwork to emails to you name it anything that comes across your desk only handle it one time now this can be something that can be like very for lack of a better word difficult for people to implement because it's really easy for something to come in and you look at it and go i don't have time to deal with this and you said it over here then you don't have time to deal with the next thing you set it over here you don't have time to deal with the next thing then like you set it over here and then you go to work on something and you work all day and like you finish that okay but then later on when you look at these again i don't have time to deal with this so you move it back over here next thing you know you've just moved the same pile of papers back and forth five times and think of all that time you've wasted and you felt busy but all you were doing was moving those papers back and forth which is again a massive massive waste of time so you've got to be disciplined in the sense that you're not going to pick something up unless you're prepared to deal with it and then when you do deal with it or i should say when you do pick it up you do deal with it that's something again it can be easy to go i don't have time for this you don't have time not to do things that way your time is so precious you have to get things handled once and only once okay so follow the ohio method that's rule number one only handle it once rule number two is focus on one thing at a time and by this i'm talking about in your development work you need to have one project finish it move on to the next project finish it move on to the next project finish it so like with us for example like let's say we've got i'm making up a number let's say we've got four clients we're building websites for the you know i don't work on client number one a little bit one day work on client number two a little bit of that day same day work on client three a little bit because all you've ever got that way is a little bit of each thing done and the reason that's bad is it requires a lot of mental energy to switch from one project to the next to the next and so you're constantly like getting an efficiency drain by switching projects like that instead what we do let's say we have four websites we're working on we finish the first one we work on it we finish it done out the door then we work on the second one finish it out the door third one finish it out the door so on so forth and if somebody calls and wants a project we tell them okay you're number five in line and we adjust the delivery date accordingly when they ask when can we have it by we give them an honest delivery date because we say we've got four people ahead of you you know just to give an example so don't jump from project to project and as you get busy you're going to have two three four and more projects under contract that you know you're going to be working on get one done then move on to the next one get it done then move on to the next one get it done and so on and so on and so on and if you've got a bunch of projects already lined up to do and somebody calls you wanting more work be honest with them about a delivery date say i've got this many ahead of you and here here's what comes next all right so one thing at a time and it again saves you all that mental energy of switching from project to project to project which is just a huge you know efficiency drain at the end of the day number three when problems come up deal with them immediately and here's what i mean by this is uh it's really easy for you know some for something to come up and then for you to say okay i'll deal with this a little later well if it's a problem and you put it off until later the problem only gets bigger the problem compounds so now it becomes a bigger issue to deal with and that can become a bigger issue to deal with in terms of money it can become a bigger issue to deal with in terms of time it can become a bigger issue to deal with in terms of you know other things so let me let me give you an example easy example i like to use something comes in from the secretary of state saying you've got to send a piece of paper in to renew your business license and things fall through the cracks and it doesn't get done so now you're late sending in your business license you get a notice from the secretary of state saying um you know you are now going to have to pay an extra 100 for your business license that's a problem a problem has just arisen you now have to get your business license renewed and there's an extra amount um associated with it by dealing with things as soon as you get them then bam they're taken care of right uh you know if you get an unhappy customer get them on the phone right away get it dealt with you're like right away if you see things in your business that seem like they're causing an efficiency eliminate them on the spot don't say oh man we really got to clean up that process no eliminate them right there on the spot don't let them cost you more time as things go on when problems come up get them dealt with and get them dealt with on the spot i cannot stress that enough number four is your management of communications and this is a big one communications are one of the biggest things that can make you feel busy even though you're not actually producing anything all right so let's look at the two ways that you can manage your communications in a way that will greatly and i do mean greatly greatly greatly uh increase your productivity all right and the first thing you can do in managing your communications is avoid realtime communication platforms like slack uh google hangouts and and things of that nature where it's more of a chat than it is um you know like a formal message it's really easy like on a service like slack for example to constantly see messages coming through and then when someone gets a message others are prompted to respond and so on so forth and you wind up having a much higher message volume than you would through a medium such as email and the thing is number one every time you get one of those messages you become highly distracted and it gets hard to get back to what you were doing and you get into a workflow and number two the overwhelming majority of those messages you're getting through a realtime service such as slack aren't actionable anyway they're just noise okay so you're basically filling your day with noise which makes you feel busy but again you don't actually produce anything avoid realtime communications altogether i cannot stress that enough we do not use them in our businesses we don't use slack we don't use google hangouts we don't use any of those things and on the subject of communications manage your email properly so and what i mean by that is go through your email one to two times a day or however often you feel is appropriate but set aside set times that you're going to go through your email and avoid your email during all other times think of it like this you sit down you open your inbox you get a message from a client you respond to it client responds back you respond to it again client responds back you respond again client response back okay that's three or four emails from the client you had to read and that's three or four responses you've had to write now we all know a lot of people use email in a way where as soon as a thought enters their head they gotta fire off an email to somebody about it right if you say i'm only gonna go through my email once a day and that's it so like let's say for example you're gonna go through your email at three in the afternoon from three to four you're gonna clear your email when you get up and or get to work i should say in the morning you've got one one email in your inbox from joe client during the course of the day joe sends you three or four more emails well now at you know three or four in the afternoon when you're gonna go through your email you can read all four or five emails joe sent you at one time and then you can send them a consolidated response to all of them right so in other words you get to type one response as opposed to typing three or four or five individual responses that becomes a huge time saver and the other thing is you actually have less email to read by following that approach because if joe is going to email you three four or five times during the day anyway if you're responding to each of those then he's likely to respond to your responses so you go from getting four or five emails in a day from joe to getting 15 right so you greatly reduce the number of emails you have to read by going through your email once a day or twice a day and but again leaving your inbox closed at all other times or if it's not going to be closed at least not responding so set aside set times that you're going to respond to email and then go through it using the ohio method which we discussed a minute ago so if an email asks you for something don't just respond and say i'll get back to you on that respond with what the email actually asks for and only go through that inbox once a day and you will be surprised at how much less time you spend than your competitors going through email so let's put together everything we just talked about let's say your competitor does not follow the only handle at once method which was number one which means your competitors that work 40 hours a week and they probably spend 10 hours just moving the same stack of paper back and forth like we talked about right so number one they don't follow the ohio method so how much time are they losing there number two your competitors jumping between projects all the time which means they don't produce as much right so let's say they lose you know an hour a day moving the paper back and forth by not using the ohio method let's say they lose 30 minutes of productivity a day by jumping from project to project now they've lost an hour and a half of productivity you know a day let's say they don't deal problems immediately and as a result the problems become more time consuming later let's add 15 minutes or up to an hour and 45 minutes a day now let's suppose that due to inefficient communication practices which is what we just talked about with realtime communication services and email let's say they lose another two hours a day in an eight hour day we've just lost probably three to four hours three hours 45 minutes for you so call it three to four hours to essentially inefficiency so if you go to work for eight hours and that person goes to work for eight hours and they're losing let's say four hours of their their data inefficiency and you're not you're gonna produce twice as much as they are in an hour day which means you're going to make twice as much money as they do working the same amount of hours now combine that with the last section of our video where we talked about the need to put in a few extra hours and combine that extra productivity with those extra hours and actually know your income shoots through the roof right so again time but also productivity so focus on the tips we've just talked about in this and you are going to be fine so and you will actually see your income go up substantially well this is going to wrap up our course on how to succeed as a freelance developer i hope you found this helpful
