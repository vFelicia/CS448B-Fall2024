hey everybody it's Jesse and site is almost ready to launch today is going to be probably the most random video I've done because I'm just trying to handle a few changes that came in just today just clean up a couple of things that I noticed when I was testing so I don't know if this ever happens to you but sometimes things just come up at the last minute so we got to try to try to get them fixed you can see my my Trello board here you got a lot of stuff in the done Colin have some things in the to do column still and a lot of these are colorcoded now the kind of dark grey color means they're on hold they won't make it in before launch the yellow I don't even remember what I named these on hold okay so the grey is the dark grey is if time allows which at this point we don't have time so they're all going to be after and then the other ones are on hold for for some some other reason maybe I just haven't made up my mind about whether I want to actually do them or not so most of these things in this column at this point are not making it in so the only column we have to worry about or this one in this one the last thing here is the point to domain to the server so obviously once that happens the site is launched everybody guessing people saying hi in the in the live chat and I am still sick so yesterday I was sick today I am even more sick than I was yesterday so I apologize in advance if I'm a little bit all over the place the truth I've been having trouble focusing today I I keep forgetting to reset my Pomodoro timer and so it's just been weird so I'm trying to have some take some energy drinks and things like that just try to stay awake and be alert enough to do this so you all helped me out today if you see me doing making some crazy mistake please call me out on it Thanks unless I get well soon thanks hopefully I will hopefully after the site launch this I won't be working crazy hours yesterday when I left yesterday I had already put in a whole week's worth of time according to my normal work week and it was only Wednesday so that's probably not helping my illness that I'm working all the time but yeah so after today today might be late again but after today I should be able to relax a little bit and hang out with my family all right so let me tell you what I was working on you got me right in the middle of a Pomodoro session so I tied my thing so I have about 6 minutes left in this session I'm working on this adding a hover effect to the menu so one of the changes that was requested let me bring this over so I can show you one of the changes that was requested was to let me bring this over because only that at some point I was will bring it over now was to add a hover effect to the menu so before we had nothing nothing happened when you hovered now I have a little hover but here's the problem there's always a problem this seems like oh this would be so easy so there are several problems one was the way I had set this up these allies they didn't actually cover like the whole height of this so when you hover it was just this tiny little rectangle that make getting colored so I tried to change that up a little bit so I got that it was basically editing some line Heights and padding not really big deal which is kind of annoying tedious stuff so I got that sorted and now I have this issue so right now this this works right it looks okay it works but when I scroll down it no longer works so uh luckily I remembered what was going on with this menu so I know why it's doing that so let me show you I need to make this bigger sure that you'll probably can't see this so basically what happens with this menu I away too many things open let's just close something though but all we really need is is sticking out and app dog is and and the styles okay so basically what I tried to do was use this JSX style thing I don't even remember what it's called officially um it's part of next well it comes packaged with next I think it's just JSX or CSS and JSX something like that but basically it lets you write write in your component if you can see here you can write all the styles so it gets applied here but it's scoped so this this is locally scoped to this component so these styles won't like lead out on anything else on the page which is really cool you can make a selfcontained component and assuming you're not overriding anything with your other style sheets you can actually just leave it named you know whatever you want so I just you know I just put ul here because I know it will only affect this ul I don't have to worry about putting a long string of like I did here which is the only reason how to do this is because I was already using it like this in the main stylesheet and I don't have time to go through and clean that up yet I'm sure if you work with CSS reading like the time you know how this is that at some point it's just easier to to do this than to try to find where everything is especially when you're short on time but really what will happen is once I if I can get all the styles moved into here then I can just take it out of the main style sheet that will be fine but here's the problem whenever let me go in the JavaScript to show what we're doing with a stick enough so if you can follow along here we're actually cloning so this long string of jQuery things is actually cloning that menu so let's go back and see so when I scroll down the original menu has now just been hidden you can actually see a little bit because the the Styles change you see the padding changes slightly in the hover is gone that original menu gets hidden in a new menu that had been made and hidden originally that had been cloned is there so this is an entirely new menu that was created on the page look or at least whenever that function got called which in our case isn't necessarily the page load it could just be the navigation and it's a clientside navigation so there is no page load so we initialize that and component did mount if you're not familiar with react you probably just didn't follow what I said don't worry about it check out some of my previous videos and I explained it a little bit better or or check out the documentation on component amount so of course all this that I did here that I was trying to do things the right way the react way this doesn't work because this is locally scoped to this this particular component that component is already on the page with all the styles ready before the clone one is even made so I have to go back now to the main stylesheet and edit this anyway which if I had been lazy to begin with I would have done it this way to start so now I have to choose this foot so just small annoyances then I mean I'm going to check the live chat again depending on how many people are watching I may just keep the live chat going for longer than normal because I mean I'm going to be here until the site launches I'm not I'm not going anywhere I may have some interruptions just some other people that are working on content for the site my boss so I may take have some breaks but there's a lot of there are people watching and you think it's it's useful then I'll keep going for a while I think it would be cool to keep going to actually launch and we can see it hopefully it it doesn't break in front of everyone but but that's that's the plan and it will help me to stay focused and awake if I talk to you all while I'm doing it and Mike so my timer just went up for my Pomodoro session so I'm not going to restart it right now we're just I think I can get this done in about five minutes and we'll just count that as one session since I I just talked for the last six minutes okay so we're looking for bottom nav and let me go back to dev tools and Sewer that alright so looking for line 380 okay so here we are alive 380 so the first thing I need to do is grab this and make it a hover and this all the indentation is crazy because this was a personally written in SAS and then compiled so this is not normally how I indent everything this is just how it comes out from the compiler and then I'm just working in the CSS right now because I set up the compiler to compile sass so normally I guess I would set everything up alright so we need to add a hover on here and let's grab this all we did was just change the background color and there we go and so this is just our main menu color and then I just I think this is the light property I'm I really don't know that much about color formats but I just changed this to make it a little darker alright so now I guess we could take this out because I mean I would like to have it in here but because it clones it there's it's never really going to work unless I come it I don't know maybe it I could rework it but I don't think it's going to work so now we need these scale bottom now if you ll I a so let's add in these styles so you see at this at this point this is not super difficult we're just it's just a matter of finding where this is making sure we we're getting the proper cascading so we're not do anything special like I said changing my and I change in the padding we added a little a little transition effect I recommend adding a transition every time you're doing something like like a hover or some type of change it makes it look so much more smooth otherwise you get this really kind of abrupt change and it's just kind of jarring doesn't look as nice I that's fine bottom now view oli line height padding actually we can replace both of these padding things I don't know I had to there I never cleaned it up so as I've been going along I've been trying to get rid of as much as I can over here in the main style sheet and put it all into the components it's kind of easier to do it as you go along at some point I'll probably have to just go back and make like a deliberate effort to go through and move them all in but that can come later and then finally we have on the UL we just change this margin and now we can get rid of this completely let's make sure we don't have any inline styles and we don't okay so this should work now I'm going to save this and this let's go back over here and I'm gonna refresh because the the hot module reloading doesn't work on my stylesheet it just works when I update components all right so this still works good and now this works now um it does it kind of looks a little bit squished like I want more padding up here let's let's do that I'll do that now that's kind of thing that I probably won't remember to do it'll just slip through the cracks let me actually I just heard some some messages come in from my boss okay okay he's got some images for me to put on the site there was there are still a lot of images from like the old old original site that just wouldn't were they most of them just weren't big enough where they had the wrong dimensions for what we're doing with this site so my boss just said he has some images he asked if he could upload them on it on his own but I don't really have kind of like the content management system for the site is WordPress but I don't have everything linked up so to save time I've actually been hardcoding some of the sections basically the sections that you know there's not a lot to them and they're not really likely to change I'm just hard coding for now and then I'll make custom post types and WordPress so that other people can edit things on the site without having to get on the server or edit any code but at this point the sections that he has images for I don't have connected in through the WordPress API I didn't make post types form yet so I guess we'll be uploading some images here soon once he sends them over okay some of you guys are asking some questions about JavaScript libraries yeah okay so I'm using my like framework is materialized so it's a material design it's like bootstrap but with material design so it comes with JavaScript and CSS and it requires jQuery so that's why jQuery is in here normally um normally you wouldn't you wouldn't want to use jQuery with react and I went over that in more depth I think in my like two days ago in my live stream so but we are using it so there's just a few things you have to do to make that work and there was one other question let me see Oh someone wants to know the Chrome extensions that you're using um am I using what am i using in chrome uh this one let's see this is WP sniffer it tells me if it's a WordPress theme this one is live reload right is it your browser sync this is live reload okay and that works with like what I'm using gulp I think maybe I don't even know if I use this one anymore be honest with you that might have been left over from when I use grunt on the time ago JSON format err so this is this one um is how I get the JSON to look really pretty like that instead of like this which is pretty unreadable most of this is Google's Google Drive application launcher which I had pretty much never use on right there LastPass saves all my passwords and stuff definitely recommend that super useful wocket time keeps track of all the time I spent in my editor and in my in my browser and then every week it sends me an email and tells me like how much time I spent writing CSS on this time I spent writing JavaScript HTML unless time did I spend in chrome so it's kind of cool to go back and track things this is really useful this one I don't remember what is cooked but it tells me what this site is built with what is this tampermonkey lets me do custom scripts that I can run on certain URLs that's why my github is black this one lets me know if there's a retired jazz if there are vulnerabilities in any of the JavaScript libraries that are being used usually jQuery always comes up on there I'm not sure most jquery versions it seems like have some type of vulnerability and fullcontact for gmail this just tells me when somebody emails me it has links like automatically gradually to their social media profiles so i can check them out okay another change all right so I just got another change from my boss he says the whole behind the titles need to be more opaque okay that's going to be an easy change so we will do that but first let's look sort this padding out I said this is going to be forgotten easily and it almost was so I want to try to do this in a way let me bring my dev tools over all right my dad tools are super small let's bring this up a little bit I'm gonna bring it up too much because it's going to mess up how this looks as well I think this did I know it didn't awesome I thought it was going to make this guy get bigger too but it didn't so alright so I want to try to do this in a way that I don't have to edit everything all over again so let's see if we can make that happen let's go right to the a since that's what's getting Harvard if we can increase the line height maybe let's just check up the ladder a little bit and see what happened okay alright well that kind of did what we wanted but we didn't quite get let's see didn't quite get what we wanted let's check these allies let's see if that did anything I don't think it did my night 1614 yeah let's make them the same just to check but I don't think it did what we wanted no it did not let's try it on the UL increase the margins that's not what I want this is what I was afraid of more complicated we thought let me refresh it I can just reset back to what we had originally yes somebody in the light I remembered with that Chrome extension was this one that tells me um wet lap eliezer yeah super helpful I always seem really smart whenever someone was talking about a site and I tell him like exactly what it was made out of made from and I think people usually think I can look at the code and tell that you can't sometimes but I normally just use this plugin all right so my boss is knocking on the door I will be back in a minute this is the same thing in the worst ways sorry so sorry again that text yeah pretty mean you know how or who can do like the yeah so on about the images for the forbidden no no sections looks like a vertical image also some of the text is tall now changes to this may not be well yeah depends on the bright so no there be places where it could be like tall image on the desktop and just something that happens later on the desktop horizontal it could yeah a little stack on the mobile yeah so it'll get a little kind of the way I think okay I choose preferred a surer image on mobile so there's no scrolling right that's what I mean something like I add it back the anechoic sorry portrait on the desktop another landscape um have a show focusing no worries even if at least for now me other images and even if they just go away okay all right thank you okay I'm back that was my boss and my boss is super super helpful a number one it's awesome that he lets me do these live streams but also he handles all the content stuff for me so when it comes down to times like this no one I don't have direct interaction with a lot of people everything goes through him which is awesome because I have less interruptions in general so that's great and he handles all the content you know like usually people will give him like books of content which obviously we're not going to put all that text and everything on the site and then he will go through it and kind of edit it down to smaller chunks that are better for the website and they give it to me so that's that's super helpful and then there's another guy that is like amazing at photography and image editing and things but he's on vacation this week so I had to do some image editing myself earlier today just some basic stuff so that slowed me down a little bit but I don't think that that guy's taken a vacation for the entire time that I've been working here so he definitely deserves it which I mean I've been here for like two years it's not that one all right so where were we oh this menu trying to get the padding so we just reset it because I kind of messed it up this this might get put on the do later list if I'm going to give it one more go and if I can't fix this quickly then we're just going to put it off because there are other more important things that need done before we launched hopefully the I'm still waiting on some content to come in and that's always a little it causes trouble sometimes I had one section that I spent a ton of time on the site doing and then we changed the content and the size of the section totally changed and then everything I'd done didn't it didn't look right anymore so hopefully nothing like that happens again font size when fiddly padding maybe we'll just increase the padding no not that padding this better let's hear that the okay oh all right I think there's my word let's increase the line height let's go to 16 it's a too big um it's not bad all right now let's look if we can increase the padding maybe this will do it let's see yes it seems to be working if it's if the screen is too small or blurry for you right now I'm basically just hovering over and dev tools that element so I can see a little outline of where the padding is and I'm just clicking my my keypad up and down to just kind of see exactly where that needs to hit it looks like seven pixels is where needs to go I'm gonna have to add some top padding and I'm going to guess four whoa okay I see I have all right now let's check it out oh man what a great guess it was for exactly I remember when I was just starting out there was a guy that worked for the same company that I was doing some contractor work for and he used to be able to just look at a website and say yeah you need to put three pixels of padding on the top of there and that'll fix it and you'd go in and that was exactly right he just was so good knew exactly the number of pixels so I'm pretty pumped that I just did that because I always thought when he did it it was awesome a nice that works so now let's make sure we'll just copy this and that that worked out as good as I could have hoped only had added two lines one element so super happy about that let me check will worry on this about a uoy a and the line height and padding that saved it give it a refresh just to check no servers down and I mean if you've been with me for the last week or so you know that for some reason I keep getting errors on my development server it is the air has something to do with the hot module reloading and I keep putting off actually trying to debug that error so I just have to restart occasionally that the thing is like the restart only takes a few seconds so it's it just hasn't seemed worth it to me to do this these aren't really broken it's just like a cords issue since I'm one local oh so these actually do work on the main site if you all want to check out the site while I'm working on it you can inspect the codes up on github and the test site link it's up to so those are both in the description so you can check things out if you see something crazy this just looks totally broken let me know I mean I'm I'm not trying to rope you guys into being testers for free or anything but if you would like to test things out and let me know that'd be awesome I can't guarantee that I can fix everything because you saw my list obviously I have things that need done but it'll probably get on the list all right so let's pop this in this was about one my my tracking of my prayer yes the time has been slightly less than accurate lately because I just there's a lot of stuff coming in so I'm going to I'm going to actually start up another Pomodoro session so we have a 25 minute timer so we will try to track this this is going to take probably three minutes increase opacity of tile overlay so let's check this out in dev tools so here's how we're doing this we have a background image let me make this bigger this is probably still too small for you okay so we have this background image here and the first is this actual like squid Lee thing literally it's it's names clearly I didn't name it like that I got it from the the old site but I like the name and then we're putting a comma and we're doing a linear gradient and so it's basically like we have double backgrounds and the linear gradient is the same at on the top and the bottom I think this is top and bottom so basically it it just looks like an overlay so what we'll need to do then is change change this these fives and dev tools freaks out when you try to edit this it's all in one big line so I'm just going to edit this in the in the code because it'll actually be faster so where is that right now okay so I do actually have that in the component so let's grab our title component which I don't think I've opened so we have a component for title and by using alright so I have these yeah this looks strange I know and that's a whole nother story as to why that had to happen like that oh that's things that's kind of crazy why do I have okay I needed a global tag all right let's where we had there we go alright so let's pop this up I mean there's no reason why we couldn't go to 75% capacity here it won't block that much of the image so I think that'll be fine now that should reload there we go all right yeah that's a lot better that should be that should be fine I'm not going to waste a lot of time trying to finetune that that works let's check it off and move on the lowest unit I ever count is a half upon Maduro which would be twelve minutes and fifty another twelve minutes and thirty seconds um that took less than that but we'll just round up and Boop's and we'll move it to done all right let me check the live chat quickly oh you guys are having some good conversation here yeah I'm not going to be as attentive to the live chat just because I got to get a lot of this stuff done so I'm sorry about that I will Oh on I'll look at the live chat though like after the site gets launched I will look through it all so if you put some in there I will see it I never totally ignore it let's see someone says Team Rocket in there you got a Pokemon fan I wish Pokemon with my kids so I am familiar with Team Rocket oh man looks like we get we got a fight going on in here whoa all right so I don't really have time to moderate anything so I apologize if anyone is being rude to other people um I don't I just don't have time to look and see like who should be blocked and you know who started what so yeah and there's some messages in another language that I don't know okay yeah this does need moderation so yeah I don't really have a moderator I know there's a way you can assign somebody a moderator but I never had to do it before um so anyway whoever's fighting please stop and otherwise I'll probably just block everybody who's involved in the fight I don't want to do that but I just don't have time to do anything else maybe in future uh future shows somebody if somebody wants to volunteer to be a moderator or something as long as you're cool about it and don't like block everybody that I'd be happy to make somebody a moderator but yeah I mean just be you know be cool I think everybody just needs to take a breath and relax all right like I said some of it's in our language I don't actually even know what people are fighting about okay I'm not going to work on this one there when when content came to me it didn't have actual dashes it had like double hyphens instead so someone commented that I can't can we get rid of that oh yeah definitely but I'm not even going to attempt this until I get all the content in because I might actually like fix this in content that is not going to be on the site so that's let's hold off on that let's do this Oh Magus I need more info because I'm waiting on text info so the color will just let me know that I can kind of skip over for now add squiggly things all right let's have these squiggly things let me show you what we're talking about and I mean let me do a commit real quick I don't want to get too far ahead about committing so what did we do a hover effect sticky Neve yeah that's what we did I definitely did more than that because of that I'm seeing the events page got changed I can't remember what it was so that's going to be the kivett message that's less good to commit frequently you know you see at this point I can't even remember what I did I also I'm not sure if I'm using the word effect properly if it's supposed to be affected with an e or effect with an A I've been using it with the Eve basically for everything during this project for all my commit messages so I can't ever remember my wife's actually an English professor so I don't know better I I just rely on her to proofread all my stuff and then I end up never learning the grammar rules myself alright let's go to the home page so we're going to work on I got a request a few hours ago to add these little things in to some of the headers I'm only going to do it on the home page some of the interior page headers are just way too long and I don't have room for these and they wrap up onto another line and it's going to look really silly if one's like up here and ones down here I don't really want to do all the CSS work to make sure that they always stay out here so this is how I did it I originally wanted to do these as background images but this h1 or h2 spans the whole width so it's a little bit difficult to get them in this position especially because I'm this font size will change to slightly depending on the screen width so I just didn't want to get into all that so I decided to just make two spans within the h2 so this is an image that I'm loading in a span and this is another image I'm loading in a span with just a little bit of padding to make sure it appears like this and that's it so we're going to do the same thing down here to this section we have some some white squiggly things and we're going to put those in so let's uh let's go over here where's our index page so home page alright let me make this a little bigger let me know if you can't see this text it looks big to me but uh depending on your screen it might be too small yeah sorry I just take it a drink drinking a lot of G fuel I don't know if you guys ever heard of G fuel it's basically like an energy drink powder it's like has the same stuff as 5hour energy but it's cheaper and you get it like in a big tub of powder so that's keeping me awake right now and I'm not sponsored by G fuel so I didn't get paid to say that I actually use it and it works what am I trying to do you can see I'm a little bit I'm a little bit out of it I'm like losing focus more easily than I usually do all right I always have a mission at the top I'm trying to copy and paste this okay here we go so we're going to copy and paste this line not everything but we'll have this bit okay so it's hard to see we'll check it out when we copy it but I've grabbed the images and we're going to go down here to this section where it says formation I'm just going to copy this out and then I'll change the text back to formation this section originally said something like building the church and I changed it to formation and I put that elsewhere but then now that's gone at this one I'm just going to leave it a formation because I'm afraid building the church is going to be too big for this section and it's going to write the words are going to wrap maybe we'll change it we'll see I might get an email at some point saying that we have to change it all right so this let me save and let's just see what happened okay awesome so we have these in here we're not going to use these images obviously we're going to use we have some other squigglies so I need to check I need to find my left folder I'll throw in over here I need to see where the other squigglies are so not that one not that one all right we need squiggly three reverse and squiggly three oh that's great I don't I don't even have to change the names very much let's throw in let's just whoops oh yeah here squiggly too we use our multiple cursors and put in three and it's safe oh nice all right it's not too bad it looks like this should be a little bit farther to the right I just got a message from my boss hold on let me check okay I got some more text so we'll be putting that in next don't let me forget okay yeah that's not bad but that definitely needs out that's like that's really weird because I thought I had let me check the values let's say we have a margin right why is that margin right that should be left let me check this out that I messed this up with up I did all right I can't believe I didn't catch that before okay so basically what I did is that this should be Morgan left when I I did the first one and I copy and pasted over and I forgot to switch it so Morgan left and I did the same thing up here Morgan left now let's save it and that should that should fix it there we go so that popped out that popped down a little bit I mean that's that's actually fine I think let me make sure okay so I do have okay that works you can see once the screen gets so small that it would be probably get cut off then I just hide them completely there we go all right that works so let's see how long did that take us not too long we're gonna this is a 1 so this came in exactly as we scheduled it was about I'm rounding it was a little bit more than a half of a Pomodoro session but really close all right now let's put in this text and I do have I have something in here just in general for text add text there we go all right and it was this text but then I added some a bit all right let's see what we have let me open up what I never watched just sent me anything all right so bring this over the text is really small but just so you can see like basically just send me some text and he told me where to put it on the page so I'm just going to copy and paste that onto faith right now this is going to be on the about page so a lot of this text I have pulled from the original site and so I've just been waiting on it obviously these images are going to change instead I've put them down here and their own cards these cards are a little bit different than they were so I actually resize these images and now they're all uniform and have the right links in there let's see I can barely read this text too small even on my screen I have on on my other screen the text we're going to copy and paste so that's a second section now I have several paragraphs it's always like I mean does look nicer when you break your text up but when I have to manually put in the text I don't like when I have to keep putting in paragraph tags I know it's not that much work let me just get rid of some of this stuff we've cluttered up and we don't need most of this now the news page is actually going to be completely hidden at first because we don't we have very much news we just have like a couple of headlines that are links to places so that doesn't really it's not enough content to warrant having an entire like blog set up in general I my rule from back when I used to do a lot of search engine optimization work was if you don't have at least 300 words put on the page then it shouldn't be its own page that was that seemed to work for me before I'm not really up on everything that's new with search engines but at least you know a couple years ago that was kind of the bare minimum you needed to be taken seriously for page to be taken seriously by Google's a crawler about there it is it's an alphabetical order I don't know why it took me so long to find that probably because I was trying to talk at the same time all right so this is the car where we're above that or above that we're going to we're trying to go to the second section you see that this is so much more than I would ever normally put in a react component these pages are basically just components but eventually all this will be cut down and just be templated and pulled in through the WordPress API but for now it's like it actually reminds me when I first learned how to do websites I was using notepad at the time Windows notepad so this is a little more colorful but you know just all the code right there in front of you all right I think this is the section let me double check no it's not I think I need to go up home yeah it's this one okay so is what we'll do some copy and pasting and let's copy and paste that let's make a couple more P tags we need two more class name always remember to use classname instead of class and you're at components or else you'll you'll either get eye they're reacting freak out you can air or it just won't consider that class at all it will just act like it doesn't it wasn't on there and your Styles won't get applied let's do one I need one more paragraph okay I really need to learn Emmet at some point I don't know if people ever use Emmet or heard about Emmet but it's like allows you to just write HTML just super quickly with all these little shortcuts I've known about it for years and I've seen videos and always wanted to learn but I just never took the time to do it but in times like these it would probably come in handy all right let me just say that see how it looks before we do the rest all right okay so we get three paragraphs okay we definitely need a new image this is just not working here I mean obviously it's not even aligned properly if I don't get a new image before it's time to launch it this section will just be full with text that goes basically everywhere in the site it's going to be like that at some point I'm just going to say like we have to launch because I'm going to fall asleep while I'm working if we don't and I still I need to be awake because once we launch any point the domain I need to quickly set up the SSL for the new domain so I can't be totally wiped out at that point I need to be able to handle any issues that might come up so anyway we will cut any images that just don't look right it's better to just not have them to have been to have an image that that's just not big enough and doesn't fit in that section at least that's my view I'd always rather just completely hide sections that aren't complete and then users don't realize that they're missing out on something they don't even know it's supposed to be there to begin with and then when you finally do make the you know that new section of the site or that new feature available then it's like people are getting something as a bonus instead of feeling like all this is still under construction so yes that's my little takeaway if I mess up the rest of the video I think that's still good advice online hub for local learning let's see is that title in there no all right so we need to add a title tag all right we'll make this and I think I'm making these h2s let me check in interior section so I just want to make sure I'm consistent consistent h2s here H for a my dawn then this is an h2 we're going to try an h2 uh I kind of think maybe I just went with an h4 here because this was really big I don't know what I was like I'm not going to change that but I it's just weird to have different sections basically it's the same level in the page hierarchy but I have different H tags so that's not a good idea don't don't do that I'm only going to leave that because I'm running out of time so this will be an h2 in this section uh let's see all right so we want this to span the whole section be centered over the whole thing so we're going to make another row within the container class name row and let's just add Center wet Center in there I'm not sure if we need that but I might as well put it in now so say some time and then I'm going to put this in I don't think I need to put in a call and occasionally I've had weird things happen when I don't with this in a column and the system it this is the grid system that comes with materialized so I've had weird things where like the H tag will like spill out over the row and cause issues like on a small screen where there's a horizontal scrolling happening and and the cause is this H tag spilling out that if I put it in a column and it's just a fool with Collin then it fixes the problem so if you ever had that issue in material ass that might fix it there we go finally we're gonna have the h2 and paste that let's see if it looks good all right that works it is a little big as an h2 let's shrink that down and just see like mmm four lines that's not terrible really don't like a header to span four lines but if I if I had time at some point probably I put a media query in and shrink the size of these headers of all the headers down on on a small screens let's oh goodness I got bullet points to put in and then exit reshape this myself I know it's small but look not only are there paragraphs but then there's bullet points goodness it's not a big deal if you have like a WYSIWYG but we got to make this you oh so now lies by hand the oldfashioned way okay so this text is changing yes yeah okay cool so that's their this next one we're going to have another paragraph and we'll put the UL in that picture we need two more paragraphs here one paragraph is going to have a line and then a ul we'll see how that looks I don't know how to look right off the bat there's my timer so let me actually I'm gonna I'm going to do the five minute break for my timer right now and that will just give me time to to keep track of everything so I'm not going to take a break from the live stream but I'm going to take a break so I can come in here say that was only half upon I call Pomodoro sessions palms for short I don't know if anybody else does that if it sounds silly but if you hear me say that that's like what I call it to myself I'm going to bring in I'll show you what I'm doing over here I know it's really small but just to get an idea I also track my time here so I'm going to say I actually forgot the last two sessions so I'm going to double up and say it was about sixty so I'm like manually putting in the time at some point I'd like to automate a lot of this and just have another time in and then I just make a little note of what I've been doing I did set of the hover today menu so you put that in there what do we do we added squigglies page headers and what are we working on now new text yeah new text for about page okay another super small but I just read out what I was typing so you know that so basically this is how I keep track of things so all the time I've been spending on this deal now I don't track me eating's so sometimes meetings do take our big part of a project so I only track the time that like I'm actually coding or you know looking up I mean we all know that coding is a lot of googling as well so that's my time so so far in this project I actually spent like 48 and a half hours on this uh so we'll see so that gives me an idea of how much time I've taken I have it all my projects that I'm working on or have worked on or all different sheets down here so it's nice that I can go down sometimes I actually put like an hourly rate down here and keep track of it so I can get some point go to my boss and say like hey this is how much this project may have cost you if you went with you know an outside contractor so it's kind of cool because if you add up what I've done in a year it's it's always way more than I get paid in a year so that means that I am I am bringing value I'm a good investment for this university and it also gives me leverage if I wanted to ask for a raise or something at some point so I recommend keeping track of that thing even if you're not an hourly worker I'm not hourly I'll take a paid salary salary but it's good to keep track of I got about two minutes before my breaks over we're going to start up again so I'm just going to check the live chat there's a lot going on the live set so I'm not going to scroll all the way up it looks like did somebody somebody volunteered to be moderator said I volunteer as tribute um oh I didn't I didn't see that earlier let me check if if they're still craziness going on in the chat then though maybe look up how to make you a moderator squeezes Java developer somebody asked if react to jess is the only framework that I know um I worked with angular before but not in a while like maybe out of like four years ago or something I did some stuff with Hank so it was angular one I've read about other frameworks like the newer versions of the angular and view j/s and then in terms of like non JavaScript frameworks I have had to work with things like C char PHP stuff but yeah for now i'm just i'm working with react at this point reactive is more than enough for me to try to have to learn so I'm not going to move on to anything else right now but I'm definitely interested I like to use the right tool for the job so I'm interested in learning some other stuff I just keep seeing so many headlines about how great few jss so I just I don't know I haven't used it yet to my ass about CSS library all right they got an answer materialized y'all are great you you uh you answer these questions right here hey somebody says they like G fuel to somebody but we believed in you when they used emoji so it's actually B and a leaf I love that that's so cool there's a lot of message retracted sin here I don't understand that why why is somebody keep retracting the messages and how does that I don't know I've never really participated in live chats myself so I'm not sure how you retract the message yeah materialized is open source it's on github materialized is not material design it's different material design is like the basic like design philosophy developed by Google and materialises is like an incarnation of that design philosophy so actually putting those ideas into HTML CSS and JavaScript there are other material design style frameworks out there but I tried a bunch of them um probably a couple years ago and at that time react or materialized was the one that was the most it was had the least amount of bugs it was easier for me to use so I don't know at this point if there's something better but it still maintains there's the shriek one update so I'm still going with it somebody said okay so so just to comment so I mentioned real quick before we start again somebody says I don't know how you look I think I have a picture on my my youtube channel so there's a link in the description for the for this video to my youtube channel and my twitter I think and there are pictures of me on on both of this so I don't know I've never had a reason to actually show my face on a live stream so maybe one day I will but for now I don't somebody else said they retracted their statement because they were there talking about the a versus e and the word effect and I it turns out I was correct so awesome I had a 5050 shot at being right you know it's only can only go one of two ways alright so let me get back into this I didn't get through everything that was in the live chat there's a lot going on so on the next break I'll I'll do the same thing and I'll check back in I do want to see okay we still have 33 viewers that's a little bit lower than we normally have but that's that's a decent mount of people so I'll keep going in case you missed at the beginning I'm just going to keep the stream going for a while but maybe even till I launched the site unless I I might have to take a break to go out and like meet with my boss or so that that may happen so may not be straight through but I think this is doable let me get is I'm still waiting on some content and some images anyway so I can't I can't actually launch right now so we're just going to try to get as many like little things done as we can all right so we will right in the middle of making a paragraph tag with the class name of flow text flow text comes builtin to materialize and it just makes your font size change depending on the screen width so it's like a responsive font so I like it it's very helpful and it saves me from having to test fonts sizes on different screens and what I think I need one more so let's copy this and let's bring this in so we are going to paste this and then I'm going to try to put the UL right here I'm not exactly sure how this is going to work out with the padding if it's going to be up too close but I just don't remember what the default padding is materialise for this we got some allies how many do we need one two three four four a large so let's copy that now we can copy some of this over by default materialise does not put any little dots or anything by there they're allies so we'll see how it looks if it's not obvious that this is a list we may have to put in some of our own hopefully it is obvious and it works now you'll see what I'm talking about in a second when we save this and one more one more Li and hopefully since we put that in the paragraph tag that had flow text are ul will also use the flow text that was part of the idea of putting it in there oh it's terrible there we go all right let's flip over ah shoot all right this is are you oh that looks awful what is going on here see this it like you you think like all I have to do is copy and paste some text content but it's never that simple well alright well I I don't mind like this this padding here is fine I like that there there needs to be at least like some indentation or something I guess I could just change this and see what it looks like now I'm gonna do like disk uh I don't like using the disk how lucky do you put them in up here um then we need some some margins in here shoot 16 pixels all right see how this looks that's not bad we'll keep we use that so let's copy this and we will add it let's see if I already have some I don't know if I'm using JSX in here yes I am where is the set it's just in that section I'm going to try to put it in here and see if it gets scoped just to that section we may have to move this I haven't used this style JSX tag often enough to know exactly what's going on with the scoping and I just skimmed the the materials for the the documentation only read like the tiny bits that I really needed at the time let's see where we're at alright let me just give us a name um a class name maybe we'll need it again so we'll just do it make it a class what should we call this bullets let's call it bullets not like gun bullets I don't want to how about circles or disks disk lists okay cool what am i doing yes there we go no there I think it might be time for more G fuel so I'm gonna feel really tired out of it I also have Visine drops like for my eyes and so when you're coding for a long time your eyes start to dry out those really help so may need to stop and put some of those in as well I'll just copy this paste it I mean okay and see if it works I think it did what what the heck just happened oh my goodness what how how did that did you guys just catch that what just happened there oh okay so a couple things are happening that's first of all the styles are not being applied here at all so I do need to move that tag that style tag out further so it's it's scoped to a bigger scope and then also for some reason the flow text tag is not being applied so I'll do two things let's do two things to try to fix this Vlad flow text to here hopefully that works I really don't want to have to add flow text to each one of these allies but if this doesn't work I'll have to and it's probably just some that lifestyle overriding that I'm assuming and now we need to take this this whole thing here and move it because it was just being scoped to the shoot that I grabbed too I want to double check yeah I just want to double check and make sure I didn't grab the div at the end of that and mess everything up so let me move this all the way out to like pretty much the largest scope we have on this page I could go out like one more but this should work hi no one ever found out live with idat7 wait a second I got that error a long time ago and I fixed it at least I thought I fixed it what the heck was that all right now we got to restart the dev server okay assuming that that these changes work that should be it for the for that Li all right a little bit better not exactly what we wanted at least we got this flow Tech's working now this list I still just looked in here to begin with alright super simple fix they just have a lot more like selectors here in the CSS so I'm getting overridden so we'll just throw in a couple more selectors and we'll just override that does it ever feel like a fight when you're trying to override other CSS like sometimes it does to me alright so let's go with div UO when in doubt just throw a div in there there's probably always an enclosing giver on something and I okay all right here we go unable to find an element with ID 87 what element is supposed to have idat7 what element is this so here's what I'm going to do a refresh the page and hope it works now I'm going to search for the word ace the letters 87 87 oh man so many 8730 187 you maybe we can put that on the nb7 what the heck maybe yes all right I narrowed it down this list flow text 87 why is this supposed to be all right I'm going to check the live chat real quick and see if anybody caught caught anything what is the stray oh did I did I mess something up maybe I messed up a mess of someone I copy and pasted all right let me get me go up and check I mean that's usually it when stuff like this happens it's just you you misplaced it's misplaced like semicolon or something all right this looks this looks all right I mean the highlighting helps to anything that's you know inside of clothes we'll get a different color that looks all right let's check that style tag here God that looks like it's supposed to look in the move good all right yeah somebody somebody had they just retracted us in so I'm assuming that they figured it out I'm just going to say it somebody's programming is so boring sometimes it is sometimes it can be tedious you just got to listen to some music and just grind through it other times it's fun I don't really know what watching me do it might be pretty boring but let's see yeah so when you do this style JSX tag first you're going to put brackets and that's going to basically you're in react component so that that's put you in JavaScript mode now then on the JavaScript mode I use this this little back tick and that's the temporary template literal syntax so think of this as using a single quote or double quote except it can do cool stuff so all this in here is basically a string so I can write all the CSS just like normal CSS it since it's a string and then it all gets changed over and applied where it needs to get applied for that component so when it comes out on the other end it's it works well in this case it's not working but usually it works so let's go back and we'll look at this again and see what's going on am I still I'm still getting so how's it not even showing up at all I need to make this bigger so we can see what's going on okay so this Li should be getting some styles that we put in and I don't see it anywhere so our styles are not even being applied at all let's check to see if these styles are being applied because these did work yeah these styles are being applied let's let's check this out I'm just trying to rule things out here okay so we can see this is what we should be seeing as the styles getting applied something like this this data JSX all right let's check that out let's make sure we did it you will disclose uh I'm pretty sure I know what I just did I added the class disc list to the UL so I I shouldn't have had to space that let's see if this works I still might not be and it gave me that same error we're definitely going to have to test this out on the live server because if we're getting this error on the live server that's a huge problem I think it's it's only happening when I hit save and the hot module reloading happens so I'm I think it's only with the hot module reloading and that's fine because then it won't mess up anything in production but once remember to test that okay still not happening but let's see alright at least it's here so we just need to add one more we need to make it more specific so I hate making things so specific but let's go with main and then and that's that's good and kind of annoyed no how is that not this is this is really terrible it's like alright now I just I just have to do this I have to go just like the nuclear option I should have just done this five minutes ago then that's the thing I can't remember how I fixed that same issue last week oh man wait a second you guys might have already seen this I haven't looked at a live shot in a couple minutes I'm an idiot if you didn't catch that haha they did alright somebody did somebody already caught that three minutes before I did I should have just I should have just checked the live chat sorry oh man I applied it to those triangle flights in the UL instead of the Li that was the problem alright well that is finished I'm not going to mess with that I'm like I just don't want to deal with that anymore so it's gonna look like that alright let's see alright one more for this page let's do all right we're actually we're going to use blockquote for this one so if you haven't use blockquote yet you will you'll see it up alright so we got this section here let's go up or the last one alright so here's a section we just today we're going to drop down one section and we're going to add a block quote crunch then I'm gonna add flow text again oops okay now I'm going to bring in this text and they say it was a given I put that in the right spot right thought I did I am starting to lose my voice a bit sorry about that did a circuit again with this the dev server that's why me okay somebody's at such tab I think that that's right about the time when I was typing important phone there I probably don't need it now I can take it out but I I'm not gonna go back and take it out right now alright this should be good enough and then let's see alright awesome so we've got this little plot quote right here and I want to make this match the home page because we have a quote on the home page let's make it Madison's check out the home page and see how we did it alright so we don't have any parentheses and it looks like we're making the name of the document italicize let's see what this is okay so we need to change up how this is format it a bit and I don't know should we go with the black I think we should we should make this black background yeah you don't have in here and then we'll make this red okay so let's do the shortcut mode on this and just copy and paste some stuff we're going to copy this border and let's throw it on here and I'm just going to put it in here and if I haven't already showed you this and so show you got to do it if you're using next jazz I don't know if this works with just regular reacts but on on next jazz they have this CSS and J's thing I think that's what it's called and you can just type in it's basically like an object it's not like not a it is an object so javascript object so these first set of brackets says hey we're going to do some JavaScript now so anything inside those brackets is JavaScript and then the second set of brackets is an object and so you just type in all right no no no hyphens here you can okay shared CSS stuff and then you put this stuff in quotation marks let's see if that works it should work we're getting that again okay we it did we're Bowie you can barely see it because we didn't make the background black I listen to the inspector and it is it's really already use dev tools when it's blown up so big what I do want you want to be able to see so red background flourish let's just remove that class and add a black background okay simple case we're going to move this class which gives it the red background and that little squiggly thing in the background here and we're going to keep white text we're going to keep I'm not I don't even remember what the class banner is going but we're going to keep it and we were not going to add another class I'm just going to throw background right directly on here with the style tag if this is just like making you cringe this is not exactly like frowned upon in reacts throwing your CSS in the middle when I first started doing this it's like so freaked out because you guys I've always been like been taught I didn't really go to school for this but I've always read and seen everybody say no you got to separate out your CSS and the separate files don't put inline CSS but then with react it's okay so it takes some getting used to my Pomodoro cycle just ended let's just throw this in since we're so close to having it ready um background color red I'm playing Spotify and on my headphones in the background and have this 90s rock playlist and I'm not like super into rock I'm actually I listen to whatever I'm not picky but it like brings back so many memories of hearing these songs when I was younger so it's kind of cool they had a pretty good throwbackthursday playlist there was a lot of like 90 stuff that was nostalgic for me so if you have Spotify what did I just do why did I say red I'm losing it guys guys and girls sorry you I'm losing it people I don't know there's nothing and I don't why would I put their name I never do that okay alright let's try that again I need to get off this page alright awesome so we have that done the only thing we need to do is just clean this section up here to make it look like the the quote on the home page so let's go back over what do we do I'm actually I want to look at the the index page while we're here because I think I made okay I did it I did it in line I just did a spam okay I think the tearless actually has a class for italic I don't think it's I don't think it's worth it time wise for me to look up that class right now because it would take me longer than to just copy and paste this but I'm pretty sure that it is a class alright so they use caritas best anybody anybody good with Latin you want to tell me what that means I'll tell you what it means in a minute but I'll give you guys a minute to see if anybody knows Latin I used to teach Latin in high school I haven't worked with in so long I'm really rusty but um I still remember some of it ah spam and no Google Translate no cheating if you really know what this is a lobby then then put it in the in the live chat okay that's what we need and there we go there's the other one and that's that should be it should be right do we need we need to comment it up with the comment the in a coma okay and that that really should be it alright perfect so that's matched up exactly with one on the homepage this picture is not going to stay I don't know what we're going to put here yet I wanted I'm going to see how it looks real quick with no picture I actually will probably just leave it in that in those columns so I think I kind of like it off to the side like that happen let's say well that's that's happening more frequently that's not good alright let me go back over all right somebody did get so John John Heiner got it they got the they got the answer so hopefully in google Sharon's like that but yeah in Latin they translated a caddy toss past Ghana so today uses God Caritas is actually like so that's where we get the word charity from but in theological terms charity and love are like the same theological like thing that the same virtue so so they're in Latin it's pretty interchangeable today's concept of love is usually different than the meaning we give to charity but if you're reading like some oldschool theology stuff maybe in Latin then you can use those words interchangeably pretty much so little Latin lesson for today and then s this just is so in Latin word order doesn't mean anything so all right John Ida says they legitimately translated that no Google Translate so awesome if I had like a gold star I would give it to you that's really cool not too many people we'll know any Latin nowadays I mean it's pretty much no one speaks it conversationally people just read it actually I don't mind that off to the side let me know what when you all think having this off to the side I definitely just need some padding I don't like calculus that is but right off to the side that's not bad sorry my voice is going yeah often the side is pretty good man I forgot to start my poem into our timer again so let's uh that's all the text content that we needed to put in for that section so let's just give this the next show so this is three right we went a little over I mean really it's like three point five I can't leave it took that long to do text I'm just going to throw this over here because I think we have all the text we need now I don't I don't think I'm waiting on anything else hopefully actually I wrote out a list earlier sometimes it doesn't focus if I actually write it on a piece of paper with a pen so okay you need a text for the about and yeah I think that's the only place I needed text for so great so we're done with that let me I'm gonna put in the time over in my other spreadsheet as well and stupid timer all right 330 I may have to take a break and eat something at some point I just realized I have eaten nothing today I'm not feeling well I had like a like a protein like weight gain type of shake this morning so I haven't like eaten anything that was like you have to chew but I did drink that so I'm not like I'm not running on no calories at all but very very few calories at this point I do do you ever do that when you get working you just forget to eat I do that frequently all right so at this point let me I want to make sure I didn't get any more messages what are the dimensions for the headers uh I did get a message um so you asked me what dimensions I needed for the title for that like the header images so the thing that I'm calling the title here these images the images that I have are not quite as big as I want to see you see if someone has a big screen I think this is 27 inches and this is this is like the Apple like they're a doll monitor which is called like a thunderbolt I forget what it's called so it's like a 2k screen I think so you can see I don't know if you can see this it looks like it's pixelated somebody here should this is somebody that I work with and he said look like a watercolor painting so this image it actually kind of works if you want to pretend it's a watercolor painting but I need bigger images so my boss just asked me what dimensions and I think mm width will probably work I should doublecheck that and make sure that this image isn't already mm and I'm going to go here and just see no it's not these are 1,200 these width of 1200 so that's that's no good unless you're going to limit the width of your page to 1200 you need something bigger than that because screens are just like crazy these days with size and resolution you can't get away with 1200 with anymore at least that's what I think I work on a 27inch 5k screen and then my secondary monitor is 20 I think 27 maybe 25 I don't know a a 2k screen so I probably have better screens than most people do but still you know you want to develop for what's coming you know try to be as cutting edge as you can so you don't have to redo it in a few months all right let's let's get rid of the space and move on we'll save I did want to just add some pie before we start the next item on the list let's just add some padding real quick I'm actually just I think I'm just going to add grab this section and just add margin to the bottom this will be easy uh normally I don't like to do this little like piece by piece thing but you know we're just so close to being finished I just want to get it done and I'm super tired and hungry right now I wish we don't have like good food delivery where I'm at so I some like bigger cities now you can just like have food delivered from a restaurant like right from your app you just pick it I really really want that here but I live in a town that what's a city technically but there's only like I don't know 16,000 people something like that so I guess it's not nobody's making money doing that here so you can pretty much only get pizza delivered maybe what I want here let's go 50 see how that looks all right I like that 50 works let's go here and we'll just add this right ends we already have that tag there marginbottom 50 pixels well east of 31 viewers so that's impressive for those of you have stuck with it for most of the time I've been on some people maybe you're new and you have them in here the whole time if you're just getting here I'm working as fast as I can uh and fighting exhaustion and a cold to launch this site today and they're allowing these tiny changes oops I got a call before you some changes let me take this hello hey yeah let me let me see yeah I just haven't checked my email so maybe this extreme is why it was originally expected pattern has occurred okay all right so let me let me know exactly it doesn't sorry in Google Chrome your uh what machine is ISM window it's a Mac one up wood version operating system you do you know okay maybe it's a no captive um so there's there's two things that I can think of that it could be at this point maybe number one it's possible that some something is cached that is not it's just messing something up with the site as it is now in which case you have to do like a like a hard reset or you could try to go into one of those browsers in my private browsing mode and look at the site that'll tell you if it's the cache or not the second thing that it could be is that it's possible that both Safari and maybe even Chrome the latest versions of them have not come out for El Capitan that's that's a long shot Safari for sure they cut off the versions but I just can't see chrome doing that yeah so it worked on the same machine yesterday all right then it has to be I would I would guess that it's something with the caching so I would try it in a in a private browsing window and you can call me back let me know if that doesn't work I'm just as I can't troubleshoot it because I can't get it everything I try to view it on I can see it so I keep trying I keep trying maybe I'll ask some other people hmm yeah and I should it should be an option to do private private yeah shoot I'll have some other people over here oh yeah I'm sure we probably have computers open because we're not you know we don't have as many swap workers as normal right now so that'll or two yeah yeah okay yeah no yeah um yeah I think it could be I think it could be live I mean they're not not like every single feature is going you know necessarily needs to be like like we we don't need like a really robust search mechanism right now because you can look through every resource in 30 seconds so so things like that but you know for the things that you know are important the main portions of the site you know they I'm going through right now I'm looking at like padding and things just kind of tweaking a little bit so so they will be ready to go but yeah if you want to come on over and check that out I do I think I'm gonna have some other people to check it out on their machines though too because I want to know what's going on with that mmhmm okay oh yeah gives the linkage okay okay all right so that'll be yes we'll take out the the button there the link button for now and put something like okay that's that's true I just don't have that PDF or is it already up somewhere okay send it send it to Tom and and then I'll have him upload it somewhere that I can link to it okay all right thank you hi Ron okay I am back that was the Vice peseta assistant director of the department that I'm making the site for so come in a big problem he's running uh he's on a Mac he's running El Capitan and on both his version of Chrome and Safari which which are uptodate he's getting an error when he tries to go to the test site so the site so if you all could try to go to the test site if you can the links in the description it's just test katic addicts calm I don't expect anybody to know how to spell cat akattak so I always have to think hard about it too so use the the link so if you're just joining you're wondering why I was just on the phone with someone this is this is just my normal work day alright I'm I'm narrating my work day but at times I get a rough interrupted so I got you know I have to talk to I am getting paid to do this work so I can't ignore everyone else so I see we did lose some some viewers if the viewer account gets down really low then I'll probably just cut off the stream because it's obviously nobody wants to see it at that point but otherwise I'll keep it going for a while I think it would be cool to keep it going until I launch but I suspect that might not happen for two reasons one uh I think some other people will have to look at the site before I get the goahead to say like it's going to go live and I don't want to just wait here and have nothing going on to wait on their their response and there go ahead the other reason is I'm I'm getting just like super hungry right now so I'm gonna have to take a break so if possible it's possible that maybe I can just live stream later on I don't want to take up the free code camp channel like all day so if I have to stop and then livestream later maybe I'll just do it on my channel I just I won't schedule it as an event I'll just go on go on my channel we'll see I'm gonna check the live chat really quick see if if anybody got the same error somebody says Robert bled saw said I saw the monstrous on the thumbnails like what's going on here yeah you don't so in case you don't know this is this is up here this is a monstrance so it's a Catholic thing so I imagine that that would be kind of odd to see that as like a coding video come up but that's that's like the hero image for the site and that's that was like we had to have that image in there everybody wanted that image to be in there and prominence so yeah so that's in there uh somebody's I think what's the error of John's asking what's the error um I don't know exactly what the error message is I didn't get like a copy and paste oh yeah actually let me check my email and unexpected error has occurred that's it I think it's just a gray screen with unexpected errors occurred I guess I just I keep trying to go to all the pages there and I can't get it to happen someone says press one to die instantly one not sure what's going on there okay my boss just said he's having a tough time finding the full versions of those images the the larger versions to work so we'll see how it goes I mean if if we have to go with with these images I mean the majority of people viewing the site probably will have a screen small enough that it would work but I don't really want to take that bad gamble I think it's just the site a site just looks a lot worse when you have images that aren't the proper size and they're they're pixelated so I really rather not have to do that so he's the kind of thing I don't know if I can keep streaming the whole time because some of these things are a little bit out of my control and it's been a children creators good son okay so John says tried it then it looks fine shoot yeah and it's not entirely it's not entirely updated I haven't pushed the changes to the server in a while so it won't match up with what you're saying here on my local version exactly but all right well I can see your scroll bars in the team cards okay you can see you can see scroll bars what browser are you on that you can see the scroll bars because I definitely want to get rid of those let's do that next on the lid that's on my list so I knew it happened in IE 11 um oh actually I have a great idea let's go to browser stack I don't know I didn't think this browser stack and let's go to Mac El Capitan and we'll try out let's just let's try out Safari and we'll see uh because this is what the other guy was running when he got the error I'm assuming he was running the most updated one so if we try to go on here maybe we can get the same error if you've never used all right we got it let's check it out what's the problem here anybody want to take a guess I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is but we'll see take a guess before we check out dev tools inspect element all right so we're going to see let's see we got three errors I'll give you a second another second to say what the error is before I click over I'll tell you I think it's because I'm using es6 stuff and maybe this version of Safari can't handle the es6 stuff in it maybe yesterday the day before we did switch other yesterday we switched out and transpiled some of the code so it would work but then I switched back to the other code because I wasn't finished editing it yet so let's see can't kind of chimera yes that's it that is the error okay so that's great that is great news the error is simply that I'm using the variable let well instead of air I'm using let that's a es6 thing that is not supported in this version of Safari it's weird that it was happening on chrome 2 but maybe maybe chrome was older I don't know but that's it so basically what will happen is we'll double check we'll come back to this and double check once we transpile the javascript it might be worthwhile to just transpile the JavaScript right now and put it on there I don't foresee let's say let's see if let's just check out our list and see if we have anything that's going to be jobs you're teddy no I don't I don't think there's anything left we need to do we want to edit that javascript file lets transpile it we'll put it on the server and then we can test it immediately and make sure that that was in fact the problem if you want to know more about the whole issue with the Essex and let watch yesterday's show because I explained it in more depth yesterday uh where am I going I just I want to say just forgot where I was trying to go Oh babble try it out ok I don't know if I actually I could try to use this one but in the off chance that I did edit this since yesterday I don't know if I did or not we'll just get rid of all this and we'll go in normally I would set up like automatic transpiling but I didn't do that yet so I'm just going to do this I only really have one file that needs transfer so big we're good to go with that let me can I do cooking it this oh well forget go get it cool so we got this transpiled we'll throw it in over here I'm not even going to worry about backing this up because I have this Said's from like so many previous commits I could just grab it from from github so let's say that we got a wish my console here it is let's check out figure out what we've been to one what was the last thing we changed did add content yeah wonder less commits that hover effects okay so what we did we added it's good ways we did add some squigglies and we updated about text and transpile no no we never put past as we update about it and transpile this alright that's good alright awesome now let's let's go to the server so I got server over here actually this might be too small for you want to see let me let me bring it up a little bit there we go maybe that's better so just just like we've been doing the last couple days ssh into the server and this time i got everything ready so I'm just chaining these commands with this double and sign I don't think this works on Windows I think it just works on Linux based stuff so be careful using it with Windows I'm not sure but um I think that's the way it works so this will just do all the stuff that we were doing manually before so it stopped it went into the directory a man did it miss something there's no way it was that fast no yep I was I mess up one thing so in fact it did not work because I messed that up I needed to add run sunny npm run build efficiency right here I left that out that's important so let's just run it again they will see you oh my goodness let me just use this portion actually now this will work if I just CD out because this is assuming that I just loved him okay that was supposed to save me time you see it did not it will later on now that it it's actually the right command I'll just be able to throw that right in I know there's probably a way for me to just like have this saved on the server and call it out but I'll set that up at some point actually here's a good question for for everybody do you know of a way I know this is possible but I just haven't done it before where I can set this up so that I'll have zero downtime when I update so like right now there's brief downtime while this thing builds somebody showed me the site right now nothing would you know they'd seen hair what I want to happen is like maybe two different versions of this basically a duplication of this this node you know at running and like so I can take one down but then nginx will automatically redirect traffic to the other one update one then bring that one back online and then update the other one is there a way to do that if you know they'll be awesome if you can give me like a link or something I probably won't have time to do it right now but that would that would be great to implement in this project and some future projects as well alright so that should be online now let's I'll check it out real quick right here yeah okay that works now the real test let's go back in here it loves you up pretty quick and browserstack if you don't do anything no sense in wasting a lot of a lot of bandwidth and because they I mean these are like real like virtual machines and stuff you're on our own machines so alright yay it works now all right let's click around just to be sure see so that was it that was the problem I was using some newer features of JavaScript that we call es2015 features or sometimes you hear es6 I was using some of those features that are not supported in Safari 9.1 so that's why I didn't work uh I also let's see what browsers they have I wonder if they have another browser no they don't I don't know let's stop this and go out I guess each instance you have to like I was hoping I could just stay in that one instance and switch to Chrome but I can't so let's try the latest one I was assuming that install extension now I don't really want to do that right now uh I was assuming it was the latest version it didn't work that's what they said it said they're running the latest version it's all up to date so we're going to try it on there we'll make sure that this works well that was that was like a weird effect at first on if you guys caught that but anyway alright it is working work you're working good great so yeah so if you're just joining us we're getting errors because we were using new JavaScript features so we transpiled the code using babel and now it works awesome so let's stop this we don't need it anymore probably test a little bit later on the launch if I have any any strength left now let's get to these scroll bars so I had some of you say well he picked up a couple of years I'm into a little while ago that I forget to eat when I work and someone said I forget to work when I eat I would like to have that program a little bit more often somebody else what are we doing today we're in the site ready to launch so we're doing anything that we have to do to get it ready to launch so a little bit of everything here testing and troubleshooting just some browser testing doing a lot of like tiny like UI tweaks or even copy and pasting some content in at some point hopefully we'll get the domain name switched over and we will set up the SSL but I might have to take a break before that so alright so let's get these somebody yesterday I asked yesterday for some code to hide the scroll bars so let me let me put that in and I'm gonna check the chat from yesterday and I saved it there's some good information in there there we go uh okay weitzman now that's not it scroll bar okay so I'm going to copy some of this let me scroll up to see what browser okay they say they can see the browser in the latest chrome version on Windows 10 shoot yeah all right this thinks we're gonna have to fix this so basically what happened was I wanted all these cards to be the same height so let's look at this let's check this up now let's do accent the team one is better I wanted all these cards to be the same let me go on the last side no good so I wanted these to all be the same height but some people have really long titles and they were rapping on the other line so as a quick fix I just added this little scroll on a Mac you don't see it so it still looks okay on Windows that doesn't happen so here's what we're going to do I'm going to open up Chrome on Windows in browser stack so we'll just go windows which are Windows 10 and the latest version of Chrome I'm using this so I can basically because I want to be able to use the F tools Chrome's dev tools as I like those the best then I'm going to put in some of the code from dev tools to see if it works before we put it into a project it loaded so of course we're good oh goodness to scrollbars ah you're right this does look really really bad I might just have to truncate things or I'm gonna set a limit on the titles okay so maybe what am I going to put this on not the card on the content let's move this over a bit have some more space areas where we have our old stuff okay I'll shoot I can't can I'm not pace them in here yes it worked all right so there's some of it this isn't I've gotten I bet some other stuff I'm going to paste in and try to get it to work oh um I should not a face about it should because of this see it says Nathan now because this would only work for yesterday we're talking about Internet Explorer's we need to see if there's some equivalent I know this isn't going to work but I was worth a try okay so like a WebKit version sure yeah all right so here's his thing we set overflowed to none and we get rid of these but then it's cut off we need the yeah you're right so make sure the scroll bars look or they do look really bad all right here's the fix right now at this point titles being cut off is less of an issue than then these scroll bars these look terrible because we still have a modal that will pop up and we can see the full title in the modal so I'm going to let the titles get cut off for now maybe go in and either truncate the titles or possibly leave out the title I hate to leave out the titles I also don't think I really have time to go in and manually like cut down the titles so yeah you're right truncate and you all were saying that yesterday too I should have just tried to have the truncate yesterday yeah this always felt like not a great idea just kind of like a quick solution and it was definitely not a great idea so glad uh that I'm really glad that you all caught that thank you and this is what it I am a little bit slower when I do the live stream because I'm explaining things and talking but you all catch stuff like that so sometimes it really saves me a lot of time or saves me from like launching a site with a really ugly UI in that case so I think it's a good tradeoff all in all you know we kind of work on this collaboratively I give up a little bit of my time but then I get all of your collective knowledge to help as well I think it's a good trade where did I put this so we're done I'm closing out app just because we transpired it we put it on there I don't want to edit it anymore any more JavaScript that I have to write I'm going to try to write directly in the components if i use es6 and the components it will get automatically transcribed by next or whatever they'll do something with it so that it works behind the scenes so what I want to do now is go let's go to that team card component because I probably put these in line styles on it overflow what did I say none I think that's what I did yep okay so this will do basically we've prevented the text from wrapping which is what we want so the cards will be even otherwise you get like a really weird stack if I had more time I would try to use maybe something that would possibly do like a masonry style layout that could work I don't know but I don't have time to mess with that in my experience there's I've always taken away like more time than I want them to think when I try to do masonry layouts with some type of JavaScript plugin so they're not going to make the cards all different heights but it is going to cut off this at the end here and I will it's not going to be cut off on every screen size certainly once the screen is bigger it'll be off define once you're on a phone and there's definitely going to be stuff that gets cut off but all it takes is one click to see it all I'm not really happy about shipping the site with that but I'd say that can go on the list of things that don't absolutely have to be ready today you can feel free to disagree let me know why if you think that that really should be fixed beside the point now I gotta make some tough decisions about what launches also I don't really expect to get like a million people viewing this site today either so if we want and it's not like perfect what's ever perfect when you launch though but let's say it's not perfect it's not like you know so many people are going to see this I think the last time this site is going to get more viewers than then my last time I had a really rush project but last time had a really rush project it was like super rush like can you do this by tomorrow and I did it and then for like two hours I looked at the analytics and no one visited the site and I was like are you serious I stayed up half the night and then slept for three hours and came in I really did this site and no one even went to it so that that was fed and I was a super mad about it but it was slightly annoying alright so we fix this I forgot to set my timer again so I guess I'll just estimate one the testing of it took a little while it probably is more like a half but it was close enough all right the list is getting down it's going down farther so let me check my email real quick make sure we didn't get any other changes yet oh it's like alright I may have there's some new content but I think it's stuff that can be put in through the content management system so I'm good with that so I'm checking my email on the other screen I don't don't think that the people I work for would appreciate me checking the email in front of everybody watching on YouTube so I try to do everything I can on the main screen but there's some stuff that I shouldn't show to the world not because it's bad it's cuz it's just like you know private stuff or a password or something like that okay alright we may have to make a change we may have to change the link here in a second that's not a big deal all right sorry I'm reading an arene email for my boss or at least one that I get cc'd on okay this could be a major change so shoot see I don't like this might be something that should just be put off because I don't think it's that big of a deal right now but I mean the people would suggest changes whether they be a client or other people involved their change always does seem like an important change at the time and the grand scheme of things I don't think this is that important but here's the change that might happen what is not great right on because I zoomed in and what I don't like this you see this highlighting how it looks like oh I'll check it out later on I guess um so this is supposed to this is fully data in from WordPress so this is a custom post type with all these custom fields I'm pulling it in through the API so this is why it's a bigger change than it seems it's been requested by I don't even know I just give the email but to add another section here that will say whether or not this and that requires registration my boss is arguing that it doesn't it's not necessary to have that in there and I tend to agree we already have a lot of stuff here what would have to happen is I'd have to go back in and edit that the custom fields for that custom post type and then I'd have to edit the code that I'm using on the react side to pull that in and add another thing so rather not do that but maybe it'll happen hopefully not do you see it's kind of cool that the role that my boss often plays for me is awesome and that I wasn't directly I didn't have to directly respond to that email I am cc'd on that email I could see what's going on but he is taking care of that for me so that saves me a lot of time and I'll see the focus so it's definitely cool I mean think if you were maybe at a smaller agency or something like it would be like the role of a project manager I mean he's basically like a project manager for all the projects that we that we have here he also has a lot of social media stuff he's good with that all right I'm going to check the live chat just for a second because I I need just a little little break here oh shoot I just remembered I have scroll bars on another page too and I bet a scroll bar shows up here I can't do anything about that though yeah I can't why is this alright so this is this is annoying that this is dropping down lower um that's that's a kind of like small enough I don't need to worry about that now it is going to bother me though there's another page where we had scroll but all right resources that's where get scroll bars dang it those are going to show up how bad do these look with scroll worth take it alright let's check it out with scroll bars let's go back in here yeah once again I keep saying people say truncate somebody said add the truncate class last time I tried to use truncate it um it like wouldn't work on a multiple line thing I said look at the keep up with the live chat more often because a minute again somebody just said check resources that's where the scroll bars are and I'm over here trying to think about what it was not the team so they're still on that I didn't push the updates yet resources it's like the scroll is not very good at all on this I'm hoping it's just because it's on a virtual machine like through browser stack and this isn't actually the experience for four people I told up I got my wife calling I'm gonna take this hello hey how's it going oh you can watch I'm still on on YouTube live you're on the live stream right now yeah I just decided to keep live streaming it because I'm like I'm really out of it so I need some help oh no don't don't worry about maybe a gnome for dinner you guys can just eat and I need you I don't need anything yet so I need to take a break here I need something oh my god breakfast sandwich in the freezer I know I miss you guys too hopefully this will be the last day this would be the last day and then I'll I'll get up I'll get out early a bunch of days coming up make up for it alright now I love you oh no oh shoot oh yeah just send me a text and remind me to do it and I'll pick it up on the way love you too right okay sorry about the interruption umm fishing stuff a month or two into China line of stuff this is let me see okay so many laughs SS and lightning me see awesome I'm glad that this is serving some some purpose the nearby event isn't it yet the nearby event thing that's going to have it I can't really do anything about that the that the other people involved in the project actually wanted the scroll bar in there that's why I added the stuff on the bottom the little buttons that scroll horizontally because they wanted the scroll bar in there but it wouldn't show up on Mac so I'm going to leave that in there whether whether or not it looks good is a different question but they want to make sure people know that you can scroll sideways horizontally on that these things alright let's let's try to add this truncate class and see now let's not do the here alright we got a link to put on say let's just throw this link on here right now so I don't have to make a note remember it oh we got it Google Analytics strip to put on awesome well throw in both of those things to throw in the script and hopefully I can do is anybody can you just throw in analytics Script under a react component does that work I got to look up let me look up a site I did a couple months ago because I know I put analytics Script in there and it was a react site I'm looking it up right on the other screen mmm maybe I would have put it in the footer component that seems like a good spot but I would have put it yep I did okay oh you have to dangerously set H inner HTML to get it to work good thing I looked it up now I'll copy and paste this and just change the thing is there any danger in me having my analytics property code out I don't really know I'll just do it on the other screen so basically no there's no danger that's publicly viewable from dev tools so forget it I'm not going to put on another screen what am I thinking yeah any code that's clientside code everybody can see it anyway so somebody just joined are you trying to suppress scrollbars yes I am somebody said I should mute my mic when talking to someone else just in case that's a good idea I haven't been doing it just because I don't know how to do it I've never had to mute my mic yet and so I'm using software that OBS I think and just like the default mic that comes with an iMac so I never really had a unit before so I'll have to look oh so far I don't think I've said anything that shouldn't have been heard maybe there's stuff that you guys didn't want to hear but I don't think it's anything that shouldn't have been there all right so I need to add in to the footer component the analytics code I've been waiting and my boss made the analytics property you got me the code this is actually the code I used on a previous site so I'm going to go back and just grab that if you've never used Google Analytics on your site this isn't the only way to do it but this is one way that's easy you just put in this code this is just standard code that they give you and I it's the same code all the time except you just change out this little number here in this ID number and then and then it it works when you track it so I put it in I try to put it in a component that I know it's going to be everywhere and there will be a footer the same footer everywhere so now it'll be all my pages so that's done and that was actually on our list so we can move one over that was super fast wonderful it's just feel satisfying to move things over to the done list and see it grow all right correct URLs let's add what were you going to do we were going to add this this link in let me let me open this and grab the link okay so there's a button on the site now that goes to a site that's not ready yet on the courses page so this is basically just like kind of a marketing site for this program this is a whole like custom learning management system and this is supposed to link to it but it's not ready there's not even like a coming soon page yet so we need to replace this with it's actually just going to link to a PDF Oh somebody said you can use obs with a hotkey so cool yeah this says somebody asked if the session will be available after it ends it will be available I have to watch though okay I'm it I think like a session after like four hours maybe it doesn't get there was some limited four hours I remember reading about so hopefully I won't take four hours actually I am going to take a break really soon maybe maybe as soon as I update this link I'm going to do it also try to do like I'll try to truncate that what I'm just getting too hungry and I can't even think right now so I'll take a break and then maybe so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to take a break at right after I do this link then I'm not going to do another livestream on free code camp channel because they're they're nice enough to let me stream on this channel and I don't want to take advantage of that and be on here all the time and you know I don't know if this content is going to be like really good what they kind of what they want so if I come back and stream later on which I might do I'm gonna do it on my own channel so you can go to my channel there and see if there's a stream happening I'm not trying to beg for subscribers here but if you subscribe I think you will get an alert if I go live so if you want to get alerted you know go ahead and do that but I'll stream on my channel and then that way I don't you know I can I can stream and and be really tired like I am and if I say something crazy or do some crazy cuz I'm tired then I won't be an embarrassment to free code camp at that point it would just be to myself so so that's the plan let's just change this link I mean not not that you all want to watch me change a link that's pretty simple uhhuh little phases that on courses I'm glad there's not that many pages in this site this would get ridiculous to to try to manage if it was a really large site I'm gonna I'm gonna have to think of some other way to manage this when I try to apply this to a larger site all right we have Franciscan in the time there we go and here's art here's our length and let's put it there I'm going to keep the same title there because it basically works it's taking them to some information about princess getting them alright great and that should have hot reloaded no that's because that's the live site let's go back here courses and yep that works that I'm going to try to go there alright it works always test your links out at some point you never know if you might have messed something up accidentally and you got a broken link because he copy/pasted wrong if you watch my previous videos copy and paste errors are real and they can mess up your day so alright everybody I'm that I'm going to save everything from this live chat and I will go through it at some point I just don't have time right now so if you're something that you asked me that I didn't get to that you really wanted to ask me or something that you wanted to tell me that would be helpful that I didn't see put it in a comment on this video uh and then I'll definitely see it I'll read this chat too so I guess I'll see it eventually but if you put in a comment I can respond back to it thanks for sticking around for a long time we still have 17 viewers after two and a half hours which is which is great probably not too many people stay the whole time but hopefully you you learn picked up something useful or at least got an idea of you know how things are on launch day at times it's not always this crazy on launch day I usually have more time and things running a lot more smoothly but when you're on a tight schedule this is kind of how it works so I'm gonna go now um I'll probably do a livestream tomorrow I don't really know what it'll be about I guess it depends on how the site's running and if there any extra work needs done on it I'm gonna go now get something to eat I might start to stream again on my own channel so you can check me out there thanks for all the advice you all were great and helped me find a lot of stuff that would have taken me a lot longer to find I really appreciate it so I'll either talk to you later today or tomorrow
