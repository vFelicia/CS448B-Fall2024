okay let's talk about something really useful google fonts now back in 2010 google started to offer web fonts for free and it quickly became the biggest repository the fastest repository for free fonts to use on the web i can have fonts installed on my computer that's great that's wonderful and i can come in here and i can say that i want to set the font family to something that i have installed on my computer that's going to work for me if i'm looking on my web pages on my browser on my computer but somebody else may not have that same font installed that's why we build font stacks with the fallbacks google fonts or web fonts in general this is how we use some really nice fonts that are available for free i could in theory upload a font from my computer to a web server link to it from there and then anybody in the world can use it but if i don't have a license for it then i i'm guilty of copyright infringement there are fonts that are designed to be used for print publishing there's fonts that are designed to be used for the web there's ones that are free and there's ones that are paid google fonts is a collection of free ones you don't have to pay anything to use them google wants people to use nicer fonts to have nicer looking web pages so let's say for the sake of argument that i'm building this page and i want to use a serif font for my headings and then i want to use a sansserif font for my body text so i have whatever my system wants to use is the serif and the sans serif right now i'm going to use google fonts to bring in and use some nicer fonts so the website fonts.google.com pretty easy to remember and this is what it looks like these are different fonts samples of lots and lots and lots and lots of different fonts you can see how far i can scroll down here there's tons of fonts available there's a search as well that allows you to narrow this down because if you had to really look at every font it would take forever to you'd die of choices so let's start with the serif we're going to try to find one for the heading so i will unselect all the other categories of fonts i only want to find a serif one okay so in my serif groups here we can scroll through starting to look for one that we like or we can actually search for if you know the name of a font so here we go alegria i like this font so i'm going to take this one what i'm going to do oh yeah and on the website here you can also change the text that's being displayed if you want to put in a piece of text that you're going to be using to see how that's going to render you can do that so i'm going to click the plus sign right here to select it so i have one family selected now now for the body text i'm going to have a serif font for my headings and sansserif fonts for my body text so we'll unselect that go down to sansserif now the one i want to use is called open sans here it is so open sands now we can change the style of this to see what it looks like but i'm just going to add this quickly and then click on here to see here's the two fonts that i've selected and these two fonts this one's a serif font this is a sansserif font i'm going to include these in my web pages we can do the standard css i can add a link tag i can copy and paste this link tag put it into my page or if you prefer the syntax for import we can do that so i'm going to do this one i'm going to copy that come over into here and paste there we are i have an at import that's gonna bring in now let's expand this to make it a little easier to read we are so this is the url that all of the fonts begin with and then you'll have family equals the names of the fonts if you want to specify a specific weight we could say instead of bringing down everything let's only bring down 700 weight this is bold so i want the bold allegria and now i can come in here add that to my list and font weight i will set to 700 bold okay i have that saved i'll come take a look at my page there we are this is the font so if we here let's show both at the same time here there we go if i remove this there we go that's the default serif and there it is with allegria we can do the same thing down here this is the default sansserif font and then i will add open sans there we are so there's my my font pairing that i'm going to use alegria with 700 weight and open sans falling back to sans serif now i haven't done a full font stack here i've just done a web font and then a default inside here i've done the basic uh includes for these things we can also customize so with open sans we're bringing down the regular with allegria i had said 700 that was what i wanted now if i come back here you can see there's the 400 and 700 i didn't want the 400. i just wanted the 700 so i put colon 700 you can put a comma between all the different weights if you want so i can remove the regular i don't need that and you'll see as you if you add in all of these options this little thing up here will change right now it says load time slow because i'm loading all these different versions if i didn't bring all these versions it gets to become a moderate load time and then a fast load time so i'm bringing in two fonts one font weight for each that's so fast languages well do you just need the latin do you need the latin extended do you need greek and cyrillic as well so depending on the font and depending on the languages that you need you can do this okay so i've got those selected one other thing that it doesn't show in the customization but you can actually limit which text gets used i'm just going to slide this over a little bit there we are we can come in here and say end text equals there g and f capital g capital f so there's the capital g there's the capital f and i'm only getting those two letters being brought in that's the only text that i'm that i'm bringing in those the only letters capital g capital f those are the only ones that are being brought in so the other letters are all fallbacks if i was to write out there we've got google written in allegria and now i've got fonts so this would be an optimizing thing you can do or it's something like if you want to do that ransom note style where you've got different letters for different things you can limit which characters are actually brought in as part of this so that's the and text i will just leave it as a comment here there we are okay so we've got the google font we did import we could have brought it in as a link tag as well we specified the weight that we want we can specify that we only want the 400 here we're speeding it up by saying it's limited to just that weight that's the default or we can say 500 or 400 that's the default weight that we're getting in here step was to talk about those fallback fonts we've got allegria we've got this the generic we've got open sounds we've got the generic but there's nothing in between so if this fails to load or if it's really slow to load then we want to have something that's much closer matched to this so great website here mioni.ca fantastic website here's the web font i want allegria that's the one that i want it's going to download it from google fonts can play with the size so let's go 24 pixel make this easier to read there we are line height you can play with the weight so 700 is what we were using there we go 700 so georgia that's okay we could take a look at some other serif fonts to play around with this times times new roman so this is a sansserif font arial so you can compare the difference um this is how you can go through if you've got a list of fonts you want to compare it to you can provide the names here to find something that matches and then the section down here at the bottom overlapped this is showing the same text with both fonts so options so you can show them in different colors so red for one black for the other and then this creates a little animation so you can see the difference fouc stands for flash of unstyled content so you see one while the web font is loading and then it quickly changes the goal of this is to have something that doesn't dramatically change like if i were to come in here and say okay this one's 16 pixels that one's 38 pixels there you can see huge change between the two fonts this is not an effect that you want to have you want to get these things as close as possible to one another so that as you were styling them whatever font size you're picking it's the same it's going to be the same font size regardless of the font so you want to make sure that these two things are pretty close to one another now this is a bad match you would never replace alegria with ariel but palatino georgia something like that this is something that you could use as a replacement font all right so that's google fonts i will include the links for this great tool the links to the google fonts website and a code pen for this code so you can play around with it if you have any questions feel free to leave them in the comments below if you found this useful please share it with other people and as always thanks for watching
