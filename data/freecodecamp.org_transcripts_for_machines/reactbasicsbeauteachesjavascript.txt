I will be going over the basics of react in this video react is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces it uses a concept called the virtual Dom that selectively renders sections based upon state changes and it's great for making single page apps it is used by sites such as Facebook and Instagram when you first start a project you have to make sure you include react in your project code pin makes it easy if you're using code pin you just click on the little gear icon here and then under JavaScript I already have react included you want to include two things if you don't have included already you're gonna go to this quick add and you're gonna scroll down and you're gonna go to react right here and then after you click here you're gonna open up the quick add again and then you're gonna click to react Dom you need both those things react and react Dom and then you have to go to the JavaScript preprocessor and you have to make sure a Babel is selected this is going to allow you to use JSX I'll tell you more about JSX later in the video after you have it set up you can start creating a react project I have a simple page here that's been created and react before I go into the details of what's what all this stuff is I want to show you that in the HTML section here I just have one thing it's a div with an ID of container the CSS I just have something to create a bigger font size for everything so it's easier to see on the screen so let's go over to the JavaScript the cool thing about react is that you can create a whole webpage just basically in JavaScript so this right here is a component your components tell react what you want to render and then react will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes usually your project will consist of many different components that go together and then you have this line here react down that render when we're going to render our main component which is shopping list and we can pass in a prop I'll tell you more about that later and then you have the next argument is where the the component is going to render we have documented that get element by ID container so that's going to select this container up here in the HTML and then it's going to render your react component here shopping list is a react component class components taken parameters called props and return views to display so the parameter that shopping list is taking in is down here name equals Bo it's going to take in this four so here's the name of the component and here's the parameter we're gonna pass in to the shopping list component it's also gonna return this view to display so it's going to return all this stuff right here is the view that's going to display this part kind of looks like HTML but it's actually called JSX you don't have to use JSX but it makes things much easier because it's so similar to write HTML which many people already know JSX always has to be completely surrounded with one tag what I mean it's you know it starts with a div tag it ends with a div tag if I tried to add another tag here like a PT ad or something it's gonna mess things up unless if I do add a P tag I would have to start put another div tag at the beginning and then surround the whole thing with what div so I have to just add another div here but we're going to delete all this stuff because we don't need it for this project and it already starts with a div tag and ends with a div tag also there are some differences between JSX and HTML instead of class you're gonna use classname mainly because class is reserved word and JavaScript there's a few other minor differences but for the most part you can write it pretty similar to HTML inside the JSX you can put these curly braces and inside those curly braces you can have any valid JavaScript inside here we have a variable name which is the prop that's passed in so when I pass in this name Bo I can access it just like this this that props that name now just realize that in the display here I still have something that that's not actually in the code so let me rerun this okay so that's what it should look like now the other part we are going to be adding later so this right here is being displayed right here we have shopping list for Bo and you can see it's displaying wherever your shopping list for Bo and then we have this list here and the list is being displayed right here around on the webpage now I'm going to add a little more to the code and react you have different components and the components form a hierarchy you usually build components making each additional component a child of the previous component I'm going to take out these list items right here and create a list item component we are just putting in a variable which is going to be all the list items we're gonna fill this variable with the list items in just a minute but first I'm going to show how you create another component up here so here is the the list item component so we have the shopping list component here and then we have the list item component here that we're going to include in the shopping list component I haven't finished showing exactly how to include it yet this list component is actually a simpler way to write components called a stateless functional component this is four components to only have a render method rather than define a class extending react that component you simply just write a function that takes props and returns what should be rendered so it's going to take in props here and it's going to return which should be rendered which just is just a list item and then inside the list items we have props that item this is something we have to pass in to this component right now both of these just renders see we just have the render command here we have the render command here but I'm gonna add more methods to shopping list components later this list item component only just renders the one item that's passed in I'm gonna create the list as a state in the shopping list component so I just put in code inside the shopping list component this is to help create the state of the list and then we're going to pass each item of the list that we have stored as state and a shopping list component into the list item component and then that state becomes props the key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself wellperhaps are external and controlled by whatever renders the component this will make more sense as I explained this example but state and props are key ideas and react anything inside this constructor function is just run one time at the very beginning of the program in JavaScript classes you need to explicitly call super when defining the constructor of a subclass and this is where you're going to define your state variables the list state is owned by the shopping list component and the state can only be updated by the shopping list component will pass the items on the list as props to the list item component but the list iron component cannot make any changes to the items because they're owned by the shopping list component well let me finish create the code that will show you how this state actually ends up in the the list item up here so I'm gonna go to this render method down here okay let's look at this we are gonna create this variable as just an empty array called list items and then we have this loop here this that state that lists that's how we're getting this list here this list here is this that state that lists and then we're gonna do a for each loop for each item in this loop we're gonna use the item which is unicycle juggling clubs and stilts and this second thing is just the index of the items we're gonna do list items dot push so we're pushing each of the list items onto this array but now we're gonna actually use some JSX here so it's going to have this tag the list item in the tag and that list item is this list item so we are going to pass in one of these list items opponents into the array and inside the list item component we are going to put in two props so use the first prop item equals item so there's going to be a prop called item and that the value of that prop is item and we get the item from here and we're inside Jess actually gonna use curly braces to put in JavaScript so this was gonna be each of the items on the list and then we are going to pass in another prop called on click now you can pass in variables but you can also pass in functions so the on click is going to pass in this on click function which we have not created yet so we're gonna pass in the variable and we're going to pass on click as a function now before I create the on click function we're going to use the on click function up here so in the list items component I'm just going to add this on click equals props dot on click now we still don't know what that function is doing so that's what I'm gonna create now we are going to create the onclick function in the shopping list component so here's the on click function now I'm passing in a function created in this component so I'm putting in a list item component but I'm passing in the onclick is gonna equal a function in this component so now the the list item component can access the onclick function that's inside the shopping list component so let's look at what the onclick function is going to be doing we got var new list equals this that state that list that slice so remember that this that state that list is this list here slice is just going to copy the list and then we're going to do new list that splice index one so we're passing in an index and it's passed in here see when we when we pass in this prop on click we're putting the index I that are coming from the four each loop and this is just going to when we do splice it's just going to delete one item at the index so this onclick event is just to delete an item on the list and then we're gonna do this that set state list is new list so here's where we initialize the state and inside the state we have a list that's going to equal this list but now we're going to create a new list that deletes the item that's clicked on and we're going to do this that set state list is new list so it's just a way to delete an item on a list by clicking it by creating a copy of the list array instead of changing the original array it increases component and overall application performance before we ex are using JavaScript classes down here you would not have to use the the arrow function but now you have to use an arrow function so the word this will bind correctly basically without this arrow function here the word this would be referring to the wrong thing and you'll get an error so now let's run this and just just give it a test here so if I click juggling close it deletes the clip unicycle it deletes so see what that's what's happening here I'm gonna run it again if it whenever you rerun the project it will start it from scratch that's how I got these to reappear here so let's just go over really quick what's happening we have the constructor where we're going to create this list now we're gonna push each item onto the list like this so it's gonna push a list item which is basically just these Li tags with the onclick it's going to bring in the onclick function from the shopping list component and for that item it's going to push in one item at a time from this for each array so since there's three items in the list the unicycle juggling Club in stilts there's going to be three list item components in this list an array then we're going to return all this stuff here including this array of list items so we have the unordered list tag and then the list items is just all these list item tags get pushed into the array which ends up creating this list and since we have this on click event when a click it just automatically updates by removing the item so the last thing I want to add is just a way to create the items without just restarting everything okay I just added these two lines of code and I'm going to run this so it appears on the website here and we just have a text box we have a button that says add and you can see we have the ID of the text box is list item and in the button we have an on click event in the button and we've passed in using these curly braces we passed in the this dot add item function and again uses the new arrow functions but the key part is the dista add item this is a function within this component that we have not created yet so right now if i right now i can put in here that push add it doesn't really do anything that's because we haven't we haven't created this function yet so let me create the add item function okay here we go here's the add item function so let's go through what this does so we have our item equals document that get element by ID list item not value so remember when we create in the JSX or a kind of HTML down here we have this imp IM with the ID of list item so when we do the get element by ID list and that value that's going to give us whatever is inside this text box here then we have document dot get element by ID list item that value equals blank so after we get the item that's in the textbox we want to change that text to an empty string so basically after you click add item the word won't be in the text box anymore that's what this line is for because we've already used that word and then we're just like on the on click here where we're going to slice the list to create a copy of it we're going to create a new copy here is new list and then we're gonna push the item onto the new list new list up push item this I am we got from the text box and then just like the on click event we're going to do this that set state list is new list let me refresh this whole thing here and let's test it out if we add cereal and then I click Add yep see that went away from here and then it added to the list if I put juggling balls and then I click Add it's gonna add two lists and I can click valiums to take him off the list oh gosh you know but now I want more cereal let's add that again when you call the this that step set State and the component using list is automatically updated on the website now this list this shopping list for bow app is just a pretty basic example of what you can do with react but hopefully you see how powerful and all these components can be to create bigger and bigger apps this was just a brief introduction but I'm gonna be doing more react videos in the future thanks for watching my name is beau Carnes you can check the description for the code from this video so you can try all this stuff out yourself don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
