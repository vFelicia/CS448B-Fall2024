how do you get the current URL with JavaScript well there are a few different things I'm going to show you if you have this URL HTTP colon slash slash scars at CC / example / ends X slash HTML you can do window that location that protocol and that's going to give this the HTTP colon you can do window that location that host and that's going to give the card CC just that first part if you do the dot PAP name you can get everything after the the host name so the example dot slash index and if you do we know that location that H ref you might get the whole thing besides doing one at that location that href you can actually build it manually basically of our new your URL equals when to that location that protocol that's this one up here plus slash less plus one of that location that host which is the host and then you just add this last and on the path name you can also break up a URL into an array so you can access the components individually if you have you are like this where you can see it's J's nugget / is / awesome slash and next to HTML you can you can do a split on the slashes so each items between the slashes will be its own index in the array so then you can access different parts by just exiting path array and then putting the index of the part of the array that allows you to manipulate the the you have the different parts of the URL and if you want it after manipulating you can put them all back together however you want and you can also get the different parts of a URL using jQuery so this is the general thing eight to put of our x equals then you get the location dot a TDR and then you're gonna put the property what what's in here actually changes depending on what you want Francis if this is the URL and this is a little more components on the other example and then down here if you if you put host and place of where this property up here you're gonna get this part if you get hosting it if you put host name in place of that property you get this part and you can see free so you can get the pork the protocol the path name gaged ref just gives you the whole thing except it does not give you the this end part hash or search will give you everything after the question mark well thanks for watching my name is beau Carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
