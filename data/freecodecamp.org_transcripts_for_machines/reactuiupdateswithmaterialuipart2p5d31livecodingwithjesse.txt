everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie today I am wearing my high school football jerseys we had a special day at work where you could wear a jeans and your favorite team's Jersey if you donated some money to a charity so I decided why not wear my Jersey because pretty much never ever have an appropriate occasion to wear it and when I say football I mean American football so for those of you from other countries I know football means would I call suck let's see oh I need to get my spot if I go in yesterday's throwback Thursday playlist was all 90s music which was really fun because I grew up in the 90s so maybe I'll just play that there we go let's listen to 90's music today in the background all right so today we're gonna work on some of the same stuff we were working on yesterday and we may switch it up and do some stuff on the homepage or you know maybe like in the app bar at the top we'll see how it goes I did get some some more data transferred over so I don't plan on making any more routes but if we could use that Universal component to check on some of that data then that'll be cool when then we can look at the styles for that and to say hi to everyone Nikki's here how's it going also Victor San bassist I like your Jersey thank you somebody says hey you play football in high school when we play cricket cool I've actually never played cricket before I've only seen it like in movies really it looks fun though John Hanson says it's a that's cool it's a good way to donate to charity yeah yeah it's cool we do that occasionally I think we have a day like that in Christmas where you bring in presence and then they they give it to local children who these families don't have enough money to buy presents for Christmas so we get like you can wear a Christmas sweater day let's see somebody says what charity I don't remember what it's called I gotta check the email I still haven't written my check yet for it so I need to look up the name anyway let's see oh it's gonna go to the scholarship fund so students who do not have enough money today to attend school here will get financial help so that's cool all right so let's let's get started I want to make sure I start my my timer oh and we can't go more than an hour and a half I have a meeting with my boss he wants a timeline for when everything's going to be done not only for this site but for some future projects and future additions to this site which I'll have to remember to tell you about today I said I was going to tell you yesterday and then I forgot so we can talk about that maybe later hopefully I won't forget again let's say I feel like I'm forgetting something but maybe maybe I'm not maybe I just didn't have a lot of stuff to say oh I know what it is I want to say thank you to Nikki for the pull request so as you all probably noticed if you've been watching for the last few days I keep having to restart the server manually every time we make a change in the server j/s file so now we're as Harshit suggested yesterday we're using node Mon to watch for changes on a server j/s file and automatically restart the server so it'll save a little bit of time it'll definitely save me some annoyance and anyways it's really cool so if you have the repo and you do a pool make sure you run yarn because we have some new NPM packages in there so it won't work otherwise but now it is kind of cool we don't need to manually restart all right Harsha thank you for reminding me to switch my screen there we are and so I may ask one question you like your boss I I do really like my boss yep I actually I knew my boss before I got the job here we're actually both officers in this nonpro I cofounded a nonprofit here where I'm from and so he's our treasurer for that nonprofit organization so we kind of knew each other beforehand and now yeah I really like my boss so he's a good boss I like everybody my department is great it's really nice nice place all right Wow a lot going on there don't really need to see that there right now let's start your timer and get to work also let's go to the homepage No okay it is a link for a second I didn't think it was a link nothing was happening but so I just wanted to go here and show you all this is my boss Tom crow is my boss and that's his picture that's a pretty old picture but he still pretty much looks exactly the same all right so we're we had I honestly do not remember at all where we left off I think remind me if I'm wrong here correct me if I'm wrong here the last thing that we worked on were that was the size for H tags I think that's what we had done we had changed font sizes we changed some font weights and we were I we did art I I'm almost positive this was what we did yesterday and we kind of ended by testing that out and looking at the various fonts Jeff Miller thank you for reminding me about the end rot link let's get that started there we are and grok link is now in the live chat all right well since I'm on the home page right now let's just check the home page and see what's going on if there's anything that we really need to change you know style wise let's see and in case you you didn't watch the stream and we talked about this I want to do everything from a mobile point of view first and the we're gonna obviously pay attention to desktop view but I think this is the better way to go given our audience of you know mostly American teenagers as we can check let's check this out all right so here's something that I've been meaning to change for a while let's change the let's change the width first I'm going to make this side navigation drawer a little bit more narrow and I want to see how that looks and then potentially make change the width of this you see right now we have more space on this side than we do on this side so I don't want to change it yet I'm gonna wait and see what happens when we make this a little more narrow all right so we can just test it out in in dev tools here at first let's see let me get that container so with let's figure out where the width is I must be in a larger component maybe who a smaller one that's interesting hmm I'm gonna check this component because I'm not sure where that's coming in from let me make this font a bit bigger for everyone we can shrink this and let's check out our drawer component so I'm guessing it's some prop or something with is the list with 300 interesting maybe it's just getting the width from the list or the list classes the list so this div is what's 300 okay just it's this diff okay now we can shrink it here oh okay I like that I like I like I don't like that it's a weird number but all right let's let's check it out I want to make sure it looks like everything will fit and it does look like everything will fit I like how all this looks the spacing is good I was hoping if that would happen that when we shrunk the drawer a bit that this would work itself out to save us a bit of time actually I really like that and I plan on decreasing the the indent decreasing the white space here so we'll actually have even more space for our menu items when we do that that that'll actually probably the next thing we work on so I want to keep the width here so let's go back to our component and up here this is gonna look a little bit different than your normal CSS right this is we're in a react component and then react components generally you'll you'll find a lot of different ways to do styles but one of the ways is to actually put it right in the component like this and so it's a it's a constant and it is a JavaScript object but we still use all the same names and properties as we do in CSS we just camelcase them or you know we put them it we make them strings so a little bit different but once you get used to you know putting thing making things strings camel casing and obviously using the you know correct formatting for an object it's basically the same as a normal CSS and we want to apply it down here well at least for the way we have this set up we just use class name equals and then we put brackets to denote we're using some JavaScript and then we just do that classes dot list remember it's an object so we're putting in near the classes object and then the list property right because if you see these this is like key values right we have lists but then in the value is another object what that contains a key value pair of with 300 right so we can use dot notation to grab that that value anyway so a little refresher or introduction depending on where you're at with your you know react training so anyway let's change this value so I believe we added at 265 and I'm not you know I'm not set on 265 but I'd like to try it out for a little bit and see how I like it and I do want to do a refresh just to make sure that that worked yep and that works okay now let's check out our items here what's that's interesting these are actually H threes very interesting and these are I don't believe that we made these age threes we can double check when we go back to the component but I think this was what they become in material UI it's really interesting all right so why is it that's this one right padding left 56 whoa all right so I don't want to go all the way to 56 but I also don't want to be completely you know the other way so let's try a more reasonable padding of 16 pixels I think 16 is is way more reasonable all right wonderful I like 16 I think that looks looks really good and some of the items now are actually displaying on one line instead of two some of them are just too big we're not going to be able to fit them all on one line and that's okay all right I like that I like that all right so let's just figure out where this value is coming in at so it was that 50 something so let's check out this drawer new chair this drawer component we may need to go to the drawer item the leg drawer item themes facing padding left maybe it's here maybe this is where we're getting that value theme spacing unit times for all right where are we using this nested all right so it looks like we're only using nested on these ones so that shouldn't be the problem see these are the submenu items so this is the solicit item text this is really what we're dealing with here well what we wanted to change and expand this let's see maybe that's a default somewhere in material UI all right so we may just need to add in something here to override that default do I want to double check and see where that's that was at the second section said for sure all right so we're here h3 I just got to figure out where exactly to put this Oh Lin Wang says use react for Chrome good idea let's check this out we got reacts yeah why am I not seeing anything there we are it's just nested very deeply this one might be a little bit more difficult to give get access to so anyway I you can see there's definitely a difference between what we see in our code so we have this a div that's containing this and then we have a list item and then this our list item text which this is probably where we can try to put it put our new padding value but then over here there there's a lot of other things happening here that get created by material UI so let's first try let's just try to put it here and we can do class name equals put in some brackets and we'll go classes dot list item will name it list item and then that way if we need to add any more classes we'll put it on there you know what we don't want this to be all this item let's call it are they gonna save parents parent list item okay that works yeah cuz we it's just a little bit more clear what we're we're putting these alright so we want to do paddingleft of 16 pixels let's save that and check back over here let's go back to our elements here and see now we have that padding left well let's do a refresh to make sure we're not just getting the same same thing we put into dev tools nope and it did not work so let's find out if those Styles even got applied anywhere and if so where so we needed them to be applied here it looks like they did that we had a padding left of 16 here all right so if it's still being overridden so here's what we can do this is like we are definitely going to be able to override everything if we do this style to get rid of this add this in oops there we are alright so what's happened here and let's let's remove this before we forget and keep things clean so what we're doing here is adding in in inline style which if we know about CSS we know the inline styles and in that Cascade of what gets applied they're almost always applied over everything else the exception being if we want to use important with our Styles which we should use very very sparingly because it totally breaks the whole cascading nature of CSS oh I see we have Jeff Jeff put important in there too yeah it for sure and important importance like the next step if this doesn't work then we go too important but they're like levels of of how I how I override things so I don't want to jump there immediately unless I really need to yeah this one worked oh but we have issues still okay so before when we did 16 here it worked so I guess we're gonna have to put 16 for these as well so I wonder now about this the nested stuff where's that nested class on the list item all right so it's not actually on the text part so this nested value basically what I'm seeing here is that we can put a padding value here that won't mess with this padding value so if we set this to 16 as well it should fix all of our issues so we can just copy and paste at this point all right I'm not gonna try to put it up in our normal styles because we know those will get overridden so let's put this here oops it Save great alright so that's the look that that we're really going for wonderful cool that looks good while we're at this point let's let's commit this because I think we're going to move on to something something different you know there's one more thing we can do for this list before we commit I saw I keep going the wrong way normally I always have my code to the right of the actual site in in chrome but for some reason I left this to the left and now it's messing me up so we had in our props for as a drawer now maybe it's at bar I search open searched did we bring it all the way up to layout I think we did right okay I do want to set all these by default to false so we had one is true for testing so I want to set those to false now so you don't have one of those menu items automatically open all right so now that we have that let's commit this this will do a git status just to verify that we've what we've changed George where item and layout that's good what did we changing drawer okay the width was what was in drawer all right it's always good to check just in case maybe you accidentally hit the keyboard didn't realize it and change the component you don't want to change you don't want to commit that and then have to undo it and mess up you know you end up having a couple commits for something that shouldn't have had a commit at all all right so we're gonna do a git add and I'm just gonna put a little dot there little period and that means we'll add everything and now this is something different we're gonna do yarn CM and that's been set up who did that did Nicky do that or was that on though let me know I can't remember who did that I know I think it was Nicky's idea anyway we're new to yarn see them and when I hit enter you'll see in a second this is gonna walk a user through or developer through the steps to make a well formatted commit message so this is going to make the commit log be more meaningful and it'll be a lot easier for someone just to just quickly you know kind of look through the commit log and find what they want so this will say this is a new feature most of the things that we do are our new features and you can enter the scope this is not mandatory I'm gonna skip it for now but you could answer you know what is this effect what we're component then this is this is not optional we need to write a short description so in this case we're going to do narrow the drawer and so I'll miss em saying there the drawer and decrease left padding for drawer menu alright so something like that it's just straightforward let somebody know what happened we don't need a huge description here if you want to provide a more indepth description you can do that here on the next line but you can also skip this I usually skip it if I did something that was really complicated then maybe I might think about putting it in here especially I mean if you're going to do a pull request you're probably going to describe it anyway but just you know for future people that might be maintaining it if it's potentially confusing then try to explain it in this case these changes are pretty minor and straightforward so probably not needed are there any breaking changes no not that I know of does this affect any open issues I think it does maybe it doesn't I can't remember if I made an issue let me look at the issues for this repo so our current is we have five issues looking and commit missus formation is an occupation no it actually isn't so I guess I never made this an issue it was just an issue in my mind so it doesn't affect any open issues now it's gonna run our Auto formatting linting all our tests and now it's going to open up Chrome and make sure things are running in the page correctly so we don't have full test coverage right now if we did the test would take a lot longer but right now everything's passing which is great and the final step then is to do is git commit I'm sorry get push we're going to say origin and that's automatically gonna push to our master branch and there we are now all this is available at the repo description the link is in the description if you want to check that out alright I'm gonna check the time before we go on hmm I have no time did I remember to start that what time is it yeah that makes sense with the time okay somehow I just didn't notice the beeping that was happening okay let me go back to the live chat I'm gonna take a five minute break and go through and read what's in the live chat and answer any questions that might be there some bias if there's any live for Android studio I I don't know if there's I'm assuming you're asking if there's a live stream for Android studio I don't know of any live streams for Android studio if if any of you know about that please let us know in the live chat below she asks to make proper playlists please I know I know it's it's on my list of things to do I'm just been I've been really busy and I've been doing my trying to do my best to not do a lot of work at home and to be with my four kids I'm just really trying to enjoy them while they're still young and be there for them I've been working a little bit extra lately for to get this project done I still have clients and then now I have this JavaScript AF side project going which I'm not really doing that much coding it's more like I don't know like Direction management stuff for that which between all of it it's just a lot right now so I really really understand why you want proper playlists and I think it's important and I will try to get that done at at some point Evan yuan says hello and it says as a frontend developer in Shanghai China now it's 1 a.m. Wow well thanks for staying up and watching so late I really appreciate that Brooke says add a max width percentage to the drawer so it's bigger on larger screens but only takes a certain portion of the screen maximum yeah I would yeah actually that's a good idea now that I've done it like this I don't I'm gonna leave it like this for now when we do check it out and see how it looks on a large screen if it looks weird because it's so narrow then we'll go with the max width percentage but that probably would have been a better solution than what I did so sorry I didn't look over Nikki and and see that suggestion earlier John Hanson says I would still like to see an X even if it sits in the backdrop better you actually I oh yeah yeah for sure so John Hanson is is talking about in the side nav having an X here we can do an X what we could do like an arrow pointing this way either one I'll have to see what is more common maybe I'll check some other material design style sites and then that way when you use your clicks at it also makes this go here you know that maybe I'll make an issue for that I don't think I really want to get into that right now on the stream because it's it's not a style thing it's more of a function thing at this point this stream is going to be more just style based so maybe I'll make an issue for that or John if you want to you can make an issue and we'll just add that in if someone else makes an issue for at first a really helpful thing to do would be to maybe screenshot a website that has something like that just to give a visual example you know especially this people from all over the world that are reading you know that are watching and reading what's in the repo so if English isn't their first language might not be that good with it an image I think is way more helpful to be able to get okay that's what what is meant here so anyway I think being able to add an image into an issue you know whenever possible I think is a good idea I don't want to make sure you just smiling or something though I'm sure you're all beautiful but I mean like an image of a website let's see Lin Wang says what are you doing help somebody to change UI yeah we're chant we're developing a website and today I was just gonna work on the UI part of the site Shu mam says create angular apps and then also added something descriptive how it's I'm not gonna say well yeah we just we don't do angular apps right now we're even no one reacts nothing against angular I know you know people that are great developers are using angular but you know we just on this dream we're focusing mainly on react so I'd rather focus on react right now and get really good at it maybe we use angular someday I'm not sure but I don't think if we have other videos we may have angular videos on the channel I can't remember offhand though if we have I can see y'all thought I was gonna use important huh I didn't have to this time I controlled myself and I didn't dump jump straight to using important Lin Wayne says where can I see your code the link is in the description to this video a little take you right to the repo and you can see to all the code well Jeff Miller just gave the same answer thank you Jeff I appreciate it I didn't see that first oh okay look that's awesome so Nikki's is Nikki is is rook so if I you hear me use those words it's the same person so Nikki says just press enter on the guests are no questions to pick the default the default is with the capital letter so not sure why didn't pick up on that it seems really obvious right now after you said that so whoops wrong way but Lee when we were up here I actually typed in the N and I probably did not have to assuming the end was the capitalized one thanks for letting me know I'll actually really really appreciate just being able to hit enter now all right one last question before we go back and do some more coding Nikki says what is good github issue etiquette asking because the issue I created on this site has the worst title effort and I also don't know if I should close the commits discussion okay I'm no expert in etiquette so I'm just going to say what I prefer as someone who maintains you know repositories try to be descriptive but very brief in your in the title for your commits so I mean you may even want to start out and put like bug and then say what it is or if something like that just try to be as descriptive as you can check out if a repository has information on what they want then definitely follow that not every post where he does some do but just in general keep that short and descriptive and then in your actual description you can go into more depth include as much info as you can screenshots help as well if that applies and when it comes to closing it if someone submits a pull request that fixes it then it should be closed if for some reason it doesn't get closed when that happens then if you create an issue you're probably safe to go and close it if it's just a discussion if let's say the discussion comes to a conclusion where decision is made I'd say you're probably safe to close that as well yeah if let's say you ask a question and it's no longer relevant like you found the answer you realize your question was unnecessary if it was answered elsewhere you can close it that you know that's going to be kind of a judgement call type of thing you whether or not you want to close it I think and if if worse comes to worse you could always you know just say hey any objections if I close this right I'm pretty easygoing when it comes to my repos at some repos the maintainer zz it's hard to tell tone from just from text but the maintainer seemed a little bit irritated so sometimes that happens you know just kind of realize they probably are dealing with a ton of issues all the time so I'm sure it gets frustrating but anyway that's what that's my advice for for github issues I'm sure there's probably a guide out there that doesn't much better job than then I just stated explaining all all that okay let's go back what were you doing alright so we just finished up with some things in this side nav now let's look oh I know what I want to do I mentioned yesterday that I definitely want to increase the white space here at the top of this logo so let's do that now yeah I definitely just want to grab do it for this image or the span that's containing it I don't want it to extend any further like to this container because I I really like how this is vertically centered here you know what actually now that I think of it this is going to increase the height of everything so maybe it should be on the the container alright we'll mess around with it and see which would will be the best to do if I can do a bit here just to see so we'll do a padding top I padding more margin would work here it's not gonna make a difference and let's try eight pixels first see this what I was afraid of is that it would throw off this so eight I wouldn't go any more than eight here I don't know what you all think but eight pixels almost seems like too much space to me I'm thinking six I I like six a lot more let's go with six usually eights my minimum for that kind of thing but it just looks way too big now let's take it off of here and try putting it on our container padding top six pixels there we are that looks a lot nicer in terms of our icon so let's try to take that six pixels of padding on the top you know let's let's extend this as well just to make sure it's not messing anything else yeah we have some weirdness going on on the desktop so we'll get to that next first let's get this sorted out all right so this is most likely in the app bar component so let's check that out icon all right so the icon and the image are inside of this div we already have a class on it this is given the class of column one I don't think that's what we want though we want the whole thing right that's what we that's what we did so is it toolbar there's a toolbar and let me just do this all right so toolbar pretty much does there's everything so let's add the class name Oh actually app bar already has a class as well we could just add to that yeah let's just add to app bar since the class already exists it'll save us a bit of time just go paddingtop oops need to camelcase that and six pixels we'll save it and give it a refresh all right great so that works we have our padding awesome I keep an eye on the time all right looks like we're good we'll be able to finish out this I'll keep an eye on the live chat too if there's not a lot of questions then we can definitely finish out this Pomodoro cycle if there are a lot of questions I might end a little early so I can get the questions in before my meeting all right great so we've got it working now I'm sorry we've got it looking better now on a small screen now I would like to switch it to a larger screen and see what we can do about this is it's not at all what I would like to see whoops all right so there's just way too much space here unnecessary and then it's causing a lot of unnecessary space here I think that size of that logo is fine I don't want to make this huge to somehow like make up for this I think that would just cause another problem of having a logo of too big so let's try to decrease that space in here so let's figure out where that space is coming from first oh think this is it let's check that line height I mean it could just be regular height I suppose 72 where is it getting there all right so let's dig down a bit okay definitely not from within here to go up that's odd that's really odd I mean we can obviously get rid of some padding that would be fine but the height is just still just too tall yeah and our line ID here is just is not yeah the line nights not really even affecting that space alright we might just have to set a height then on this div so let's try that out let's go heights and let's just set 30 pixels there we are interesting let's see what it looks like now all right let me see I'm gonna go back to the live chat and see if anyone has mentioned a better solution okay Nicki good thought the Nicki says that maybe it's the search bar that's causing the height issue I like that idea I did not even think about that but I I'm pretty sure that you're right about that so let's check out the search bar see maybe not Nikki I really thought that that would have been it but I'm not I'm not seeing extra height therefore the search okay if we all right so if we take away displayblock from these then it actually but it bumps this up a little bit and definitely makes that smaller overall I just want to see if there's if there are any side effects that are happening if we do that that we don't want one thing I notice is that these are now spaced out a lot farther which it looks like that could be changed if we get rid of our or margin okay so that's that's better I still want to have a margin over here I guess but it may be better to actually put that on the search and it it would be easier okay hmm we may be able to Center these it's gonna work now let's put it on the do we not have a ul we just have allies all right okay guess it's not gonna work is okay all right well that's that's I guess a first step let me go to the live chat and see what you all think well John says do you think the hamburger so this icon here could be visually bigger the click size is 48 by 48 which is very good the problem is the UI seems to control that hamburger it's visual size yes you're right yeah the the click area is actually bigger than the size here yeah I'm open to maybe changing the size of this I'd go look before I change it I'd like to check the material design documentation and see if there's a standard size that we should use okay well let's let's go down this hole here let's go down this path and see what happens if we try to remove this block this display block from all these a tags and and it will go from there so it looks like the only real issue is the the spacing and I think we can deal with that my music ended I'm so used to having music on when I'm coding that it just becomes really weird without it so I'm gonna get something else on here quickly all right I have so many messages on my phone I don't understand okay so let's get this over to a component displayblock all right so in line is now the display I suppose it's worth it to try to go through a few of these values first inlineblock actually looks pretty good so does inline flex and I grid alright any reason that I should do something else so basically ever these inlineblock flex and grid are all looking pretty good let me know if there's some reason why I should go with one or the other I'm just gonna default to inline block for now alright so let's find these a tags see if we can put change their display to inline block so we're probably here at a power menu item I believe this is the component that we want I'm sorry I meant to say style this this you link ul link class and this tell live for the margin you want to take that away so for now let me just make it zero because I don't want to completely remove it in case we need to put it back in give it a refresh all right not bad not bad definitely it it messes it does mess up a little with the positioning of this search icon so now the search icon appears to be a little tall we may be able to solve that simply by making this icon a little bigger which I think would be fine so but that'll be the next step first let's shrink it make sure it fits okay all right cool looks like everything fits and let's see we still have a space here more space than I really want oh did it not get applied is that why we have that space cursor for any kind of automatic station on that's weird it should have been there we are I think I got applied this son yep it was applied this time displayinlineblock alright so now we've kind of filled that gap here which is good this could maybe be a bit tighter here but I think that's acceptable and let's work on this this search icon let's make the search icon a bit bigger and give it some left margin or padding and maybe and maybe we can move on and do something with these search icons and this button here I think I'd like to change a little bit about how this looks let's see all right we're not gonna be able to do all that I just yeah I won't have time to do all that but let me know what you think I don't I don't know that I really like this button being here I think it might be better to have just text but maybe accented in a different color so we know it's clickable I I don't know I think it's too much it's just too much right here I don't think we need to highlight this that much it just takes users to access FUS so it's essentially like a login button but it's not even for our primary audience this is for internal audience it comes my usual time of day to start yawning all right okay well we're not gonna have time to work on that anyway but we just kind of think about what might work let's shake this up it's our SVG all right yeah let's take our SVG man let's do a oops paddingleft and let's try eight pixels I like it a pixels looks pretty good let's also see if we can add if we can increase the size here so let's go height and I don't know 25 pixels width 25 pixels and this is not 35 is it not actually increasing there we are I said it said too low alright that gives us a click area of 40 by 40 which is still a little small but remember this is not going to be visible on mobile so in terms of just the click with the mouse this is fine if we wanted to have something be clickable on a mobile device on a touchscreen device you you want it to be like definitely above 40 I'm sure I think what the standard is is it 48 by 48 essentially you want it to be clickable with somebody's thumb especially if somebody has a larger thumb so that's why you want to make sure you have a large click area you don't want two people to accidentally click the wrong thing or something like that but I think this is okay let's just see I would like it to be slightly higher so I wonder how we can accomplish that the best nice will paddingbottom but you know what that definitely adds it adds more than I want to the bottom here yeah I don't yeah only I want that it adds too much let's see what else we can do Hey there we go we change the heights it looks like now that's not see that's just not enough of a change I think yeah it's we retire like a one pixel change I need like a 4 pixel change here I think I'm I'm at a time for this one so let's let's grab what worked so we definitely want that padding and we want it to be a bit bigger so let's just grab this for now and they can work on the rest at another time so in I guess forget the Atbara menu item no that's it it would it would be an app bar right yeah SVG style so I'm gonna paste that even though I know it's not you know how it's supposed to work we'll just convert it a little bit here save that and oh we already had a thing with huh interesting all right let's take this out for now and just have our padding that was the most important thing okay one refresh just to make sure that that worked no and it did not didn't work hmm yeah actually it looks like none of that is being applied hmm all right this is something you know what this is I wish I didn't have a meeting all right I'll have to work on this later on yeah so normally I would go a little bit longer and fix this but I have a meeting so let me check the live chat see if I've got all the questions and then yeah we're getting it kind of close to meeting time so it's a try using flexbox a line item Center all right okay yeah that's a good idea for that vertical line Thanks up and some condition flexbox can ignore inline block okay Oh Saad says what if you outline the button with the green color yeah that's a great idea I'll have to try that well then I'm gonna try very hard to remember that and try it on that button I I think that might end up looking really nice yeah that's that's a really good idea Oliver says what about tablets Oliver you're right you know what a tablet might be big enough to that this would show up on that's a good point all right so I should definitely keep that in mind that we want this to be clickable even like like touchable even with someone's thumb good thinking I love these strings because you all have these ideas and you know what I just I don't think about those you know maybe eventually I might think of one or two of those things but there's no way I'm going to think of all the stuff that you all think of too anyway I really appreciate all the help Blake ass has any one worked with react on Rails if so is it easier or harder than playing reacts all right so yeah Blake um you probably know I've never worked with rails before so I definitely can't answer that maybe someone else has has worked that and and can let Blake know in the live chat all right so Brooke saying that pretty sure that space was not there before the search bar was added so maybe it did have something to do with a search bar in any case I think we're getting we're getting close to a pretty decent solution here so I think we'll be alright and we won't even have to really mess with a search bar too much just want to kind of get this stuff moved up a bit and get this the proper size and click area all right well Matt the end of the live chat now and it was somewhat of a shortish a mime a word in an hour and 14 minutes so I guess it wasn't that short just went by quickly for me but we did get some things done we got that side drawers looking nice I mean that's as far as I'm concerned that's ready to launch that looks good and then this app bar at the top it's getting there it's getting there it's not this is not launch ready in my mind but it's close so anyway it's Friday have a wonderful weekend I'll see you all back on Monday Monday the stream is probably gonna be a little later than normal it's going to be tough I don't know what time I can stream because I have an appointment I have like appointments during my normal stream time and then after we'll see I'll try my best to stream on Monday but Monday and Tuesday I it'll definitely be different times than normal because of meetings and things so just a heads up on that I'll let everyone know on Twitter and I'll try to schedule as early as possible so y'all get a heads up okay Nicki says friendly push reminder okay cool yeah I will push this I kind of wanted to get it fixed before I pushed it but I think I'll just push it so you have it all I'll do that though as soon as I end the stream and yeah so anyway again have a great weekend I'll be back on Monday hopefully and it's I was gonna say have a great weekend again but that would be silly all right anyway I'll see y'all later
