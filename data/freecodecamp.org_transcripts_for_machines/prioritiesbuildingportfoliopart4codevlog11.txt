together one life look at that some compassion to make the thing is that i want to really learn spanish but getting used to having a choice getting used to the remote work to being independent from you know traffic jams plus being most effective during morning hours these two things made me think that okay after some short experiment of going to these classes and having the spanish classes five times a week i can do it more effectively one day from this public course to which i'm going will give me like almost one week all the effective classes uh at home that will show uh i didn't resign from this public course at all so i got a chance to come back there i know what i'm missing i know what methods to use in order to learn i got tons of materials at home and online that i can use the thing is that i have to be i have to be systematic as with learning coding designs spanish is important for me but it's not the priority the priority right now is learning to code everybody has got just one one life and everybody has the same 24 hours so the thing the thing is how you manage the time the thing is how you spend it selfawareness is cool and knowing your flaws knowing your energy close is really important to learn more effectively and if you don't know your priorities and you take the life as it comes you don't use it wisely i prefer being aware i prefer choosing on my own and conducting some experiments not being afraid to change the decision and try something new if it goes with my priorities if it's okay with what i'm going to achieve in life it's tuesday i'm researching how to present the design section and i've discovered that the project that i wanted to show uh already has some problems it seems that the api has been changed this is the minus when designing stuff and implementing the code that's connected with the api that does not belong to you all of a sudden it can change and you gotta change your code it's wednesday i want to show my design skills in the portfolio but i'm not sure how to do it it was the best way which projects to choose how to describe them some of them i cannot show and this is the problem when you have mba and you did something for a class you're proud of but you cannot show it so so i'm wondering how to do it and what to show so no idea right now maybe it will come with the day the later during the day during the meetings let's see an hour and a half i got a meeting in the center it would be the meeting with another free called camper but she's from sevilla and she is on her trip to malaga that's why we decided to meet so talk about our code and revise a little bit and the second video that i'm going to have today is with the product designer i hope to show him also a bit on my portfolio and to ask about some advice the main reason that that we are meeting for is to discuss his talk during the front and malaga the meetup is focused on frontend and design and since he has a lot of experience i hope he would share it with the rest of the community it's wednesday in the evening i just came back from the two meetings that i had the first one was with a free code camper from sevilla we were revising our code and we were discussing our design and learning from ourselves so i i got discovered few things from d3 today and javascript it was really awesome meeting really productive one i learned a lot the second meeting i had it was really motivating when it comes to the person and the story and his experience uh he is the designer and with about 20 years of experience and i really enjoyed this meeting because of many aspects and he uh he motivated me a lot to learn design and to try harder and this was really very awesome and meeting the people who are also doers meeting the people who have that interesting story to share and who try hard to develop to to live real life and to to do a lot of stuff not just only to spend their life passively it's really motivating visualizing your goals helps and if you see the people who who were on the same path but few years ago or who are at the same path right now it's um it can be motivating it can be inspiring you can learn a lot and you can take the energy from it for your fight one more take away if you're watching this but you are the person with a lot of experience who can share their story the struggles they had do not hesitate to share it you choose the form it may be the article maybe the video it may be that post it whatever you want sharing is something awesome you don't have to do it nobody will make you do it but it it can help so many people thursday i won't have too much time today to work on the code itself but i decided to work on the materials and the content for the design section and for sure we are iterating over it and changing the projects adding the staff with time so i will use the time that i have today for creating the content there for taking out the best example of recording some movies for deciding how to tell the story and what to focus on it's friday i'm doing cross browser testing and checking also the page on various devices it's saturday in the evening this is how the page looks right now so i introduced smooth scrolling working on portfolio sections i introduced also new mob mockups it's easier to focus on the design right now the page is available at the one who does uh right now i still need to introduce some changes like add the designer in terms of the design cases i'm working on i want to correct a bit the routines here i will also need to run the speed test and optimize the the images and generally the css javascript and things like that and what i did this week was testing for only the page and fixing some bugs this week i also had two mega inspiring meetings and i was revising the code of my previous project doing some small changes learning that basic stuff like the beginnings during this meeting of d3 and how how i should start with it next week i'm going to analyze the state machine and how it works because it seems to be pretty useful and for understanding the state and programming the logic in various apps i will be also working on the next stage of the design project i can show you that but it will take me some time but hopefully i will also learn something new and i will be able to share it with you keep on doing and see you next week
