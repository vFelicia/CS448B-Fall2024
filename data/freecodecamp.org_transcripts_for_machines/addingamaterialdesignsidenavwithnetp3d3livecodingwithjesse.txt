hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie and today we're going to go over well we're gonna start with continuing where we left off yesterday and then when I get to the question answer session I want to go over some changes that I made on project project 2 so I had a meeting this morning and had some additional project requirements so I'm not gonna code anything but I just want to go over a few things that I did because I think they were they'll be kind of useful so sorry I didn't have my camera working when I started it should be working now I was just reading about a way to use your phone as your webcam so if I can get that working I might try that and then maybe I won't have problems with the webcam anymore and it should be a much better picture too because I think I know I could record 4k video so I have no idea how many megapixels my phone is but it's it's definitely better than my builtin webcam on my iMac to everyone I see some people saying hi in the live chat there so all right let's um let's get started and let me bring let me bring over my my timer bring the timer over and let's organize our windows so you don't have to flip around so much so we'll bring over let's bring over the code here and bring that over there we go so here's just what we had so far I think we I think I accidentally searched so let's go to I think that was the URL hopefully there we go that's it all right so this is a South where we we yesterday doesn't look like much but we learned a lot about how this thing is structured so the plan today is to Pomodoro sessions of code and then a question answer session I think when we do that that gives us a nice about about an hour and a half at least unless there's like no questions and then we're maybe we'll be at like an hour and 15 minutes but I think that's a nice length a nice length for the show it gives us a long enough time to get get something done I get some questions in but it's not so long that I think it seems like too daunting if for someone to watch the replay so I'm gonna start my first Pomodoro session after this one's over I'll take five minutes and answer some questions so if you ask something in the live chat and I don't get to it just wait and I will get to it you know after the timer is up and then at the end I'll try to get to every question so if you can stick around till the end I'll definitely get your question answered and nobeard notice that I that I saved yeah I did out my I was just really busy with well with work and my family and the the nanodegree program I just hadn't shaved in like a week because every time I got up to get ready work I was always running late from like staying up late trying to trying to do this work so anyway so I finally got the shape that was nice but let's get started let's see we are today going to try to well first thing we should do is make this visible right because we're not really gonna know if we've done anything right unless this is visible I mean we can see the we can see here in dev tools that what we've done is actually being inserted properly into the Dom but for some reason we can't see it so let's figure that out first it hopefully should only take a few minutes then we're going to define those find those points where the data from the content management system is being inserted into the current menus and we're going to take those and we're going to plug them in with that repeater component that we found yesterday and we're going to try to plug them in in our side nav where we want those fields to be and hopefully it'll work out that all the links that were in the other menu are now going to be in our menu and they're all going to look right so if if you're not familiar with what we're doing this is the menu that we're going for and I'll show you I can show you the menu that we're coming from so we're one of this we want the links to be on the side here also a search bar there when you click this it'll actually open up the side knife and then this side which is taking a significant amount of time to load this time you can see this that was that was insane we didn't even see anything but white for I wasn't counting but that was at least five seconds maybe more but anyway this is our current navigation and we want to go to this okay so let's check out just right here in dev tools what's going on and the first thing I want to do let's see where all right work we're out from here many contents that's a bunch of stuff there we go so we're up here everything below here is the main content which that's not what we're dealing with right now we are dealing with the the header which I guess is inside of here yep here's our header okay oh you know what I just remembered now that we never imported our style so we're gonna use materialized and we never brought it in so let's do that I suspect that once we do that things are gonna look a lot different let's see I hope they look a lot different because they should so let's grab from materialized the CSS and JavaScript for now I think I'm just gonna load it from a CDN might think about probably in the end we're just gonna host it ourselves and we're gonna pull out everything that we're not using to trim it down a bit but for now we'll go with the CDN and then that way we'll have access to everything while we're developing I think that'll just it'll be faster than having to go and grab things and put it I've tried it both ways I've tried starting with nothing and pulling in what I want and I try starting with everything and then pulling out what I didn't use I think it does go faster if you start with everything so materialize there we go getting started okay little versions one one is coming soon I wonder how sin but for this I'm fine with I'm fine with using whatever version where we have access to okay so this is whoops I did not want to save would almost musta hit can command s instead of command C so I'm gonna copy that and we'll put that in now I don't want to put it in here actually I'm almost kind of thinking this over just coming from like the react world so I was working all morning on react and just thinking of like importing our styles and things right into the component that we need I'm wondering if it would be good to import the stuff right in this main nav component that way if there's any pages we don't use the main nav I guess we wouldn't now you know it that's that's nonsense because we're gonna end up using this throughout so we're gonna use these styles so if I was only in ez styles for the main nav it would make sense that that old thing might not have made sense I was just kind of thinking out loud but basically I was I was thinking that if I put the Styles that I needed just in that component then I wouldn't load them on pages where I'm not using that component but I'm probably gonna use that same header on every page and I'll probably use these styles from materialize for a lot of other things so I'm just gonna put it in main master test oops not that one this one okay so we can see everything else that we have I'm gonna put these right now below this is quite a large there we go I'm gonna put it right at the bottom so that way I know we're gonna override a lot of this and then whatever custom styles we need to use we'll put it under under these to be able to override the things and materialize mmhmm so how excuse me and that should that should be good hopefully we can get rid of a lot of the styles that are that are so we saw like I know I saw a custom Styles being imported let's see yeah here so we have a lot of different styles coming in you can see at one point I actually went in and I tried to clean this up so we have like the all these bundled I think it was interesting what I found was that there wasn't it actually loaded more slowly when I bundled them all together so that's why these are commented out not so I'd like to test it again and and see what happens because that was kind of odd that you know they're like that and I went through and I meant if I'd a lot of these so a lot of these are the minified versions even if they don't say men so but we'll go through a later on after we get it looking like we want to we'll go through and try to get rid of as much as we can alright so that should have loaded let's refresh whoa all right okay so it's looking pretty bad but we have something on the on the screen at least so we can see that we have you know we have some of these links we have this is an SVG it's supposed to be the Facebook icon okay so what we have I do have some Styles that I did not import it just let my mind until now that I had made some custom styles for that header I didn't bring those in so I need to bring those in I need to check to see if I did any JavaScript that I need to bring in as well and that should help get these you know down to normal size and get our colors right however we still have I think we'll still have some work to do here because we have some weird stuff going on I suspect that we'll see what happens when I bring in the other styles but I suspect that maybe there's some conflicts and you know maybe there's some really specific CSS selectors in the custom CSS that was already on this site maybe they used important a lot and it's overriding some stuff so we'll just we'll have to deal with that the tricky part is we have to deal with it in a way that doesn't mess up other parts of the site so it's gonna get I don't know it's gonna be touchy it's it's I don't know I think it'll be fun though I know it at my meeting earlier when I told everyone in my department that I started working on this they were all excited so that's that's cool I like to work on projects like that so we'll be at main that I guess I can import it here I was once again trying to decide whether I should just import this here but I probably have some styles that I'll end up using so we need to do is find here we go here's what we have for the for that nav so if you remember yesterday we pulled the mark up for it but not the style so let's grab our CSS and it looks like most of this I'm just gonna copy and paste all of it right now it's not that much there's some stuff that I don't need yet but I will need later like the footer and then the loaders I might keep the loader we'll see I don't know that it would make sense on this site I use it a lot when I have sites with that I have like clientside navigation but I'm not sure how well it would work out we'll see oh okay yeah most of this makes sense to keep so let's pull this over and let's make whoops I'm sorry I went to the wrong wrong place I have a lot going on over here on this screen and if we can make I wonder where the rest of these files are our house that is there we go alright this looks like the place alright so let's add a file in here new file we should call this I don't know I guess it doesn't matter new design I will call that not not very creative but it'll work for now I was thinking about putting something like Jesse's awesome theme or something but it's not it's the University site I don't I don't really want to mess with that okay cool I like how that looks it's a little bit different than Adam just how they how things get highlighted and it's not bad I wanted I think I want to try to match my theme that I use an atom with the theme I used in Visual Studio code since I'm used to it yeah it looks a little weird sometimes so I've been using this other theme for a long time for years all right so here's our CSS let's check out the JavaScript see if we have anything that's going to apply okay so I have this I like to put this on all of my sites and at least all the ones that I'm using jQuery with and it just keeps the copyright date current and you know everybody puts a copyright date in the in the footer you know we do have some things that I'll need to use yeah this is I have those links in the in the top nav when you click them it automatically opens that side nav so I'm definitely going to have to have to do that although I'll have to check at one point materialize change their API when it comes to modal's so I can't remember if I did this before or after that change occurred so if the modal is not working the first thing I'll check is you know how we're doing this well then I'll check the materialized docs because I had that happen on a few of my sites when I went to up update to newer versions of materialized all right let me make sure that coffee that alright we're gonna do the same thing we're just gonna make a custom javascript file so let's see where we're bringing in the mmm J's vendor well I'll find this a Jas file so that'll work there we go alright so let's make a new file let's call this new design Jas and then we'll copy that save alright now we just need to pull these in so I'll just OOP someone I'll copy this and I'll make it new design touch a s and so now we're bringing in our JavaScript and let's find our CSS and let's I want to I want to bring this down below so yeah here's what CSS oops oh this is right I didn't make it new design dot CSS and let's do the same thing with our JavaScript and that'll be it'll be better we'll have all of our stuff all together right here at the bottom it'll be easy for us to find it okay not indentation and stuff is not pretty right now what the heck no I gotta change my settings here might add key is set to actually tab instead of two spaces like I usually have it so I need to need to do some work on that alright so now let's refresh and see what we have okay a lot better not not what we want yet but it's a lot better okay yeah we're on our side now it's not working let's check our console and see what errors we have all right a lot of stuff wow that's huge okay okay we don't have the image that makes sense velocity is not defined smashing so I know it's not a function okay all right so we've got a lot of stuff going on okay okay I just checked the live chat Alberto says do you have jQuery imported above material je s I I don't know let's check that out yeah actually we do so we have we have this above let's check them it materialized Docs and see if we need a certain version of jQuery Wow okay so it's saying jQuery 3.2.1 I don't want to have to use multiple versions of jQuery I don't really know what the compatibility is I mean we could try we could try to pull in this jQuery and see you know what I'm a little bit worried too about this side nav is not a function so let's check out the documentation dear so now there we go okay well so that is in there it's it's still it's still side nav interesting well all right let's let's check on that modal right now while we have the dogs open okay I do have the newer yes so we initialize it with dot modal okay it should be all right then okay all right this is gonna be it's gonna be some work all right well let's just go through let's check what version of jQuery I was using and what version materialized I was using on this other this oversight here okay so this was that that demo site I showed at the beginning that had the version of the header that we want I'm gonna check I'm hoping that in somewhere I have a version number maybe maybe I'm pulling it from the CDN here oh it's it's possible that the code I just copied over the JavaScript have some es6 stuff that's not working I'll have to doublecheck materialise okay ninetyeight point we could try pulling this version of materialized in to see if if this works better with what we have I mean I'd rather use the newer version if I can but just to get things working at first to try to narrow down the problem I'll bring this in and then Oh comment didn't work off the check what's the hotkey to comment in Visual Studio code I don't know what am i showing this I'm sure this is plain text maybe that's why let's highlight this as HTML yes there we go now let's see if the comment works ok now it works that makes sense ok let's try this then hopefully this address works for the CDN I don't see why it wouldn't and now let's give it a restart and that'll be the last thing we do before I had set the fiveminute timer Wow I think we actually have more errors now okay we did get rid of at least one thing that was up there so maybe we don't have more maybe they're just in a different order that's done you know there's not a function I should check to see how many of these errors are happening anyway and yeah actually it will do that after we do all our five minutes a Question and Answer I'm just gonna comment out the things that we've imported and I'm I'm going to see how many errors we have just naturally because some of these may not even be our fault alright so let's take five minute break for questions I'm just going to scroll up to the top of the live chat and go on down the list do as many as I can James says hi there what are you working on just came in here we have an existing site so Franciscan ddu is our existing site it's built on a really old content management system that's a dotnet framework based the system's called Ektron and I have to work within that system to try to make it look nicer be more user friendly and most importantly load faster so right now we're just we're we're working from the top down basically and we've started with the header actually we might the next thing we might do is the footer and then we'll work on the middle we'll see but we just started with the header and working on the side nav as well and so we have hmm sorry this is a big yawn I don't know why I'm yawning so much I got it I got sleep finally last night so anyway we have HTML CSS JavaScript csharp some dotnet template things that I don't really know enough about dotnet or a cron to know whether or not this is Ektron specific stuff or whether this is stuff that's common to everything built with dartnet I don't really know but we've been working through and to figure it out and I'm gonna try to make the best of what we can with this site to try to buy us some time until I can clear out the schedule well really my boss can clear out my schedule so I can redo the site completely Sarris Manny says free code camp is amazing yeah it is isn't it and I say that not to say myself is amazing but the everybody the organization as a whole is amazing a lot of awesome volunteers just doing great stuff okay else also says I'm doing my intermediate projects check it out do you have advice for someone who's starting in free code camp my advice if you're starting with the free code camp lessons is do a little bit every day it's much better to work for for it an hour or halfhour every day then once a week you know do a large chunk like you know even if you did eight hours let's say every Saturday you're much more likely to remember and retain the knowledge if you did a little bit every day instead of just one large thing I mean it's kind of the same thing as working out right if you worked out a little bit every day your body is gonna like that better and you're going to be healthier in the long run than if you just did the crazy workout once a week for one thing you're gonna be really sore if you try to do it like that but your brains I think is the same way and in terms of a little bit of practice frequently is better than a lot of practice infrequently so that's my advice that's my main advice and other than that just stick with it and I would say try your best to do the exercises on your own first because you can definitely find answers for everything you know you can find it out there but I don't you're losing something if you just try to get answers from other people to quickly write your programming is it's not necessarily just about knowing syntax and things like that but it's problemsolving if you're good problem solver all that other stuff can be figured out you know that can be looked up but if you know we'll have all the syntax memorized but you're not a good problem solver you you end up you won't be good you won't make good things because every time you're faced with a new problem you you won't be able to you gonna be able to solve it so anyway those are my if I thought about it more maybe I'd have better advice for you but just kind of off the top of my head just a little bit every day and try to do as much as you can on your own don't let yourself get stuck on one problem for a really really long time like if you you know if you're stuck on one algorithm for days then I'd say you know just move on right but don't give up after five minutes right and I mean it'll be up to your level of patience I guess to decide at what point exactly you would look you know try to get help but I think you just get more out of it if you to really try to do the work yourself okay all right I was just looking I was almost to the bottom of the live chat so I just wanted to scan it really quite see if there's anything else that I should answer right now before we move on okay this is useful John Hanson says you can just update to the latest jQuery is fully backwards compatible that's awesome John also asks have you ever used the step function built into Chrome developer tools for JavaScript debug debugging it helps pinpoint yeah actually I have used it I don't use it often my like fall back is always console.log right I know everybody says that there's better ways to do it but it's just when you have a bug in you're frustrated that's not really the time that you want to try out something new and like have even more trouble trying to figure out a new technique so you just fall back on console look but anyway I'm there's so much stuff going on here that actually might be might be useful all right let me start up my Pomodoro session again and let's I just thought of this I had my live chat on the on this the screen on the side and so I'm constantly looking to the side I'm never really looking at the camera so now I'm gonna move my live chat up to the top of my middle screen my main monitor and then that way it'll be easier to just appear like I'm not talking like off to the side all the time and I'll be more in line with the mic so all right let's see oh okay I know what we're gonna do I'm very curious to see which of these errors is there no matter what we do if anybody listens to Spotify the throwback Thursday playlist this week I was it was a good one it reminds me of when I was in probably sixth grade seventh grade something like that so a lot of memories of former days and Spice Girls were a big deal there were three Spice Girls songs on there so I remember how much everyone loved them interesting it's possible that I removed out carousel I remove the code for the out care or so but didn't get everything let's check this out hero slider aisle carousel what F which is yeah I can definitely get rid of that because we're not we don't even have that on the page anymore all that stuff okay and main content so it's the end it's at the end of the main content I don't know if that's gonna it's gonna let us check this out in this file but it's worth a shot let's this main master yeah but scroll down now we'll have to check out the main content that component we'll do that later I'm not worried about it but at least we saw that in fact a lot of the errors are probably caused by what we're trying to bring in all right let's try then to use let's try to go with the newer version of materialized and let's bring in a newer version of jQuery and see if we can I don't want to load two at once so let's see where that other version was so much stuff where are they pulling that in whoa maybe I'm not bringing jQuery in anywhere this was commented out that's interesting it's possible that jQuery is being brought in somewhere else let me let me check because I don't know why I would have completely commented out J quick thank is this and whoa tickly tickly unless what that is and this is okay that's just our materialize it's Facebook stuff interesting let's go to our network JavaScript see here we go so we do have jQuery I have no idea what version of jQuery this is jQuery 1.10.10 in it alright let's check our jQuery thought Min Dutch ass it's in the head we should be able to see this why are we seeing this okay I guess it's being brought in by something in here meta data let's check out where this metadata is coming from you actually let's check out shake this out soon and see mater there we go metadata one is coming from here okay so we have all right I'm I'm checking the live chat real quick see if anyone said anything okay how much I'm not sure what's getting pulled in here I mean I assumed that this was where everything was getting pulled in from I could check it again okay so this favorite shortcut icons is this here so between viewport and favorite shortcut icons everything is getting pulled in by this eye so I assume so all of this so all of this is getting pulled in from somewhere else interesting okay all right so Umberto says he's never seen that so he's guessing that it's something from my CMS I yeah let's I'm gonna try one more thing oops I don't want that us once that and let's see Wow there we go let's see where else we can find this okay Wow this this is in a lot of places I don't think the tests these seem like they're all tests so let's scroll up a bit test as inflated for control I don't share this one up okay this does look like a lot of what was being yeah you know what this is not I don't think this is being used anymore because I've removed this code unless there's some part of the site that is still being used that I don't have found which is possible but in any case this is not where that's being brought in front you can see this this site is kind of a maze with all the stuff going on these all look like they're tests ooh it was fine page layout just feel like following a trail here wait a second why is that already in there yeah all right being able to search through all those the whole project at once is so useful all right I think this is not what we're looking for all right so let's go back to what we had before what are you looking at here before we looking for jQuery is so we want to find it's a page layout PB test SPX and then CMS login we could try CMS login or PB test all right you would think that a test page would not be something live but this is the file structure and this is weird in the names of files so I'm not gonna take take for granted that that would is probably not anything live let's try it out last one which I think it was that yeah all right let's see actually not I think about it I do I would have all the login stuff here so let me open this up in an incognito window so that I get rid of all the login stuff I mean I probably should worry about the login stuff at some point because people are still gonna have to you know login but most people won't so for now just to make troubleshooting easier we're gonna try to not have all this stuff load hopefully it doesn't load for users who who aren't logged in there we go well that's interesting all right let's check out elements jQuery wow it is still loading this that's interesting it's not in there anyway you know those those test files were actually now that I think about it they're probably testing what gets rendered so that's not where we want to look anyway we're interested in where this this metadata is I'm sure we bringing this in here at all no no I forgot we're bringing it in from the other place okay okay I'm not sure I'm not sure right now where that is coming from so yeah let's let's try to do something and then I can search for that later on actually let me see I'm Barrett oh saying a lot of stuff and I know then he knows csharp so let me check out what he's saying yeah it says whoa are they importing them in each page individually this one is not using master that's a relief to hear that it's not being used no wonder people don't like dotnet MBC is much better organized in my opinion yeah yeah and you know what honestly it's it's the organization of a lot of stuff is not great a lot of our older stuff is just not great so it's it's not even necessarily the fact that it's dotnet it's just there's a lot of stuff going on on top of like the Ektron system and then we had it modified I mean I wasn't here for this from from what I've heard when it was first put in place it was then modified by the company that set it up with some some custom things then people that worked here tried to patch it up and fix it and make it do other things and so there's a lot of stuff going on and there's no consistency in naming or anything it's um there are literally pages that someone like winning and viewed source and copied all this stuff and then use that as the template for a page and then popped in so it's just weird there's weird stuff going on so we're gonna run into stuff like this so but I mean I like I you know the whole point of this stream like I frequently say is just to see what it's like you know what my day is like and I imagine I'm not the only developer that to come in and work with legacy systems and you know can't just start from scratch so the last project and the project before that we were able to basically start from scratch and just build it up and that's awesome we can make all the decisions on how we want to build it unfortunately for this one we can't so it's definitely it's fun to try to have to hunt for things and see how it was done as long as I can find it in the end it's it's fun but it can make things slow and frustrating all right so let's um let's try bringing in another version of jQuery and let's just see what happens so I think I have materialized most of that below here huh yeah some materialized here I guess I can get rid of that and I can get rid of that and they had whoops under getting started I think they had a link yeah so let's just use this for now since that's the one that they were recommending and I don't want to like in production use two versions of jQuery but I just want to see what's what we can do right now to get things at least working a little bit and then try to mess mess around from there and see if we can get something that works it's not working oh okay we got some different things now mmm I do wonder why while we're getting some of this stuff whoops I'm wondering where this is coming from interesting this shouldn't be pulled in right now right maybe maybe there's this stuff that we put in down here is pulling this ends though oh yeah nondescript stuff we're not in the main one sorry I was looking at the wrong thing yet you need to go to the main nav so actually I think yeah it's probably coming from here we're still pulling these in it's fixes okay yeah I think it's this okay actually it shouldn't be right where do we put this uh so this is inside the header so it should not be outputting anything outside the header right this is where it ends all right my timer is up so I'm gonna finish this up in just a minute I just want to see what is over here I think what it was probably happening is that side nav takes up space and then the JavaScript in materialized pushes it over and that JavaScript we're getting an error and it's not running and so this is staying out so it's pushing everything over and so that's why I mean this button doesn't work right because this never initializes since everything's pushed over that's why this is going off the side there so I think that's our problem our main problem is the JavaScript just is not running because it looks like all the CSS is fine right we're still getting we were getting some weird stuff from what's already there so you can see on hover it's changing the blue which it shouldn't do so but other than those few things our CSS is fine it's just the JavaScript it's not running can I try let's try wanna try this with our new version of jQuery and see if it makes a difference okay no difference there and last thing and then I'll be done let's not use this version of jQuery and instead let's uncomment that no still still not working although actually this is I had forgotten that this is the way it works but whatever version of jQuery we load last seems to be the version that it's trying to use so let's get to know I want to get rid of this because really I mean this is the only error that we're getting right now so I also figure out where this is and remove it the others checking to see if it wasn't that al carousel wasn't loading anywhere else but I'm gonna see it okay all right now it's time for questions and I'm I think I got through a lot of them so it probably won't be a very long questionandanswer session so if you have a question you think about asking it put it in there now because once I get to the bottom I'll probably go on for like three minutes longer than I should and then I'll end and turn the stream off but I don't want you to miss out in case you want to ask something so if you're not interested in the question answer session thank you so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow so hopefully you can join in then if you don't have a question but you are knowledgeable and like to help answer questions that would be awesome it's definitely way better when we get a variety of of opinions and in answers right I mean we can't all be experts at everything so it's better when we have people that know about different areas all right so let's let's go oh you know what I just remembered I told you I told you all at the beginning that I was going to show you what I did on project two because I thought it was really interesting so let me take I'm only gonna spend at most five minutes on this so I'm setting my five minute timer so I don't keep going for too long and let me show you as quickly as I can what I've done so here's our service request form okay and I've added in a few things so now they're automatically if you mark a field is required and asterisk is going to be there so that's I don't know it's it's a simple improvement but I'll show you how I did it in in react I mean it's kind of cool it's not super complex but I just like how it's done also I've added this if you click photography now you have two more required fields that pop up so and some of them don't and some of them do but this was some feedback I got earlier today that the video people and the people in charge of photography both want more information but it doesn't apply to everything so I thought that was kind of cool so I just want to show you oh the other thing that I did was I changed the field the validation so I don't know if you remember I think this happened once before if I were to do something like this and have a space it would have marked the name as being invalid so it's not it wasn't obvious from the name of the validation that it would do that but it did so I had to change it from like alpha to is words something like that and if you change it to is words then it lets you put spaces so a lot of these I just removed the validation completely because there really wasn't anything built into formzee that would fit because really in these you know primary target audience I they could type a paragraph that had numbers letters special characters at that point what am I really you know trying to validate there and remember write the validation clientside is really nothing nothing to do with security because people can get around it it's more just to be helpful to the user so anyway so I decided to take off the validation except for some obvious places like email phone actually I took it off a phone too because somebody might put want to put their extension here so they might write ext period and then a number which would be invalid so anyway so I took it off of a lot of them but it's really nice that it will be on email though and then that way it'll force people if they accidentally mess up their email or something I mean it won't check if they misspell something but at least it'll if they left out a dot or something really important would it would let them know all right so here's how I did it whoops okay so I've added in in in the data for the check boxes this is the coolest thing I did so I'm going to show this just to make sure I get it in I've added in this conditional fields that's an array of objects and you see the objects are exactly the same data that I'm passing in up here for the other text boxes right so I've added into the service request form here where we have check boxes and right so here's where we're pulling in the check boxes there's some more space here so you can see so within this right where we're checking for all that data in here the check box data in here and where we're looping over that and when we get down to here I check to see if there are conditional fields if there are conditional fields then I check to see through this state ok I check to see if the check box is checked that's what this does okay that's not really obvious right away but that's what this is doing so it checks the check box and so if there are conditional fields for that particular check box data and then if the check box is checked then it renders everything that's under conditional fields so since it's an array of objects we can do a map on there and then we map and we just pull in that same formzee text component that we've used at the top for the you know for the name email and all that and then we just pass in our props and since we we did it the same way I guess this is almost completely the same I've added some different styles just because of where they're at in between those checkboxes and I've also added in for the required we have for the floating label Texas field field required if if it's true then we do field name plus and asterisk if it's false we just put field name so that's how I did those asterisks as well yeah so that's how I ended up doing it I tried a couple different ways before that that didn't work and then it finally hit me that this was the simplest way and it would work and I can't believe I didn't think of it sooner so I actually tried like passing in all of this stuff as data in a string which was ridiculous and obviously didn't work and I tried putting this in in our icon check box thing but then I would have to been passing information back and forth about the state of of those text fields right because remember they're controlled components so right we're putting in the value whatever gets typed in there goes into state and then the value of that input comes from state right so I'd have to pass that back and forth from the parent component which was service request AAS so that was ridiculous as well when the simple thing was just to put it in there unfortunately that was the third thing I thought of but it was still cool to go through here and just kind of see what's possible and not possible so anyway just thought I'd share that with you all the it's all on github now so if you want to check it out a little bit more detail you can do that all right now I will go to the questions and let's see I got to figure out where I left off it okay Carlos asked what version of jQuery I'm using I assume that you saw embarrassed this looks like 1.1 yeah so there are multiple types so there was I commented out one one point eleven something and then so it was falling back to an older version one point ten something to the evidently I was using one point ten without realizing it at first and then you know we tried we tried at version three nothing gave us the result that we wanted so off to do some more troubleshooting okay Evo says or I bow I'm not sure I'm not sure which way to pronounce that it's Ivo says hi Jessie long time no see the good old memories working with asp.net in school still haunt me to this day hey I just noticed my camera didn't freeze up at all during the stream so hopefully it lasts and I'm still going to try to use my phone next time but I'm glad I didn't have to restart it all right so uh Abdul Azeez says hi Jesse is it not possible to work with the computer I see you are working with two computers another question is what is the difference between free code camp and github okay so Ebola answered the saying github is a code repository storing code and free code campus community of developers yeah yeah that's that's pretty much it right you can store your code using git on github yeah and free code camp is a lot of different things go on I think its main the main thing it's known for is its courses so it's coding exercises but there's also a lot more going on now so they have a really active forum they have medium publication so lots of blogs and then of course we have the YouTube channel now that's really picked up and we we have a lot of videos every week and yeah so it's just we a loved one or not and then there are also groups free code camp groups that meet up frequently so all over the world so this it's a lot we got a lot going on and also I'm not I don't understand what you mean by your first question about working with two computers are you saying I think I'm trying to see if you can see my other computer in the background if that's what you're talking about I do mainly just work with one computer and that's fine one computer with three monitors and then the computer behind me is just an old Windows laptop connected to an external monitor so I don't go crazy trying to do things on one screen and I just use that for testing and in fact something happened and it isn't connecting to the internet anymore so it hasn't been able to connect to the for at least six months so I really haven't even used it and I think I'm better off because it's so old I'm afraid it'll get a virus if I try to connect to the internet anyway it's just and it's super slow so I don't really need to use it that much anymore because I have browser stack for testing and it's faster for me just to open browser stack on this computer and test then to get that thing started up and connected anyway I assume that's what you were referring to if not let me know and maybe clarify a little bit more for me nova glow asks what kind of degree or training did you get to become a developer okay so my training was for the most part informal I do have I have a video on my channel the links in the description on how I became a frontend developer so if you want a more indepth answer I think that's maybe like I don't know a 10 to 15 minute video of me talking about it but basically other than a little bit of training in HTML and CSS in high school and one programming course in college where we use C++ all of my training has been just online either taking mostly free courses online reading you know reading blogs reading free JavaScript books documentation things like that and just learning by trial and error on a lot of projects I was lucky enough to have basically the role of a subcontract subcontractor for a lot of things so I got a lot of work doing just so many different things you know relating to websites everything from writing blogs for companies doing SEO work all the way to JavaScript stuff and I get paid for that and I was able to spend a lot of time learning and didn't have to worry about billing clients or trying to market myself or going to meetings or anything like that because I had someone else that was doing all that I got paid a little less because of it but it freed me up to spend a lot of time being able to learn and get paid while I was doing it so that's that's mostly where I really went through a lot of my learning now that I'm employed fulltime as a frontend developer I've learned a lot while I'm going through projects and sometimes if things are a little bit slower I can spend some time like doing more targeted learning so doing some free code camp exercises or catching up on you know videos from from conferences that are on YouTube and things like that sometimes I'm able to take some time you know maybe like on my lunch break or something I watch some tutorial videos so just here and there I picked things up you know when I needed although I am taking a Udacity nano degree course that's about the closest thing to formal training that I've that I've had so anyway like I said you can watch that video too if you want to hear some more about it and I didn't mention my I just looked at your question again you asked what kind of degree I had I have a degree in business so it's not really related to confuse whoa Evo Eva just had a great idea I love this idea so Eva says you can also try to hack it by overriding the jQuery nsj file in the UX folder but that is just the ultimate hack I like that that is like it's it's a little bit sneaky but it's it's so simple that's like the I still would like to know where it's coming from cuz it'll always bug me if I don't find out but just to get things to the point where we aren't loading a bunch of different versions of jQuery and we have a new version that's that's a great idea I'll just keep a backup of the other version in case it breaks a bunch of stuff which it shouldn't but all right I think that's that's the best idea that I've heard today John Hanson says would it be a good idea to comment out the template variables then bring them back one by one unless there are too many of them yeah actually I thought about doing that I think if we had more time I probably would have done it because that right we're kind of getting towards the end there I'm gonna say I'm I'm gonna do a lot of a lot of searching so we'll see we'll see what's going on I think I'm right after the stream I'm gonna stop working on on my work stuff and I'm gonna start working on my project for Udacity but then tomorrow when I come in I think all morning I'll either be searching for the answer to this or I'll be finishing up some things on that Resource Center on project to which there's not really that much left to do but hopefully I'll find it and then we can actually work on something I'm running out of titles to put in my video I just put it in today's video about the side nav I'll just have to put part two at the end I guess oh okay John Hanson said I could browse our hard reload to clear the cache if it's holding on to jQuery version actually that's a good idea but I think I have it yeah yeah I have it so that if I have dev tools open nothing gets cached so that's really helpful so check out that setting if you if you're not familiar with it already because you almost never want the cache working when you're developing so so nothing should have been cached I'll probably try it though later on because you never know I mean it's uh it's always worth trying too hard refresh just in case Shay says hey Jesse thanks for these thanks for the videos would you mind giving a brief description of doing local development versus using code pen or cloud 9 etc or could you point to the best place to read up on how to do a simple project locally set up the local O's for testing etc okay yeah I'll try to explain this briefly also so at the end of those sentences is etc' period right which is etc now this is totally unrelated to code but you may have heard from previous streams that I used to teach Latin right and that's a Latin word at cetera but it always bugs me when I hear it because everybody except for one person I've ever heard pronounces it etc but if I were teaching Latin and I wanted to say that I would say etc right so I don't want to say it like that and sound weird so I still say etc but anyway it always bothers me so this I basically still want to know does anyone else pronounce it like the proper Latin way I'm wondering especially like people whose maybe a Romance language is their first language I'm thinking they would be more likely to pronounce it properly and maybe it's just Americans speaking English they can't pronounce it right I don't know anyway and Latin has multiple pronunciations depending on what type of Latin you're studying so I guess it's I shouldn't be too weird about it all right so I'm gonna try to take there are a couple parts to this question so I guess I'll talk about the doing like cloud development like in browser development with code pen and cloud 9 so I would say this code pen in cloud 9 urns are in two different classes right so in terms of ease of use I'd say there's like a spectrum right and the easiest would be something like code pen or jsfiddle would also be in there I think there's some other ones but basically you just can write code and immediately see the result usually you have like three windows one for HTML one for CSS and one for JavaScript like three little frames and then there's another frame that shows the result it's super easy so basically you're just working with three files it does let you import other libraries and it's actually really easy to do in code pen I haven't used a fiddle in a long time so it might be easy in there as well but there are some limitations right I mean you're you're limited I would never do a really big project in there right with that needed a complex folder structure as last time I use something on code pen like you can't host files there you have to import them also so it's limited but it's really easy you just need a browser to get started and then a little bit harder to use is cloud9 or things like cloud 9 where you have what basically looks like what you see on on the screen right now but it runs in your browser all right which is actually kind of interesting because this is running on chromium right I think the s code is an electron app so technically this is running in a browser right so but anyway you you all probably know what I'm talking about right it's not running in this is running on my computer essentially like a native desktop app but cloud9 would run in your browser you'd open up your browser you type in the URL it's c9 IO login and there you are and you'd see something like this and you'd actually see I got rid of it on Visual Studio code but at the bottom you would see a terminal that you could type real commands and it's a Linux server so you could type in all your normal Linux commands you can load things with NPM you have all your folder structure over here and you have your code here and you also could have another window to have the live preview and you could split the window out in fact and you know put it on another screen if you want but it basically completely mimics your local development environment you're still somewhat limited because I guess it depends on what version if you pay for you know faster server more space it could be really nice but you still have you you're going through the internet right so there's always going to be that I guess would you call latency right then that lag I mean it's not bad if you had a good connection but you have to be connected so you couldn't you couldn't develop you know offline like that the Third Way and then maybe there's more ways that I don't know about is you've developed locally and I may I say that's the hardest because you have to set up cloud 9 sets up a lot for you but locally you have to set everything up like if you want to develop let's say react like we are doing for our last two projects you'd have to have a computer I mean it doesn't really matter if it's Windows or Linux or Mac but you'd have a computer you need to be able to install node in npm and then you need to install all your your other packages yourself it's on your machine it's taking up your space on your computer like you know you have to have a separate terminal I mean a lot of like Visual Studio code comes with the terminal and stuff but to be honest with you I'm Way more satisfied with using I term two separately then using this I mean especially if I want to do some stuff in the terminal and I'm not actually using atom or Visual Studio code I don't have to open that up just to do it so so now you have two different programs right you're running us you got to run a server on your own machine to do local development so you can see like it just grows in complexity the cool thing though about cloud 9 and things like cloud 9 are that you could potentially do like real development with you know loading and PIM packages and all kinds of cool things that you couldn't do with code pen but you could do it on something like a Chromebook where you know you normally don't have access to load something like node and an NPM and all that stuff on a Chromebook I know there are ways to unlock it but let's say you didn't want to void your warranty you could do it in browser potentially you could do it on a tablet it would probably be harder depending on what kind of tablet you had but you know you could do it there I've never tried to open up cloud 9 on a phone but that I mean it might be possible so anyway hopefully that helps that ended up being a really long answer I probably could have made a whole video out of that but anyway that's that's my opinion on that also the other part of that question was could you point to the best place to read up on how to do simple project locally set up a local host for testing I would trying to think where I saw I I would like to do some videos on that but I'm they're not doing them yet as you all you all know who's been watching I really want to do a lot more videos but I just have not had time so I don't know when that'll happen but until then I think we'll stern who does the what is it learn code Academy YouTube channel will stern made a bunch of videos on setting up development environments and things but they're kind of a little bit older than maybe a few years old so but it'll get a lot of the concepts will be there right I mean he goes into like webpack but he also goes over gulp and grunt and things like that so you'll you'll get an idea for what's out there and how to do it and then you can maybe read up on some newer things if you want to but you should be able to get the basics there you know if you like that I don't I don't really know of anything offhand like for you to read I'm sure there's a lot of good stuff out there I just learned how to do all that from YouTube videos but that's a good place to go and let me know if you have any other question if you try it out and have other questions and stuff just let me know in the live chat or you can message me on Twitter or something and help you out if I can okay just a few more things here in the live chat I'm down to the bottom now Ali says let's see okay this was in response to someone else's question in the live chat so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna read that okay ebo says sometimes with these kinds of projects I just feel it saves you a lot of stress and hassle if you just start over I definitely agree and if I could I would just start developing the new site right away honestly I think it's somewhat of a waste of time for me to do this now because I hope to redo the main site within the next like year or so and oh hey I think my daughter is at the door so hold on a second me open the door look you can see Thanks there you go yeah the cameras right over that green light is yeah so what do you think you're gonna say something there the people on YouTube on YouTube there are 21 people watching right now yeah so this is Gemma my daughter Gemma and this is my son Raphael up here so they they just brought me some food because I'm gonna stay here at the office late and work on my my project for Udacity so it's a lot easier to get worked on here at home there's too many kids I normally like having all the kids around but not if at work to do just let you come in by yourself but I kind of couldn't do well I'm gonna finish up my youtube show now do you guys have to go okay alright that was fun um yeah my daughter Gemma wants to be like a YouTube chef like make cakes and stuff so there's a youtuber named Gemma whose show her show is cupcake Gemma and she has like some bakeries in England and my daughter Gemma loves that show so well maybe one day I'll make Gemma YouTube channel I bought her all kind of baking stuff for her birthday it was at the end of August so so we'll see anyway I'll give you back to the coating now to only only have just maybe two questions left oh okay so the last thing Evo was saying it's better just to start over sometimes okay now I remember already basically my opinion is that I should not be trying to fix this site that instead I should just start on the new site and we could probably get a new site up and running and like probably I'm gonna say like six months not that it would take me six months but just there are so many people that are going to be involved in making decisions on that that I know it will take forever to get approval for stuff so because really we've already done stuff even on this stream that we could use to build our own site like if we took if we took what we did for that project one right and use next J as some serverside rendering with next and and react and just linked it up with a content management system through an API like WordPress or something else then we basically have the site I mean the main site right now Franciscan ddu has like three thousand plus pages maybe more than that but in reality they're you know we don't create all those pages right we create a home page template and then just a few other templates for the different types of pages and then those just populated with data from the content management system so the hardest part of that whole process would just be getting the data that's in the extra on CMS right now and getting it transferred to something better I don't want it to stay on there I don't want it to be hosted on campus anymore because it's it's slow the time the first byte is just unacceptable so that's the biggest thing and once I have that down actually developing the site it's not really a big deal so to me you know spending weeks on this is just kind of it's time that I could that I could already have that other site ready so I mean yeah I'll get this done a little bit faster and there'll be a slight increase in speed it'll look nicer but right now it's just like it's it's like putting a bandaid on something like underneath still needs it's it's still damaged it still needs work it's you know it's still slow yeah so anyway that's that's my opinion about this and so and I'm I'm comfortable saying this on YouTube because I've already said this to my boss and this other people that that work here's but that's how it is right when you when you work with other people you can't always do it however you want to do it sometimes you got a you know you got to wait and you got to do other things and anyway so we'll do the best we can you know and I think it's gonna it's going to be good and people are gonna be impressed users are gonna have a great a much better experience so is it is it the best thing we could do right now no but it's gonna it's gonna be better ok Tony yes how long have you been coding I think like five years I don't know every time I get asked this after think about it I just need to write it down and just stick it you know on my desk let me try to think so I've been at this position as a frontend developer for a little over two years before that yeah before that I think it was about three years that I was doing some website related stuff so I wasn't really doing like advanced coding stuff the whole time when I started out it was you know kind of maybe just customizing some WordPress themes just really minimal CSS work you know minimal HTML almost no JavaScript and then I started to get more into it so I started a lot better with CSS and then started getting in JavaScript and now obviously you all see what I do I've been you know I've been streaming all summer so you know I think you have a good idea of where I'm at now so but basically it's been like a fiveyear span of but I would say three years I've been like really trying to learn JavaScript as much as I could you know I can't always do what I want because it depends on the projects that I have but three years really for the JavaScript but just in terms of like web design and development in general five I did do stuff here and there before that and as I mentioned earlier I have a video on my own channel and I think the title was how I became a frontend developer and I go into it more in terms of like the points in my life where I actually did do web development work because there were some other other points like in high school and college and stuff that I did some stuff with that okay Ali says code pen allows asset hosting if you use projects rather than pens okay cool is that a new feature did I just miss that before like I said I haven't used code pen in a while but that that's really cool and is that a paid feature or can you do that on the free version now anyway that'd be good to know so I said earlier that you can't host files on code pen but I was mistaken so I guess there is a way I'm not sure how to do it but I think there is a way so that's that's good that's really awesome I see a lot of people doing the early free code camp lessons when they're first going into code pen aren't sure how to get images in there sometimes I see questions about that so okay Ali says you get one free project okay so you can do one one free project and actually host files there and then I guess if I don't know how much it costs but you could you know get the pro version and have more okay I see several people were saying that my kids are cute thank you yeah I think I did an alright job on on the kids so far none of them are I haven't messed any of them up yet hopefully I don't my oldest is only eight so I have a while to go okay nobody said I didn't know you had children I actually have four children so you saw my oldest too so Raphael Gemma and then I've Ambrose who's three and Cordelia who's about to turn one in a few weeks she'll turn one on October 5th so yeah so I'm busy alright I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so I'll be back tomorrow and hopefully I'll have this to the point where we're not getting errors and we can actually start to work on things a little bit more alright so huh nope you just said I am shocked you shocked that I have four kids okay now I'm getting a few more things in the last here's Ali says that's impressive how often you stream and have four kids me actually so me being able to stream this much is really due to my boss letting me stream at work which is really awesome and he's a smart guy and he so he realized right away that me streaming would would not only be good for me and good for you know hopefully good for you all if you know you can learn learn about what I do or at least learn from my mistakes and but it would also be free publicity for the University so just to put it in perspective I think the university's YouTube account has maybe 20,000 subscribers free code camp has over 200,000 subscribers so it's it's a little bit of like you know hey this will be good for university but also and this was unexpected at first I've gotten so much help on my projects by pool requests and by you all you know helping that it's really been a huge benefit to to the University you know to my department and in all our projects so I hope that he continues to let me do this and so far everybody's excited I I mentioned you you all in meetings frequently and sometimes even by name and I'll say you know hey soandso submitted a pull request and it was awesome or you know and everybody's really excited about that so your your you don't get to interact with other people here at the department but they know that you're there and that help and they're all happy and excited about it so anyway so I hope I can keep doing this if it ever happened that it wasn't allowed to do this at work anymore then I probably wouldn't be able to stream this frequently I just have to see it at that point I would I wouldn't want to stop streaming but you know it would be different the schedule would be different the projects would be different but hopefully that won't happen and I'll keep I'll keep doing this but yeah so that's how I can stream with four kids let's see us Sarat says can I be as good as you in two months with six hours of coding a day with consistency I may be I mean it just it depends on how fast of a learner you are what your background is already like what level you're out in terms of your skills with coding I so I don't know there's going to be it in terms of like just coding you can definitely get so like if you wanted to focus on just react and build react stuff you could definitely get there but there's gonna be like a broad area that you just can't get without time and that there's certain things like having persevered through like projects that are really hard or dealt with clients that are really difficult or like there's so many things that you can't just do it you know it just it's something that happens to you and it it makes you better it changes the way you look at things so things like that you obviously can't get by just training hard for you know for a couple of months but like as I was trying to say a few seconds ago like if you wanted to focus on a specific area you could definitely get as good or better than me quickly you know my five years of coding has been spread out over so many different things like I did a lot of search engine optimization work copywriting and a lot of WordPress stuff I was trying to learn angular at one time it's just been spread out over so many areas that I definitely think it's possible to get really good better than me at one particular area if you were to focus on that whereas I never really was able to focus until I started working here and really narrow down like this is going to be our stack this is what we're going to use and being able to commit to it which right now it's basically committing to reiax you know when you commit it's tough because you're basically saying no to everything else but by doing that it allows me to focus and get better it allows the people around me that are going to work with me to be able to know and for me to be predictable in my work so anyway so yeah it's entirely possible but I would say it's only possible in the sense that you would have to concentrate on one area and and there are some experiences you just can't recreate so how much that contributes to me being a better coder or not I don't know but I mean I'll tell you this like when you bring down somebody a business's email system for three days you definitely never ever mess with MX records again without copying them down first so like there are things like that that just like see her into your mind like something that needs to be done and yes I did do that before so it was it was a business in a big city in the United States that made a lot of money and I have no idea how much money that I actually cost them but I I did pay for them to hire somebody else to fix it so and that other person made a lot more per hour than I did so that but I think I got off easy on that because I still worked with that client for a long time after that it's actually one of my best clients so anyway so let me see I don't think there's any other okay one more course keep you in more questions hey it's fine okay so Hodor says quick question can link your coding environment which extensions are you using on on paceman I think there's a command to get a list of extensions okay yeah I'll have to there there is a way to get a list of extensions I'll probably get you the atom extensions because I haven't really loaded anything on Visual Studio code so that wouldn't be a useful list but I'll have to get my list of atom extensions and I'll put them I'll probably make a gist and have it in in github you know linked up to my profile so I'll have to remember to do that I'm I don't know if I'll get it done you know this week but it'll be on my list of stuff and I'll make sure I say something on the live stream about it no BS is what time in your country here 156 a.m. no beer are you in India or close to India because I'm pretty sure that's the time zone there it is four o'clock here yeah it's a 358 p.m. where I'm at I'm in Eastern Standard Time so there's the same time zone as New York and the east coast of the United States oh cool no beer is in Bangladesh so yeah I've had enough viewers from India that I I always remember what time it is in India and when I tell people like they look at me really weird like why would you know what time it is in India so I think it's cool it's cool to know that let's see okay zanny says why are you using classic ASP because I'm forced to that's so this is it's a preexisting site that that kind of old and I just have to make the best of it so I'm just gonna try to clean it up make it faster make it more userfriendly and so I can't there's some things that I can't change on it and there's a lot of things that just aren't really worth it to dig into because this site won't last much longer if I'm not working on a new site sometime within the next year I will be very surprised because I've been I've been planning it like since before I even got the job here I remember before the interview I did a huge report on all the things that would change on this site and I turned that in on my in my interview to the person who's now my boss and yes and I actually I went through I think I even had code samples of like code that they could use to change the site right now so I think that that helped me get the job they were they like that but I'm ready it's been like over two years that I wanted to change the site so I don't want to wait another year so anyway that's why I'm stuck with with the classic ASP and I'm not really interested in trying to figure out how to change it so it is it is what it is right now but we're gonna make the best of it and and try to make this site I want to try to shock people that are used to this site with the new thing I want them to think that I completely redid the site but in fact we just are gonna change a few things you know to make it better so but I really enjoy doing things that other people think you can't be done right so I mean I know you all realized that these things are possible but a lot of people who aren't really into web development sometimes just they just assume that things can't be done because they may have been told by at some point by a developer like all we can't do that and who knows why that developer said that maybe they just meant you don't have the money for me to do that or I don't have the time or maybe they didn't have the skills to do it or didn't want to do it who knows but it's happened frequently at the University here that people have said I'll say well why don't we do this and I say all I know we can and sometimes it's literally as easy as 10 minutes in dev tools and you can find a fix those moments are really awesome when I get to see somebody sits like I wanted to do this for years and you just did it in 10 minutes like those are really cool those are the moments that I like I write down or I usually don't write it down I put a note and Google keep just so I remember and then on bad days I can look at that and say like oh I did do something awesome but anyway I'm to the bottom of the live chat for real this time so I am gonna go now unless somebody sneaks a question in there before I can be finished but thanks again for watching thanks for all your help and for all the all the questions you all have great questions today and I know I talked for a little while on the question so sorry sorry if I talk too much I know occasionally I'll have people in the comments or in the live chat telling me I talk too much but it's not it's not a tutorial stream you know it's it's I like this question answer thing and I think it's it it makes this stream more unique if it was just me trying to teach you how to code it would not be a great stream because there's so much I still need to learn but my personal experience is unique to me and you can't get that anywhere else so if I share that then there might be some value here all right so I'm going to go now I'll be back tomorrow thank you so much for watching and have a great day
