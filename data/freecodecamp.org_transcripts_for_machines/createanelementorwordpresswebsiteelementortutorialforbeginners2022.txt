in this course you will learn how to create a custom website without any code using elementor and wordpress i'm beau with freecodecamp.org i've created a few popular wordpress courses and this one is specifically focused on elementor elementor is a free wordpress website builder and this course is all you need to learn how to build a bunch of different types of websites and you don't need any prior experience to follow along you will learn a drag and drop system that allows for easy and limitless customization so you can build the perfect website for your needs and the website will look great on both desktop and mobile so let's get started the first step is to get a domain name and hosting we'll be getting that at hostinger.com but you can still follow along if you use a different hosting provider hostinger provided a grant that made this course possible but i had already used hostinger personally in the past and had a good experience hostinger is optimized for wordpress sites and has a 99.9 uptime guarantee they also give you a free domain and free ssl so we can just go here get click get started and then you can decide whether you're going to create a brand new website or transfer an existing website well we're creating a brand new website and you can you don't have to go through all this but we are doing a wordpress here and i'm just going to go through here and it'll tell you what kind of package we want to do so we can just skip this for now because this is actually an upgrade but we don't want to upgrade so i'll just go to skip here and then it's going to recommend the premium shared hosting plan so you can actually go and just select your plan manually but this will help you figure out the exact plan you want you can see right here you can actually host a hundred different websites on this plan and you get a good amount of storage and you get unlimited bandwidth so that's pretty good you includes a free domain and then ssl will make it so you have a secure website so this is a good option so i'm just going to select that and then it's going to show where you can actually upgrade if you want or you you can choose a different amount of months and you can see depending on how many months you buy a time is is how much it's going to renew for so you can see this one renews at 699 799 899 or 11.99 a month so just pick whatever one you think is gonna work best for you if you're just testing it out you could just do a the one month plan or if you know you're going to have a website long term you can do one of these other plans and then um after you get all this set up you can go through just to create the account and you can select your payment and then you can submit it so i'm not actually going to type in everything but it's pretty straightforward if you're going to create your own account for the first time so after you get logged in and possibly as part of creating your account you're going to want to get your domain so if you're done creating your account and you haven't gotten a domain through that process yet we can just click on claim domain right in the main menu now here is you you're going to have to have a domain name that's never been used before it could take you a few tries to find one that's not already taken but i'm going to go with beau with the dashes that's my name bo but my name doesn't have dashes but o.net let's check availability and i already tested this so i knew it knew it would work and i will claim domain okay now we have to set up this domain registration details and we'll just finish filling this out okay the domain is registered okay now add the website to the hosting plan and i already had this hosting plan registered for this other website so select that one website connected successfully now i'll show you how to set up an email account on your domain through hostinger so i'm on the hostinger home tab after i'm logged in and i'm going to just click emails and now i'm going to the so i already set up this one before but now i'm going to set the email on the domain we just created so i'm just going to click there and then create email account and then i'm just going to type in it automatically filled in something but i can type in anything i want so i'm going to put bow and then i'm just going to type in a password here and then create okay so now people can email me at bo b dash e a dash u.net and then i can access the email by still being on this email tab here and going to webmail and then i'll just sign in here and there are no messages but i can always compose a new message here and then i'll receive messages if someone sends me a message and now let's go over how to set up ssl for the website so i'm going to go to the ssl tab on this hosting or dashboard and ssl is important it makes sure all data coming and going from your website is secure and nobody's going to be able to there there won't be any hackers or anybody that can see what's going on with the website if someone submits information it'll be secure nobody will be able to see what that information is so i'm just going to click the install ssl button and then i'm going to select the website and just click install ssl and the great thing is that it's it's free it's completely included within hosting or within the plan and now i should have ssl but i'm going to actually do this drop down menu to go to the bow.net to see the one that we just added and you can see it's installing it says it may take up to an hour but then after that we can go to the website instead of going to http colon slash bo.net it will be http s colon slash bo.net because it has the ssl it's the the s stands for secure i'll go back to the dashboard now i want to get wordpress installed on the website many different website hosting services allow you to easily install wordpress on the website so the exact method could be different if you're not using hostinger but it should be relatively similar so i'm just going to scroll down on this page here and i'm going to click wordpress and then i'm going to install wordpress and i'll fill this out to finish setting up so let's call it my website for now and anything here can be changed later and then i'll put in the password and then i'll just use these default settings here and click install we're on the hostinger dashboard but we want to go to the wordpress dashboard so we can start creating our wordpress website so i'll just click on edit website if you're using something besides beside wordpress there'll be something similar to get into the wordpress dashboard another way you can always access your wordpress dashboard if you look in the url bar here we have the url name and then it's slash wpadmin you can always go to slash wpadmin to get to your wordpress dashboard okay i've zoomed in a little bit on this and we're just going to look at some of the things on the menu over here these are all things that are important when creating a wordpress page we have our posts when we're going to create a new post but you're likely going to be creating a new page like the about us page contact page and stuff like that and we'll be going over that more later and you can also change your appearance and there's just a bunch of other sections here many of which will be going over in more detail later in this tutorial but first of all let's go over to users and you just want to make sure that you have a a password we just want to make sure that the password is the password we chose now depending on how you installed wordpress you may not have created a password and depending on what hosting provider you use and you just might want to make maybe verify that you're not going to have a default password so i'm just going to type in a password here and then i'm going to do update profile okay now we're going to go to the plugins tab before we deal with the plugins let's just get rid of some of these tabs i'm going to click x here we don't need this i guess they're not tabs they're just information boxes and to get rid of this one we're going to go through and actually delete some of the extra plugins here we don't a lot of these plugins we don't actually need so i've selected all the extra plugins and i don't need this one either and i'm going to go to oh first i'll do deactivate and then i'll just select them again and i'm going to go to delete and don't worry if you accidentally delete a plugin that you actually need because it's really easy to reinstall them so i'm going to go to delete okay and now we've deleted all the plugins we don't need and you can see we no longer have the extra information box up here those associated with a particular pro plugin so now i'm going to go to add new this is an elementor tutorial so we could just install directly like this by searching for elementor and then we could click install now but we're actually going to install it a little differently we're going to install something else that will in turn install elementor it will install some themes it will install some templates and so we'll get everything in one by installing one thing so instead i'm going to search for starter starter templates okay this is going to install elementor plus a few other things that are going to be helpful so i'm just going to click install now and activate so let me go here down here and click see library and we don't need to watch this video here i'm going to click on build your website now and then you can click which plate you can choose what page builder you're going to use so in this tutorial we're learning about elementor so i'll click elementor and then it's going to give you a list of templates you can use so you can see some of these are premium so you get to pay extra for but there is a bunch of really good free templates and i highly recommend starting your website by using a template and then you can customize the template to meet your specific needs so go through and look at these templates and try to see what template looks closest to the website that you want to make and then you can modify that template to meet your specific needs so i'm going to choose this one but keep in mind everything is super customizable so no matter what one you choose you're going to be able to add sections remove sections change colors change pictures to make it so it meets your needs so i'm going to click this one here and it's already showing how we can customize things by adding a logo and different things like that but we're going to do all of that later so i'm going to do skip and continue and it's going to show you can actually choose different colors and fonts but again we're just going to do all this later because we just want to get the template installed on our wordpress instance and then we'll do all the customization later so it says one last step and then we can choose some of these advanced options so we are going to install this theme to go along with it the astra theme and the customizer settings we're just going to keep all these checked except i don't want to share any data and then import content this is this will import dummy pages posts images and menus so we could uncheck it if you want to do everything from scratch but i like starting with things and it's easier to change things once you once you start with something so i'm going to click submit and build the res the website and you notice i didn't even have to put in any information about my name or my email address or anything like that okay the website is ready i'll go to view your website and this is the website so it basically just installed everything all the the sample images and stuff like that and you can see there's different sections the home about services and the great thing about this is we can edit everything this doesn't have to be a services page we can make this into anything it can be a product page it can be a more information page maybe it could show a list of different people that worked at our company so we're going to be able to update all this stuff to meet our specific needs and you can see right now these are all dummy links if i click start a project it doesn't do anything and we have a contact page here so let's see how we can start updating this website using elementor to be the exact website we need for our project and so we can't edit anything right now this is just the view mode but to edit it we can go to edit with elementor just click edit with elementor and it's going to load that and now we have the site right here but then we also have the elementor editing menu over here and this is what we're going to use to add sections modify sections and just make the website be exactly what we want to be using elementor so first of all we have the navigator here which will help us select different sections on our website so here's the first section right here and then here it's going to go to the second section and you can see whenever you select a section it's going to put a blue outline around it so you can see this blue here here this blue line around the outline and then you can see you can select the section with these buttons here this is how you would add a new section and i can just delete that with this x here or you can delete a section or if i click here this is how i would move the section around so this we can select down here the bottom section but we don't even need the navigator i'm going to close the navigator because you can select a selection just by clicking on it so when i move my mouse over a section you can see the blue outline goes around that section and i already showed you that if you click the plus button you can add a new section and then we can bring over widgets so i'm actually going to go over here and get to the elements tab here and these are all widgets i can bring in so i can bring in an image i'll drag this image in here and then it's going to this is like the default thing here but i can actually choose an image and there's already images here that came with the website i'll be showing you how to add more later but like for example i could add a picture of this man and then it will be right here now obviously that's not really what we want so i'll x this here but let me show you one thing another thing is that there are often different columns so when we first create a section there is just one big column but if i click the plus button i can choose the structure is it just me one big area are there going to be two columns three columns four columns and you can see what if i want a small section here and a big section over here you can change the size by dragging this around here and then you can add different things to different sections so if i click the plus button that's going to bring up these different widgets and like i already showed you had an image but maybe we want to add a heading here and then after the heading you may want to add something after the heading so if i go back to these widgets i may want to add a text so we have the heading and we have the text here and over here we may want to add a video and when you edit video you can link to a specific youtube video or you can choose a few different sources including selfhosted so there's just quite a few different things you can do by adding different sections and different widgets and soon i'll be going into more detail about more things you can do with these sections in these widgets and show you how and then i'll show you how to modify the current sections on the website so i'm going to delete this extra section now and i wanted to show you one other cool thing about starting with a template like this it's already set up to be responsive so if i click this here there's a button on here says responsive mode and then i can choose am i do i want to look at it like it's a desktop a tablet or a mobile device i'm going to click mobile device so you can see as i scroll down everything gets drunk into a uh one column that's going to look better on a mobile device i can go back to the desktop site and if i'm done testing out these different sizes i can just hit x here now we're going to actually start customizing this page to meet our needs first of all we can always preview changes so we haven't made any changes but you can always go back to the main page by going preview changes i'm going to go back to the home and i'm going to just click edit with elementor again and so now we're at the at the home page again and you can customize the website to be any type of page it can be a blog it can be a business page it can be an online store there's tons of possibilities an elementor can basically make any type of page you want to make it and just for fun we're going to customize this page so it's a store that sells unicycles like i said you can make yours anything you like so let's look at this text here so for one you can easily change any text you see on the screen so i can say unicycles we all love unicycles there we go and then let's say we don't we want a different font if you want a different font there's a few ways to go about it you can select the text you can go to style and then i can go to typography and i can go to here and i can change to a different font here so i could change change it to verdana or times new roman or i can basically i can choose any font here there's even these google fonts here you can actually load any fonts from google fonts but let's say we know that we want all our fonts to be the same you may not so this is the way where you would do it individually you could select every single text box and change that font but there's also a way to change all of the fonts at once so i'm going to go back to default here and now i'm going to go to content or i'm going to click this hamburger menu and go to site settings so then i'm going to go to typography and now we're going to change the typography for the entire site and you can see here that there's different sections this is the body typography uh links h1 h2 so h1 would be a heading so like this is probably either an h1 or h2 h1 is the biggest heading then h2 is the smaller heading so this is probably either an h2 or h3 so we can go through and change the typography and it will affect everything on the site so like body would be text of a paragraph like this so i'm going to go into the typography for the body and i'm going to change this to georgia so we can see it change this font here you can see that change the font on the button here and it will just change it all over our site here and then for the headings i'm going to do a little different i'm going to go into the typography here and i'm going to use trebuchet and so you can see the font changed and you can see we can also change the the weight transform style decoration line height some of this stuff i think is better to do for each individual heading like the the height the letter spacing you're probably not going to want to change the letter spacing for your entire site there could be some specific headings where you want to do that so we're going to leave that all as the default here and then i'm just going to go through and change all the headings because right now if we see we can see this does not look like the same font as this and then this is a different font so i'm going to go through and just change all these headings to use that same font and after you make any changes you have to make sure to click the update button so now it says your changes have been updated so this is going to make sure to save all the changes we just made so now let's go ahead and update this background image this section right here is often called a hero section it's like the first big section you see on a website and we want this background image to relate to unicycles in some way so what i'm going to do is click these six little dots at the this top this blue section edit section and then i am going to go to style and then we have the image here i'm gonna click choose image and there's a few different ways to do this so so if we go to update files i can select files on my computer we can also go to the media library and it's it the website started with all these images basically in here by default but we're going to be updating most of them but another thing you can do is go to free images so here this says powered by pixabay so that's a website that you can get free royalty free images and so i'm just going to search unicycle and then see what comes up here so let's see which picture would be a good background picture so i like this one it's going to have multiple unicycles and this looks like a pretty good size so i'm going to just click insert media and then let me just click choose images again let's see insert media okay i must have clicked the wrong thing or something okay here it goes and now we can see we have this unicycle picture in the background and then one thing i noticed is that now that we have this picture here the text is a little harder to read so i can go to where it says background overlay and i can change this opacity so see i can make this a little darker if i make this darker then you can see that the white text shows up a little better so i like that better and the overlay was already on there it started out at 0.2 and i've increased it to 0.61 let's just do it at 0.6 and yeah i like this so you can you can try different things you can change what the color is the base color here is black but we can make the base color something else it's just up to you on what what you want this to look like there's actually a lot of other changes you can make to make this look exactly how you want for example you may want to actually make this a gradient so we have the overlay it's just black but you could maybe go from black and maybe you want to be red at the bottom or maybe a blue so it's going to kind of go from black to blue and then you can change the location of where it where the second color starts so now the blue starts toward the bottom and then you can also change if it's going to be like a circle where it's black in the middle and then blue on the right but we are going to just go back to the classic just the single color black and if i go back up to the background here we can also change the position so right now it's center center but i could make it um like top right so it's it's going to kind of move the image around now we're not seeing too much movement with this image it basically just depends on what size of image you're starting with like what the the aspect ratio of the image you're starting with and then we're not going to do this but one one thing you can do is instead of having an image here you could put a video here so i could put a link to a video they'll just play in the background and we can still have the color overlay to make it so the text pops up pops up a lot and then you can also use a slideshow so you can make it switch between different images again let's just go back to classic we're just going to use this image we already found here so now let's make some additional changes here so we are i kind of like how it says we all love unicycles but we don't need this text here so i'm going to click here okay i'm just going to adjust this so it wasn't showing this will edit thing but now it is so i'm going to click here and then click this edit and this is allowing us to edit over here but if we don't want to actually edit the text or anything i can just right click on it and go to delete so now we just completely deleted that text and look where it says we all love unicycles we can make some adjustments in here like for instance this word unicycles is pretty big but you know i want to make even bigger so i'm going to go to style and then i am going to go to typography and then i can change the size here so it's even bigger here and then there's a bunch of other things i can do like for instance i could make it so it's bold and then i can change the letter spacing it's at negative three but let's say i want to kind of fill out more so i'm gonna just go to uh five so we all love unicycles and it's it's spreading out the letters a little more and we can also even change the color if we wanted now i kind of like the white so i'm going to go back to the white but one thing that i would like to do is add a text shadow now you're not going to see it too much because it's dark in the background but i just increase this here oh it changed the color so it's a little darker and now you can kind of see the the shadow there we go and decrease the blur okay now like i said it's going to show up more depending on what what background image you have but that's just one of the options you can do when you're changing the text now if you remember we deleted the text that was after this word but what if you decide that's a mistake you actually do want text after that word well i can go up here and here we go now i can drag in this intersection and i can just put where oh actually that's the wrong one the text editor and i can put it right under the word so now we have this this here now i'm going to have to do some style edits to make it look like what we wanted so i'm going to click this little edit button here and i'll go to style and then i can change the text color i'm going to go to white i can go the typography so i can make the the weight a little more i'm going to make this bold and i'm going to just so put down here so let me just delete this here and you can see this is just sample text we're not going to bother updating a lot of the sample text obviously in a real world situation you'll you'll update it to put the text that goes along with what you're trying to do here i'm going to center this i want this you the word unicycles to be a little closer to this so what we're going to do is actually click on the word unicycles i'm going to go to advanced and we're going to make changes to the margin and the padding so the padding is going to be the space kind of within the element and the margin is going to be the space outside the element so you can see the negative 50 that's why this this top blue line is um kind of coming through that part of the i and l if we change this to 30 you can see that it increases that margin up there i'm going to keep this at 50 and so you can actually you can change everything all at once if you link them together so i can just add padding all at once wait it wasn't linked now it's linked together so now it's adding the padding all at once but we just want to actually change how close unicycles is to down here so on bottom i'm going to unlink it and i'm going to just actually the padding is not going to help the the margin is going to help again sometimes you just have to play around with it to see what's going to look best so i'm going to decrease that so now that this text here is closer to the word unicycle so now i'm going to show you let's say you actually did have a longer phrase here i'm just going to copy this and then put it in here and so let's say you had a phrase that went about this long now why is that white there let's try that again there we go so let's say you had a phrase that went this long but you want the text to not go so far out to the edge but let's see how we can change the width so this text is about as long as the word unicycles well we're going to click on this this dots here to change the settings for this whole section let me go to advanced and or actually it's layout we go to layout and then we'll go down to width so width here we have it as box but i'm going to actually do a custom width here and so it's going to this is like the full width but if i go down you can see it's changing the width here i don't want it so far down that the word unicycle starts going to the next line but that looks pretty good so now this text isn't going to go all the way off to the side so now let's make a change to this button it doesn't really get started that doesn't make sense when it relates to this unicycle store so i'm going to click this button here and i'm going to change the text so to change the text i just go to this thing that says text here instead of get started we're going to say c unicycles and this will take it to it will take people to a page showing all the different unicycles that are available at the store and we can change the style just like we would do any of these other things so you can add an icon here or you can change the alignment but and you can also just change the style so i am going to change this i don't instead of using that specific font i don't like that font for a button so instead of using the the default text i'm going to go down here and i'm going to use a google font or x i don't like that one let's try one more there we go and then i'm going to change the size here i'm going to change the weight i'm going to change it to 800 and then i'm going to change the the background color so this yellow i'm not going to use yellow i'm going to go to this background type and right now i can select any color here i kind of like this orange color now if we want to make sure to use the same color elsewhere in our website i can click this plus button to create a new global color and i will call this unit orange and create so now we can easily select that same color for other sections of the website now that we have this color i'm going to go back to this text color and then i'm going to cr make it white okay that looks good and you may have noticed if i go back to the um the content tab we can change where the the link's going to go so i can type in the a page on us a page on our website like maybe it'll be about.html and uh right now we'll later we'll have to verify that we have the page called about.html so now let's see how to modify more sections so we i don't think we're going to need every section in on this page like this quote here i don't think we'll need this so i'm going to just x that out and close that and this we're going to modify it so instead of our services we'll do our unicycles and then i'm going to update these pictures so i'm just going to click on the picture and then i'll click choose image and previously when you weren't watching i uploaded some pictures of different unicycles i just went to upload files select files and select them selected them on my computer so we're going to insert some of these unicycles so just go here choose image and then choose another image and then you can obviously go through and change the text here so i'll put a fat tire long rides tall unicycle and then we can also go through and make changes to this so i'm gonna go to this fat tire section i'm going to click this edit button here whoops i can always just do command or ctrl z to undo so i'm i have this i have the title and description so here's the title here's the description and i'm going to change the style i'm going to scroll down to content so in the content i can change so we have the title here and then the description here so i can just change the title i'm going to change the color of the title and i'm going to actually go to the the global i'm going to click here where we can choose the color that we create if i scroll down uni orange and then the typography i'm going to change a little bit i'm going to change the weight to 900 and then style i'll make this italic and then i'll change the alignment to center so this whole thing is going to be centered now what i can do is right click and i'm going to copy and now i can paste the style see i can paste the style here so now we have everything centered it has the different color for the title and that's looking pretty good so we have in about us in a question so we don't need this questions page here but let's say we want to add a new section so we already saw how you could click here and and add these different columns and then bring in over these other widgets but there's another way if i click this s here so this should look familiar we were able to choose different templates and we chose this one but there's this other tab here blocks so if i look through here i can look at something that looks similar to what i want to put in and i kind of like this the frequently asked questions so you may not want to add a frequently asked questions but if you if it looks similar to what you want to add that's a good thing to add you can see there's actually some different different ways it could look so i'm going to choose this one here and import block okay and then we can go through here and so this is kind of cool how you can minus and plus it to make the answer go go up and down it's called an accordion and you can see according items so if i click in here i can actually change the text of the title and the description so i can say what kind of unicycles do you have and i can update this we have all types and then on the page people can kind of go minus or plus and then for now i'm going to update this now i'm going to after it finishes update dating i'm going to click this little side arrow so this is going to close this close the side menu and then we can see more of what it's going to look like so with that closed this is more like what it's going to look like i still have the responsive screen up here so i can close that here but you can see it has all these changes and so it's starting to look more customized now i'm going to talk a little bit more about what you can do when you're adding custom sections now i already showed you how to add a section by clicking the plus arrow and by clicking this now i'm going to show you a few extra features that you can do like i'm so i'm just going to add a section just like this and it's going to have these two sections so i'm going to just add something to the section so for instance i'll add a button to this one and then to this one we will add a heading so when you're trying to get everything to look exactly like you want one thing that you may want to do is to add a background image so if i click this and then if i go to style actually advanced go to advanced and then i can go down to background here and i am going to add an image so just click this and then we'll just click we'll just choose one of these images that were that were already uploaded and then when we see the image it just looks like a solid color that's because we're just seeing the top of the image so we're going to want to position it so i can use this positioning i can even go to a custom position and i can change this and let me change the y position so we can see so now we can see actually some some trees in there and then we also to make this bigger to make where the image is we can add some padding so let me click here again and then we're going to go up to layout and in the in the we're going to unlink here and then i'm going to add some more padding on top here and then i'm going to add some more padding on bottom i'm actually going to use 75 up top and 75 at bottom and then i'm going to add some padding on the left let's do 15. so you can mess with the padding to kind of choose how big a section is going to be and where things are going to be like let's say we want this button to be at the bottom well we can just change this padding to 25 and then this padding to 125 and then it's the same size here but the button is now down here and then let's go over here if i go into this section with this heading here if i want to edit this section i can click this button here and then i'm also going to change the background type this time we'll do a gradient so i'll go from blue or i guess yeah blue to red there you're probably never going to want to do a gradient like that but i'm just kind of showing you some examples of what you can do if i go to layout here i can change the vertical and horizontal alignment so the vertical alignment is default but i'm going to put it at bottom so now what you can see is bring the text to the very bottom it's just so here we kind of use the padding to change where the button was but you can also use the vertical alignment and sometimes that can even be a better way of doing it now whether you want to do it with the padding or you want to do the vertical alignment that can depend on what you're going for so it's going to look very different in when we go to the the mobile responsive mode so if i click responsive mode up here and go to mobile i'm going to scroll down and we can see here because of the padding it's going to always be kind of the same height here but this section is not going to be the same height because remember before it was side by side what we had this box on the left and this box on the right and so this box would just kind of fill the space of this if we wanted this box to be the same height we would just add additional padding or margin on the top okay i'll go out of this and i'm actually just going to delete this whole section i just wanted to teach you more about the background images the padding and margin and different things you can do in that regard so i'm going to just x out of this now we'll talk a little bit more about adding videos i briefly mentioned it before but let's go through and this image we're going to convert into a video so really what i'm going to do first is just delete the image so i'm going to bring in this video here and i already talked about the different ways you can have a source for the video but youtube is generally the easiest i'm just going to paste in a video i found this unicycling video that we're going to use but one thing it starts with these titles here that i don't want to have so i'm going to make the start time be seven seconds so i'll just put in seven seconds for the start time and then it will start at that exact time and there's all these different things for the options you can do autoplay i'm going to make it so it mutes i'm going to make it yeah i'll make it so it loops and then i am gonna make it so it auto plays now you're generally probably don't want your video to auto play but if you wanna if you're putting as a background video there may be a time where you would want it to auto play but generally people don't like it when videos are audio playing so you know we'll just turn it off for now so now when people get to this page um we'll put that down they can start the video and it automatically starts after the titles and then they can watch all these unicycle tricks so let's just update this so it kind of relates to the video we offer courses to improve your eunice unicycle skills and then find out more and you can we can always link to where the the where the person can find out more right here and this about us i don't think we even need that so i'm going to delete that now i notice that this section this these sections all kind of blend together so let's add a new background to this and i'll show you some different things you can do when you're adding backgrounds so click these dots and i'm going to go to styles and background so this time i'm going to do a gradient the first color i'm actually going to choose our uni orange and then the second color i'm going to go for white and then with this angle we can actually change the angle of where how the gradients going and see and right now it's kind of a gradient but there's we can actually change the amount of gradient by by messing with the location so so the location will choose where the gradient starts you can kind of see how it's as i move it where the orange kind of goes back and forth but i can also move this white back and forth so the closer we get this together you know the less of a gradient and so we can make just a solid line like that i can change the angle like that and that i can make it go this way and now we're going to do 5757 so now we still want to make this separate so i'm actually going to change this white to a slight light blue now this probably isn't the best design choice but i'm just kind of just showing you what's possible and i want to show you another cool thing i'm going to go out of background and go into background overlay so i'm going to go to choose image and i'm going to upload a file and then i'm going to insert the image and this is not exactly what we want you can see it's like repeating this unicycle i i got a picture with a transparent background so i'm going to so i'm going to change the size so the size is it's not going to go bigger than the section and repeat we're going to do no repeat and then i'm going to change the position i'm going to position it in the on the right side so you can see it's kind of behind this section here and then just adjust the video size here and now i'm going for attachment i'm going to go fixed so if it's fixed then when we scroll you can see the unicycle kind of behind the image that actually changed the size so i'm going to change the size and i'm going to do custom let's see what size we want okay that looks pretty good and now you can see when you scroll down you can see this unicycle in the background over on the side over on the side so that looks pretty cool i'm just going to do one quick thing i'm going to custom i'm going to put this into a custom position so it's not quite all the way to the edge so it's like right in the middle of this video and now let's try it okay um now let's just move it down a little bit okay so now when you scroll down you can see the that unicycle moving in the background well we probably put in enough time on this so let's just update this and we're just going to check what our page looks like so far now we see when i do this and the unicycle kind of changes position we can actually fix that by the way changing the x position so it's a percentage so let's do 60 percent for the x percent or maybe 80 so now with the x position being a percentage like that if we go if we change the size of how wide the page is it's still going to be the same percentage into the page so another thing you may want to add in this section that we haven't covered yet is social icons so i'm just going to add one more section and show how you can add some social icons to share your twitter instagram youtube or any other site like that so i'm going to create a section here with two columns and in this column i'm just going to search for a widget i'm going to type in social i can bring that right into here now it defaults for facebook twitter and youtube but i can also add an item so right now it defaults to wordpress but i can just go into the icon library here and i can choose any of the other ones it's deep it's showing all these different links i could add there so i'm going to find instagram so if i just scroll up here you can see there are quite a few things we can choose from so do instagram here and insert so now it's instagram it's the instagram logo here and then you can add a link so uh for instance for youtube i'm just going to add a youtube link and we can use the official color of youtube which is red or we can do a custom color if we want to do a different color so well we have all you can add but just click here you can add a link for each social item and then you can even change the shape like right now it's rounded but we can change them to circles or square how many columns you want the alignment centered and then here i'm going to add a heading and i'm going to put follow us on social media so we have the social media and then here and then if i click here i can change the background so this section maybe i want a background overlay and i'm going to change the color to our uni orange color and then i'll update that so this is all we're going to do for our home page but let's just make sure everything's going to look good on a mobile device so i'm going to go to the responsive mode and go to mobile and so now we're just going to start the top and we're just going to scroll down okay if we go down we can see this unicycle thing this unicycle in the background it's in the corner but let's make it so just in mobile mode it's going to appear in a different spot so i'm going to click here to be editing this section and remember that was in background overlay and now we have it's showing that it's in mobile mode right here so any changes i make here it's only going to impact the mobile section so i'm going to make this kind of right in the middle and i am on the percentage here so that's good so 50 and then i am going to make this fixed and says attachment fix works only on desktop so i think that's as good as we're gonna get on this let's just move this up a little bit and i'm gonna change the opacity a little more in mobile so you can see a little better okay if we keep scrolling down here we can see this looks pretty good but how about this let's make this heading let's make it center only on mobile so i am clicking the edit button here and we can see it's showing it's only on mobile i'm going to click center so in this way we can go and make changes that only impact mobile so like for instance we made the center on mobile but if i go back to desktop it's going to be left aligned so you can make sure things look good on mobile and specify specific settings that only apply to mobile or only apply to desktop another common thing that you're going to want to change on mobile is just the the text size like the this actually looks pretty good but sometimes you're going to say oh just on mobile we want this to be a smaller text size so it's pretty straightforward if you're going to do that you just go to typography and we can see it's in mobile mode and then i'm just going to make this a smaller size when people are on mobile and then i'll just click update to save all that so now we got our homepage done we're ready to go and modify the next section of our websites so to do that i'm going to click on preview changes and once we're on preview changes we can now see the different sections here well first of all we can actually scroll down and see what this looks like and then we can go to the next section which is the about page so on the about us page i can now go to edit with elementor and you can see what we when you're editing with elementor we can't see the the heading up here and so later we're going to talk about how to modify that in this about page i'm actually going to make these a capital letters about us and you don't even have to make this an about us page you can make it something else you can use the same page in this template and modify it so it's not an about us page but i'm going to change this background picture here so i'm going to go to style choose image and i'm going to do another search and this time i'm just going to use this one here and i'm just going to have to okay something to oh let's see if i click the top button okay that looks cool it actually lined up pretty well if it didn't i can always custom the size and move this around here but i'm going to go back to what it was which was bottom center and that looks pretty good and then i'm going to scroll down and some of these things what we're not going to have for our about us page we will have this text box but i'm going to delete this image and instead of having this our mission our values and this quote i'm going to add a section with all of our team members so i'm going to click this and then we'll go to blocks like before if we scroll down we can see all these different possibilities i'm just going to go with this one so ins import block and that now we can go through and make updates so i can say our team and then i can even change the color of this if i want or change the font i'm going to go into the style and put the color well actually click the global colors and i'm going to go to uni orange and we'll keep this the same but now we can go through and change the images so instead of those images i'm going to just choose some of these other images that were already on here so i got that one and now we'll have all color images and you can see i made a mistake there obviously so this is a good time to show you about this history button so i can go to history and then i can um go back to anything so i'm going to just go back to here and so we went back a few steps in the history now i'm going to change this image to this one and then the final image and now you know there's already a section that had all these different images but i'm just showing you how you if you want to add your own section and i'm going to change some of the stuff in here so i'm going to change the style and i'm going to change the title and we're going to use uni orange and what i'm going to do is just copy this section now we can just paste the style paste the style and paste the style and now i'm just going to go into responsive mode just to make sure everything looks good when we're responsive this does look pretty good i'm going to make a change though because i actually don't want this there to be so much space on the top and bottom of this text so i'm going to click here and then we have the minimum height right now the minimum height is 420 but if i change this now there's going to be less of a space in between the top and bottom like around this text and then i can actually go through and update this image and i'm going to do custom and i'm going to just whoop not that position i'm going to change this there we go and now this girl is still lined up correctly and then i'm just going to test again on responsive mode this is good the about it's still pretty big on responsive mode i think how i when i changed it it only it it didn't only it just changed on desktop mode so i can change on mobile also here and then i'm going to update the image as well on mobile mode okay looks good now i can click update and then i will go to preview changes now this is why it's important to preview changes you can see now this isn't lined up exactly how i wanted it so let me go back to edit with elementor and i think it's because when this goes back and forth you can see the where the image is placed is different well we can fix that so i'm going to go to style image and then instead of using the pixels i'm actually going to change it to the percentage so if i change it to percentage okay this is more of what i want so it does kind of cut off the girl a little bit the head but really we're focused on the unicycle so that's looking good if i go to responsive mode well that doesn't really make difference okay so we'll update and then preview changes okay now i'm going to go to services now we can go now we can on the services page we can go through and update and customize it but i'm going to use this as an exa as an opportunity to show how to remove a section so later i'm going to remove this whole services section from the website so we're just gonna have the home about and contact so let me go to the contact page and now i'm gonna make some updates on this contact page so i'm gonna go to edit with elementor okay we can see in the contact page already there's information about where the contact information like the email phone number location and then there's this form so let's see how we're going to customize this first let's click on this text and we're going to capitalize it just use title case so just like before i'm going to change the background image so i'll have to click this up here to change the background of this section here and i will go to the style and then i'm going to choose the image and i'm going to upload a file and then i'm just going to insert the media and i'm going to change the background overlay just like before so we can see the contact us a little better and i'm going to make it so there's less space on the top and bottom so i'm going to go to layout and change this height here and i'm going to adjust this position i'm going to custom here and let's see how we want to do this actually we want this to be zero and then the y position i'm going to change the percentage okay then we can kind of see the unicycle there okay now i'll just change this i'm going to change the color of this text and we'll use the color we've been using a lot i'll go to style text color and x whoops i'm going to use the uni orange and i'm going to copy this and then i'm going to paste the style and then you can go through and update the email address and the phone number i'm just going to leave this as default for now but for the email um you can change you can change if like if you want to put a dash here or if you want to look different here and then you can obviously change the style by updating the color here and then we have the social icons down here right now so you update them just like we saw before where i can put the twitter link here and if i want to change the colors back to like right now they're all gray but i can go to style and go to official color and these will be what we would expect here and what we really need to look at is the form this is where it's going to be a a little this is going to be something new so to make it so this send message will actually send an email we're going to have to update this form so first let me apply this and update i think i just actually needed to update so to get this form all working correctly we have to do that within the wordpress dashboard instead of the elementor dashboard so let me go to exit to dashboard and i can just close that out and click here to go to the main dashboard and then i'm going to go to wp forms here so now we can see the forms and we just have one form the contact form i'm going to edit and this is the form the styling is a little different but this is basically the form that's appearing on on the website and we can add additional things so right now we're just asking for the name email address message but if we want we can add a new a new element so i'll do go to add fields and let's make a drop down and then we can change it a favorite type of unicycle and then you can make different choices tall road unicycle or offroad and then people have a drop down box and now i'm going to go over to the settings and then notifications so this is where we're going to update exactly what happens when someone clicks the submit button it's going to default be whatever email we put as the admin email but if if you want a different email that this email is sent to we can type it right here now this is the same email at freecodecamp.org is the one we were using but if you're going to update the email address here you'll you should also update the from email address and then if you want the subject of the email to be different you can change it here so this is the email that you'll be receiving when a user of the website sends submits the contact form and this information is coming directly from the contact form and then when we're done with this we just have to make sure to click save now it says after saving these settings be sure to test a form submission so you can see how it looks so you're definitely going to want to test this out just to make sure everything's working but it should all work it should all be set up to work correctly okay i'm going to go out of this and we're going to go back into our page here so if i just click here it's going to open this up and there's a few final things we want to change so we've already learned how to customize all these pages with elementor but we want to do a few more things we want to update the logo here we want to i'm going to teach you how to update this header up here including changing this number or possibly just removing the phone number and then we're going to talk about how to update this footer here so we're not going to do that from with elementor i'm going to go to the customize button right here and then i'm going to go to header builder and it says the header on this page is set from the transparent header please click the link below to customize the transparent header so do that customize transparent header and we're going to decide first we're going to decide when the header is going to be on and it's we can just on desktop desk on mobile or mobile and desktop and we want to use a different logo for the transparent parent header no we wouldn't always use the same logo and here is where we want to change the logo so i'm going to update upload a new logo and it's just this little unicycle image so this is now going to be the the logo it's going to appear right up top here and then we still are going to have to update the logo down here but we have the new logo in our header and there's plenty of websites out there that can help you make it to a logo for your website and there's also a bunch of tutorials on youtube on how to make a logo or you can get a designer that to help you make a logo for your website but it's usually pretty important but it's it's very helpful to have a logo that you can use on your website that people can start identifying your website with your logo and then we can go down here do we want a different logo for written devices no we're going to keep that off and then the logo width i think it looks pretty good but we can change the logo if we wanted to we'll let's just go back to the the default which is 60 here now i'm going to go back up and i do want to actually turn this on enable on complete website so the header will always show up and then you can choose if there's any specific places where you want to disable it so i'm just going to leave that all as default now let's go up here we're still customizing the transparent header and we're going to see what options we have on the design so we just changed the logo here but you can see that depending on what your background image is you may want some sort of color or something behind here i think it looks pretty good for this image but you may want a background overlay so if i click that see i can use some other color here i could even try to get like an orange color i can change the transparency and i can even choose one of these other colors here that we have down here and i can make it kind of transparent now i don't really think that looks better so i'm going to turn that off there but there's just one option depending on what background image you have so i'm just going to clear that and it seems like it's kind of frozen up here if any if that ever happens to you just try publishing it and then after you publish just refresh the page or sometimes it'll just does it automatically so now now it's not loading anymore but there's a bunch of things you can change here so we can do the the overlay we can also change the color some of these other things like i can change the menu color or basically the color of these these words here right now it's white but if we want to change it red in this case this is the color of our current page we're on so see when i put my mouse it says hover active so this is the active page or if i'm hovering over a page see i want to hover over it so that's i kind of like that but i'm going to make this an orange color here so now when i hover over it's going to turn orange or if we're on the page it's going to be orange and then there's just a bunch of other colors you can change depending on what you're trying to do here so that's how you're going to change the design and the logo but now let's see how we can remove some of these elements like i told you about how we're not we're going to remove the services page from our website so we want to remove that so this is not where you're going to remove this but it is where we're going to remove this phone number here see if you look at this line here we have the site logo the site title and logo we have the primary menu and we have a button well the button is this thing right here so i'm just going to click remove the button and then it's going to remove that okay now i'm going to try to change the logo for this footer down here so there's a few ways i can just start clicking i can click this edit button here or i can back up here and then i'm going to go to the footer builder and then i will go to the design and then i will go to this see this html one that's the logo here so if i click in here we can see it's just an image that's right in here so i'm going to delete this image and then i can either just leave it deleted or i can add the logo again so to add the logo again i'm going to do this and then add media just click there insert into post and then i'm going to actually make it a lot smaller and then we can see that little unicycle see once we change the size here it changes the size here you can see that that says copyright is the copyright right here this thing right here we have the footer i mean we have the footer menu which is this menu right here and then we have this logo here so i don't actually want this copy to say this i'm going to change it so i'm going to click here and it's going to say made by bow and it's kind of off to the side here so let's see if i how i can change the design a little bit so it's not so far to the side now it's already showing a margin of 40 but i think i'm going to actually have to change this this layout here and i'm going to put some padding on the right okay sometimes you just have to go just try out different things to figure out where you have to add the padding i had already tried to add the padding in one other spot i tried to add the padding here but or the margin here but it didn't increase anything so i just added had to add the padding on this whole section here okay now i'm going to teach you how to remove the the item from the menu it's not on this page surprisingly because if i click to click edit here um oh i guess it does say configure menu from here but i don't think i'm going to be able to remove an element from that menu so no yeah so i'm not going to be able to remove anything from the menu here so to remove something from the menu i have to well first of all i'm going to publish what i have and then i'm going to go back to the main wordpress page the main wordpress dashboard now i'm going to go to appearance and well and then menus here okay so we have these this menu the main menu and you can see home about service contact well i want to remove services i'm going to click here and i can do the drop down here and then remove and i'll just save the menu okay let me go back to the page now we see it says home about contact if i scroll down to the bottom home about contact so we've successfully removed that page so let's say you want to add a whole new page to this menu so to remove a page you just saw how to do that but to add a page first you're going to click or hover over the new button and then go to page and so you can and then after you're adding a page i can just click edit with elementor and so now it's a page with nothing it has a header it has a footer but it doesn't have anything else i may want to go into here go into the blocks and i can actually sort by different thing i'm going to hero because usually you want some sort of big thing at the top and i'm going to put this and i'm going to import this block and then i could go through and edit the page just like what we've been learning i'm actually just going to put a solid color here as the background this is just a super quick example we're not going to use this in the page but i'm also going to change this to just a blue up here and then i just want to show you how you would add this new section to the page so it just loaded this image from just the the template here for the this top section here but if i click publish and let's say i want to add this to a link well it says hooray your page is live have a look so this is the page but it's not showing in the menu up here so if i wanted to get this page in the menu i could go to this button here go back to the main wordpress menu now if i look at the pages i can see the page that was just added so let's see if this is the page i just added if i click view yep this is the page i just added so i'm going to go back here and i'm going to do a quick edit so i can edit the title and this is just going to be called new page and the slug will just be new page the slug is just what's going to appear in the url and i'll click update and then i can add that to the menu if i want want to by just going to appearance menus and we have the new page here so i can click add to menu and it would be here and i could put it right before the contact now i'm going to be deleting this in a second but i just want to show you how you would add a brand new page to a menu so let me go here to visit the site i'm on the about page and you can see the new page shows up right here right in the menu so let's go and delete that new page now i'm going to go back to the wordpress menu i'm going to go back to the menu so that's appearance and menus and then i will just remove the new page and i can also go whoops i forgot to save this so save the menu and then i will go to pages just see all the pages and we can delete that new page and we also can delete the services we're not going to use that so i'm just going to do bulk action move to trash and i'm just going to close these and our page is pretty much done we're just going to go over some final settings so you can see it says love nature up here that was the default name so let's change that to what we want to be so i'm going to go to settings here and then we can change the name of the the title and the tagline this is important because it is going to appear in some places so you want to make sure it's accurate so for the site title we'll just put in the unicycle store the place to buy unicycles and by the way i did not set this up as an online store but i do have another tutorial about how to create a wordpress online store so you can check that out if you want and i'll put the link to that in the description and then let's just go down here and then see if there's any other settings we want to update so you can you can change the date format that's going to appear or the time format now this is mainly going to appear if you were doing a blog post in this tutorial we did not cover how to make blog posts but uh if if you want you can update these formats you can change when the week starts on i'm going to say it starts on a sunday and then i'm going to go to save changes okay our page is basically done and we have learned the basics of elementor you can see as i was demonstrating things there's just a bunch more menu so this was kind of learning the basics and you should now know enough to start figuring out more things on your own you just explore the menus and remember when you're doing things in the menus you can always do the undo you can always go back in the history so you don't have to worry about messing anything up you now know the basics of using elementor to create and customize your website thanks for watching and good luck on creating your own website
