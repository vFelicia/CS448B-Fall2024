hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do some css so our last stream which i think was friday thursday or friday of last week we started doing some css work so we're just gonna continue on with that uh since the other work that i've been doing lately is kind of boring and not really stream worthy so i'm saving some of the the work that might be a little bit more interesting and easier for beginners to follow along with so over the weekend i had a conference uh pittsburgh tech fest and i gave a talk there about basically a lot of stuff we've been doing over the last few months so using react and graphql to get data from wordpress uh so if you're interested in that talk check it out it's on my channel a link to my channel is in the description and it should be the last video that i that i did it should be right there on the home page i don't i can't see the live chat right now i'm trying to get that set up and then we'll start okay um also uh if you if you do follow me on twitter you may have seen this message earlier if you don't follow me on twitter and you'd like to uh link to my twitter is in the description as well but i have an idea for a project that i think will be pretty cool and i'll keep you all filled in on on how it's going but for now i'm just looking for advice so what i'd like to do is use some machine learning to predict whether or not a customer will convert whether they'll take the desired action based on some information they provide in an online form so i'd like to do it in javascript i've gotten i was thinking about using brain.js i saw some videos on it it seemed pretty easy to work with but i've also gotten some suggestions to use tensorflow.js so if anybody has any other suggestions or advice or any good resources for me let me know in the live chat or in the comments or wherever you'd like but i think that could be a pretty valuable uh tool for uh for businesses i know a lot of the bigger companies already have things like this they either pay us you know for an outside service to do it or they do it in house but i'm thinking this could be targeted more towards um like smaller businesses uh trying to make it you know somewhat userfriendly and you know the the big problem is for small businesses is just getting the amount of data needed to really make a good uh prediction with it but i do have some data that i'm thinking of working with that i think will be enough to get started so at least for testing you know for us i'll already have the data that i need um okay oh i forgot my my spotify i forgot my music uh the microphone finally started working on my mac at least i think it is it seems like y'all can hear me so now i can listen to spotify on my phone which definitely helps do most other people listen to music while you code let me know in the chat i just always assume that that's like a normal thing that people do but i've gotten so used to it now that it's just like constant and let's see okay all right so i'm just taking a glance here at the chat and then we're going to get started with this uh matthew asks about how about that new free code camp content yeah i haven't i've just looked at a little bit of it i haven't had a chance to try any of it yet i'm thinking about doing a series where i work my way through the new content maybe even do it live that would probably be on my own channel but if anybody would be interested in something like that let me know and then i'll i'll think more seriously about doing it oh wow michael said my live stream was thursday wow so it's been a while sorry about that um i don't remember why i didn't stream on friday to be honest but yesterday i had a doctor's appointment that was an hour away in the morning and uh the doctor's appointment took longer than i thought because i had to get blood taken and then i got back to work uh stopped at the store to get something to eat for lunch i got to my office ate lunch in my office and then had two meetings back to back and then a third smaller meeting that was no i was not expecting and then i had to watch the kids because my wife took my son to karate so it was a very busy day if i would have been able to fit a stream in it would have been really short um so as it was i ended up getting i needed to get paperwork done um that was due by the end of the day yesterday so anyway i don't like to have that long of a span between streams but it happened oh that's it michael thanks that's what i remember so i did do a stream on friday i just forgot about it but i did it on my channel so that was when we got ready for the uh for the talk that i did thank you just uh i don't know what's up with me i just the weekend was was rough it was so busy uh i needed like another weekend to recover from my weekend all right so let's let's get this started seems like i've been talking too much at the beginning here um okay i'm gonna switch scenes all right i'll make this a bit bigger for everyone i think that's that's probably good on size let me know if it's not not sure i could go much bigger than this and still kind of see what's going on uh for for the last hour or so i've been working on these these routes so i've been going into wordpress cleaning up data making sure the slugs are correct and uh actually just deleting a lot of posts that were either not needed or i could combine with other posts so the data came over very like fragmented and lots of different posts so i've been able to combine a lot and then also add routes so i've been running into this issue where uh there'll be two and sometimes completely different urls for the same content so i have modern languages and mod lang lit both go to the same content and not only that but then on top of that so if you go like franciscan.edu modern languages slash uh classes it should it takes you the same place as if you did mod lang lit slash classes so like this whole tree of pages has double urls and i'm not sure which one is even the the right one i believe that depending on what link you click on on the current site it would take you to one or the other and it doesn't redirect so it's a bit of a mess but i'm glad i found that so that i can add this in trying to avoid broken links as much as possible all right so that's what i've been working on so the last few commits you'll see in the repo uh are basically just that so not really that much to catch up on uh in terms of work on the github repo um what do you think yeah oh you can find the link to the github repo in the description uh also if anybody's been uh worried about microsoft and github or excited about it or anything let me know in the chat that might be cool to talk about i know there's not a lot of details available yet but uh i'm kind of interested to see what you all think i don't have any plans to move my repos yet um i at least for the for franciscan university's repos i know um you know we use a lot of microsoft stuff like office 365 so i don't really see an issue with leaving those repos on there in terms of my personal repos i'm not really worried about it until there some reason to be worried about it you know but i would like to hear what you all think all right so i just started a pomodoro uh timer oh nikki has a good point says does microsoft buying github mean the atom editor is doomed uh use visual studio code anyway but still that's a great point i did not even consider that yet uh but yeah uh you know because they're let's say like i thought about electron because github you know built and maintains electron but microsoft uses electron for for several products and actually that microsoft hosts an electron conference i i believe um or at least they sponsor it and they contribute to uh the project so i thought oh okay well that's actually not a bad deal but i didn't think about adam whereas you know visual studio code is direct competitor to adam i would i would hate to see adam go away i don't use it much anymore either but it's it's good to have options you know all right so this is the last page i was working on this made this is probably a good page for us to check out so uh if you're just joining us you didn't catch the last stream where we did css basically what we're going to do is just go through the site and find things that look like they need a little work so it doesn't have to be perfect but if it looks broken we are definitely fixing it so i'll just scroll through this page quickly uh right off the bat i i see some inconsistencies in spacing i i really don't like this long list but right now i i don't want to deal with that right now yeah all right there's nothing on the page that absolutely looks broken but you know what i i do remember something i noticed earlier uh so when we go to you know one of these and we go to click let's say on undergraduate we get a weird color i don't know if you caught that on the on the screen but uh it's almost like a pinkish color so i i want to change that i want to try to see if we can see it i'm going to zoom in and click to see if you all can see it as well uh if you want to check out the website you can go to dev.franciscan.university i'll put it in the live live chat in just a second okay do you see that that actually looks orange on on that screen uh depending on what screen where did this take me i think i accidentally clicked on something all right so let me do um all right so if you go to the link that i just put in the live chat you can browse through the site as well so i believe that we changed this at one point and i don't know if it reverted back or because we added some of these extra drop downs if that had anything to do with it but oh looks like that page does not work good to know i have a list of all the pages that don't work so i'm not i'm not worried about you know taking note of that right now ali ali a fanboy says ajax with a heart yeah this ate my ajax yolo shirt it's uh you only load once yeah so this is actually an eventbrite shirt so i got this uh at the first syntax con um from uh ben alegbedu who uh who works at eventbrite does a lot of conference talks if you don't follow ben on twitter you should he's a nice guy he's got a lot of good info uh i think his twitter handle is ben nvp all right so let's go into code and uh let's let's check out our theme and see if we can just fix it here let's see so i doubt it's a problem with our theme because it looks like the style works like if you could see that on other click events we we do have proper colors so yeah maybe we'll have to go right into the component actually you know where we should go let's go to the documentation that might save us a lot of a lot of searching um there we go let's look at i don't remember what that's called oh nikki says he uh says i know how to fix that give me a sec to look it up okay cool all right i'll give nikki a second to to let us know about that um ali also asked where are you from right now i'm streaming from ohio from steubenville ohio which is right on the eastern border so right next to where pennsylvania and west virginia meet so i'm pretty close to pittsburgh originally i am from west virginia and those are all of course in the united states okay let's see what this is button he had a a few people coming in saying hello hey everybody uh thanks for watching all right so the drawer all right so the side list we need to check the list components then because i believe what we've done is just we've nested lists oh if we actually if we just nested lists we may may be able to just see this easily okay so let's check our tour item.js okay so this is a hover color okay nikki saying find the css for that link and apply color inherits to it okay um let's see where back up and go to drawer let's see what we've done here um interesting all right let's go back in here sub item icon container that's odd i i don't actually see anything that would make the top links um change michael asked which page you working on i couldn't see when you started okay um this i'm not really on any page i'm just looking at uh this side side navigation all right sneaky so see the external link css class there okay was it on the back on this other one oh there we go external link color inherit that's the same thing okay all right cool thank you thank you nikki uh okay i see uh because we manually put in those external links down here didn't we yeah we did okay so we put that class right on the a tag all right that's that's uh super helpful all right so let's check our a tags here and see what classes so we do have a class as sub link on our a tags and i believe those are the only a tags we have just double checking okay so on our sub link let's try to put that in there and let's save that and then we'll try it out okay great and then let's try a sub link awesome let's make sure just try a couple more yeah awesome great job nikki um that's really cool that that was a very easy fix very easy fix so wonderful at one time we uh we actually had a issue open for that so let's check the issue and uh see if it's still open we can close it and i'm going to check on my timer all right so in about 11 minutes i'm going to come back to the chat and answer a few questions uh for a little while so let's see here we are issues oh wow i didn't realize i have three pull requests if you've submitted poor crafts recently uh sorry that i haven't checked them and pulled them uh merged them yet uh i'll um i'll try to get that done after the stream all right so the regex oh actually i got a pull request about this so i'm excited to to review that faculty titles not displaying oh i you know what i figured out how to fix that bug because i was having the same blood bug on my presentation slides um so i stayed up really late on friday and figured it out so this might be a good one to uh to fix soon before i forget how i did all right cool so we don't have an issue for that anymore um like i said i think someone it may i think it may even have been nikki actually fix that at first but then i broke it again once i added in that other stuff and then carry over the styles so we can go ahead and commit this change so we are using git as our version control for this project so we can check get status here in our terminal that's integrated right in here with visual studio code and we can see that we have made a change to that drawer item.js and we can do a git add all right to get that file ready uh and then we're gonna do yarn cm because we have a little custom script set up to help us make wellformatted commit messages um so it's a shoot oh well i guess it's not really a new feature uh it's a color change so i don't know if you want to say that's a feature or not so change on on click color of your sub items all right yeah i guess feature is an okay thing to do i mean it wasn't exactly a bug or anything oh michael said uh i've almost figured out the first issue but i'm not quite there yet my regex food is terrible yeah i thought let's let's check that out for just a second here uh that pull request because i thought one of these was about that all right let's let's check the file let's see what's going on all right so we now have okay cool so we have this regular expression here and then we're replacing all that with this interesting that's really i mean this this regular expression is is definitely beyond uh what i've ever done um so that's really awesome yeah so i'm gonna have to test that out it looks like there's a little way to test it here i know this is a little off topic of this today's stream um but since since we were talking about it i figured why not just test it out and uh we had to wait a second for this to go through anyway all right so that worked it passed all the tests and so let's push that up to github all right cool so it did match that uh okay interesting so well here's here's what i guess i'm assuming is is happening um this here this uh a dollar sign three must i i guess that's putting in the third capture group so with one two three the third capture group is what grabs the uh the url uh for this link so by by using this we're actually able to insert like a variable whatever is captured in there remember that was the issue that this was the issue that caused me to give up on using a regular expression because i had no idea how to do it but i did know how to do it uh in javascript so uh but this this is definitely the better solution so we'll probably go with that i'm not gonna merge this now um it's it's off topic for what we're doing right now but then also um any like stuff i do on the command line goes really slow when i'm trying to stream so uh let's go back to our our css so we've accomplished that and i'm gonna refresh because for some reason it's not it's not closing the drawer when i click okay michael creel says i thought we were only trying to replace the intext yes yeah that's what we were trying to do but i guess in a sense that's exactly what's happening again but it's it's the end result is the same okay so the end result is that all the markup stays the same except the inner text but the process to go about that is is a little bit different with that regular expression um so i said i i don't know that i would have come up with that but i like it which i mean i'm assuming that it all works uh it seems like it will so i'll just off to test it and then if everything does work i will merge that pull request later on all right so we already checked this page uh let's go through i want to try to find some pages that we haven't really seen before nikki said added the title prop to or is that already there accessibility for the win i don't remember if that was there or not but uh it should be there if it wasn't all right let me check uh i think we already checked some of these pages um so i'm not gonna do this top two all right we have nothing there right now we have to build that out employment in hr okay that's good yeah i kind of i think we i think we looked at this stuff already faculty openings i don't think this page works no it doesn't all right consumer information all right not bad yeah this page didn't turn out too bad at all let's see if any of these pages work uh so i'm just gonna open a bunch in some new windows assuming that they're interior pages all right nope that does not work whoa all right well it's not the worst thing ever but uh the way these are like this i guess is centered and this one is i wonder if these are just set to be like right on the end of this line of both these lines no no we may be able to work on these but my timer just went off so let's take a five minute break and do some uh question and answer i'm gonna scroll all the way to the top see if there's any questions um if you have any questions that you'd like for me to answer please put them in the chat now nikki says writing a blog post about using keyboard shortcuts to get things in code done faster what are your favorites ah interesting if anybody has any favorite keyboard shortcuts to get things done uh let let nikki know in the chat charlie what it's kind of hard to think about you know because you get used to him it's kind of thing like you just do it you don't at some point you just stop thinking about it as some trick you know um i don't know probably the thing i use the most that saves me time is multiple cursors so on a mac with visual studio code it's command d now i have the atom keyboard shortcuts enabled since i was used to using atom so i don't know what it is on visual studio code by default but you know command d to do the multiple cursor thing is uh really helpful and i don't know i mean aside from that all the normal ones right uh you know control f for for finding things i probably use that that might be what i use the most also of course copy and paste but everybody knows those ones um yeah if i think any other ones i'll let you know oh wow uh nikki does not listen to music while coding interesting michael says i heard that gitlab had a spike in activity in the last two days not sure if it was real um yeah i don't know i mean even before the announcement was like official you had people talking about going to uh to get lab i mean i i don't know i it reminds me a little bit it's definitely not the same situation but it reminds me a little bit of when everybody said they were going to leave facebook you know a month or two ago and like i i didn't leave facebook and obviously like a lot of people just didn't leave facebook but in in terms of like i don't know in terms of the people on twitter that i follow and on instagram you know there were some there was some like reaction strong reactions to it like i just deleted it you know um i think this is gonna end up being a similar thing like they're gonna be some really vocal people who are like i'm definitely moving uh but you're gonna see like the vast majority of people probably end up staying uh with github uh if if if not for any other reason than just it takes a while a lot more effort to move than to stand still right like there has to be a really good reason for people to move and i don't think they're i mean microsoft hasn't done anything yet there no decisions have been made there's uh so we just don't know what's going to happen if something drastic changes with github yeah then people more people might move but if it stays largely the same just the fact that microsoft owns it i don't think is going to be enough for anybody to move especially with i mean how many developers use visual studio code now right it's you know there are open source microsoft tools that are widely accepted by developers you know why couldn't github be that too right um i don't know so i think it could be awesome it could be like hey github's the same except better because now there are more resources behind it and that would be great uh or you know it could end up being bad it just depends on what's decided upon so it seems like at least for now at least till the end of the year things aren't going to change that much so i think they're going to take it kind of slow in the transition at least that's what i read so that's my opinion on it which what do i know so just take that for what it is uh tomiwa says i think they should just keep uh both running on separate teams i think that's where we we were talking about visual studio code and adam i think that's a good idea at least at first keep them both running uh on separate teams and you know just kind of see where it goes from there you know if i mean they're very similar applications they both run on electron they both do the same thing so i guess long term if it ends up being that the best of one just gets absorbed into the other that would make sense i don't know if it would be a good thing but it would make sense uh if it if it happens all right so my five minute timer is up i'm gonna reset my pomodoro timer after this 25 minute session is over i'm going to come back to the chat and answer whatever questions are still remaining all right so for this page i actually like really hate to work on this page because it's it's a standalone page styles i do for this aren't going to carry over into anything else so it's like we don't get that much for the amount of work that we're going to put into this so i think we're not gonna do it this is the page that we have to have uh for for our accreditation or membership in these organizations uh so we have to display this somewhere but nobody looks at this except for possibly the people that police organizations to make sure that they're displaying these things uh i'm not i'm not really a fan of these things they actually cost a lot of money just to be able to display this and so i don't know i've argued in the past that prospective students high school students don't care at all about these things uh and so it's a waste to have them but um that's not what what people think so what other people think in my organization so we're still going to continue to pay a lot of money for these and display them for the time being but my advice to just hide them somewhere um was taken mainly because those those little things that show up in there they load so many scripts those aren't just images so many scripts get loaded it was slowing down we had them on the main page it was slowing it down significantly and it's already slow so at least at least my idea to take him off the front page was uh accepted all right so this actually this is really interesting i'm just looking at the url path to these as you know we set up a google cloud storage bucket to store all kind of the images and the pdfs that are on the current site and i don't believe that i got that file because i i didn't think there was anything live on the site that was using this file this was this folder was supposed to be for the admin panel of the old cms so evidently some files got in there that's a really weird path you know what i don't i don't know if you all can see this or not but i don't think that's an actual path all right i'm gonna i'm not gonna work worry about that right now but that could be kind of a big issue if all the pdfs if if we're not given the real path and instead we're given the path to a dot aspx file that then pulls in that data given an id um that's going to be a problem oh same thing here yeah this is that's not good okay well at least i mean these pages uh in terms of how they look are acceptable yeah but the urls are for these pdfs or not uh the only thing i see that's really weird here is the spacing and i'm not sure why let's just check the code out for a second and why are there breaks between all of these that's insane okay um all right so it looks like whenever this came over wow i'm sorry this is too small for you all to see uh let me make this bigger so you can see what i'm looking at and just how insane this is um this is how the content came over when we uh pulled the content over from the main site with all these breaks in between that that's just all right so evidently yeah we have so we have already had these breaks set to display none which is good um but yeah i'm gonna leave this like this for now because once again this is one of those oneoff pages that nobody really looks at anyway but we just have to have same way with this page you know it's all just legal stuff wow that's really small man i guess oh goodness yeah these are pdfs also i'm assuming they're pdfs i can't even tell really um but they they don't have real urls either okay pages all right and all right so all those pages were okay i'm glad i looked at them though because now i realize uh the issues that we have with um with those urls all right so let's check out the next set i really thought there would be more issues with styling to be honest i think we've gotten pretty lucky with some of these pages um let's check out this directions and attractions accommodations there we go that's an external link and so is that oops oh cool actually that's not bad even you know the way the image is set up now i definitely want to check this out though um on a smaller screen really it's what i should be looking at first okay that's not bad i was just i was worried that it would be aligned uh to the right instead of left but this i think may be taking advantage of some of those styles that we created um last week i'm gonna double check yep yeah those are our styles from before which is great so uh these styles are being applied elsewhere and they're doing what they're supposed to be doing all right cool and okay this is not too bad i'm not i'm not a fan of all this italics but uh like i said we are um we're looking for things that absolutely look broken oops all right let's try this page wow okay uh we are gonna work on this page because this page is gonna be important to uh the president of the university and some of the people that are higher up because they're really focusing on these things they call the the charisms of the university so we're going to work on this page even though it's you know it's basically one of those oneoff pages that doesn't really get very much traffic but in this case the traffic that these pages do get is important all right so we can see we have h5s and h6s uh that h1 looks okay the h2s the size is okay but uh we'll see we may have to adjust the h1 and h2 depending on how big we go with uh our h5s and sixes uh so let's let's work with this h5 first and let's go let's go to the font size of let's try 18 just to start oh actually i think 18 looks okay and then font weight of 300 is gonna be thin let's try four see what it looks like four yeah i think four is more acceptable yeah four makes a lot of sense right there okay all right let's figure out what um style sheet we should use so what's this being used for department so for some reason the department style sheet is being applied here i get that the page is being applied here that's weird all right let's check let's check this out uh so we have about visions of charism uh let's go to our drawer menu.js and this should tell us what we're using to render this page you want another one of those where'd you get that one yeah i have another one come here you want to be on youtube i'm good at the other my oldest son is is here he's asking me for some of the stuff the the conference swag that i got you know what i think i have it down here i'll give it to you i'll give it to you a little bit here say hi you're right there down in the corner there this is raphael that's my oldest you want to say anything to people on youtube i don't know you don't know all right you want to hang out for a little bit okay so raphael here's what we're trying to do you see how on this page watch that cup and stuff in it let's put it over here um do you see how these are really small so we're trying to change that so they're not really small and so right now um we've we figured out some code to use to change it but we just need to figure out the right place to put it uh so we're gonna look here and what was the title of that page it's a vision charisms so actually we can just do a control fine division and charisms page type about pages about pages all right let me check our server see i know where i need to check um about i should have a route that is just for about and then we can see what it's what um component is automatically being rendered all right let me just scroll up because i think it's at the top maybe i don't have it check the bottom here all right let's uh yeah it should be rendering to page all right well let's just look at page i mean it's possible that i've i've loaded that css and page i did so for some reason in the page.js component i'm loading the department css uh style sheet as well i don't remember why i'm doing that so i'm gonna leave it there for now uh but maybe i'll go back and look at the uh get get history for this component and see when i did that and maybe it'll maybe then i'll remember why it's there if it's a mistake i'll take it out but for now let's put these styles in the page.css so we need to find our static folder let's close up some of these there we are static styles and then let's find that page dot css what do you think right there we think about this work that's a lot it's a lot a lot of stuff yeah did you do all of that yeah the people in the stream helped too all right so i'm just gonna put it down here at the bottom and we're gonna say h5 and i really hope that i copied those styles no i didn't okay uh i think it's easy to remember though i believe we went with a font uh size oops font size of 18 pixels and a font weight weights of 400. all right so let's save that and do a refresh see if it works yeah it worked okay cool now let's look at these h6s these are really tiny and but let's see what we can do so font size i'm gonna go start at 18 pixels and see how that looks actually that's that's not too bad but i only because it has that bold uh you know font weight let's see if we drop it down to like 400 if it's still gonna look like actually that's that's not bad uh let me let me bump it up i'm trying to avoid making them so big that i have to adjust these uh larger headings but if we can go to 20 actually i like that and then uh i want to see where all this padding is okay wow that's a lot of padding we definitely uh or i'm sorry margin we don't need that much margin um so i'm gonna leave the margin top for now and let's just go with margin bottom oops margin bottom uh let's let's try eight pixels oh yeah that's a lot better yeah that's so much better uh we're gonna go with eight i think i could go even further because it looks like i think there's some margin there on those p's yeah uh so let's go down further um can we go down there that low one okay uh we probably can just go to zero then margin bottom zero yeah i'm gonna go margin bottom zero since we have such a large margin that seems to be by default here yeah oh just in the user agent so yeah i'm gonna set a margin bottom zero on those i'm a little bit afraid that these styles are gonna mess things up on other pages though so we're gonna have to make sure as we click around that we we check uh but you know they definitely need to be bigger no matter what page they're on that font size was just unacceptable so i think this will be i think this will be okay that i mean that looks a lot better okay so let's move these over here throw in our h6 and then put the styles in oops and i need to clean up i i need to get a plugin or something that autoformats my css that would be nice all right so that's in there let's do a refresh just to make sure yep great okay uh jeff miller says doesn't prettier do css yeah actually we are using prettier probably just need to set that up then nikki says shouldn't h6 be smaller than h5 you are correct you're entirely correct and normally i would say yeah we're going to do that for sure but in this case the mark that we're given doesn't make sense so like this is not really a heading this is i i don't even know like maybe i would make this a block quote or something if i was gonna do it um yeah so this should not be an h5 it's it's not a heading um these are headings for each one of these little sections so or actually better yet if they're going to list charisms this should be like a dictionary style list i forget what the the html tags are so anyway there are better ways that would make more sense to set up this html so i entirely agree that the h6 should normally be smaller than an h5 um but we're just doing what we have to do to make this look okay with the markup we're given and then we're going to go back like over the course of the next year i or someone else i can hire is going to go in here and make sense of all this markup and we won't have silly things like that happening you know eventually and actually since this is kind of like a oneoff page we maybe could have gone in and actually adjusted this but i don't want to get into a habit of doing that because then the site will never launch um okay i'm gonna check my timer oh we only have about a minute left so i'm just gonna commit this change and then i'll uh i'll answer some questions and uh then we'll we'll wrap up the stream all right let's do a git status there we go that's that's what we want to see uh just that css files changed and we'll do a git add yarn cm and let's uh i guess we can do a fix for this that was obviously i i guess uh a ui bug right a design bug i don't know um so let's say uh fix heading um sizes and weights okay so that's going to do its thing and i can start answering questions now and as soon as that's done i'll just i'll push it up to the repo and um and then that way everything will be available to you all john hanson says you need it need a visual studio code extension for color highlight yeah you know what i had that on adam and it was pretty awesome that would be cool to have one on visual studio code but i'm kind of like i'm trying to not have um extensions that i don't need running because it does tend to slow things down and since i already have issues with trying to stream on on this laptop uh i probably won't do it here i have no problems adding in more stuff on my uh my imac at work though because it can handle it coding in caffeine says hi developers and coffee drinkers yeah i have uh my iced espresso here so i'm i'm with you today um rahul says when will this project be over i really hope we get this thing launched before july uh it based on my initial plans it would have been launched already um some things happened we were surpr i was surprised by the quality and amount of data to be honest with you and then i also had expected to be able to hire on some student workers and that just didn't happen so uh so it got extended out i mean if it ultimately helps you know make this a better you know better project a more smooth launch i guess it's okay but i i really i don't i start to get nervous when a project drags on you know i just want it to launch um i get what happens is like the longer you wait to develop a project uh it just makes you nervous become because it'll start to become outdated before it even launches right uh you don't want it to get so old that you have to at some point go back and completely redo the project but it but you don't want to launch something outdated so it's almost like you'd have to at some point also the project goes on and on people keep coming up with you know new ideas for things to do i don't like that i'd rather launch it and then any changes are going to be based on user feedback and analytics data and not just on well what if we did this or that all right so i'm pushing that up to github that will be ready in just a second uh coding and caffeine says love material by the way thank you nikki says all that pr for prettier eslant you can postpone i was just trying that out on a different project than the one i used as a sample for a blog post oh okay all right thanks uh john hanson says don't know if it would be a small change to give a hover to your anchor tags a darker color oh you know what i i we were talking about that last week weren't we um yeah i don't think it would be too difficult of a thing to change so that might be something uh that we do uh at some point i i think it would be good though the world's asked how do you get react into production mode um yeah so it depends on what you used to to to build it with so we use next so if we check out the package json it'll it'll tell basically we we just run this command and it does all the um transpiling and minifying concatenating everything uh so we just type in build right uh i think if it's if you use create react app it's also build um so of course it'd be yarn build or npm uh run build or something like that if you set it up from scratch then i guess you'd make the build command whatever you wanted it to be alright uh michael cruz said i had to do something and then i see jesse's mini me on the stream yeah he's off of school now so this is your first week off of school right yeah yeah what you been doing now that you don't have school i'm not coding right now anyway there we go you're playing outside and stuff yeah that's good uh gorov gaurav i'm sorry if i'm messing up your name uh please let me know how to pronounce it if i am anyways this looks clean isn't it so i i guess you're saying the site looks clean uh if so uh thank you that's definitely uh what i was going for as a clean uh interface oh john hanson said nikki's blog is helpful nikki i'm going to check that out for sure i'm pretty sure you gave me the link to that before if you didn't give it to me and if you did is it cool if you give it to me again i'm gonna check the my twitter dms after this to see if you gave me the link already uh in twitter or i'll just check your twitter profile how about that and it's i i you probably have it linked from there so don't worry about it yeah but i definitely want to check it out though uh jeff miller says uh jesse i owe you a docker compose file for local minecraft server oh yeah yeah i mean don't don't worry about it i mean i don't i don't want you to you know take a bunch of time out of your schedule to do that but if you get a chance uh that would be really cool you hear that he's remember i told you someone from the live stream was gonna uh help and give us a file so we could create a minecraft server maybe maybe um so we'll create it and it'll run on like one of these computers so like we'll just at home we'll be able to play it cool yes it'll just be for us so then you don't have to worry about anything like any bad guys on the internet or anything yeah yeah it'll be cool we could uh we could build awesome things huh all right oh okay uh nikki's blog is uh nikki i pronounce your last name aha let me let me spell it out anyway because if if you can see the string now obviously you could copy and paste that if you're listening you'll probably need me to spell it anyway so it's nickymeuleman dot netlify.com blog yeah so i'm gonna copy and paste that into my browser right now so i don't forget okay um michael says since all the questions on your stream talks were about graphql if you get good at explaining it you'd have a niche you could dominate yeah i guess so um i did get talks about graphql i think i um i think i could have done better talk if i would have if i would have explained more about react and graphql and how they work at first because it seemed like the the people in the audience some of them i had never even used react before and a lot of them had never used graphql before so so the kind of the rest of the talk was a little hard to follow because i had assumed in order to get through all of the material on time i had to assume that the audience would have already set up certain things on their own so i don't know maybe i i could have uh kind of front loaded to talk a little bit more with some explanations so i mean really that i actually have taken that same content and uh i want to present it as a like a three to five hour workshop and really go through and actually build out a whole like demo project with everyone so that that i think would really be a better a better fit uh but still at least i think the audience members got ideas for what's possible so they'll definitely have to learn more about react and graphql if they want to do it on their own but but perhaps now they they see that something is possible and not that difficult to do that maybe they didn't even realize was was a thing before and that's i think that's valuable oh okay jeff says uh for what it's worth i use this docker image and uh has linked up okay cool i'll have to look up that docker image um so actu i have docker which i think i'm probably gonna run this on one of my windows machines i think i have docker running on one of them or installed but it's been quite a long time since i've developed anything so i have to probably do some updates um but i could probably test it on this mac though all right well i've gotten to the end of the live chat and uh i think this was a cool stream uh just you know basic css stuff but uh it's always fun one more thing good job on all the code everybody oh yeah he says good job on all the code um everybody buddy yeah so i'm gonna try to be back tomorrow uh do another stream and i don't know we might be doing some more css we'll see what happens and until then have a wonderful day
