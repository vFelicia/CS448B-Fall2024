hello keep calm and hackathon hi free code camp my name is jane sorenson and this is the first video that i am doing for you all and i pitched the article to quincy quite by accident back in september when i was starting to create a product and i had no idea how to do a landing page and no idea how to do online marketing and i wanted to be able to just do something quickly with my wordpress and quincy said if you're having a problem with this chances are other users are too so i accepted to do what you're about to see if anything is confusing bounce through my 6 000 word article and ask a question either here on the video if it's relevant or on the article if it's relevant now there is a product that i release on a monthly basis it's a digital download i call it the tactical chronograph and what it is is it's a monthly agenda that you print out at home and you can carry it around by the by the week or carry around the whole month agenda so you can plan your time accordingly because what you put into your phone calendar isn't always sufficient for for planning and keeping track of everything that you want to do so i came up with a nifty design basically responding to my own needs and i started marketing it using this landing page that i'm taking you to right now what we have here is we have a popup it's probably a timed popup that will go away before i click the x there but i figured out a way so that simply by subscribing to my email list then they click yes i want the tactical chronograph i will automate an email within my email list that will then send them the download link so that they can get the tactical chronograph directly from the link rather than order it in the shop and then click the link to get the download so this is two ways by which people can collect what i'm giving them for free so closing out of that this is my landing page the back end of how this works mailchimp and woocommerce woocommerce is the ecommerce website uh web services that are provided for wordpress users mailchimp and wordpress and woocommerce have an api that connects together so that if somebody uses word woocommerce to order my product and they go through the traditional shop download there is a little check marks button for them to subscribe to my email list mailchimp the mailchimp api will recognize that that person has subscribed to the list through woocommerce and also which product they have bought so that's going to be able to uh cue them up in my email list for any type of automation where i could say people who downloaded the tactical chronograph i would like them to have this particular email campaign then there's also the form and other integrations so this is where you will do the majority of your work here is where you will design a little form that you can use at the bottom of any of your landing pages or any of your blog posts where it just makes it really short and sweet subscribe to the list first name last name is your typical default for it this you have to have connected if you are using wordpress to go into to for wordpress and mailchimp to speak together here despite gdpr i do have usage tracking on usage tracking is a requirement for a mailchimp for those who have fewer than 2 000 users and therefore are using the free account now what this really entails is that you will know when somebody has clicked open your email i don't really get any interaction through the wordpress interface as to what happens between mailchimp and wordpress just that mailchimp knows what product they have ordered and then when i have sent them a campaign according to the product that they have ordered or according to any criteria i can see when somebody has opened one of my emails and when they have clicked one of the links the logging error in warner's warrantings only that's for wordpress developers so that would be you and that's the screen where you have any errors so let us go over to mailchimp and see what they are looking at here projectica is the list i have for this particular website and let me just see if i can create a segment based on information that came from the word chimp and woocommerce integration so contacts that match all let me see now i've made my list for projectica because it has a global audience gdpr ready however probably only two or three subscribers have opted in while under the new gdpr regime so i won't look at those now because that would just merely be a curiosity here we go orders let's see total orders let's see if anybody has ordered two of my products when i really only have three goose egg that means that of the people that have come in through the store they've all only ordered or that word mailchimp and wordpress have noticed that they have ordered one product create a segment let me see where commerce purchase activity has purchased pregnant yes so we have 33 people who have come in through my woocommerce store for one of my products on projectica i hope that gives you a little bit of an overview as to how wordpress and mailchimp has connected themselves together so now let's go back to doing an actual landing page so in june some of us have had our time off this is copy i'm gonna change what better time than to do a little reflection on what you wanted to get done with your year here's where i'm gonna add some media i'm just gonna add a placeholder bit of media i'll just choose this particular image there insert into the post we will center it and say in the caption placeholder for 20 second explainer video you can subscribe email list with this link no caps is needed be cued up to receive it in no time now the reason why this link works is because in that segments that i showed you earlier when i created this segment to test different people i have created a segment called the new hustle chrono optins let's take a look at what i called that new hustle chrono optins means that after the last email campaign was sent on may the 5th may the 4th the sign up source to get the product was through the generic api which is the hustle api connecting to my mailchimp and hustle is a plugin on my wordpress and i set it up through that that if they were ordering the chronograph that new subscription was going to stick them in a group a project group called chronograph so new subscription where it was immediately added to the group chronograph gets thrown into this new segment so all new subscribers with that will then start receiving this email and go back to the website this link presently i'm going to send them to mailing list which i don't have but i do have a code given by mailchimp for wp for the form so we'll save this draft we will grab this short code right there and we will go back to the post you gotta simply use the back button for it and we're going to drop the form at the bottom of the blog post say sign up in big letters remember these are going to become a button and we're going to create an anchor for it a name equals sign up and i'll just perhaps get the syntax wrong and have to diagnose it later i bet here we go subscribe to the email list link so there's the anchor there's the link to the anchor let's do a preview there you go see that little short code popped up subscribe right there all they have to do is enter first name last name email address let's create a segment where not so much date added as in landing page activity the landing page activity is mailchimp specific landing page a service they offer and i'm going to briefly show you that as well but instead we're going to choose sign up source api generic mailchimp for woocommerce and we're going to add is after a specific date now i'm not going to be making this page live until say saturday so we'll add saturday and here we go i'm now going to show you something that mailchimp has about the landing page service of their own because sometimes having a landing page that is not hosted on your own website you don't need to have wordpress you could be using bootstrap you could be using joomla or jupal or or weebly or wix or squarespace although i'd love to give spare squarespace a try they probably have that covered in a native way very well but mailchimp has a landing page service and i started one a little while ago to give a test as to how it works and here it is tactical chronograph landing page you design the landing page oh that looks funny um you design a landing page exactly like you would be designing a uh an email in within mailchimp and here are the gdpr marketing permissions this is new and so simple content is what the standard tactical chronograph front cover looked like up until june the june cover is going to be different a little example of what it looks like when you're using it and hey this is your call to action grab it grab it right here enter your email and go so that's a really dead simple landing page let's preview it use this space to tell c you're supposed to write some copy here free tshirt or a downloadable pdf that's exactly what we're doing send me the link that looks pretty nifty i like that i'll like that when it's actually completely done but i really like how dead simple it is here's a cautionary tale though watch out for your graphics see how the background graphic just blows away everything else but at least you have the hero image your call to action your persuasive argument and your email collection and gdpr permissions send me the link i like that let's publish it remember it's not actually fully published until that link is out there for somebody to find and click so there is no risk here in doing this save and continue and we're going to add a page title and say so this one is test landing page tests landing page means nothing to the public let's give it a test test web page for people who want to manage their schedule and diary because it is a diary as well a little better save that is an awfully long url i can edit it you want to have something short this is what i was talking about earlier where it was just slash chronograph instead of slash technical chronograph because people want to type in very short comprehensible urls so we're going to take off people here i'm just going to say manage schedule diary better short memorable still kind of long take out the diary in fact schedule is also a verb so we'll take off manage there we have a nice short girl so the test web page for people who want to manage their scheduling diary a little better there's the earl for it the contacts will be added to projectica let's edit that yes to projectica but it doesn't allow me to add them to a subgroup yet that again would be the segmenting where they recognize landing page activity the content has already been designed the recaptcha is enabled so let's just click publish high five it's live i either will be able to edit it later or i'll be able to replicate it but now i could create an ad if i want to for facebook and i already have an automated welcome email set up for everybody who joins the list like i said you should have a thank you page that that your web page redirects to when people successfully sign up but they should also receive a confirmation email to make sure that they are confirming to the list and then a welcome email that comes after the confirmation email that will include all links to any free content that you're providing them so back to the list projectica and we're creating a segment this one is going to be yes it's auto update by already landing page activity i'm going to say matches any of the following conditions landing a page activity they signed up on the tactical chronograph landing page or date is after a specific date may 25th let's see if there's anything else i want to add to that and i already have a segment for this store however i could still add it in here and that doesn't change anything in the results so product purchased is the tactical chronograph we only want people who are subscribing to it new so for now with just the date added it's going to have to be a dumb list where we're going to assume that everybody who joins list after this date until the next time i go in and change the segmentation rules we're going to assume that they're ordering the tactical chronograph this time it's going to come back with zero i'm going to save it as a segment we're calling it the june tc automated segment and put to check as a note to self that sometimes somebody will land in here when they've ordered a different product there we go so my list has a few different saved segments chrono through wu after may 7th that's people who ordered it in the store new hustle chrono optins that's for people who ordered it through the popup that isn't working right yet right yet this is a different product and those went away and this is just anything that they ordered through the store if they check the little subscribe box they get into that segment as well so i hope that makes the uh the process of signing up to a mailing list through wordpress as well as using mailchimp a little bit clearer and some of the important things that you are going to need such as connecting the apis together understanding what your products are and how they can be used to segment a list if you have any comments questions let me know you can always reach me through my own website which is projectica.org you're welcome to also join my tactical chronograph group because everything is free and i'm looking forward to doing more and better videos like this one thanks very much bye and by the way i just wanted to mention who you see in the background particularly taylor right there and somebody who's putting together a 3d printer i've been working this whole time out of the technology sandbox at concordia university and i love it here and i love this giant mac if you can find a space to work in it like a makerspace like me go for it
