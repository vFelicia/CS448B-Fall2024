javascript has three kinds of popup boxes alert box confirm box and prompt box many people think you should almost never use this feature of javascript preferring custom modals instead the reason for this is because they're very obtrusive they lock the entire browser and will take focus even if initiated by an inactive tab but there are still occasionally good reasons to use them so it's they're good to know about so for instance right now we have the alert here so if i run this it's going to pop up i am an alert box right here now you cannot choose where the popup box is going to be that's up to the browser that's another reason why custom modals are often better because you have more choice of where it's going to appear in the browser so these alert boxes are just to give a message and then you hit ok to make the message go away one example is if you want to give a message that a person is just about to be automatically logged out of a website okay let's comment this out and we're going to put another one here now i'm going to show you the confirm box so this is the code for the confirm box you're going to put the word confirm and then you're going to put what you want to be confirmed and this is going to return a a boolean so if if you if we run this to see what it looks like so we can now either push cancel or ok if we put ok it will return true if we put cancel it will return false so if i click ok you'll see in the console you pressed ok that comes from this right here or if i run this again and press cancel and the console say you you press cancel and just you know alert and confirm these are all part of the window object so you could write it like this window.confirm or window.alert that's implied if i run this it will do the exact same thing but the window is just implied when you use alert or confirm okay and the last one is the prompt let me comment this out for prompt you can pass in two things the first is the message that's going to show and the second thing is the default text in the text box let me run this and so you can see what i mean so in prompt you can actually put in a piece of information here and then it will return that piece of information so you can see in this code it's person is going to equal and it's going to set the the variable person to equal whatever we put in here so if we put we can change this name and then if i hit okay you can see in the the con the console.log hello quincy how are you today and we just get it from here this if person equals null or person equals nothing then we're going to put user cancel the prompt else we're gonna say hello and we're gonna bring in the person's name that we used and then how are you today so if i run that again and hit cancel it's gonna say user canceled the prompt okay that's popup boxes thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and remember use your code for good
