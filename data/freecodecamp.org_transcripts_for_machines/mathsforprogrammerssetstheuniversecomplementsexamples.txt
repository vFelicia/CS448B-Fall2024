in this video I'll be going over examples of complements so in this video I've defined the universe to be the integers 1 through five and it's denoted graphically by this blue line and if we recall the definition of uh the complements with or with regards to a we have a complement equals the set containing elements X such that X is an element of the universe and X is not an element of a so in that case we can look at uh all the integers 1 through 5 and if it contains any element from a we throw it out so uh in this case if we look at the integer one we know that that's not going to be there because that's an a if we look at uh the integer two that'll be in our set we look at the integer three that won't be in our set because that's also an A and then four and five are uh within the universe and they're not within a next we have B compliment well we know that 1 2 4 and five are within the universe and they're not within uh B and lastly we have C complement two four and five are within the universe and they're not within C because we had to exclude one and three
