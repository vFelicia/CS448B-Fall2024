hey everybody is Jessie and today we're going to keep working on our react project that we've been working on for this is day 19 so I've just been working on the video page so I have the the proper embed codes now for all of these videos and I noticed something when I was doing this that I want to correct something that I said earlier so I think on Monday I had noticed something odd about what the way the float X class was being applied and I think I figured it out and whatever I said about it on Monday I don't think it was correct I can't remember exactly what I said but you know I just noticed it so I didn't have time to go back and and watch the video and see what I said but but check this out so right now I have let me show you so on this h2 at the top I have the float X class on the container div but then for these h3s oh yeah for these age 3s I have float X right on the h3 I think that I said that float X was not being applied directly to the H tags if I put it on there and that's not correct I'm not I'm not exactly sure what I was looking at on Monday when I thought that but that's obviously not correct and I'll show you I'll show you why so let's take a look at this this h2 so we can see the float X classes are showing up and at first it looks like all right none of them are there but once you shrink that down it's obvious that this got smaller so let me make it bigger and smaller one more time so definitely smaller I mean we can even double check that I'll make this a bit bigger for you all be able to see those those more than a bit it's a lot bigger I let's stir this up there we go all right so we can check out the computed styles and it will tell us exactly I mean I I think I can tell just looking at so that's about 28 pixels there almost there 29 and we make it bigger now we're up to 40 right so it's definitely acting like the flow text should act so if we check sit still that's odd so for whatever reason I'm not sure why but for whatever reason it just shows up in dev tools that has crossed that and I I think I might have mentioned that that's possible that was the case before and then obviously what's happening with these is it's actually overriding the default H tag styles so if I were to put flow text directly on this H tag it would become the same size as this so this h2 would be the same size as the h3 so if you want to keep the H styles but then somehow still have it be responsive which like I said from dev tools I can't really see it maybe you all can see something and I'm just missing it since I'm trying to look at it now live but kind of a I don't know just a small difference but it it makes a big difference when you when you view it you know the h2 is definitely a lot bigger if you put that on the container div so for this page I'm gonna keep it as it is now because I like the size for these H threes I think the H tag is the correct tag to use in this case these are definitely headings but I like the size that the that it's getting now from flow text even when you shrink it down I like that size but I don't like this size for this age too so we're gonna leave it like this the only thing I may change at some point is the font weight to make it the same as this but just just wanted to add that correction to what I had said earlier and so that's out of the way let me say hi to everybody I see some of you on the latch Sana's back awesome so I hope you had a good time on on holiday and where was your in Greece right so anyway that's cool so for everyone watching later on or if you can't see the live chat susanna who was frequently in the live chat hasn't been here for the last two weeks because she was on vacation on holiday so welcome back it's good to be back I do have the secondary stream going on Instagram so if you're on Instagram you can check me out the my username is in the description to this video if you're checking this out on the Instagram live stream you can see the code for what I'm working on on a free code camp YouTube channel and that'll still be available even afterwards as a recording on YouTube and on Instagram the recording will be available for 24 hours afterwards alright so let's get started I'm thinking today just to give you a timeframe will code for about an hour and then then we'll go to Question and Answer we'll try to keep it under an hour and a half for this session let's see I don't think there's any other kind of announcements or things to get out of the way I did have some pool requests so let me show you a little bit about what's changed so everyone's up to speed we have I think visibly I don't think there's anything visibly that's happened so we're just gonna check out the code and the pool requests yeah let me let me just bring the pull request over to keep it straight in my mind so we did three yeah I pulled in three full requests this morning so yeah it was this one 43 44 and 46 so we have a readme file now that is not just the create react app readme which is awesome so thanks for that so let me show you so I want to give credit I'm trying to infer there there we go so Cathal thank you for contributing so this is the first contribution to this repository really appreciate it Thanks so I wanted to put put your profile up there and give you proper credit for that and so we also had pool requests from Sebastian and one from Patrick so Sebastian added react helmet and I it can do more than what we're using it for right now but what what Sebastian added was the ability for us to change the title tag for each page so before it just said resource center no matter what view Iran now it says whatever the title of the page is and then I think we have the and then resource center so you can check that out of course on on github if you want to see more of the code and then Patrick refactored that generic card component that we've been working on so you know this has been this has been kind of cool component because it's gone through a lot of changes since we first had and it just keeps getting better so Patrick added debounce so brought that in from lodash and we've seen that before in our last project we use that with our live search feature so we're using that now for for our depth right so our mouse mouse overs to get that car give the car the hover effect we're also I mentioned this on Monday that it would be nice to have was to open external links in a new tab so we're checking here to see if the link starts with the slash which means it would be an internal link otherwise we're going to treat it as an external link and then in that case if it's external we had target blank which will open it in a new window if its internal we leave that off so it'll just stay within the same window so really good that's good thinking to check link zero so the first position of the link to check for that slash that's that's really cool kind of a nice like simple way to do that so I really like that so anyway thank you to everyone who submitted pool requests and if I'm missing something in your pool request I apologize but I just tried to kind of sum up what each one was about as quickly as I could and now let's let's move on so I just let me make sure that I committed those last changes I think I did yeah I did commit them but I don't think I pushed them yet to get up so just so you all can see everything that is up to date as possible a wolf alright awesome and I think the only significant thing that I've done is I updated a few packages a few NPM packages so I was getting let me see so I manually updated yarn because I had a version that kept trying to do like this auto update and it just wasn't working so I looked it up and evidently you have to manually update so the auto update feature just hasn't been working for a while so I did that and then I started getting errors because I said it couldn't find node SAS so I upgraded the notes that's packaged and then it worked not exactly sure what the problem was it could be that somehow that package got in this place delete it I don't really know but if you're having some error like that upgrade the node SAS package and it should work also upgraded the reacts let's see react scripts that's what it's called so I can't even find where it is react scripts here we go so upgraded react scripts so one version up so that version came out I think last week sometime in the beginning of August and I so decided to upgrade to that my main reason other than just it's good to be uptodate my main reason was I'm still I'm considering ejecting for the the pull request that we had went over on Monday so got a much better explanation so check out that pull request I believe it was 42 for I think there's only one or two pull requests that are still open right now so it's one of those but it's the one that had a lot of changes one of which being it ejected create react app in order to do some cool stuff with our loading SAS so I do like that so in case I go with that and I do eject I'd like to have everything as uptodate as possible before I object the jack so that was kind of in preparation for that but there's since we've done so much in the last few days there's a lot of merge conflicts now so we'll see what kind see how it goes all right so we need to finish up with this this layout stuff so this page is good so we're working on posters I put in the correct links and so this page is pretty much it's it's finished it does look kind of bare excuse me it's nice so this does look a little bit better so I may put in those font icons like I have in the current version of this which if I can find it I'll show you all yeah so the current version has these font icons kind of makes it a little bit less plain so we may go with these because I mean ice if I had started with this maybe it wouldn't look so plain but since we're comparing it it definitely could use something so we may add those in at some point but we've already gone over adding in thawing icons in react with material UI so not not really gonna do that right now so I guess the next thing that we can do is add let's see so we've gone through home logos posters literature okay so the only section that we've really not put in what we need to is a service request form section so it looks like it's it's ready but at least obviously we need to change these but in the main the live version of this when we click on the service request form it shows us the Planning guide first so that's what we're gonna that's what we're gonna do at first I guess I think it would be more user friendly to just link to the planning guide here like would like we're doing down here but my my bosses wanted to show up before you even get to this so I I did add this skip to form in there so it makes it a bit easier for users so I think we're gonna stick with the way that my bosses wanted it and then maybe bring up the neck when we need about this I'll bring up maybe skipping to that just so that we don't have to make people you know go through this every time so let's get this on the page and I'd like to combine some of this it's gonna be a bit more scrolling but I think more scrolling is better than more clicking let me know what you think about that but to me it's it just seems a bit easier to have people scroll the only downside is it will it will seem like there's more text on the page because there will be so you know if you have to click each each view only as a small amount of text if I combined that all into one I don't want it to be overwhelming so if it does look overwhelming then maybe we'll split it up again but I'd like to see what it would look like if it were all on the same all right so let's do that now I believe I've created the page let's see use planning guide okay so we have the planning guide page and we're basically just going to need a card actually we talked about this didn't we I think we talked about this before that we may try to do this without cards and I think we had some mixed opinions about that as to whether or not we should do it with or without cards you know how that looked so I think it looks nice like this but at first I do I kind of want to see what it looks like without being in a card especially since we're gonna put it all on the page it's gonna be quite a lot it's that would be a very long card so let's try it first we can always wrap it in a card later on that won't really be difficult if we decide that we want that so for now we have so we have our H make sure we're not linking to this so let me see what are we calling this planning guide the links should be just planning guides so let's go there so we can see what's going on when we change things all right yeah so it's just really basic let's build out this page a bit more so let's start with the container div oops class name container and we may want to actually I was thinking that we might want to pull in the vertical alignment but this is going to be so big we won't we really won't need it so I think we'll be fine with the container div inside that container we're gonna put a row actually this is going to be if you're kind of a beginner in in reactor frontend development in general this might not be a bad livestream for you I know occasionally beginners ask me will you know will I be able to follow this and sometimes the answer is probably no you know maybe if we're working on some stuff with Express sometimes that's a little bit more difficult to follow if you're not used to it but this is gonna be a lot of basic you know layout so we are using the materialized CSS grid system so that's why we're doing this in this specific way if you're familiar with bootstrap then materialized CSS is basically does the same thing as bootstrap but with the material design style all right so we have this now and we're gonna put that h1 here I think we have been we've been doing h2s the let me do an h2 for now I'm not super worried about the H tags if I were making a site that I really wanted to worry about SEO search engine optimization I might give more thought to the tags the header tags and what was in them but this site does not need to be SEO friendly it's an internal site I actually would prefer if it didn't show up in any search engines so which is also why we're not worrying about serverside rendering not now search engines some search engines may be able to render this and all right but if we're pulling data from an API which at this point we're not but it's not out of the question at some point to do that then basically your content would be invisible to search engines because they won't they won't wait around long enough for the API call to come back and your content to be rendered they'll just think it's a blank page if you do want to know about doing serverside rendering to accommodate search engines you could check out the first project that we did where we used next Jas to handle or serverside rendering really alright we could I don't want to see what the spacing is like here and let's see do we have actually we do have sub headers let me um let me do a separate row then all right so I'm I was thinking about making this all you know just in one row and one column but I think I'd actually I'd like to keep it separate it may make it easier later on to put things into cards if we do end up putting them into cars I may break the cards up by section so that we don't have one big card and if that's the case then I'll probably probably want each card to be in its own column class and on large screens we may even separate it out depending on how much content is in there and instead of having every card be full page width we may do two columns so that that's why I was hesitating so much right there I was just trying to think of what what I may do later on so well actually you're not gonna call that planning guide view right now I have some instructions at the top of that page so I'm gonna make that the h2 and then our first section is titled plan ahead so let's do that and we want this to be an h3 with that to be an h3 and now we're just gonna have some paragraphs I'm just copying pasting some content that I have up on my other screen from what I had just showed you a little earlier just one more paragraph after this one and that will give us a good idea of what this is gonna look like about how much space is gonna take uh whoops there we go all right let's check this out okay so right off the bat I know these these header tags are all messed up in terms of font size so what we need to do to make this the same as the other pages is apply our float X class and in the same way that we've done on the other pages I'm I'm considering using flow text here as well if we really want people to read this then it should be a reasonable font size and right now at least on my screen this is not reasonable so I'm sure for you all it's even worse the terms of font size but I just think it would be difficult for me to read this so I don't want to make my users read that as well and let's see okay it was 16 is that no sorry I was looking at the wrong thing where's the font size that's odd I thought I had a maybe I didn't I thought at some point I had made the default font size 16 pixels but maybe I didn't know maybe I just did it from one page I'm not really sure all right so let's try to add flow text in here in a few places and if we make we're not flow text here and I'm going to add flow text flow text here let's see if that gets applied to everything alright awesome it did alright so you can see that that definitely looks like it'll be easier to read I'm not sure about that line height though let me know what you all think I'm sure line it all right we're not it's not even showing us lion height I do want to see some helpers are typography T I'd like to see what the line height is for material lives for flow text yeah that looks like it's definitely a bigger line height than what we have right now so let's check that out line height line height 1.5 and that's directly on the HTML all right let's see about changing the line height because otherwise it's it's not gonna be nearly as readable and let me just pop let's see alright great let me meet him make this a bit smaller so we can toggle that line hi you just to see the difference yes that's that's a huge difference all right that's what we were missing I was I was messing with this a little bit earlier trying to look at the line heights and this was what I was was going for what I was missing earlier that makes a huge difference in readability so we're gonna throw that line height in there and I think I'm gonna put this line height on flow text it looked like in materialized at least on their website they have this they have some extra styles going on on their website that aren't in the materialized CSS so that line height was in those styles so I'm not sure I'm not sure if it's worthwhile to try to look through materialized and find where they're adding this line height because I right now I know I want to use this on float X but I'm not sure I want to use this anywhere else so for now I'm just gonna put it on anything that has that flow text class to it so let's find our sass file where we're using flow text which should be responsive text and yeah well if you if you want to see what SATs can do this is a really cool example of sass doing crazy stuff that you can't do normally in in CSS so check that out that's that's on the repo and I didn't do this this is from from materialize but really cool stuff alright so now that we have that in there should be able to refresh and it should look the same yep it does great actually I don't I don't mind how this looks without being inside of a card I think that's way too much space between here so we'll do something about that yeah but I don't I don't mind it definitely looks plain but we're not really we're not really going for flashy we just want to get information across the people one thing that might be nice if we do end up going making this section a lot longer is to have some sort of scroll spy so let me let me show you like materialise has I don't know if I want to do it exactly like this but you can see on the side like as you scroll it lets you know where you're at and then you can click that to go right to the section you want that might not be a bad idea to have if this starts to get really long but we'll see let me go I'm gonna go to the live sex I haven't checked in in a while I did set my Pomodoro timer but I said it a bit late so I may have actually been yeah it's already been 35 minutes since we started so let me go I I know I asked you I asked you all some things several times and I never checked for an answer so I'm gonna check now okay cool so Kevin said definitely like more scrolling instead of more clicking so alright so I had asked I had mentioned that I think more scrolling is better than more clicking so glad glad that weren't agreement on that Kevin okay John Hanson had an idea he said and posted resources just put a single to pixel or three pixel green line under each heading length of the lines should be with n cards left or right padding or margins I said the icons icons look ok so so not like in the icon yeah actually thank you for that feedback do you all do you like the icons at all or did you say like forget the icons let me go back to that page just briefly here the poster resources so instead of icons just put a single green line under each heading okay so we're just gonna have a line under Hugh then okay I'm just trying to visualize this right now okay I think about ouch what I think about it maybe we try it out yet just there we go okay okay Sebastian said for future projects that you use create react app check out react snapshot to make it more SEO friendly or use something like Gatsby cool good to know I've been doing a lot with create react app lately next J s was what I'd used previously for all my projects but this project obviously is being using create react app and my projects for the Udacity react nanodegree courses are all done with create react app so lately I've been working with that again used to it so that's that's good to know that you know it could be done it could be SEO friendly even with create react tab okay so Kevin said I didn't know the H tags are meaningful for SEO could you explain a little about that okay so let me give the disclaimer that for SEO it's been it's been about two years since I've really considered myself knowledgable about SEO so when I started being a frontend developer fulltime I quit taking on clients for SEO related work so I just wasn't interested in that anymore it wasn't gonna help me with my frontend skills and I didn't need the money to take on clients like that so having said that this knowledge may be outdated but I think it's still it's still true so your most important like HTML elements for SEO number one is going to be your title tag that's just that's been my experience that if I want to boost an SEO or change things the single biggest thing I can do on the page in the markup to change my ranking for certain keywords is to change the title tag at least that's that's how it was you know two years ago between like you know from five years ago to two years ago I had a lot of success in local SEO with just changing the title tags now beyond that your h1 tag would be the next most important things and then your lower tag so in general what I always recommended in what I what I used was so every page definitely you want to unique title tag and you want that title tag to have some significance for the keywords that you want to rank for but not just the keyword it needs to actually describe what's on the page as well I don't want to be misleading with that and then you wanna have one h1 on the page and that should also be descriptive it shouldn't be the same thing as your title tag but it should be accurate in terms of what the content on the page is and then you can have multiple other tags H tags beneath that but it should make sense you should use H tags for their intended purpose as headers you shouldn't use them for just to style things right if you just want some font to be bigger that's that's not the point and this is basic stuff right so this is not like secret SEO knowledge or anything this is just good practice for for markup for HTML but I think it also works with SEO and that it presents the search engine with a clear structure of your page and what it's about as long as you do it accurately so the like I said the H tag should accurately represent the content that there the header for and I think it you are more likely than to be indexed accurately based on your content so anyway that's why that's my SEO moment today so like I said haven't I have not researched SEO very much at all in the last two years so it's possible that it could have changed but those are just some some general rules definitely do your title tags give some thought to what key key words you'd like to rank for have one h1 and then use your H tags appropriately as headings not for style purposes does that make sense and if anyone else is more into SEO right now and you have anything to add to that or if I was wrong about something please let me know okay so Damien says I'm a day or two behind so not sure if you've covered this yet but I was trying to fix the scrolling such that the resource / side nav would scroll down as you go down the page I tried to use fixed CSS but resources the resource would hover over cars actually I've never tried this I just so so Damien said I wanted to get the effect that the resource menu would be available as user Scrolls down so I'm just to be clear about what we're talking about do you mean you want this to be able to scroll down with as we scroll at first I thought you meant this but I I don't know if you can but I can't even scroll at all while this is open so I guess it makes more sense that you'd want this so let me know if that's what you were talking about Damien and yeah that might not be a bad idea to implement something like that so we'll have to check out material UI I would imagine that they probably have something built in for this but I haven't I haven't tried to do it so but I could see at first I didn't think about it because all our pages originally didn't really require very much scrolling but if we're gonna have pages like this which will have a decent amount of scrolling then it does it would make sense to allow the user to be able to you know get to this side nav even if they've scrolled you know down the page alright okay so I'm gonna go back to the code and let's check out so Sebastian just let me know about the stepper and material UI so let's check that out because if we can put that in the page now that might be kind of the most exciting thing that we can do on this page so it'd be cool to get that done you know while we're doing this so I'm actually let me move this on the screen so you all can see since I just spent about I don't know eight minutes maybe maybe even 10 minutes going through some of the questions in the live chat I'm not gonna do the break right now I'm just gonna restart this you know now and then we're gonna do one more 25minute session and when this is done that'll put us a little bit over that hour that I wanted to spend coding and since I spent a lot of time earlier going over some of the pull requests and the changes then it'll be okay if we go over that hour and then after that I'll go back to the live chat and answer questions so it's fine stepper whoops stepper okay all right yeah this so definitely the vertical stepper makes a lot of sense and yeah instead of you know clicking obviously we would want this to happen on scroll which it looks like yeah okay so it looks like you can control that okay so we can control based on the step index where you're at which one gets highlighted so if we would just track the scrolling yeah if we track the scrolling on the page and then change our state based on the scroll position then that should work and you know we'll we definitely want to change you know how this the default styling of this which is just fine cool thanks Sebastian I yeah I think this will definitely work and yeah this is pretty it's not exactly what we wanted but it has enough of what we want that I think it's worth trying to adapt this all right well let's get a few more sections on the page so that we actually can have enough enough space to scroll to really try this out and then let's try to add it in and probably what I'll do is we'll try to add it in you know kind of as is just to see if we can get it to work and then we'll worry about styling it the way we want it okay so let me add in I got logged out of so this my friends this can get Lugg love me out so there's you don't really have a lot of time in there before you get logged up but I have I do have all the code available and maybe I should just copy and paste that because that's on github so I don't have to worry about getting logged out so let's do that and that'll be nicer I won't need to manually make all the paragraph tags I'll just copy them over so yeah let's go with so the current order is after the plan ahead then we have a list of all the different types of things that we can do all our services but I think we want it I'm gonna try to change that order I don't see anything yeah I don't see anything in the text that that's in there that would a user would expect to see a list right after that of services so I think we can safely change the order of this so right now I have this I will need to change the age tags but it should work I should be able to just paste this in and have it work so we definitely don't want these to be age ones area I'm going to make these h threes and we can change this too this will be a link to and then we'll need to import slowed up in there I believe I grabbed an extra div that we do not need there we go we need to import link if yeah so we're not using that already so have it here I thought I had it how am i linking to these oh you know what now I remember we switched it to generic card so we wouldn't have to bring in links oh here it is okay now we'll see how that looks great make sure that works yep that works okay it gives us a bit more bit more space all right now we also have a larger section that are all the services I think that that may make sense as a separate section let me just I'm just gonna put it in down below so you all can see it we can figure out whether we want it to be in a separate section I mean it would be beneficial if users did see that because they may not really know it all the things that we do so it might be important that they see at first and they don't have to click to get to it and this would be cool because this this will have some markup that is somewhat less common I know I had never used this markup before until I did this project so we have all these these deals and DTS right so this is actually I wonder what the default styles will be okay not bad not bad so if we could if you see each so each DL right has DT which is like the title and then your d DS which is your content right so this is if you're gonna have like a dictionary style listing this is the proper markup to do that so you'll have you know your word and then your definition all right so that's yet not really sure what I want to do with that yet see what a tag were using okay so you're actually using a shoe it's good it doesn't really look that good to have the header be an entire sentence I may switch this yeah let's switch this I think this we'll look a bit better there we go okay so if services and that's a bit of an introduction and then we have this okay all right not bad now let's try to put that that scroll well we'll work on making it via Scrolls by style list so let's see if we can fit it let me think how we gonna fit this in I guess this will end up being a fixed position so it's really gonna exist outside the normal flow of our layout so it won't it won't really matter where we put this I'll probably put the mark up for it above all of this and then we'll give it a fixed position and it will stay with the user the entire time yeah that makes that makes the most sense for this so let's grab let's grab some of this markup lose the line this one I would see if we're getting anything from interior UI we're not we'll grab everything from now and probably won't need to keep it all though I guess this may actually be better as a separate component at some point right now let's just we'll just take all this and put it in our component just to see if it works actually it was this the one I'm gonna see if I'm getting the right one okay now I want a needle on with the granular control right yeah there we go this will bring in the styles too since it's it's not gonna like it if I don't bring in the style okay now style should I feel it'll do yeah we're definitely gonna need to change those to fit with our page but for now we'll just grab everything and put it all inside inside this div doesn't make sense to put it above the title but I'm gonna give us some space okay let's let's see if we've done this correctly oh that was I'm excited that was a lot of copy and pasting and I to get it all in the right spot click a step to get started next next great okay so everything's working we have more than we need and we need to style it differently and for some reason I grab the horizontal I guess instead of the vertical I'm not sure how I didn't notice that but we did need the granular control where's our vertical looks like we can just switch to orientation vertical and let's see if that'll work for us we're so stepper great all right so we have a vertical orientation now which is awesome let's move this over this is gonna look really bad at first while we test it but the only styling that I want to do at this point is just to make it fixed so that as I scroll I can still see what's going on there we go positionfixed great I don't want it on that side I relive it on this side so right whoa all right so that's why it's giving us there we go gonna get rid of that that width and we want to add that great and that actually yeah that's that's not a bad spot later on it might not be a bad idea to have it down just you know a little bit more but I thought it was gonna overlap this text but it doesn't it's too close so it doesn't look great but for right now that's good that'll just let us see what's going on so let's grab this style here and you should be able to change it yep go change it here we can just replace this with that and we need to also add that position I forgot to copy that over some fixed oops and we need commas because this is an object great whoops what did I do nope I did not put that in quotation marks okay great all right now we need some sort of scroll let's save material UI all right so let me let me ask this see if any of you know before I before I start searching not that I'm against searching but it's just boring if I'm searching while I'm livestreaming so is there something built in the material UI that I can use that will track scrolling if not is there something for react the track scrolling that I could use and if there's not something specific for react I just need some sort of plugin that is vanilla JavaScript don't want jQuery that tracks scrolling if none of those if we if we don't have any of those things then we'll just have to do it from scratch which is cool but we're not gonna have time to finish that today so I'll check I'm gonna give it a minute or so and then I'll check the live stream or I'm sorry the live chat see if you all know anything about that also I I wouldn't worry too much about the scroll tracking working with touchscreens so there's going to be some use cases where people may have a large screen that is also a touch screen but those will be small but the use case in which we'll have a mobile screen where when you touch I'm not as worried about because this will just be hidden on those screens we will not have enough space to put this in so for now I'm just worried about normal scrolling that's not touch based okay so it looks like Sebastian says it doesn't look like there's any anything builtin materiai all right so my search is on the other screen some of the top searches have used jQuery but it looks like I found one that's vanilla JavaScript it's a it's a pretty old answer though it's from seven years ago so it might work but maybe I don't want to find one that's that's different okay so then says what do you mean by track scrolling basically I just want to know the users scroll position on the page so that once let's say when they're at the top section this part will be highlighted but then once they get here then that second section will be highlighted then the third section right then will have a fourth so I want to know when the user gets to a certain point in the page at that point I want to change the state which will then change which one of these is highlighted so these will all correspond to a section on the page okay does that make sense actually there's a I don't need this but there's a react Kurt react cursor position NPM package that sounds really cool it'll give you coordinates for where the cursor is so fYI that's that sounds really cool I'm finding finding stuff about how to do this with react native okay look I have found some code that it looks like people use this for react and it has worked so then in the live chat says a manual window dot on scroll will be the handiest okay that's that looks like it looks like some of the stuff that I'm seeing on my other screen with the the searches so that's probably what we'll go with so we're not gonna do it in this stream but I think this will be kind of cool to do on a live stream so I'm gonna save it I'm not gonna work on it and we'll work on it tomorrow what's tomorrow Thursday okay yeah I'm pretty sure that I don't have anything going on tomorrow afternoon so it should be same time we'll have time to do this I'm not gonna work on it if one of you really really wants to work on it and submit a pull request for it that's cool too I'm open to that in which case we would just take the beginning of tomorrow stream and go over how that was done either way I definitely want to show on the live stream how we do this because I imagine this is I'm well for sure I'm not the only person trying to do something like this in react and it wouldn't be useful just for this it would be useful for any type of animations that you want to happen as the user Scrolls and I'm sure there's you know 100 other things that would be useful for as well so I'll work on other things there's definitely a lot of a lot left to do a lot of small style things and so I'll work on that now the coding portion of this is going to be done so if you were just sticking around for the code you're not interested in the question and answer session thanks for watching and you could go do whatever you need to do now otherwise if you have any questions please put them in the live chat right now I'm going to try to get through all your questions and answer them as best as I can and not just me everyone in the live chat is very knowledgeable and helpful and provide some great answers too so if you think I'm a noob and you don't really want my opinion then it's still worth it to put a question alive because there are other people in this lab chat that are far from being noobs and are very knowledgeable if you don't want to put something in the live chat for whatever reason you can direct message me on Twitter or message me on any other social media platform that you like to use or you could put it in the comments to this video and I'll get to it when I can probably the most reliable way to get in touch with me is a direct message on Twitter if for whatever reason I just tend to get to those messages faster than I do to like let's say comments comments on the video are actually a little bit hard to keep track of for me because there's a lot of videos now so I trying to go through and find which videos have the comments a little bit difficult alright so let me scroll back up and on Shaddai answer any questions it doesn't look like there's a lot so this may not may not be a very long questionandanswer session okay awesome so it looks like in with the text the font size it looks like you all think that the larger font size with the increased line height is definitely better easier to read so I'm glad glad you all agree with me on that I've actually had some pushback from people who I'm building websites for here at the university that they're they don't really like the larger font size mainly because then they can't fit as much text on a page it looks huge my response is usually well maybe there just shouldn't be as much text who's gonna read all that text that then also hey it's a heck of a lot easier to read it when it's when it's a larger font size okay so Kevin had an idea about the poster resources so we had talked about posters so but first I talked about putting a big icon at the top here like I have on the live version but it seems like that's we're not gonna go with that at least I had some feedback from some of you saying that that would not look good which is fun I'm definitely open to a change we had John said well what about putting a line under here and now Kevin says what about the Green Line and then also an icon on the left left like a chrome notification card so we would have a much smaller icon over here which of course would push this over and then the line so yeah we could try that as well yeah it wouldn't be a big deal to try both ways and see how they look so maybe we'll do that if I have time maybe I'll try to do that before tomorrow streams so that we can compare and see which one looks better okay and earlier Damien had an idea in a question about how to make it work to make this stay fixed at the top so I asked him for clarification and in fact it was so basically once that would sometimes it's called a sticky nav or fixed navigation and where we would scroll down to can't do in this page we'd scroll down and it would still stay there so yeah so we've done that on previous projects well we kind of had a version of a sticky and at one previous project right we had one that kind of went sticky as we scroll but yeah I definitely think that's a good idea so we'll try to implement that as well so thank you for that Damien so Chaz Chad says hello I'm a new hey Chad don't worry about it I definitely consider myself somewhat of a noob too in many areas so you're in the right place hmm okay Damien says I've been having some issues when trying to push to github with everything uptodate is there a way to resolve this I did try googling and just end up pulling your work he said any tips on resolving this error let's see yeah Damian so not sure so then had some advice for that to make sure that you add the changes and commit the changes first and then do your get push so I'm not sure yes adamian not sure if that advice would work or if you're already doing that or not so yeah let me know if you want to message me on Twitter or something so we can talk about it and get some more information and I'd be happy to help you okay XANA actually is is not a fan of the sticking of it says it takes up space maybe go with an arrow to the top instead alright let's let me think about that it does take up space it's not a very tall header though wouldn't take up that much space maybe we'll have to think more about it I I mean I'm also fine with having that that little arrow to the top would definitely have well especially if we're going to do a scroll tracker then we could have it so that once you get to a certain point of scrolling then the arrow appears what what if we did this alright how about this idea what if we had it so that as you scroll it looks like this but as soon as you scroll up a little bit it appears no matter where you're at so a lot of I think apps do this so as you're scrolling down the top bar just disappears but if you just scroll up a little bit it'll it'll come back again so I that may be the best of both worlds so that it's not blocked if you don't want it to block your view right it won't block your view but then if you want to see it all you have to do is just scroll up a bit hopefully that makes sense did I do this I do think I did this for something I guess I guess I could show you an example in case it's not clear to anyone just gotta remember what project that did this on I let me see if it's this project no not that one okay all right so I've done it here so I'm gonna bring this over so this is a project that I did sometime last year and you can see I mean this is a transparent nav so it's not really that permanent anyway but it goes away and now as we scroll down you see goes away when we scroll up it just appears right so something like that might be cool to have all right so hopefully that was a decent illustration of what I was what I was talking about okay cool so about the salami let me bring this over since I just had this question if I can find this sorry I know I'm I'm not making sense right now but let me show you what I'm talking all right so Matt was able to catch the live stream right now so he's in the lot the live stream in the live chat so about this pull request so if you want to check it out pull request 41 if you want to check it out this is what we're talking about so you can see this is the explanation which is excellent you know very detailed so anyway Matt's in the chat right now and he's saying about the pull request is setting state like you know just using state equals and then an object the newer way and let me see if I can this should be me up here so setting state like this as opposed to using the constructor like this he's asking is that the newer way so essentially like part part of this pull request was changing from this to this assuming that this is the preferred way and it's a better way and that this was not the best way to do it but it may be the case that this is just a newer way to do it and is acceptable so that's that's the question all right so all right so Ben says you can do it like that in the constructor for the initial state and then set state for all changes yeah so I think what we were okay so Ben I think Ben is actually saying do it in the constructor as well you stay yeah so basically yeah let me explain so I could probably bring up and show you the difference in context here so for instance in generic card component we are using the constructor right and we're doing this state and we're adding things in here but in I know we're doing it differently in one of these components so let me see we were we were doing it differently there we go so for instance here in logos Jas I'm setting state initially just like this right as opposed to doing it like this with within the constructor okay and Matt said that he he actually talked to someone who is a developer for a for a large startup company and said that he's been doing it this way like we're doing here for a long time so not sure that there's any difference okay so been saying I think both work this is uh this is a good question like who so I think maybe I need to do a bit more research on this so right now in in this project most of the time we're doing things like this in fact this this may be the only time when we're doing it like this I'm not exactly sure about that but it seems like this is the way we've been doing it and it works but this also works right I've been on this page it works as far as I know there's no errors so let's see those okay yeah so no errors even as we change the state there's still no errors so in terms of what works right we know that it works but I guess my so basically but my thing is that at this point is assuming that they both work and that these are both in use and you know in react projects that are out there so you know so evidently there's a developer at a large startup that's doing it like this so assuming that these are both in use and they both work which we know they work is there any difference and then would that difference simply be a performance difference or is there something bigger that um that we're missing on this actually you definitely would like to know about this so if you're watching the recording it would be nice maybe if in the comments let me know which way you you handles this I do you use one or the other or a combination sometimes you use one or the other or what's your reasoning behind it so definitely I mean this is definitely beyond my current knowledge of react I think I'm pretty sure that in the react course that I'm taking right now this was the way so the one way we're doing an engineer card Jass is is the way that they've shown how to do that but like I said just not sure what the difference is okay okay Pat Fewell says it's es7 new to a lot of people okay so it's see we have quite a discussion going on now in in the live chat about this issue so all right so at this point I think I'm I'm to the bottom of the you know I'm to the end of the the live chat so I'm I'm gonna wrap this up but if you want to continue this discussion in a live chat sort of way check out the slack channel so let me show you all the slack channel so FCC live stream so FCC live stream slack calm so we have this slack channel so you can continue the discussion if you want to I'm definitely interested in this and I'm gonna try five time I'm gonna try to research it a bit more as well maybe look at some other projects and see how they're doing it so okay so thank you so much for watching and for all your help and the live chat I really appreciate all your your opinions on you know on everything that we're doing and today especially it was more about the look of things which is definitely it's super helpful just to get a second opinion a second and sometimes third and fourth and fifth set of eyes on this you know right away that immediate feedback really ends up making it look you know so much nicer so yes I think that's it for day sorry the discussion is still going on in the live chat so I was just reading the last few a few comments there but I will be back tomorrow okay matt said to let him know about the pool request yeah I've definitely yes oh I've downloaded that that pool request as a separate branch and I've been trying to test it out the thing I had today is that so I tried to merge the changes that were in master into that pool request into that branch and I didn't get through them all before I so I just a lot of things that have been updated so I couldn't get through it all and kind of properly test it but I I definitely want to so I'm gonna try to give that give that a shot when I can cuz hopefully sooner rather than later because the more changes I make it's just gonna make it harder to merge everything okay so I'll be back tomorrow sorry I keep trying to say goodbye and not doing a good job of it but I will be back tomorrow and same time 2 p.m. Eastern Time and we'll work on that scroll the scroll spy and that oops I'm back too far there we go so we're gonna work on this tomorrow until then have a great day and I'll see y'all tomorrow
