i want to begin this video by reviewing the definition of complements so the definition of a complement of a set for for instance the complement of a equals the set containing elements x such that x is not an element of a i'll now be going over two new algebraic laws for sets the first are the law of complements the law of complements states that if we take the union of a set and its complement it equals the universe or if you take the complement of the null set it equals the universe furthermore the intersection of a set and its complement is the null set and that should be clear because if you have uh the set a and you are intersecting it with everything that is not inside a there's clearly not going to be any overlap so you're going to have an empty set the next one is the law of involution so involution states that if we have a state here let's call it state zero and we feed that state to a function in this case we're going to feed it to the complement function then when it gets to state 1 if we again feed it through the exact same function the complement function it will result in state 0 again in this case if we fed state if we fed set a through this cyclical function here then we would have a feed it through complement we get a complement feed it back through the function we get a complement complement which equals a and then we can have a complement complement complement which would be a compliment and then you get the idea it's cyclical
