In the previous video, we saw what a LAN is. You know, a network which can span across a small region. Now imagine you want to connect devices across multiple cities or multiple continents. Now, that's a huge network and that kind of network is called WAN. In this, to explain this, let's take an example of an office campus you can have multiple buildings, you know, multiple floors, you have multiple computers in this different floors. So, how do you connect them? You take a router and put it in each floor connect all the computers in in that flow to the particular router and you take a bigger router and you can all of your router's to that and that's how you can create a small WAN.
