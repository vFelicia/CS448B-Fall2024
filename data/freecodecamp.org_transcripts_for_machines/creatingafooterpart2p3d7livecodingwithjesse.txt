hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're going to finish up this footer I took the morning off to watch my kids when my wife had a doctor's appointment so I haven't done much but I had one really good idea at least it seems good now I only had it five minutes ago so we'll see we kept having some conflicts with the Styles yesterday when we were working on this footer so I I thought why are we even keeping the old styles we took everything off of this page so we don't need any of them so I went in went to the top of our main master template here and I commented out all this ESS and when I did that it changed to the footer Abed all of this stayed the same which which is good it should have but down here in the footer I have a little little difference here if you remember we had a different font and we had a shadow on it before and we had some you know buttons this was stabbed more like a button all these links so now this is using the materialized Styles still needs a little bit of work but now we won't have to fight with all those with all the styles that are there now what this does mean is that we're not going to be able to keep any of the elements that we're there like intact as is which is okay with me you know they're they all needed to be redone anyway but I think this will make things a lot easier for us it'll be pretty straightforward now when we try to do something with with materialized it should work and all we have to worry about is just any customizations that we need to make on top of materia so today I'd like to get this looking exactly the way that we want to we want it to look I'm thinking two Pomodoro sessions so two 25minute sessions of code in between we'll do our five minutes of questionandanswer and then we'll finish up with some question and answer it should be about an hour and a half assuming we get the normal number of questions and during that time what I'd like to accomplish is getting these headers to all be the same and I'd like everything to be aligned to the right these need to be buttons according to basically this well either you know what you know what I like better on on a dark background like this I actually like what I call the inverted button so I probably didn't make that up I'm sure I got it at some point from somewhere but I I don't remember where I got that term from so basically you if you don't understand you'll see when we do it but it's going to be just a white outline of a button and you'll be able to see the green behind it so we're gonna do those buttons we're gonna fix this so that it looks a little bit nicer and then we'll doublecheck on a few screen sizes how everything stacks up that's not okay yeah so that's not too much but it's going to be nice especially for for those of you who maybe are just getting into things with CSS and aren't super confident with doing things with CSS or maybe just working with materialise so I would say at a level of difficulty this one's going to be like down at like a 1 or 2 you know it's going to be a really beginner friendly stream but if you're not a beginner you know please stick around because we're still you know can get into some more in depth in the question and answer sessions and there's always people asking questions that are you know unrelated to what we happen to be doing in this particular stream so I see in just a few people in the live chat so hey how's it going thanks for joining us so I did schedule this stream a little bit later than normal so we have not quite as many viewers as we normally do at this point but that's probably my fault okay John John Hanson says he's getting an echo is anybody else getting an echo let me know it'll be a few seconds because of the delay but it shouldn't be okay I was double checking to make sure that my voice wasn't playing over any speakers here I don't hear anything okay awesome so we'll get started a few I switched back to my main camera so so far I've had no problems with this main camera because I I had to restart my Mac because it froze yesterday right when I was about to leave it froze so I just shut it down and got to it today when I got into the office but the good thing is since I had to restart everything anyway I updated Visual Studio code I updated Adam I updated about 10 packages in Adam so I did a lot of updates that I had been putting off so I guess that's ended up being good and the camera works now so I have my second camera ready to go so I actually have it over on the side sheets help bring it in to the shot but in case this one freezes I'll just bring the other one in and we won't have to mess with it throughout the throughout the stream okay so now we got a little bit more activity here in the live chat I see Umberto's here Hey umberto I got your your direct message on Twitter for a day or two ago I'm sorry I didn't respond to that I checked it and then I didn't have time to respond and then I forgot about it but I just remembered it now when I saw you so sorry about not responding but I did get it so I don't want you to think I'm ignoring you okay let me set my timer we're gonna do 25 minutes of code all right so first thing I think I want to do is get these headers looking you know kind of uniform right now this is an h5 and these are h2s so these are being pulled in from the content management system and we hardcoded this and what I think we ought to do especially now that I see everything without any styles yet you know from with the old styles I think I'd like to just hard code these as well I I don't think that these things change very often I know we talked about this yesterday of things that don't change often and I mean like aren't likely to change more than once a year I don't really have a problem hard coding them because that's not it's not really a big deal for me once a year to go in and change a line or two hopefully this entire site is redone in a year so I may never have to come back in and change anything but I don't want this to be an h2 I don't want these to be as they are I want them to have the proper classes to make them materialize buttons we will have to so they don't have that inverted button style and materialize by default at least they didn't the last time I checked there yet they are always adding new things so it's possible I missed it but I do have some Styles that I've made you know in addition to the materialized styles that work with materialized so it's just kind of a little addon that I use personally in my project so we'll just have to find that from a previous project and put that in but we're gonna we're going to redo this I think that'll just make things a lot easier once we get that done then we'll work on this down here all right so let's go down the bottom I think actually we should be able to get rid of a lot of this JavaScript now so I'm thinking it's fancy yeah I'm just gonna comment this out right now I will see if we get any errors but there shouldn't be anything on the page that requires this dis JavaScript as we start adding in more elements we might find that we're pulling in something from a template that that does need that and then we'll decide what to do same way we have wait a bit here for for YouTube I don't know that we'll need that I'm not going to go through that now you know we're focusing on the footer right now but we should be able it looks like we should be able to cut down the length of this file significantly so even though we're adding in some hard coded things that we'll add to the length I think we'll be able to cut out enough that it should at least even out hopefully be a bit shorter than it originally was and if it comes down to it we can always separate these things out into their own components if it gets too large so we're looking at these two columns here so this is our Center column and then here we have our our last our right column so let's get rid of these and I think we will need to we will need to go into our CS file so our C sharp file and get rid of some some things some lines in there or else just going to throw an error so let's find that you know like building a folder okay let me let me grab this folder so I see so I'm trying to find this folder and I'm assuming I could just drag it over here I think I can write not see if I can just drag it here whoa okay cool I don't need these this this okay all right so we need to find find where we were there we go master pages so this is what I was looking for oops alright I got a call I gotta take this call so I'm gonna mute my mic and take this you all right sorry about that that was a great time for the normal disclaimer this show is just me doing my normal work as a frontend developer I'm employed at a small university full time so occasionally I do get a knock at the door or a phone call that I need to take so the goal is just to show you what my work day is like and maybe if you're interested in frontend development or you like me pretty much work on your own as a developer and don't know what it's like for other developers I thought this might be kind of helpful to see me doing my thing making mistakes trying to work through it so that's why you know we have interruptions like that and you know I don't mind when it happens I don't like if it's a really long interruption I don't want to waste your time but that one actually was somewhat related to what we're doing so evidently someone is has a link to some page on the main website that from what is described these are the words of the person on the phone not mine that it it works but it doesn't so I don't know what that means but two two guys from the IT department are gonna stop by my office in about an hour and 15 minutes and they said they think it'll be easier if they could just show me which is cool I don't even have to go anywhere so I'm fine with that but anyway I don't mind helping out with stuff like that actually currently right now I'm the only person that knows any web development that has access to these files so I probably am the right person to go to for that in a few weeks though there will be somebody else here working fulltime that will have access so it won't all be on me okay so let's I just so Philips just said in the live chat can we do bad lipsyncing while you're on the phone I'd have been hilarious yeah so I early on when I was streaming there are a few times when I get calls and I just talked and everyone can hear what I was saying and then somebody I can't remember who it was but somebody in a live chat was like you really need to mute your mic in case like something is said that shouldn't be said on you know on YouTube for everyone to hear and so that was a good idea so now I am ute when I when I can when I when I remember it because occasionally that happens it's not like big secret things but sometimes since some of the marketing department sometimes we get information before it's released to the public so that we can prepare how we want to say things you know get things ready so occasionally I might know about something before everyone else is supposed to know about it so so I'm not trying to keep you all out of my business you know otherwise I wouldn't really care but that's better safe than sorry with that kind of thing anyway back to the code so we use that that footer so that mid content and right content and we're just going to get rid of all references to those in here as I said earlier otherwise we'll get an error because it's going to be looking for those elements and it's not gonna find them so now we've removed them from this csharp file and we'll save that and did we say if I'm not sure if we actually saved this file so we may have to get rid of them again okay it did save awesome so I'm gonna refresh we should see nothing in these columns now and we should get no errors okay awesome great so now what we need to do is set up so we have our column in here and we need to do an H 5 mu nu H 5 great yesterday I had complained that it wasn't Auto completing my my tags my HTML tags and you all had charlie who it was sorry I can't remember who it was that old that said that Emmet is available by default and vs code but whoever was that was awesome so thank you really sorry I can't remember who that was not I'm usually pretty good about that but anyway when I did the update one of the things that said that was in the new update was it completed HTML tags now by default so I was happy about that so let's bring up actually I'm gonna do this on the other screen I'm gonna scroll down here just to see what was in here was supposed to be in here I'm gonna pull that to my other screen so I can copy and paste it easily and then we'll we'll build this out to match that that first column that we had made up here whoa do we want that to be all caps I don't think we want that to be all Cavs we'll see we'll see how it looks but I'm just not sure that I want that much text to be capitalized I kept waiting for the auto refresh I'm just so used to that in my other four objects whoa that's weird I thought we had okay I had added these classes on to this let's see if I really want this I'm gonna add these classes as well but now that I look at it I'm not sure that I want this so the light class is gonna make the font weight smaller so I think it makes it about 400 font weight and then if you add the thin class that makes it 300 we can double check that for sure but I'm pretty sure that's what it is and that's just built builtin to materialise let's see how that looks so I found that okay not bad so I found that I like how the the light and sometimes even the thin font looks but only on my Mac so I have nice screens and it looks good when I try to look at it on an older screen on a Windows computer it looks terrible and you can barely read the text so I just I have to always remember that that before I commit to a font weight I need to check it on older screens especially for I mean really for any site but if it's an internal site I know for sure what kind of screens most people are going to be using because there's pretty much a standard Windows computer we have like lenovo's with the standard sized screen and resolution that I would say like 90% of the people here use so I can be pretty sure of what they're gonna see so we'll see we'll just make sure we doublecheck that at some point I'm not sure why we're getting why are we getting that space oh okay I had forgotten we actually have an image that's going to show up here I just haven't we don't have the right source so see we have this image we don't have the right source for it yet so we'll just have to get this in here so that explains the difference the difference here which yeah we'll see you'll see I don't know that we actually need another logo down here now that I look at it because we have this sticky header we're always gonna have a logo visible yeah actually let's take this out you know that's one less image that needs to load on the page and I think it'd be an unnecessary image so if we can remove it then great alright awesome okay we're just going to put in just a regular paragraph tag and then we'll get to those buttons the buttons will be kind of fun just to see how we can adjust what comes with materialise and just kind of make our own variation on it so let me copy the text here oops I need to remember how did we do this with Emmet there we go I need to remember to start using Emmet because I think it'll be a lot faster than what I'm used to okay I just checked no beer said that says I think it's John B is the one who told you that visual studio code I met by default I think you're right I think it was John B I actually I remember it now because I remember saying that John B like officially had the the tip of the day like the best best comment in there something like that for telling me that so anyway I don't I don't see John B in here so might not be watching but if you catch the replay thanks again John B sorry I forgot that it was you but thank you because that that is gonna save me so much time I'm sure once I get the hang of it okay let's see and I want to change so this should not be two hyphens obviously that needs to be an M so I'm gonna look I'm gonna look up the code for that let's see okay so we'll replace this with an M and you'll see I'll show you the difference in case you're not sure what's what's going on so all right so I'm gonna zoom in otherwise it's not really gonna be obvious and I'll pull this over as well so if you you can see on this one we have two hyphens and there's click it's clearly to life as you can see the space in between it right here we have a real all right so that's what we're supposed to have here so this was probably maybe copy and pasted from somewhere or entered into a WYSIWYG editor and it was probably if it was copy and pasted let's say like from a Word document sometimes if you put two hyphens next to each other depending on the editor it'll automatically switch it to this so I'm assuming that that's something like what happened and when it got copy and pasted it it stayed is the two hyphens I don't know but anyway when we see something like that will definitely replace it with the HTML code for that and then one will make sure you know they don't it'll render properly okay let's get rid of this Center right so you don't want that and we don't want the center here either and may as well just put in the next the next part here and I'm just gonna copy this paste it and then I'll bring in the rest and probably about out of time for this Pomodoro session so if you got if you're asking any questions I will get to them in just a few minutes and now that we have this in this just at least give us a nice idea of how this is going to look still don't have the buttons and yet but you know we'll get to that I may as well try to add them in here until I hear the the timer go off let's see okay let me do this image though right is it button BTN nah now I can't remember what it is all right let's try it like I can't remember it if I spell out button or if it's BTN so we're about to find out okay cool that was it alright so here's the default style we're gonna go ahead and I'm gonna make put another button in here and then put the button in there and then we'll change the styles to do that inverted button that I was telling you all about at the beginning of the stream so this should give us all the buttons we want there we go great okay obviously they're not all gonna say apply this will say donate this will say visit right now it says visit campus but I I personally prefer shorter button text so I'll just put it as apply and visit and then this will be I'll keep this as donate it says support Franciscan in the button right now which i think is just way too much text for a button so we'll see I'm sure that my boss will let me know if that's if I'm allowed to do that or not at some point but get a minute okay about two minutes left so we can at least start looking for the code that I need for this so like where did I have the inverted button okay you know what we did the inverted button on project one so I just need to look at I had project one all the code open and Adam earlier today and I thought hey I'm not gonna need this anymore right and so I closed it out and here I do need it again so let's just go to github and grab that code and I'll shoot I'm still my incognito window let me go on a window where I'm still logged in and I'll be easier to find it okay see I react yep that's what we want let's see if we can search great okay so here's our button inverted styles so let's grab these and I'm being able to search your entire repository for stuff when github is just amazing like it just it's so fast okay yeah we'll just grab this and this should be yeah it should be fun and let's need to bring up our CSS so for now I'm just gonna save this and I'm gonna apply this button inverted class and see what that actually we're gonna see what that does first thing whenever we get done questionanswer so for right now I'm gonna scroll up in the live chat up to the top and just go down through and get through as many questions and comments as I can then we'll do another 25 minute session of code and it looks like we're gonna be able to get this finished in within one more 25minute session which is great okay so John Hanson said at the beginning of stream that he was getting an echo turns out there were two YouTube windows running at the same time so alright problem solves I'm glad I'm glad it wasn't some issue on my end because I don't really know that much about the audio or the like audio video end of streaming so if it was a problem on my end I would have had the a lot of research no beer says hi Jessie how are you not bad I mean honestly I have a serious lack of motivation today but other than that not too bad I had some bad news about my wife from the doctor this morning so that's kind of a downer but I think everything's gonna be all right she's gonna have to do some physical therapy for a while but the doctor thinks that she'll she'll recover so it's really crazy that she had major surgery a year ago and this is still related to that surgery she's still trying to get over so I feel really bad for that actually the doctor told her she thinks she has posttraumatic stress disorder from what happened and that like that is actually causing pain for her in addition to the physical problems so that's really stinks I just I can't do anything you know I can't I can't help her so oh I know that was a lot of info sorry usually when people ask how you're doing they're expecting like oh I'm doing alright how you going but anyway so that's how I'm doing right now the stream always gets me going like even if the whole rest of the day I just don't feel like doing anything once once the stream starts and I start talking to you all like at least for that time period I feel motivated to do something so thank you all for that for that motivation and I can usually keep the motivation going for a little while afterwards so at least if I stream I get something done that day something productive done okay John Hanson at some point says never never say never when did I say now I can't remember if I said never about something let me know what I said never about because I cannot remember at all what I was talking about them gold asks what editor are you using I'm sure you got a response to that one yeah definitely so it is Visual Studio code let me flip over to that Visio code so for the first two projects I used Adam switch to visual studio code for this project mostly because when I months ago when I initially started working a little bit with this project things didn't display right the syntax highlighting didn't really work well with the csharp files and I had been meaning to try out Visual Studio code anyway so I thought hey let's just try that I just assumed Visual Studio code would probably handle it better and it did so I I just started using it so I think it's cool to show different different editors as well because we always have discussions about what editor is the best so this would be a nice comparison you know that way if you haven't tried it out yet you at least get to see it see what it's like and see the differences okay so rook asks that's cool this person's name and the live chat is rook and then their their avatar is actually a rook from from like the Chesky the chess piece of rook so anyway that's cool my son and I played chess and occasionally so I enjoy a good game of chess every now and then but anyway the question is I saw in a previous video test being done when pushing to github what does that there's a lot of things you could do that that do that in that particular project I'm using something called nightmare and if you check if you check out that project so in that video there'll be a link to the github repo so if you check out the pull request where we added testing so turn that Kevin added that in pretty early on so check out some of the early pool requests and specifically it'll say like testing in in the title of it I can't remember offhand what the the PR number is but Kevin went through a really nice thorough explanation of what kind of testing was being done how it was being done and even some of the other types of testing that we could be doing as well so that explanation is going to be a much better answer than anything I could give you right now in the stream so I would check that out for sure if you're if you're interested in more and how you know how we're doing that alright so my timer did go off let me write down where I left off at okay and let's go set this timer again alright so we've already brought in the CSS that we need for these buttons I probably brought in more than I needed but yeah I don't know that I need this this gives us maybe we do I think we do I think this is the one we want I think we want the button inverted white this one will give us a black border I don't want a black border on the green if we were going on on a white background this would be okay I don't know what ended up happening here but it seems like I named these differently than I would normally do in a project probably at some point I needed to change him and I didn't bother changing the class name because I don't think this is really what yeah this isn't what I wanted what I normally mean by an inverted button so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take this out and I'm gonna put in instead I'm gonna take out this white and this should be what we want I think I can doublecheck that actually I you know what I made a mistake this would have worked these are actually the same thing it's just one as a white border when it's a black border in any case we want the white water one for here I don't think we'll have any need for the black border one so my mistake there at the with that first one I just I I happen to look at the color variable instead of the background color and that messed me up anyway let's just add in class we may not even need but enlarge down here so we'll get rid of that yeah there we go I think we'll get rid of this button large class because I don't want really giant buttons down there I want them to be kind of slim and we'll just put in now I can't remember what it was but inverted okay and let's see what we get it should be a white outline and white text there we go great alright so now we have these when you hover it just fills it up with white okay not bad I think it's it's kind of like more sleek then let's say if we had this this you know very bright color here and I would still say you know in certain circumstances we might want to do that but I don't like having this bright color if we have lots of buttons so we have two buttons right next to each other than a third one not that far away I think it's overwhelming the accent color which is basically what this is the the accent color and I mean this is my opinion here but the accent color is only effective if you use it sparingly it's supposed to draw the eye because it's different and it's vibrant if you use it too much it no longer draws the eye because the eyes used to seeing it right so you you lose whatever benefit that you had from that accent color so if you see right now on the page it's used once the only time you see that color at all is here at this call to action so that's that's how I like to use it now not to say you couldn't use it anywhere else on the page certainly you know as we scroll down this won't be in view anymore you could probably use it somewhere else without really losing the effect but in general I tried not to use it too often on a page okay probably one let's let's put in the correct text in here and just kind of see how it lines up and I may want a little bit of space between these two buttons they're kind of close together otherwise it doesn't look too bad or you know essentially it looks how I wanted it to look so whether or not that looks bad I don't know but we I got down what I wanted to so we're gonna have which one this was apply visit and donates and if we can so I don't want to remove this right now but I think I do want to talk about removing this with my boss because we're gonna have this donate button visible here all the time so we may be able to get rid of this and then put something else useful in here instead of repeating donate or just leave it out all together and we could have just two columns yeah I mean I think well I'm certain that there's something else useful that could go here we don't necessarily need this yeah let's put in let's put in a little bit of padding and bring we use dev tools for this just so that we can see beforehand without having to do a bunch of refreshes what we want to do so let's see I'll do I'm sorry margin left I said padding but I'm we're gonna do margin let's just adding eight pixels I like that let's see eight pixels looks good to me okay so we're gonna add in eight pixels I'm just gonna do this inline yeah I'm just gonna do it inline if I find that I'm using this same kind of pattern a lot then maybe I'll do something else with it maybe I could make it class I don't know I'll figure something out if that happens but I'm not gonna do it right now I think it would be overkill so let's say style and I'm gonna have to remember not to do it the react way have been been in react land for too long and now it it's affecting my basic HTML skills so what do we say margin left and eight pixels it was it was just so hard for me not to put curly brackets in camelcase that and to put comments around that lets verify that I did that right okay great not bad I think this this font size is just way too small I want to doublecheck and see what size that actually is ooh 10 font size 15 that really man maybe it's just the resolution on my monitor but that looks really small like definitely not 15 I want to see where that's being pulled in I I kind of like having the baseline font size at at least 16 pixels see what that how much of a difference that would make not a lot just a slight difference here for most of the text the interior text in this section we're going to use that materialize that responsive font class that they have but I think the footer can be a smaller smaller font size all right I'm gonna leave that for now I don't have to think about the best way to handle this you know because the fonts being set at several different screen sizes let's just try it out right now I think I'm a let's see I just don't want to override too much so let's see what what happens if we do HTML font size 16 pixels we'll save that and let's see what it does and what I want to do is shrink this down and see if it if we're gonna don't write everything and is it gonna look too big on a smaller screen okay and then finally I want to test to see what this does is float X so this is that responsive font okay wonderful all right so that's perfect that's gonna work for us we're basically resetting so that we're at minimum were always having at least a 16 pixel font size but it's not messing up our responsive font so that's good some time with that okay now let's see what else we need whoa I don't like that oh I see what it's like that you know what let's take instead of having a left margin on this second one let's put the margin a right margin on this one so when it gets to when it stacks we don't have this weirdness going on and also we need some we need a margin between these as well so let's just move this off of here put it here and we'll change this from left to right and then while we're in here let's add actually let's just take this off completely let's add a margin of zero right eight pixels bottom eight pixels and then left zero pixels I'm really glad that we decided to do the footer now because otherwise we may have to be like scrolling down a lot to see it it's nice that the page is short here so there's not a whole lot of you know we don't really have to scroll a lot okay that looks nice let's make sure it still looks nice here aha is it no okay okay that's popping that up so I don't think the best thing to do is just to add add a bottom margin here that's just a simplest way to solve this for now so I think at least for me and this is my viewpoint on things if I'm coming into a system like an old system and trying to make things better and it's probably not even going to be around that much longer then I'm of the opinion that it's no it's a waste of time trying to make things in terms of how you're organizing your code and all that try to make things like really like you would if it was a from scratch project so a lot of things reusable and easy for other people to understand right like this is just a patch up job you know to to last us maybe another year until we can have another site so I have very limited time to work on this just until October and then I don't know when I'm going to get another chance to work on it so since we're just trying to get as much as we possibly can done that's why I do I'll do stuff like this right just some inline Styles here because this was the fastest way to solve this problem in a very straightforward way I'm not I'm not really worried about whether or not this is necessarily the technically best way to do it or you know organizationally the best way to do it so another disclaimer there's a good disclaimer these are not tutorials this is not hey I'm doing it the best way possible this is I have various jobs and projects to do with different deadlines this is how I'm getting my stuff done these are the compromises that have to be made because a lot of tutorials are trying to show like this is the best way to do it which is wonderful and I love those tutorials but I thought what was maybe lacking in in terms of videos was videos of someone saying I know this is probably not the best way to do it but here's our deadline and here's all the stuff we have to do so this is what we're going to do now and if we end up getting done early we can always come back and fix it but for right now we need to work because it's been my experience over the last like five years or so projects is that clients just don't always have the money for you to do things the absolutely perfect way and you have to make a decision do I want to just turn down the product the the client do I want to get this finished do I want to you know how do you want to do things right I mean you I don't think it's it's unique to what we do you know I'm sure they're you know when you hire a contractor to work on your house you know he'd love to be able to put in you know granite and marble and you know really nice topoftheline everything and that would look amazing we look great in in their portfolio right but not everybody has the money or the time for that so I think it's the same way with us right it'd be great if we could work on projects and do everything how we would want to do it you know completely you know cutting edge doing everything right but that's just not the reality so hopefully this shows a little bit of my reality of how I need to work so I know my other people might have you know different opinions about that but I don't know I'm just practical about it I don't want you anybody to feel bad for just doing the job you know getting things done so long as it works I you know I do want to say I'm not saying cut corners and make something that's not a good product I'm saying just get things done without worrying about little tiny details in terms of code organization I'll stress over tiny details in the UI all day right because that's the user will see that all right but if I had to choose between stressing every UI details or stretching over the organization of my CSS I'm gonna choose the CSS that's user facing the odds of another developer ever even editing this code aside from me are probably less than 1% right now so I'm not worrying about it anyway so I've been sorry for me going off on that but just wanted to kind of explain my viewpoint on that okay so what do we need to do now I got all offtrack this we need to get this in a better spot basically what I want this to I want it to be over here on this side and then we need to figure out what its gonna do when we go to a smaller screen I don't want it to do this kind of stuff I'd rather have it be probably on top of this copyright so let's give this a shot I think I'm gonna structure this differently so right now we just we have this so we have this on s12 right so it does stack eventually let's let's change first of all I want to change this just to see what it'll look like just with this kind of minor change so we're gonna switch it up and on medium screens we're gonna go full width to twelve columns and then on large we're gonna split it up let's see how much space that gives us to work with now okay all right not bad I mean obviously I want it reversed but okay so we're at that point I mean all right here's our two options I think we can either make it so that they basically just always stacked except on extra large screens or we can extend these out of their container so that we give them some more space you know in particular like here you know let's say we gave extending them out here and gave them just like 16 pixel margin on both sides that would probably be enough space I think I like the first option so let's try that I want to make sure I think that materialized did end up adding in an extra class like an Excel class let's see if it works so we're gonna go large and then X I think that's how they implemented it for a while they didn't have an extra large class and we you had to just make it yourself and then it finally got in to a pool request okay that Excel is what 1200 pixels when is that kick in I think it's yeah so we're still getting you know some of this going on that certain screen widths um I guess I'm okay with that okay yeah I think I'm okay with that but what I need to do though is we need to be able to flip these around so to do that I want to check out I made a class for an earlier project that allowed the easily allowed you without having to create a lot of extra markup to flip at certain screen sizes to flip the order around so I want to check that out first to see if we can apply that here it's been a while since I've used it but it could save us a little bit of time so we're going to go back to github and I'm gonna go to I think I showed you this project yesterday and I don't think it's in the u.s. markup I think it's it's long before we we made this organization it is so it'll be on my my repo profile there we go it'll be on my profile Franciscan Square okay so in the franciscan square site I think I had this wow this is bigger than I thought it would be uhhuh that's why I didn't search I thought I could just scroll through and find it hold on I think I remember what I called it order there we go okay so okay that's what I did so I think I use flex is that my timer Wow the timer went off okay so the only thing that I'm really gonna change I don't want it is completely finish but we're really close the only thing I wanted to change now well there are basically two things I want to make sure that these are kind of on the same line I'm not sure why they're not right now I'll just have to check in dev tools and see I probably have some sort of padding on this or something so I'm going to check that out get these on the same line and then what I'll probably do is just implement some some form of this so what I need to find is where exactly I'm using flex here so I'll just open this site up in dev tools I'll check out one of the one of the columns that I'm using this on and just see what's what's being applied to the parent containers and that should tell me everything that I need to know about that and then basically what will happen is the order property here will flip so that on large screens no no I'm sorry on small screens so this meeting you queries hang on small screens if it has the class of order one the order will be one that has the class of order the order will be so what I'll be able to do then is put and I guess I could put it on here now and then I'll just copy a copy over everything so so what one is this actually needs to be ordered to you want this to come second and that needs to be order one so even though this should always be one based on the markup what will happen is on a small screen they'll flip flop so that this one will be above that one okay now let's let me check the time okay yeah I definitely want to go to do some questions now I have you know I've some people from IT coming over in about 24 minutes so let me screw up get through some of these questions okay Tafari design says while Visual Studio code is free unbelievable yeah it is it better than sublime our Adam I like Visual Studio code so far at this point I think I like Adam better but that's probably just because of what I have set up in terms of my color scheme and my plugins so assuming I would have the equivalent plugin set up for Visual Studio code I may like that better I'm not sure I just I haven't had it set up yet so I mean it took me years to get Adam to the point where I have it now with all these different plugins and things so I've only been using Visual Studio code aside from the few times I used it a couple months ago I've only been using it for what seven days this is day seven in this project so maybe I'll get there with it in terms of plugins and then it can be a fair comparison okay so John Hanson has some good information with what I was saying about font weight and how you know this is really clean and easy to read right now on my Mac but if I were to open the same thing on a Windows machine it doesn't always look so clear so John the saying lightweight fonts light color on a dark background generally it's hard to get a clean font he says it's all about Windows running browsers interpolation there are CSS hacks but they don't work in new browsers okay yeah that's been my experience as well I've tried to use some of the CSS hacks before it's kinda it's like antialiasing something is the CSS property I can't remember the full thing now I always have to look it up but yeah it doesn't always result in what you want it to hey Sebastian's here hey Sebastian how's it going Sebastian says dotnet looks so messy or at least this code yeah it's probably just this code I don't really know this is the only time I worked with dotnet so I'm not sure but I mean this code is kind of messy I can't say anything about this I copy and pasted most of this into this this part is actually my code but one of the one of the things that's going on that's annoying me right now is this file originally was using tabs and not two spaces for indentation and I'm copying in code that was using two spaces for indentation so my indentation is all messed up and I don't I haven't gone through and fixed it because I've been made lazy by standard J s and prettier formatting all my stuff for me so yes it's definitely a little a bit messy but then even up here like all this stuff I did not do it this was way more CSS and JavaScript than I would ever import into anything Nikki says do you work with Pomodoro sorry I just joined oh don't don't be sorry about that any any questions are welcome yes I do work with Pomodoro so I guess it wasn't visible so I have this is what I use for Pomodoro it's just really basic tomato timer calm you know so I do my normal 25minute Pomodoro sessions between each we have 5minute break after four sessions do a 10minute break so it's it's a really nice way to break up the work I find that that 5minute break allows me to think about where I'm at in the project what I'm doing otherwise it's easy for me to get stuck on one thing I can keep trying to let's say find a bug in this one place without thinking of the other possibilities that 5minute break allows me to step back for a second and think one like is this problem even worth all the time that I'm putting into it and then I can decide well maybe not maybe it should be put off until later because it's not really that big of a thing and there are more you know high priority issues to deal with or I could think you know what maybe I should try this other place to look for this bug or something so I really like that aspect of it it's nice you know organization it allows me to see like at the end of the day I can say okay I've done this many Pomodoro sessions that's good for me if I haven't done that many I can think what was I doing and I you know if I look back and say okay well I had three meetings today all right I know what I was doing but if I can look back and say I didn't have any meetings today you know what did I do like I don't know like I was it was I just reading blogs about new frameworks all day or something like so it's kind of like a nice way to keep track of my my productivity as well okay cool yeah if anybody ever wants to know more about the Pomodoro Technique and how I track things so I do use that in conjunction with Trello just kind of give me estimates of my projects I've gone over that before on some of the streams but I'm definitely open to going over it again okay so here's a cool tip so no beers saying with so with Emmet instead of earlier I typed div like this to get a div but he said I can just do what he says I could have just done this and oops wait a second where'd he go just type dot and then it's not working for me maybe I have to change the setting or something but it for right now it is not working maybe if I just add a class like there we go all right cool so nobody here was right I just wasn't doing doing it right so if you just type dot and then put your class names it'll just by default put a div in there really cool thanks okay okay there's some talk about different editors and which ones are free or not that I haven't downloaded at him in a long time it's been on my machines for quite a while maybe like a year a year and a half ago might have been the last time I downloaded at them at that point it was completely free I'm assuming it's still completely free sublime and this is I'm just gonna summarize what was going on here in the live chat for a while it seems like you can use sublime somehow for free but there's a paid version as well I don't know what the difference is between the two it seems like brackets is also paid and Visual Studio code is definitely free although it was said that there seemed to be ways around paying for things I'm not gonna endorse that so that's entirely up to you whether you want to do that but at least officially you do need to pay for brackets and at least some version of sublime safari design asks if I'm recording the whole episode yes so all these streams are recorded and they're available on free code camp just within minutes after the stream ends I put all the videos into one big playlist called live coding with Jesse and then sometimes I split out and I also have videos from each project in their own playlist I don't have a playlist for this project yet but project two does have its own playlist but usually the stream is kind of at the top of the video list since I do streams you know on a ideal week I do it five times a week so it's never really that far down the list you can find one of these strains brian says show her some love I'm assuming that came when I was talking about my wife and and her doctors appointment everything so yeah thanks I mean that's really about all I can do is show some love because I'm not I mean medically it's just like you know there's some things you can do like so like cut out a lot of caffeine and do the physical therapy and things like that you know exercise you know but that's a lot of basic things and I can't I can encourage her but I can't I can't do it for her so hopefully hopefully everything gets back to normal one day so I think I talked about this on a stream awhile ago so I'm not gonna bring it all up again but about last November last October my my youngest daughter was born and my wife had a rupture when the birth happened and it was it was really really lucky that my wife and the baby didn't die but she was sent home from the hospital like the next day or maybe two days later and they never caught that it had ruptured even though there was all this I'm not gonna go into details but there were there was definitely signs that something had happened but they still let her go home and so for like a month we had no idea what's going on but there are all these problems so just to cut to the point she had to have really major surgery we can't have kids anymore and it was very traumatic for her so that's why we're at now almost a year from from when that happened and it's still she's still having medical issues and you know mental health issues so it's just been really hard for you know I think she thought and I thought too that you know she'd be completely you know kind of over this by now and and I think a lot of other people thought that too so it's hard because she's not really getting a lot of understanding or sympathy from people you know that are in the family and around her because they all assume hey well you over this yet so anyway I'm sure it'll be I'm sure it'll work out it's just going to take time let's see safari design says I always feel unmotivated when coding then my motivation spikes all of a sudden out of nowhere so yes it right around the time when I was talking about my wife I was also talking about my lack of motivation today and yes it's a it I don't know my motivation is weird I mentioned I mentioned yesterday I'm not I think it was yes maybe was the day before who knows at some time recently I had mentioned some like stuff about depression and mental health so I'm not gonna redo my whole speech about that but I think a lot of my lack of motivation is is twofold one well aside from everything going on with my wife which I'm sure is is impacting me I really have been super busy and have not even made an attempt to exercise in weeks that's definitely hurting me also I'm on a new antidepressant medication and I'm sure my body is trying to adjust to that and so that's just some days are better than others but right now it's like I just don't want to get out of bed ever so hopefully it'll all be better in four to six weeks that's what they told me so right now caffeine is is helping supply some of the lack of motivation John Hanson says all the best wishes to your wife's recovery thank you I really appreciate that okay John John Hanson clarified so a couple minutes ago I wasn't sure he was referring to some time I said never and I couldn't remember what I said so he clarified and said you said never about needing to go back into the new homepage to edit it yeah you're right I should not say never if I'm lucky I will never have but realistically I'll probably have to at least once when the URL changes for the new student applications for the prospective students to apply so I will well assuming that this version goes live before the application goes live which who knows I don't know I don't really know if we can get this new stuff live before October when I have to switch back to project one for a while I think that would be really ambitious to think that we could get it to the point where it would be good and get approval from everybody that needs to approve it so it really may not be and so closer to I don't know maybe realistically like we're probably talking like December I don't know we'll say I'm hopeful it'll be earlier than that but things tend to move really slowly around here no matter how fast I can build a site like it just seems like for the big sites like this it has to go through a lot of Hoops to get to get approval our Sebastian says last year I had a car accident where I broke my left arm I had to have surgery to fix my bone and now I have five screws my arm I couldn't lift my fingers or hand for almost three months and had no sensitivity now it's almost fully recovered still feeling weird but it's at 99% function functionality I can't lift hard stuff and my sensitivity is not 100% but it's okay all right so that's Wow and so that was a year ago okay well that's I mean I'm sorry that happened to you but I'm really glad that you brought up it's just the idea that I get at least it's somewhat normal today a whole year later not be fully recovered as I like that idea I guess it makes me feel like this is somewhat normal and you know my wife will be okay I think she'll be okay and the doctors think should be okay okay so Tafari design has another question about editors since when working at a company do they allow you to use your own editors on the company computer Roland says depends on the company that's that's exactly what I was thinking as well yeah so it does depend here at the University when I first started working here it was it was difficult to get any anything on my computer at first because so I didn't have admin access to the computer on the IT department did at some point I finally got admin access because I submitted a list of a lot of stuff that I would need for development and at that point I just came in and talked with some of the people from IT and we got on the same page about what I what my development process was like what I needed and kind of like how careful I was gonna be about everything and then I was allowed to have to have access the condition to that was that I don't have I'm not connected like to the main network but in some of the ways that other computers are connected so I was fine with that because I didn't need access to anything but just in case I happen to screw something up which I never have but it's possible that it wouldn't spread it's a lot of other computers so that's um that was that with me so since that point I've been able to use whatever editors I you know I wanted the good thing about like Adam and Visual Studio code is at least on a Mac the download process and installation actually doesn't require you to have an admin password like admin access I think it's probably has something to do with it being electron based because I've noticed that other things that our electron base also do that so anyway technically I guess you could get around it yeah but I have heard of companies where things are really locked down I talked to a guy that's a developer he lives in the same city as me but he actually works up in Pittsburgh and he said like there are some companies that he his agency works for that are even really picky about like what what linters get used in your editor like so it's you know they're picky right down to really my new details in really in situations where it doesn't make sense that they're that picky so I I guess I'm kind of fortunate and that I get a lot of leeway to pick my tools and even you've seen from project to project I like to try out different things so not everybody has it like that johnjohn pink B says is there way to upload to code pound a previously downloaded code pen zip file I don't I don't know I've never tried to do that I heard about that being done so sorry I really can't give you an answer maybe somebody else with the live chat has had experience with that but yeah I've I really have no idea okay there's a there's still a lot of talk about the the editors so I'm skipping over a lot of the editor discussion since I don't know we've have we have so many discussions about editors I'm just gonna I'm just going to skip okay at some point safari design said that I should split my screen so that we could see the code and the design at the same time I could probably do that but it kind of depends like I when we're when we're looking at like kind of a more narrow screen that's fine but if I want to get a wider view obviously I can't do that so that's why I have normally been flipping back and forth and a lot of times I like to use dev tools so I don't know maybe I could have another desktop view that split and just have that open like as a duplicate and go to that off to think about it because I do see some people in other videos that make that work with the split it's just always seemed to me like I don't have enough space when I'm splitting my screen like that so but I mean I could I could try to give it a shot sometime okay so if somebody I'm so somebody put a message in the live chat that are in other characters other than what I'm used to reading so I'm gonna do a Google Translate really quick to try to get it into something I can't understand and let's see okay so it looks like Mari Sava so let me know if that's wrong but this way I'm getting from Google Translate so Mari Sava says hello Jessi just sitting and watching your video react project to day five I love it so much that I wanted to say hello for a long time and say thank you well you're welcome thank you so much for saying that I really appreciate that that always makes me really happy when when someone appreciates what I'm doing and and get something out of it so thank you thank you again for saying that Mari also says it's 8 p.m. there so have a good evening so maybe more you didn't hear that my response to that maybe maybe later maybe a more you can watch the recording or something but let's see Tafari design says Jessie's code is so neat it makes my mind all fuzzy thinking about freshly Windex glass Thanks I don't I don't it doesn't look that neat to me like honestly this looks a lot more messy than my code normally is but but like I said normally I I have it automatically formatted for me so you can't really I can't really take credit for it before you design says is react hard a lot of companies require that skill nowadays jonbi says hey Jambi hey how's it going only way you'll find out is if you try it see if it's difficult for you or easy you might be surprised go check the react documentation page they have a tutorial for it you yeah definitely I try it out I think when I first tried react I thought it was hard just did I get my mind around the concept and and the terminology and things that was a little bit hard for me but I watched videos of people doing it and did some tutorials and then little by little I got used to it that's probably different you know for different people depending on your your experiences before trying to learn reacts for me it was a little bit of a challenge but now that I'm using reacts I think I actually think it's really easy to do you know do things and react and I mean I've we've done just on this dream alone you know we've used several different things we've done serverside rendered react we've pulled in data from api's we've done we've used create react react app and with react router so we've done a lot of cool stuff on a project I'm doing right now for for a course on the side I'm using redux I'm starting to learn react native and they all seem really cool I mean I'm not gonna lie Redux is probably the most challenging thing so far for me but still I'm you know I've only been exposed to it for you know weeks yeah maybe like a month it made probably over a month now but I really haven't been able to dedicate consistent time every day to it if I had maybe I'd understand it a bit more right now but even even with all that I think I have a good grasp of things at this point and I mean it hasn't really taken that long so I say give react a shot okay lost my place no Peter says Jessie check the the right search input when I clicked it it redirects the search page yeah right now it does that so it shouldn't do that I'm not sure what the problem is so I am gonna have to check that yeah cuz on the demo site it doesn't do that so I'll figure it out I'll get that working nobody is said to try footer copyright margin top 20 pixels okay I'll have to give that a shot later on safari design asks if I'm a freelance web developer no well I mean I do some freelance work on the side but my fulltime job as a web developer is at a university I John Hanson said break the lines out of their container it's easier and use flex and no need for media queries okay so I'll have to mess around with flex with these and see if I can get that working okay Sebastian says in Visual Studio code the bottom blue bar if you click spaces cool and then using spaces yeah too okay so I have two now so it's not did it automatically do anything I can't even tell him that oh cool it looks like maybe you do so that's definitely two spaces now cool yeah that looks like it did automatically change everything all right all right Sebastian thank you that like it looks so much better to me now awesome that's how a design said Jessie don't tell everyone all your business we respect your privacy but also said I also wish all the best for your wife as well thank you I appreciate that yeah I know I don't have to tell my business but I don't know sometimes I feel like if I talk about things it helps me but it also helps anybody else that may be going through something similar so you know it's alright I don't mind talking about that stuff I'm just worried that you all don't wouldn't want to hear that like you want to hear the code stuff so I'm worried that I go on too long about it so but otherwise you know I don't I don't mind talking about that stuff and you know especially to like about the depression stuff I really don't mind talking about that at all because I think I think people need to talk about that more and not be ashamed of it you know like you know you get if you break your leg you break your leg it's fine everybody knows you break your leg and they realize you know you're gonna walk slow for a while right you might have a wheelchair crutches right so if you have depression it's gonna impact your life and how how you can do things but if we never talk about it you know people aren't going to know people are going to realize that that that's a legitimate thing and it definitely impacts someone's ability to do things just like a broken leg would impact it I mean not not just like but in a similar way as a broken leg would impact physically how you can walk you know depression would impact mentally how you can interact with the world do your job do I mean so I don't know so I I think as long as we don't I like the idea of being open with it I don't like the idea that if you're open with it you know you could be discriminated against for jobs and things like that as long as that doesn't happen I'm all for people knowing just more about it in general and I think we could benefit so for me right now I'm not gonna lose my job if I have depression so I'm in a position where I think I can talk about it you know to other people and have it you know on YouTube so so I am so I'm going to talk about it not all the time occasionally you know and hopefully that couldn't help but I mean this thing is mainly about code so it's it's always gonna be at least like 90% about code if not more nobody said oh that's so sad to hear about your wife thank thank you I appreciate you saying that Sebastian says I'm so sorry about your wife hope she gets well soon Sampson says same I appreciate appreciate y'all Rohan says best wishes for your family I really appreciate I think thank you all I'll definitely let my my wife know that you are we're wishing her the best and everything oh cool so Mari Sava was the right the right translation of that so awesome marisol this is Jesse you made my day awesome I'm glad I'm glad that I could do that I hide a B Shaykh says is is it better than brackets for web development so it's Visual Studio code better than brackets I've never used brackets so I can't say for sure but so far I like Visual Studio code okay John B says on the subject of being worried about space with Visual Studio code you can toggle word wrap with the option key and and Z or on Windows the Alt key and Z let's actually let's do that right now so I don't forget so options cool I you know what until you said that I didn't even realize that I did not have word wrap on because I've had it on by default and Adam for so long that it didn't even occur to me and that's a lot nicer not thank you I'm learning a lot of cool stuff about Visual Studio code I'm glad I decided to use this for the stream okay all right well I'm going to wrap the stream up because the people are here from IT check things out so thank you so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow have a great day
