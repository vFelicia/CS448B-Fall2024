hi in this video we are going to be talking about the console what it is where you can find it and what you use it for now the console is very commonly used to display system administrative messages your browser has a console your computer has a console once you become more familiar with it you'll find it to be a really powerful and effective tool in JavaScript the console is used as a great tool for debugging and finding out where in your code there's a problem one of the most important words you're going to need to remember is console.log now console is the thing that shows the text. log means log it here write it here then there's some parentheses and you can write whatever you want uh now the process of doing this can be put anywhere in the lines of code just like in the last video we go down sequentially you can put some kind of statements that say you know if this doesn't work console laog this is broken online 43 or whatever you need to do to help yourself figure out what the problem is and where it's happening all right what you see here is the Chrome browser with the Chrome console the console can also be up on the side but we're going to keep it down below for now you are probably also seeing this console.log we are going to console log a string a string is inside quotes or single quotes like this uh let's console free code Camp Rocks now if we run this code right here now here it's false that's what it's returning to this but down here in the console you see free code Camp Rocks awesome right now we can also console a number like 1,24 and there it is and we can also console a Boolean which is a true or false statement do console log true and it's going to say true if we try and say a word like uh words and console log that it's nothing's going to happen that doesn't recognize words because it doesn't know if it's a string or what but once you put it inside of some of these guys then it knows what we're talking about you can also combine things so say I want to say console log uh Briana is and then true we'll see what happens there we get Brian is true you can see the color differentiation here if your screen's big enough uh if not it just says is and then true is in blue because that's a Boolean as opposed to the string uh you can use this in a bunch of different ways but this is what console really looks like
