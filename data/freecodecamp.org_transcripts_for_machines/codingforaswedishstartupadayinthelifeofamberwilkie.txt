hi i'm amber and i'm a programmer i work for a small startup called student vicaria and today is a day in my life i'm halfway to work uh let's keep going so i walk to work every day uh well unless it's raining because uh it takes about 40 minutes and it's free and this is my favorite part of my walk i have this canal and there's normally a whole bunch of ducks here but today there's no ducks maybe they're camera shy uh actually today i'm super late because i've been fiddling with this video so i'm gonna keep moving [Laughter] this is my colleague speaking swedish i just got to work and uh i'm a little sweaty from walking as always i'm going to go get some cheese and crackers for breakfast and coffee and then i'm going to check slack and do some code reviews my clock and that means it's time for our standup i'll take a photo or two to show you what that looks like we're gonna chat with our polish colleagues who work on the app and also our most senior developer who happens to be a contractor who works on everything okay so it's 1007. we just did stand up we were missing almost everyone so it was a very short standup i've been at work for about an hour currently what i'm doing is working on a bug affecting the salaries of our students we're running several a b tests and if it turns out that this bug has been there all the time then we've just sort of wasted a bunch of money giving people extra money and if it's only been two weeks which is when a major refactor happened to this code which fingers crossed it's only been two weeks and then we can just throw out that data this is very typical i go on slack in the morning and one of our support staff has reported a bug or some problem that is actually critical to fix now um like this one is specifically potentially costing us money right now um so i'm gonna work on this until it's fixed and then i'll do code reviews test suite takes like 12 minutes to run so now it's 11 12. i'm on coffee number two and i squashed that bug so that's good uh thankfully it was only two weeks worth of data that has been unusable for us so the other couple of months that it's been running it's good to go i did code reviews i approved some code and i rejected some code because it didn't work and now i'm going to get back to the thing that i knew i was coming when i came in this morning and that is a big refactor currently in our system users can have one school and we want them to be able to work with multiple schools so that's what i'm gonna get back to working on now okay so midday checkin um it's about 12 15 and i need to go get some lunch because we have an all hands meeting at one every monday and it's monday um i typically like to eat lunch around that time so if i don't go early and get lunch then i have to wait sometimes till two o'clock and that's super late don't want to do it today has been a pretty good day so far it's actually been pretty standard i've dealt with a few bugs that were sitting in slack when i came in and i have worked on some features i'm almost ready with this big refactor of users can have multiple schools that's taken me a couple days actually i was working on that last week all friday but it's almost ready to go i did get some feedback on the bug i fixed this morning and my code was also rejected so i need to work on that some more too but i'm not worried about it because the business logic that is handled by that particular piece of code um basically like no more bookings are going to be made this morning that are going to fall into that box so i'm not worried about doing that right away because i'm sure i can do it this afternoon and then it will all work out before tomorrow morning's new set so i'm going to head over to the grocery store they have a cafeteria type situation i'll take a few pics for you guys it's three o'clock in the afternoon and we've been working all day and i thought i'd introduce you to the team that's lisa top this one's henrik he's the boss wait hey guys i'm here being managerial you work with a lot of r i do i do some data science when i'm not doing other stuff and you manage things well you guys are quite easy to manage so and this one's lisa lucia she's italian hi yes what an international office right so we resolved the bugs from this morning they've been they've gone through code review and they'll soon be in production and now it's time to look at the pivotal tracker to see what stories i should work on next okay uh 3 40 we got about hour and a half left in the day maybe a little bit more and i'm going to switch gears i've been learning a bit of r we have a hackathon coming up this weekend lucia and lisa and i are going to go and hack for sweden and uh so i need to get my art shops up fortunately um we have some r projects in our repertoire as a company they analyze our data and i am trying to learn r so i can help work on those so i'm going to run some tutorials and i'm going to take a stab at a new application we need for analyzing the company's data here oh poppy so it's five and ordinarily i would stay at work a little bit later but today i have a dance class so i'm going to leave right after i record this video today was a pretty good day i squashed two bugs that we're giving our support staff some trouble and i finished a major refactor that is going to kind of open up some paths for us to do some more development in the future i collaborated with my counterpart our contractor in poland he helps a lot with the work that we do and we could not do it without him on our team it's as i mentioned it's it's me and lucy and lisa and henrik um and that's not quite enough programming for the work that we have to do so we have these other people the app team were around uh even though they weren't on standup um other quick facts about working in sweden my lovely ux designer uh and also johan who's our honorary tech member uh they're gonna have babies soon and together no not together uh separate babies two different babies and uh they'll get 18 months of combined parental leave that the both partners must take very important and um everybody makes about the same amount of money like of course there's fluctuations but like if you don't if you make too little the government will just give you more and if you make too much the government will like tax you a lot so everybody's kind of smushed into this middle bit working for a product company is really great because i'm really close to the um the users of my products the port staff so we work really really fast we like i got bugs in this morning and i fix them by the afternoon and part of the reason that we can do that is because our we're like kind of free to make mistakes in a way because the support staff will come and say hey you broke this and we can fix it within a few hours um yeah gosh i could talk so much but you've seen me all day so i will just say goodbye from sweden hayward as it were and thanks for watching
