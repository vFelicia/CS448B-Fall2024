hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do some work with our navigation so this will be more proper frontend work i know we've been doing some backend work lately but today we're going to get back to the front end and i think i finally sorted out all the issues that i've been having uh with stream quality so i should be running now assuming that your internet connection is fast enough it should run at 1080p 60 frames frames per second the problem uh didn't have anything to do with my settings in obs uh it was with my computer so uh what i found was depending on what i had running i would drop a lot of frames uh so i've turned off all the programs that i don't need and i've closed out most of the tabs that i could and i tested out i'd i'd close everything and it would work i'd open more stuff and it didn't work so so far this works i tested earlier for a little while and it worked the whole time i tested it just this past half hour and only for a few seconds did it drop frames so i think we're good and i don't know really what changed the only thing i did differently on my computer other than close out a lot of things which we already tried before was uh i downloaded the latest update uh for the mac os so there was when i came in this morning there's an update available so i just went ahead and did that straight off and that that seemed to do something because my fan wasn't running you know basically it's been running really hard the whole time i've been using it for the last week so that's all all sorted out hopefully and so we'll get started i don't have anything going on so depending on how the stream goes you might be able to do a longer stream today uh we'll just see uh so let me check the live chat here for a second um not sure i'll see this one live all right so if you you are gonna be able to watch live that's cool thanks for uh for stopping in and saying hi and um as you all know you can always check out the recording later um savage banana says howdy complete noob here done a few bits on free code camp about to do a boot camp looking forward to watching you this evening even though i probably won't understand now i'll be soaking it in all right awesome thanks for watching and feel free to ask as many questions as you want don't worry if you think it's a noob question or something i'm i'm happy to explain something and go over anything that you need all right john said the stream's going well peter says it's looking clean too awesome the ninja says this channel is dope thank you i appreciate that uh abu says will you start coding now i will i will start coding and um as always i know there's some of you that don't like the talking part and you just like the coding part so if that's the case i mean i really love when you can watch live that's awesome but if if it does bother you all the talking uh then feel free to watch the recording and you can just skip ahead and um basically anytime you see just my face and no code then you're safe to skip that and that's totally fine i understand there's not really enough time in the day to listen to me go on and on anyway all right so let's get started and let's change my screen so i'll explain what we're going to do briefly and then we'll we'll get to it so we already talked about what we want to do with this navigation in previous streams in case you've forgotten or you didn't catch that stream here's what's going to happen when we click on one of these links it's going to open up this side drawer and we're gonna have the same links as top level navigation here so it'll say it won't say inbox it'll say about academics admissions faith and life and they'll all be expandable so open up this side navigation with the correct item expanded and all the options shown for instance if i clicked about the about option would be expanded everything else would be not expanded uh so that's the goal what i want to do now the reason i decided to switch and do this today instead of working on some of the stuff we have been working on is well twofold one the stuff that we've been working on lately is going to get real repetitive we've worked out a lot of the you know kind of tough problems that we've had mostly to do with routing and bringing data over now it's just a matter of taking the time to actually do that i don't want to make boring streams of me just constantly doing the same thing over and over again and the second reason is i'm starting to show people this site so i showed my boss's site last week and one of the things that we went over is the menu and i went to click these and i i remembered oh we never made that work and he had asked it was a bit uh we had i discussed it before my boss but it was a long time ago so i had to go over again when we click this then it's going to do that so i think it would be a lot easier when i start to show it to more people to just have it working even if the links don't even go anywhere yet which they won't because we haven't built out you know most of the site yet but i want the functionality to work i think it'll be a lot easier to show people than to explain it so that's what we're going to do and let's see yeah let's check out the component it's been a while since we've even worked on these so i don't remember what we set up in the components and i'm going to be looking at them with fresh eyes basically so we have our app bar component which is where we'll have all right the wrap bar and our drawer are going to be the two components we're going to be working in today the most i already have this running let me get ngrok started for you all and i'm going to paste the link here in the live chat and you all can click on that link go to it and um let's see all right it looks like it is working great so anyway if you're not familiar with ngrok just click the link you'll be able to see this site as we're working on it and test out the changes you can inspect it in dev tools so it'll be a lot more interactive if you're able to to do that all right so let's check out if we have anything set up already so here's all our font icons now this component could definitely use some refactoring to clean it up a bit that's going to happen at some point but my opinion is if you have a deadline you have to meet you get everything working first you can always go back and refactor later but if you spend all your time refactoring and you don't get the project done nobody's gonna care the user's not gonna care when you try to explain to him about refactoring ah the stream's lagging again isn't it no why is it lagging maybe ngrug all right you know what let me shut down ngrok for a second and see if that made a difference because that was really the only different thing that we did right i've changed nothing else wow the video is lagging again have i try to think did i do anything else i don't think i did anything no why why why does it happen now what else is running on my machine it's nothing i guess i could turn off spotify let's turn spotify off um i'm not gonna have my music alright so spotify's off i guess that wasn't it i'm going to turn chrome canary off oh was that what i was using i didn't realize that was a canary window um and that's it i can't i can't turn anything else off um all right i guess i could draw all right am i back let me know if you can hear me obs is saying that everything's fine all right cool all right looks like this will work now and i'm gonna turn my spotify back on because that was not the problem all right cool i really thought i had that figured out this time oh well try again tomorrow unless i really like figure out something significant that fixes this i'm just gonna stream at 720p again tomorrow and not not risk it savage banana says try streaming at 30 frames per second um yeah maybe i'll maybe i can try 1080p but at 30 frames per second see if that'll work i actually didn't even see a setting though for the frames per second which was weird it's possible i'm just looking in the wrong place oh well um all right so let's go let me start a timer so i can know when to come back and answer some questions see i'm gonna go i think this is harsh it right hard [ __ ] this is yours right the essays or pompom.now let's start this one i was using using three different pomodoro timers and uh two of them from that you all made and one of them that i had been using using for years i don't actually i don't know about years how long i've been to a pomodoro definitely more than a year potentially not longer than two though all right let's see all right let me make this a bit bigger so you all can see especially now that we've dropped the uh the video quality a little bit so hopefully that's large enough for you let me know if it's not so let's find our our menu see if we have any click handlers already on here that we can work with otherwise we'll make some let's see svg this is a search all right great so here's where we have this so it looks like all right it looks like we're using uh the typography component that comes with material ui to create an a tag and all right so right now just has an href okay i suppose we don't even really need it to be a link but for now let's let's see where the oops let me bring this back up i forgot we shut it down localhost 3 000. and let me try to bring ngrog back up because i don't think that was actually the problem all right so the links now um in the live chat all right i was just inspecting the this uh this is the li and this is just the a uh the a tag so i was wondering what would be better to put the link on or to you know have the click area hmm all right let me know what you all think uh i guess it would be either way it really doesn't matter i suppose except we may have a slightly larger area would we no we wouldn't i think it would be the same alright so it doesn't matter so let's try to do a an on click should we do an on click or nontouch anything untouched i was looking at a project that i did earlier and we were using on touch tap instead of on click but i can't remember why so i'm just going to go with on click and what we can always change it back if we want video section oh okay uh savage banana found the settings for the frames per second and it's on the um it's in the video section you know that that makes sense now i remember a while ago i had to go to the video section to change some stuff and i i remember because i thought it was it was weird that it was in there instead of the streaming all right harshit says that was mature ui uh 0.26 it's fixed with uh with one okay so we had to use it in a previous version but you don't have to use it now awesome uh thanks for that hardship all right so let's say um open side drawer this dot open side drawer all right so we haven't made it yet but we need to make it and we need to have we're going to pass it something huh yeah we have to pass it something all right so this dot open side drawer and passion hmm um all right so i'm just going to use the name which in this case is faith in life i'm gonna pass that in as a string we'll have to figure out maybe a better way to do this so we don't have to manually type it out but just to get it working first this should work for us so obviously i'd rather have a lot of this stuff in data files and then bring it in instead of having it all hardcoded i would have thought we already had some things built out for this uh all right i was thinking for some reason we had to have some type of click handler to open up the side drawer but we're pulling it in pulling that in from somewhere else i guess um okay i um think if we're going to need to what's this for sorry i'm trying to think out how this works uh we need so we need to be able to share what's going on with two components the app bar and the drawer so i'm assuming they're both tied together in the layout for drawer so i'm just wondering if this should all live in the layout which is where we're getting toggle drawer from so that's as expected i suppose yeah so maybe this is where the um where that should live yeah that makes sense um actually we already have an expansion for the drawer change handle click so the handle click we have in the drawer already expands the items so this is really what we want to use anyway let's pull this up into layout and then from app bar we should be able to just call this function and at the same time uh so we'll call this function and we'll call um the drawer toggle so we'll basically use what we already have i think that'll be the best way to do it all right john has some so faith in life link text should have white space no wrap all right cool thank you um i'll add that in i want to do this first why it's in my mind so i don't lose what i just what i just thought of all right so let's grab our handle click state open items the state open items all right so let me see how we need to pull this out i'm going to try to go i don't know if i could put these two side by side maybe if i close this it would work let me try it out oops this one's layout okay okay uh john has a question that has to do with what we're about to attempt says is it the best practice for a stateful uh furthest up container to control any actions below it pass with props if you need to share if you need to share the state then yes it should be in the parent uh but you you shouldn't get crazy with it so you shouldn't be passing things up like five components like five parent components and that's where things like redux come in and help simplify things so that you don't have to pass everything up from child to parent several levels up because then it can be really confusing and difficult especially if you're going to change something it trying to remember and and go in in every component and make sure you're still passing things down properly is can be difficult uh so i guess so we're not really using redux we're using what is it har should help me out here because harsh is the one was telling me about it so apollo now handles state in a similar way to redux so i guess we could do some of that i haven't worked with it exactly yet but i know that there was some significant update to where you can handle stuff but for now we only need to go up one component just to the parent so i'm totally fine with that if there's some reason why you all think that we should try to use something else to manage state instead of you know just passing it with with props then i'm definitely open to suggestions but i think this should work out in this case all right so here's our layout component this is our parent so what we want to do is add our handle click yeah our handle click we're going to add this over here i'm going to briefly keep the handle click here so that way i can see the original uh and if we edit this i can just go back quickly but then eventually we'll just remove this so what we want to do is pass down uh the handle click so just like we're we're handling we're passing down this toggle drawer so we have this toggle drawer and we're also passing down the state of this so we have this drawer uh true or false whether it's open or close we're gonna do the same thing we need to i'm gonna say handle click i guess we call it let's make this a little bit more descriptive because that's we're gonna have multiple click events going on uh so let's call it expand menu yeah that works expand menu and for expand menu this set state so let's make open open items that's odd how does this sorry i want to see how this behaves now we only have one item all right what i'm worried about here is our open items is just a true or false so i'm wondering if that works with multiple items so let's let's try that check that out quickly list item this class all right let's throw this in here just to see uh okay it's as i thought uh right now this is opening and closing everything which is not what we want we need to change that all right that's fine it's going to be a little bit more complex all right here's so we can do hmm all right what i'm thinking is so number one i want to separate this out into its own component this is way too much to have all of this in this component so the entire for sure we'll grab this whole list item and then the collapse component that comes with it and then we may even want to separate out this collapse as well yeah all right let's do that this is already a bit of a mess all right so let's open up a new tab here list item down to oops labs all right now here's what i we're gonna have to wrap this in a div hopefully it doesn't mess up how this works or how it looks yeah i don't i don't see how we could do that differently um so let's let's make we're gonna call this and render see how we do it yeah return all right great now we can copy and paste this down draw item and let's give it we need react and with styles and link for sure we need link wait are we using link i thought we were but now that i see it we're not all right we're not we need lists yeah we do need list and list item collapse expand less explain more and we need the divider i don't think so at least not yet all right now let's save this our components i'm going to call this drawer item dot js yay all right what did i mess up something oh that's right i need to put this in a div oh i think this is just indentation which all right fix in that problem six all in problems yeah let's see that all right great um classes is not defined so we need to make sure we bring that over classes oops all right the timer went off so let me stop here i'm gonna take five minutes i'm gonna answer any questions uh that you all have and then we'll come back and finish this up as much as we can also when i come back from the fiveminute break maybe i'll take time to explain a little bit of what just happened if you're not familiar with react then this was probably confusing there we go there's a timer all right i'm gonna scroll up to the top and and try to get through as many questions and comments as i can if i don't get your question or comment during this five minute break i will uh most likely get to it in the next one at the end of the stream i'll get to all the comments and questions so just be patient if you can't stick around you can always check out the recording of this uh later on it'll be available on this channel the free code camp youtube channel um samir asks uh hi jesse i'm new to react where can i start um you can always check out the official react documentation like on the react website uh it's not bad i remember when i was first just new and started reading it it was over my head but they do have some beginner tutorials on there so depending on how good you already are with javascript you may do better with that than i did free code camp has a beta curriculum that you can preview and work on they have some react lessons on there i have not gone through them myself but i see other people on twitter have you know talked about going through them so they seem to be good uh code academy has an inbrowser react course and i'm trying to think what else i think those are the main resources if you want to spend money on a course i did go through the udacity react nanodegree if you want to know more about that check out my channel i did do a short video of what my review of that nanodegree program so i'm not going to go over it again since i already have that available but you you can check that out the link to my channel is in the description for this video uh so that's where i would start out now uh if there are also some videos on this channel that go over you know react basics so you could check those out as well and you're more than welcome to watch these streams and i'll do my best to explain everything be sure to ask a lot of questions uh because i'll answer as much as i i possibly can let's see viconius says why programmers haven't got girls i i i have a wife so i'm a programmer and i have a wife so i'm not sure i'm not sure why other programmers might not have them i don't really know i mean i don't know that there's anything inherent to programmers that would make them not have growth i think it's just like a joke um i guess if you spend all your time inside programming then you might be a lot more pale than people like maybe i don't know i'm just messing around now i don't really know um the ninja says in reply says who jesse has a house full of hot shakes that's not i would say singular one hot chick my wife is very hot so i don't have a household i just have one and then uh i do have daughters but uh nobody say that they're they're hot don't talk about my daughters like that my daughters are six and one and a half so uh there's still tiny little people right now um let's see all right there's a lot of comments about the stream whenever it was lagging king mobile says hi to all hey how's it going thanks for watching uh superman says can you give me your opinion on vue.js i i have not used view i haven't even really seen tutorials about vue but i've seen a lot of people who i developers who i do respect that respect their opinion i think they're good developers and they really like vue so my opinion on it now is just i've heard good things about it it seems like it's a good framework so if you want to give it a shot i say go for it i'd like to try it out at some point but i don't have any plans to do it right now i i think that i'm still not where i want to be with my skills and react so the limited time that i have to be able to you know put into kind of training and studying more i'm going to put into react right now and you know maybe one day i'll go with you but i don't have anything against you i haven't to be honest with you i haven't heard anything negative about view it's all been good stuff so if anybody has used view uh would like to put your opinion in uh please put in the live chat now if you're watching the recording later on uh go ahead and put it in the comments and i think that would be helpful for anybody that's you know wondering about you if somebody who's actually used it would weigh in preferably somebody that's use you and react to give uh maybe a comparison all right so my five minute timer is up i'm going to jot down quickly where i left off in the live chat help me get back to it after our our next session all right oh hey i just noticed like 10 minutes ago quincy stopped in i'm not sure if he's still here so but if you are hey quincy thanks for the retweet i appreciate that yo if you don't know who quincy is he's the the founder and head of free code camp so i wouldn't be doing this stream here if it weren't for quincy and uh so i always appreciate when quincy stops in it's always exciting and go ahead and follow quincy on on twitter if you want to find out everything that's going on with free code cam uh he's always always tweeting about all the different things they're doing so that's so much going on here free code camp now um you know we've had the forum for a long time we have the youtube we have two youtube channels now one for talks and one you know this channel that we're on and um have a medium publication with blogs of a podcast now the new beta curriculum is being worked on and is going to come out soon i'm probably missing some other things that we're doing but there's just so much with free code cam uh so if you if you haven't checked out the rest of what is there then you know please please check it out there's so much more and better stuff than than just what i'm doing here on the stream all right so one problem that we had before we stopped is that when we put more than one collapsible item in here right now the way we have it set up they both open and close the same time so we need to fix that but first we're going to clean some stuff up so we've extracted out all the the code we need to make one of these these elements click and everything below it included and we've extracted that out into its own component and we're not we don't have everything uh ready yet we see we still have some little red squiggly lines which means we have errors mainly these aren't defined so we need to define let's see a stylus theme i'm wondering if any of these had to do with your image form control nested i think nested yeah we need to pull the nested clasp but i don't think we'll need any of the other ones so let's bring this in now and then we'll remove what we don't need let's double check yeah that was the only place we were using classes and we need to bring in also dance classes we're open oops a new version of java is available i do not want java run me later why do i still have a java on my computer anyway anyway it popped up on my other screen um i think the open referred to the drawer yeah it did so we don't need open we don't need toggle drawer let's just bring in classes wonderful and style so all right so now we have everything that we need and we may be able to get rid of this let's get rid of this and see that's this in that list item all right great we can get rid of this this was just that that second one we brought in okay so that shortened up our component a little bit nice we may even pull this out at some point i'm okay with it there for now this is that search uh so this is our logo at the top and this is that search input so that's what we're talking about so you see everything below it now has been taken out so first let's just try to put this back in and see if it if it works oh no we didn't have we need this toggle drawer all right we will have to pass toggle drawer down so let's put that back in here toggle drawer and what we call the other one right now it's handle click but we don't want it to be called handle click right we want it to be open item all right yeah we're going to call it open item all right so we have our handle click is now going to be actually our handle click is going to get passed down as a prop from our layout right i'm you know i'm going to check the live chat so i i if you have any questions put them in the live chat i'm going to do a better job of checking back in there to make sure that i'm not losing you feel free to ask questions i'm just gonna really quickly scan through the last few comments turn okay rook says uh that handle click function please change that set state call to the function version uh okay so rooker we're talking about this handle click just to be sure if it's this one uh just let me know that i have the right one this this may be the only one that we've seen but we're actually going to take this out completely from here and we're going to move it up to layout let me grab that we may have done it did we do it already i think we did x expand menu is that what we did we did i went over here and i called it expand menu all right so rook is saying there's a recommended way to update the state based on previous state and so let's let's do that let's set states let's do that here just to show um if you can't see the live chat now i'll kind of type it out for you so this is our previous state and so we can we're going to pass in our previous state and we can update our object so then we would put what open let's see if we've called previously this parameter you can say so our open items is going to be this would be the same name so we do it like this open items equals would need to be something like this and rook's explaining this avoids issues with set state being asynchronous and batching set state calls by default okay great open item preview save on all right awesome so this was uh the correct yeah this is the correct way thanks rook uh i appreciate i appreciate you pointing that out that's cool yeah i um i knew that we could get the previous state i'd never used it before i didn't realize that there was a better performance with this so i'm glad i'll try to keep this in mind and use it it'll probably take me a while before i'm used to this way but i will try to use it uh would it would this way be the best way just by default oh no what did i do would this be the best way by default or should i stick with kind of the normal way unless i i was already using it up here i i probably didn't write this uh one of you probably wrote this and i just merged the pull request but i didn't realize i was already using it uh also i don't need these parens parentheses here same thing just avoids issues when you change database on previous date okay cool um so i will do my best to learn this way and keep using it all right so let me say this expand menu you know what i want to say expand item i think i like that better because really it's a menu item it happens to have a sub menu inside it but i think i like item better since we're calling this a drawer item all right x expand expand item um let's see oh okay rook says you also get access to props in that function as a second argument uh it's not used in a handler right now all right cool that's useful all right so right now the expanding uh and collapsing is was handled in our drawer by state we had open items so what we're going to do now is all right let's do it like this state equals open items why is that defaulted to true you think you'd want it to be defaulted to false right i wanted false maybe just for an example we had it defaulted to true all right so i'm going to put that in here but then i'm going to do a um yeah that's how we'll do it wait a second i just confused myself okay let me explain what i was what i'm thinking here why just confuse myself so our problem was we had both opening at the same time both items would open and close at the same time so my solution i was thinking is let's separate it out into another component let's handle state and that component and then each component each expandable menu would handle its own state and that would work but the problem is that we also need to be able to change the state of that item from another component it's going to be our our app bar component so that that was the issue so it's easy to do it in here if all the states internal the hard part is getting the click to work all right we'll take it one step at a time let's break it down first let's just get this to work we're going to pretend right now like we don't have to do the other step and that'll just simplify things we'll get it to work then we can go to step 2 and figure out how to change the state from outside this component all right so what we'll do then is drawer all right so for now we know we're not going to keep it in here but for now let's just put this in here just to make sure that uh we haven't messed anything up when we move this component over so we should save that that should work and then here we're going to add in let's see bringing in components oops yeah and drawer we are right sorry i'm thinking out loud a bit i've been working so much with the importing data and things i haven't actually worked with react components like this for for a while probably like definitely before before christmas all right so we're going to import drawer item and it's in the same folder so we just need to do dot slash drawer item and then down here we can add a few drawer items to the bottom of our list draw item oops all right so we'll add three of them in there so you save that save that and let's see oops i guess those colors are right i think my colors are a little off from what i used to use in my other editor so sometimes i think i have errors and i really don't all right let's see oops i didn't want to save this yet all right i gotta accidentally save that no all right cool all right so it still opens no all right so our clicks don't work all right i'm glad we um we tried this out first because we did something and the clicks don't even work all right so let's take a look at our drawer item so we do have a state the state's open items oops pretty state open items that's probably our problem no okay so i thought that was the problem because we were trying to change something in state this thing previously open items all right that looks fine let's try out expand item oh expand yeah expand item oh that's right we don't this isn't in props right now and then where's our on click yeah our on click should say this expand item all right so there we go now it works and since each component is handling its own state then they open independently awesome okay so that works uh the reason it didn't work at first was because one i wasn't even changing the right state i was i just had the word open here i didn't have open items so that was a problem and then also our on click was trying to call a function called handleclick which didn't even exist because we changed the name to expand item so those are the the two issues alright so now that that works let's take the next step and see if we can when we click one of these have this open and then have a change so i'd say the first step is let's just make it so that when we click one of these the drawer opens we'll try to do that we'll test that if that works then we'll move on and try to do this and we'll see how much time we have i want to commit this right now since we've kind of got to a point where things are stable and they work and it is an improvement over what we had we're not all the way there yet but i think this is a good point to commit um i'm going to do a git add so what i just did was i added any new files um and basically added any files uh to be ready to be committed and then i'm going to do git commit m which means just i'm going to put my commit message in that's what the m does and i'm going to say create create your item component that's pretty much what we did all right now it's going to run through all our tests so if you want to contribute to the project we got hit with these this is i'm glad this kind of hap this happened like this so if you want to contribute to the project when you go to commit which i encourage anyone who wants to contribute please do especially if you haven't contributed to a project before in github the projects we do on the stream i think are a great chance for you to just get started so i'm not going to get upset if you do a pull request and it's it doesn't work i'll try to help you through it if you have any questions let me know i've had a handful of people submit their first pull request on the things that we work on in the stream and i'm always really happy when that happens so if you want to submit a pr let me know if you need help i'm here to help you but if you do on pretty much all our projects we have some automated testing and linting and formatting so a lot of what you see here is is that going on but i messed up so it's not going to let me commit until i fix this so let's fix it and run it again and it's going to check everything and make sure i did it right this is kind of a good like safety net so that code that obviously doesn't work doesn't get into the project it makes it a little bit easier for me to review the pull requests because there's certain things i know are already going to be there and i don't have to check on so let's see where we're at so it tells us now it's eslint has found some errors so these are basically um like errors that break the rules of es land so obviously these errors haven't caused our application to crash but we don't want this kind of stuff in our code we want it cleaned up so we have some some things that we've defined but never used so we don't want to do that so let's find out where it's at they're all in this drawer.js component so we only have to look in one place which is good and it tells us exactly exactly where they all are so let's check it out line by line i'm going to shrink this a little bit so we can see this is our drawer.js component let's go up here and we have lines 6 seven eight and nine so on line six and it's actually highlighting it here in red so if i would have been more careful and checked before i tried to commit we would have seen it but let's get rid of that list item since we're not using it anymore and these are all things that we took out and moved over to this component that's why we don't need them anymore and now i'm just going to get rid of all these lines and save okay i can verify that everything's still working by going back to my project all right great it still works and now i don't have to type everything in again i'm just going to hit the up arrow key on my keyboard and it brings up that last message that git commit message this will save you a lot of time i was talking to somebody yesterday who didn't know about that on the command line and it's always great when you first learn about that and also the autocomplete like if you hit tab it auto completes when you first learn about that it like changes your world it was so cool to see somebody like learn that for the first time so i'm gonna hit enter again it's going to run through our tests let's make it a bit bigger there we go so i made it through prettier which auto formats i made it through eslint which that's what i got caught at the last time now it's actually running tests so it's opening up a browser it's loading the page and checking to make sure certain elements are actually on the page so you can't see it now the browser opened up on my other screen but it actually i just saw all these tabs open in the browser and different pages in the site load you don't have to have it open up uh there's some options you can run it so you don't see it but you can see it checked our faculty page we don't have tests for all our pages yet that's one of the areas where maybe i should make some issues in the github repo anybody that really wants to write the test feel free but we did test we tested three pages our faculty and it says uh this page can be seen at this ura faculty sum id so whatever id we want to test and it displays the correct data the index can be seen at the correct url which is the root and then page two can be seen at slash page right so we passed all our tests now we're ready to commit or ready to push this so we're going to get push origin and we could type in master here since we want to push it to the master branch but we don't have to we can just use the shorthand hit enter it'll automatically push to master i do need to put in my id since i restarted my computer earlier so let me on my other screen here i'm going to open up lastpass if you're not using a password manager like lastpass i do recommend it that way you can use super long ridiculous passwords and you don't have to remember them you have to remember one your super long ridiculous lastpass password but then all your other ones are covered hmm for some reason lastpass is not opening what did i do all right let me try to open in a different window no all right let me go to this last okay rook says you don't even have to use get push origin you can just use get push and that will work that's really cool i didn't know that um i'm gonna have to log into the desktop version of lastpass since my extension isn't working my chrome extension when i was shutting down clone chrome windows before uh from the task manager in chrome maybe i accidentally did something that messed up lastpass i don't know um actually maybe i just go to the chrome extensions page after i just gave this big uh deal on everybody used lastpass and now it doesn't work hmm i can open up the options for lastpass i just can't open last oh well uh harshit says are you in lastpass premium i am in lastpass premium i could just open it on my phone and type in the password i guess let me do that i was just trying to get out of typing in that big password but hello um all right let me type this in now all right that should work what no all right well let's try to just type get push let me try to type it again maybe i did it wrong yeah it worked this time awesome sorry for the uh the delay okay so that's that's there and that's push to get up so you all can see all the code that we just did you can check it out yourself you can clone the project contribute use it for whatever you want everything's totally open source we use the mit license you can do whatever you want uh i will say like the obviously the logo doesn't fall under that right that's the university's logo um and then like university images but the code itself is mit all right let me let me set my five minute timer i'm gonna go through some questions and then figure out whether or not we want to continue with this and try to get some more to work or maybe we want to save that for tomorrow's stream so if you have an opinion about that let me know i know it can be a long time to watch a stream we've been going for almost an hour and a half now so let me know if you'd rather have me split it up and do some today and some tomorrow or just do it all today uh let's see dinesh asks are you a react developer i guess so um i mean officially i'm a front end developer and i do a lot of react stuff so i think it would be accurate to say i'm a react developer if anyone disagrees with that let me know i'm not really sure what qualifies i'm going to be a react developer but i develop things with react all right john hanson says so i should mostly pass up with props in the functional uh dumb components uh if a component view container needs state to make it standalone component then let them hold their own functions um let me read that again that's props yeah so your your stateless functional components definitely just do props right they're not going to have state yeah so if you need a if you need something to have its own state you can put the functions in there like we did with these list items all right now obviously either later today or tomorrow we're gonna have to deal with the other things that we wanted to do and it may need to change but for now that was the simplest way to get the behavior that we wanted that each component handles its own state john hanson says jesse is a react king i don't know about that uh i'd be happy if i was like i don't know a react duke what are all the titles of royalty right maybe i'm down a little lower um dinesh says as i can see on both the screens you might be working on html and some js framework is that correct which framework is of javascript is it uh it is react so we are using react all right all right let me uh so quincy was in the chat a little while ago and uh quincy did say we're just getting started exciting things in the pipes for 2018. so that's cool i'm excited to see what what happens so i'm not in the loop with all the secret free code camp new stuff coming out so i'm just as excited as any of you might be um let's see let's see let me know if i mispronounced that but anyway they say hey i was making a twitter clone with react.js and material you lie but i couldn't get the twitter's navigation icons like home icon etc how do i get those icons hmm with an ad like icon is like for twitter no i accidentally closed out my my youtube window so i always wondered if my stream would still work if i closed out of youtube and it looks like it did still work let me know did the stream stop at all like a few seconds ago see all right i'm trying to look at the the bottom of the live chat and see if it stops all right cool that was really weird uh so i accidentally closed the tab and now it says that it looks like my stream has restarted from my admin screen because it's saying i've only been streaming for one minute but based on what you are telling me i guess it didn't stop at all i'm just worried because i don't want there to be two videos of this this stream later on uh so as long as that doesn't happen i think it's it's okay uh so anyway the question was about the icons for twitter so the reason i accidentally closed my windows because i was going to open a new tab and look at the twitter icons so i could better answer the question and i accidentally closed out youtube um i don't know where you would get the icons for twitter they may not be available for public use so i would just be careful about that uh you could certainly get some icons that would do that like you have a there's a home icon right you could probably find a little icon of a house somewhere it might not be exactly what's on twitter but i would just be careful to find out if you're allowed to use the twitter icons or not and i mean you may be able i don't know if you'd be able to check in the code if they would have a comment somewhere in there or even i don't know if these are svgs or what i just just opened devtools to see oh it looks like a font icon all right so twitter's using i guess their own font icon set for that so maybe do a search for twitter font icons all right um my time's up i'm just i'm going to go down through how about we'll do this i'm going to go down through i'm going to answer all the questions and everything once we get to the end i'm gonna see how i feel how tired i am streaming takes a lot out of you um it really realistically i'm just sitting here talking and typing but like mentally it's draining to try to focus on the code and the live chat and talk so i might not be up for doing more code after this but there's a lot in the live chat so i want to make sure i get to all your questions we can always finish what we're doing here tomorrow let me check all right stephen says uh jesse just a quick question having a hard time learning javascript any ideas on what i should do i get the concepts just not how to use it um maybe if you need a little help about how to use it maybe check out some like practical projects that use it maybe where they walk you through some of it so maybe like a video where it walks through making a or an actual project would be good and then maybe you could go along with the video like type things out along with the video or you know then go from watching the video to trying to do it on your own in your own way something like that might help you make the connection between you know being able to do like some of the algorithm challenges to actually being able to build things on your own so i know there are some videos on this channel i know beau has some videos and some other people have videos on actually making projects step by step uh that use javascript so maybe try one out some of them might be too advanced so just you know try a few of them out and see what you can do with it i that's probably the best way uh to do things right i think that's like natural learning for people even when we're little we learn by watching other people doing things and then we try it out ourselves so i think that's that's everybody's different but that might be a more natural way is to watch somebody else do it and then try it out as you get confident then you can do your thing and and be more creative with it so anyway i hope that advice works steven uh try it out if it doesn't you know come on back ask me again maybe something specific i could help you out with if if you need it let's see savage savage banana said pics of life or riot i said earlier let's talk about my wife earlier in the stream so um it wouldn't be that hard to figure out who my wife is um we uh follow each other and like each other's stuff on twitter and instagram and facebook so um if you really wanted to figure out who my wife is and find pictures you could find it i'm not going to share them with you but it's not like it's it's a secret let's see uh rick says catch you later have a meeting uh see you rick thanks for joining us good luck with your meeting oh okay we have a little bit more context on stephen's question earlier so um steven's working on the wikipedia viewer in the free code camp challenges and um just not getting it all to work together the right way um great and angel had an idea of um maybe ask someone in the free code camp community to do some peer programming it could help i i think that's a great idea that's even better than watching a video uh if you really need some some help you know oneonone help i'm sure there's a there's some videos out there people actually building the wikipedia viewer i always have mixed feelings about that when i go through the free code camp challenges or anything like that i always like to try to do it on my own before i look at how anyone else did it uh especially i don't mind as much looking at the ui but looking at the code i'd rather not do it i suppose if i'm stuck on the same problem for a really long time it makes more sense to just look at how someone else did it but but having somebody else there with you to just help when you need it i think would be preferable um someone asked about my code editor it is visual studio code oh i do want to share some good news i don't know if this person wants this announced so i'm not going to say a name but somebody who frequently is in the live chat for these streams just got a developer job uh and told me about it within the last few days so really excited about that uh congratulations you know who you are uh if you're cool with me saying your name just let me know uh but anyway really excited that has happened you know several times now where you know someone who's watched the live chat uh was able to get a job it's always really cool when that happens so any good news like that you know if if you if you're comfortable sharing i'd love to hear about it as i get really excited about about stuff like that i think it's cool when like we all develop in our coding and you know our careers develop so anyway again congratulations just thought i'd share that with you all you know a little little inspiration if you are looking for a job now people are getting jobs i'm not saying that it has anything to do with my stream it'd be cool if it did but probably not but people are getting hired it happens keep at it and if you're looking for a job it'll happen just keep keep trying is uh stephen says do so how much javascript do i need to know before i should move to react my ultimate goal is to jump into react uh let's see and in response john says i went from jquery to javascript in about three months i'm doing fairly well with react after four months time yeah i would say i've heard people say that you should get really good with javascript before you go to react and i respectfully disagree with that opinion i think once you know enough javascript to understand the basics of react you're okay to go and do react you will get better with javascript as you do react you'll use different parts of javascript that you never use before when you do react the only thing i would warn against is don't just do react and forget about the rest of javascript actively try to learn more javascript because one day no one will use react probably not going to be anytime soon but at some point your career there'll probably be some other thing and it'll be a lot easier for you to go from react to the other thing assuming the other thing's javascript based which probably will be but it'll be a lot easier for you to go from react to the other thing if you have a good foundation in javascript so just to sum up my advice is go for react as soon as you can start understanding it but keep up your learning of vanilla javascript along the way all right let's see john hanson says awesome jesse a good example of troubleshooting and react thinking ah thanks i appreciate it i felt like i felt like i was in trouble there for a little bit and i kind of looked over and saw how many people are watching it's like ah all these people are gonna think i don't know what i'm doing but that's kind of the draw of the stream right uh to see me struggle through but i was rusty i felt really rusty doing react stuff i was just forgetting like simple things so that long like winter break just uh i i guess i forgot a lot more than i thought i did but that through it we did it helped once i try to break it up into smaller steps so that's good a good tip break things up into small steps one at a time you'll have logical places to do a commit and break it up and you feel less overwhelmed uh miss miss alex says i didn't understand um i'm not sure what you didn't understand if you're still watching could you let me know like more specifics about what you didn't understand i'd be happy to go back and explain something or you know go through a part of the code or anything you need uh rook says those error messages are nice they tell you the file the line and the character spot the column yeah for sure they're they're really nice saves a lot of time rook says is that link clickable the error link let's see uh where's this checker terminal so these aren't clickable but maybe you're talking about the error that comes up here let's try let me do something that gives me an airline i can't click on that popup maybe let me try to do do something like this all right it doesn't look like anything in here is clickable whoa oh that was the get i've never typed clicked on the the get thing all right i'm just going to get out of there because it's confusing me um change 101 let's get out of here it was just showing me the changes that i made all right cool anyway rook i don't know if i was trying to click the right thing but it didn't look like any of that stuff was was clickable you know what all this calculating stuff is not working right i wonder if some of my plugins in visual studio code are what's causing my computer to run maybe this plugin is cool but i really don't need it maybe i should go in and shut off some of the stuff i don't really use all right i'll have to check on that just a thought so harsh it said yeah rook that's amazing so it is clickable i must have just been trying to click the wrong thing then huh uh how to get the terminal on visual studio code to look like in the video you know what i got these colors from udacity's intro to get in github course it's a free course check it out um i think they have two get courses now the older one was taught by two women so do that one if you want to know these colors and they gave some an example file to change all your colors for your terminal and i just took the example i didn't even really change it i just like the colors so that's where i got it from the git and github areas i think it's called intro to get in github on udacity it's one of their free courses so earlier i was talking about tests and writing tests for this and harshit says jesse you also haven't written a test yet with a little winking smiley face oh [ __ ] you are right oh man i just got called out yeah i have not written a test yet i i will say this i have slightly modified some existing tests not for this project but for previous ones but i haven't written one a test on my own so horseshit keeps me honest i didn't i didn't say i wrote a test i just encouraged everyone to write tests yeah so i need to learn more about writing tests myself and uh yeah harshit has i've done all the tests for this project so thank you for that okay oh um i guess so we used get push earlier that only works if you have set the tracking branch already so thanks uh harshit and angel for clarifying that my phone got the oreo update i hate these new emoji i don't remember what the emoji were like was like before the oreo update maybe that's better uh then i won't be bothered by the new ones uh all right so um o o u s s uh os let me know if i'm pronouncing that wrong i'm not really sure how to pronounce that but anyway they say can i tell you something i subscribe to your channel but i never watch your videos this is mainly because they look too advanced uh and the thumbnails do and uh miss a lot of fundamental stuff in my opinion um uh when i watch some of your tutorials uh you go too fast but i still watch some of your videos though i'm not really hating on your channel i respect what you do alright cool i appreciate um the constructive criticism uh yeah so i will say this if if i ever go too fast you're welcome to ask some questions ask me to go back i'm i'm happy to do that but also so the different videos on this channel on free code camp channel serve different purposes if you maybe want a more fundamental tutorial check out some of bose javascript videos i mean it depends on what you want to learn but for instance beau has a lot of basic level javascript all the way up to more advanced stuff this particular series live coding with jesse is not really a tutorial it's more of just showcasing my everyday work so i think the biggest benefit to this aside from the awesome community that we now have you know around this the show is that i mess things up frequently and then we get to work through them live so you kind of get an idea that usually in tutorials you don't have that happen they're well organized and things work whereas with this stream things don't work and we have to work at them often or sometimes we just have to make things work and it's like this is as good as it's going to get right now when we have to you know think of the tradeoffs between doing it one way or another so not everything is perfect so that's it it makes sense that sometimes it seems like it goes too fast or we miss you know go skip over fundamental things uh so i still appreciate you saying that and like i said if you ever want me to explain anything more or go back and do something again let me know i'm happy to do that uh but again i i really appreciate you saying that and the way you said it was very respectful i i definitely appreciate that uh so thank you kamal says uh hey jesse you're doing great work please organize this tutorial in an organized manner react part and material ui part uh would be a great help um kamal says i mean make the react and material ui part uh combined playlist in an organized way uh okay um yeah let me i can probably separate out the tutorials in a better way right now i have like i say what project it's from so the title will say like this this one i think was p5d23 so it's project five day 23. what i will do and i know i've been saying i'm gonna do this and i just haven't really taken the time to is go through and separate every project out into its own playlist i hadn't thought about doing anything like this before but it's a possibility that potentially i could separate out certain topics into their own playlists as well i don't know that might be more confusing but i could do something like here's where we do just all back end stuff here's where we everything where i handle like sending emails from a server or file uploads so there are some things that we seem to be doing like every project that could be i don't know let me know what what do you think would be the best way to organize these i'm still going to have the one big playlist that's just live coding with jesse so you can see everything in one spot but i definitely think it would be good to have playlists for each project is there any other way that i should try to organize these as well i pro i can't go crazy with it because it's not my channel i share it so i don't want to make a million playlists but you know if there's any reasonable way to organize it i'm i'm definitely um open to suggestions okay all right blake's here hey blake how's it going oh okay so kamal said please make a playlist for react.js material ui combined i don't know where to start it's all messed up uh wordpress react node i want react.js only please make a specific playlist for that hmm all right yeah i'll have to think about how to do that because there are times when we switch back and forth so it may be a little bit hard to just isolate react because there are some streams where we'll do node react wordpress all of it in one stream uh sometimes it's hard to just stick to one one thing i'll keep that in mind and i'll i'll try to think about how i could organize them there are definitely some videos that are like obviously one thing or the other they could maybe go into a playlist john hanson says a pinch of clothes is great when making a slow cook stew yum i don't know where that i guess are you cooking john i don't maybe i missed something in the chat um oh says did i did he answer my question i was gone for a second i did answer your question i'm not sure you can always check the recording uh let's see oh umberto says i found out recently that our contract is getting renewed i have no idea for how long yet but hopefully that means i get to keep my job for a while longer umberto that's awesome really awesome um yeah so i mean i guess let me know let me know if you do get to keep it and if you're back in the market looking for job let me know too uh i'd be happy to like i don't know retweet stuff for you help you get some exposure savage banana says becca yeah that's uh yeah my wife's name is becca so i guess you did go and look it up on social media um all right cool harshit says all right we might be on to something now harshit said that that import cost plugin is cpu intensive uh and it crashed um it crashed his computer once so remove import cost all right cool so uh either today or tomorrow i'm gonna try to run on 1080p with that plugin gone and then see if it makes a difference let's see hershey said i messed up pronunciation of kamal sorry about that let me know how i'm supposed to pronounce it properly uh i really i do care about pronouncing uh everyone's name right so uh let me know don't be afraid to correct me if i if i ever say your name wrong all right so uh oh says um i think kamal is right when you organize your projects in their own playlist it would be more attractive and more inviting uh the thing is i'm a software engineer and worked with javascript a lot with but with the new es6 and the new things like babel and import and export and how that stuff works uh like that freaks me out sometimes or the observed thingies it's not that i don't understand javascript just the new things that javascript frameworks offered but if you have videos or tutorials where you group them in playlist they would be so much better in my opinion so i work mainly with c sharp and php okay cool that's good that's good to know thanks for the clarification um yeah so i would say probably it would be more like i can still look at maybe organizing things differently but i would i would say trying to maybe find some specific videos maybe in like bose javascript playlist that have to do do with es6 and some of the newer things might be more helpful to you and then if you want to still watch the stream which is awesome if you do it will help you to understand more of it and i'm still open answering any questions that you have as well nikola says it's it's kind of hard to give a name to a live stream because you don't know exactly what you will finish at the end yeah for sure the hardest part about live streaming is figuring out what title to give the videos no lie that's the hardest part because you're right i just never know sometimes i title a stream and then i don't even get it to work at all or we end up having like some bug and we fix that so that is the hardest part even if i did organize them in the playlist i'd probably still have some things that weren't right because of that because sometimes we just don't actually do what the title says we do and then i never go back and change it which i should uh all says i study now as a software architect and my sequel database and stuff anyways yeah that was that was it i think one more thing my pronoun my name is pronounced like us okay cool thank you for the pronunciation i'll do my best to try to remember that us us okay awesome uh john says yes cooking painting and thinking code soon off to the gym wow that's impressive cooking painting and thinking about code that's that's really impressive i um uh i don't know if i can handle all that at once and still you know not burn the food all right harsh it says to paste and see the pronunciation and translate all right cool let me do that right now come on all right i'm trying i'm trying to listen and get it right it's really like subtle all right i don't know i'm trying my best to get it right i'm having trouble with that one though um let's see let's see harshad said uh to john hanson i looked at your website your oil paintings are awesome they are awesome uh check out john's website if you're into artwork uh he's a really good artist and if you still haven't checked out his light bright react app on codepen check that out as well i tweeted about it last week or something so check out my twitter and scroll down a bit and you'll see a link to it um says thank you for answering my questions jesse you're welcome thanks for watching the stream and being so active in the chat i really appreciate it all right so i've gotten to the end of the live chat and i tell you what i think i'm gonna wait till tomorrow to finish up with with what we're doing uh cause i'm a little bit tired i'd like i'd like a little break like to get something to eat and also now it gives me a good title for the stream tomorrow because i can use the same title and just put part two so that that makes it a lot easier for me um oh yeah one more question vivek says bro tell me how can i do my best in python uh well i don't know a lot about python specifically i do like python i've used it a little bit but i can give you some general advice on how to how to do your best and uh i should make a video about this because i think i've said this you know a few times now in the stream at different times but when you're trying to learn any coding stuff python included uh when you your strategy for for learning more i think should be if you can break it up and learn a little bit every day that's so much better than maybe like let's say every saturday just doing all day on saturday your brain will when your brain's trying to learn something new it's trying to make these little pathways and connections right with with the neurons in your brain i'm not a scientist so if i'm not using the correct terms i mean it is what it is but uh the more you make pathways like think of um if you're taking a hike in the woods right if you walked over the grass every single day a little bit every day the the grass and everything would get beat down and there'd be a path if you only did it once a week it probably wouldn't wouldn't happen the grass would have enough time to grow up and so you wouldn't have that nice path it's the same way with your brain so that will help if you can do a little bit every day if you can do a lot every day it'll help even more but that's my my number one piece of advice when you're trying to learn something you'll retain the knowledge so much better and try to build on it right so when you learn one thing don't just move on to another concept and never use it again try to immediately apply what you learned to a project so do your tutorials but then try to have a project going at the same time and apply it that helps so much when i was learning react with udacity i would immediately use what i learned in udacity on my projects at work and the stuff we did in the stream and so i remembered it so much better so then when i actually got to the point in the udacity course where i had to build my own project i had retained a lot of the knowledge from the lectures and and the little exercises that we had done along the way because i'd already used it so that's just kind of my general advice i think it can be applied safely to a lot of different things in programming and probably to other fields as well um i mean i don't know if if you have like any specific areas about python i don't know how much i can help because i i don't know that much about python um harshit says here's some more specific advice this is good so harsh it says make servers or learn ai says there's a huge scope for python nikola says which time tomorrow will you stream uh in your time um i'm trying to stream i've been trying to stream earlier around noon it seems like a better time for um for time zones that are like in india and in that area of the world so maybe noon or one p.m eastern time in my time so sometimes i have things going on and i can't stick to a time but expect it sometime around there uh vivek says which field is more appropriate in the future ai or networking i don't know ai just it seems like it's really cool these days uh so harsha's answer is good says ai is really hot these days but there's always need of networking yeah yeah i mean i tend to agree it does i i think they'll both still be you know useful and around for a long time if i had to pick honestly assuming that i could safely get a job in either one and support my family i'd pick ai because that just seems it seems really cool to work on harshad also says you should be good at math and math for ai okay it's cool it's good to know that's some good specific advice there harshad also says networking is easier to learn uh abby schick says ionic or react native for android i recommend react native i think react native has some advantages over using ionic uh it lets you use like some more of like the lower level stuff um that you know won't necessarily have access to if you're using ionic now i haven't checked into ionic for years so maybe it's it's different now but as far as i know i think react native gives is is the better way to go uh vivek says what time do you stream in india um i don't know for sure there might be multiple time zones in india but for harsh it's time zone um which i need harsh it's in the himalayas but for that time zone noon would be like 11 p.m right let me know horizon uh is 12 my 12 p.m my time 11 p.m for you it's somewhere around there it might not be exactly 11 uh but i think it's that's close vivek says i'm stuck in many things so i can't decide my my future uh yeah that's tough vivek i mean right now just do what you can with what you have and don't worry about what you can't control you know um that way at least you can make progress with with what you do if it turns out you can end up doing more and have you know some more freedom in your decisions at some point then you'll be prepared uh let's see xavier says any way to contribute to your projects there used to be an option in free code camp to make websites for charities like for free um yeah i'm not sure how that works with the charities thing in free code camp but you can definitely contribute to these projects check out the repositories that we have and you know go to the link check out that whole github organization and any of the repositories just look at the uh look at the issues that are open and you can take one of those and work on it or if you notice some glaring flaw you can open your own issue and you'll work on that if you want if you need any help or ideas just just let me know oh cool good to know vivek says there's only one time zone in india it's gmt all right very good to know that's cool that's nice there's one time zone in the in the u.s we have so many time zones sometimes it's when you're traveling in within the country like it can be confusing um sometimes as you pass through time zones it's like depending on which way you're going it either seems like you gained a lot of time or you lost a lot of time um abby scheck says which library should be used for employing machine learning and web apps uh i i really don't know i don't know enough about that i know there is some uh machine learning javascript libraries out there i'll i don't remember offhand what they're called though uh but they do exist if you're gonna use them in web apps you may as well use javascript because you're going to be using it anyway since it's a web app so that would be my recommendation i don't know if you could run machine learning stuff clientside i assume you'd have to run it server side with node um i don't know it it would kind of be cool if there's a really something really lightweight that you could do basic machine learning stuff in the client but i i don't think that exists i think it's too resource intensive oh wow vivek says it's 1 15 a.m uh it is it is 2 46 p.m right now where i am abby asks is it advisable to learn two javascript frameworks at the same time um i wouldn't try to do it myself i'd rather focus on one and learn it really well the only way i would do that is if i um i wasn't sure whether i wanted to do one or the other and i just wanted to learn the basics of both to make a decision uh but i think it's better to choose i always i i think i mentioned this before in a stream but i i read it really like an old book once uh but it was about basically like ways to live your life to help like improve your brain um and your intellect and uh it was one of the things that it had said was was basically and this is in my own words was if you really want to be good at something you have to say no to everything else so right if you really want to be good at react you say no to angular and view if you really want to be you know and it works with anything in life not just programming it doesn't mean you can't do those other things but you can't do it at the same level right you have to focus there are some people who can be good at a lot of different things but if they would just pick one they could be great at it so if you want to really be great and like one of the best at something you're gonna have to pick other things um which is like i mean that that's kind of freeing and restrictive in the same time because it almost gives you license to be able to focus and you'll be okay with that um but but you do have to decide uh so i guess just think about that some people would may rather just be kind of good at a lot of things or even really good at a lot of things but to get to that best level you do have to choose and so that's why i would say learn one framework well and be really awesome at it that's what i would do but lisa it does depend a little bit on your goals and what your intention is for learning both of them all right i mean if you're in a a company that uses both obviously you have to learn both if you're a freelancer and you want to open yourself up to more clients yeah learn both but if you have the freedom to be able to pick one and stick with it i i would do that oh vivec says for machine learning tensorflow is good it's uh developed by google that's right yeah i i do remember hearing good things about tensorflow haven't used it yet but i've just heard good things uh hardship says javascript is terrible in machine learning use python it says 95 percent uses tensorflow hardship is making an ai chat bot vivec asks where i lived in america i live in ohio i actually live right on the border of ohio and pennsylvania and west virginia like they all meet at one place so i live the the big city that i'm closest to is pittsburgh so i'm pretty close to pittsburgh and so i'm in the eastern time zone so like new york city is in the same time zone that i'm in the whole east coast of the united states is in that time zone all right hey har [ __ ] harshest said stephenville ohio you remembered yes stephenville was a small city uh like i don't know like sixteen thousand people in steubenville i think vivek says uh ohio have their own university yeah so ohio has um a lot of universities so there's a university here in stephenville and that's what that's the university i work for it's uh franciscan university of steubenville there's a and it's so it's an independent school but there are state schools that are like government funded so ohio state is the big state school i believe it's the largest university in the state of ohio and then there's there's a lot of other small universities so small and there are some other state universities as well so there's there's a lot but ohio is one of the more important states in the united states uh several like major cities and things i'm not originally from ohio though i'm from west virginia which is one of the least important states but i i love it i love my home state um vivek says what job do you do i am a i'm officially a front end developer but realistically i i do a lot of back end stuff as well but my title is front and developer and if you'd like to know more about what i do just check out the stream because i'm streaming this from my job so this is my my actual work that i'm doing each day on the stream stuff you don't see are basically me sitting in meetings answering emails and uh sending messages on slack but like my real work is is exactly the same as what i stream let's see um here's another question and wow all right i'm gonna have trouble with this name i'm gonna do my best red jesh rajesh khannan really sorry if i messed that up um says how to improve my web design skill if you want to know more about design i recommend read through some the material design documentation just to get an idea of like the the logic behind design which you have to think about uh and then check out some other designs um so like there are websites that like give awards for the best website designs like check those out just kind of look at what's new and design things you like and don't like um and and then just try things out um you'll get a feel once you look at enough design and work with it enough you'll start to get a feel for what works and what doesn't just by looking at it you'll be able to look and say no those colors don't work i need more white space uh this needs to be a few pixels one way or the other like it takes a while to get that but eventually like you'll get it and i'm not saying i'm the best at design but you know i'm definitely at the point where i can look at something and say this will look better if it were adjusted a few pixels or those colors definitely don't work um and at that point and then you know even beyond i'm sure there are people that are even so much better at that and can come up with an awesome design like you know right off just off the top of their head on a piece of paper or something but that would be my advice just kind of check out the designs that are prominent now read about like why they do it and check out some of the websites that are really getting like recognized for having good design uh let's say yes abby six says how to make svg responsive and web pages um harshad said media queries yeah media queries so i'll tell you what check out some of the videos by sarah drazner um she's really good with svg's and so check out some of her stuff i've heard some of her talks before where she covers like responsiveness and svg's and it's actually a lot better to use svg's as opposed to normal images if you want things to look great on different screens because there's i don't know there's really cool stuff that you can do there's so much you can do with svg so i check out some of her stuff if you want to learn more about it but essentially yes like media queries work a lot using like percentage widths instead of um like a fixed width you know helps a lot uh but i think was sarah drazner yeah that's drasner uh vivek says bro you live in america it's great but i live in india it's also great but i want to get a job in google california yeah um it'd be great to work at google uh they have you make a lot of money there's um like a great a lot of like perks to working at google like you most likely have access to a lot of awesome technology they also have a lot of different locations worldwide as well so i mean it'd be cool to live in california i wouldn't want to live there though because it's really really expensive to try to find a house or an apartment in california but google does have other locations like they actually have a location in pittsburgh which would be really cool to work at i could i could live in the same house i live in now and just commute into pittsburgh and work at google there if they'll they'll have me if anybody from google is watching i mean give me a call maybe we'll see uh i like my job right now and where i'm at but i probably would not turn down something from google it's just a great opportunity um assuming i would even good enough to work there i don't know about that um let's see whoa uh all ozos just put a lyric up from country roads which is basically like the the theme song of my home state of west virginia so you you just made my heart feel like longing for my homeland right now just from that lyric so i'm gonna like be singing that song all day every true west virginian knows all the words to that song and can sing it whenever it comes on so how did you know about that song um well i really i appreciate that that's awesome you put that in there um let's see oh yeah so they're saying sarah drazner works at microsoft yeah yeah she works at microsoft she's really active on twitter as well uh you check out her twitter stuff she has she's spoken at a ton of different conferences so she's on a lot of different youtube channels for different things she i think she has a talk on free code camps talk channels so free codecam has two different channels if you check out their talk channel um then uh i think she's on there but yeah everything i've ever seen her do with svg's is just amazing i should say jesse they will probably not hire a react engineer as facebook yeah i don't i assume i'd be doing other things and and not react i don't does google use react for anything i don't know maybe they do um yeah so maybe i'd be doing other stuff but i mean they gotta have people writing javascript right they have a lot of websites so i'd probably be doing something with javascript i do use a lot of material design and google uh google invented that so maybe maybe there's a show for me um john hanson says it's for you google's calling yeah be crazy if they actually did call me during a stream at some point um all right i've gotten to the end of the live chat finally all right so i think i'm going to stop for real this time uh thanks everyone for watching uh we we did some good stuff uh didn't get everything done that i wanted to but um the work that we did it worked so that's that's a plus so i'll be back tomorrow i'm going to try to stream sometime around like noon or 1pm uh another question um says would you recommend for me to go to into app academy um i'm not sure exactly what app academy is but my recommendation for any type of thing like that or boot camp or something is check it out to make sure that they're legitimate and see like do people really get jobs from this check on the price if you can afford it and you can take the time and it seems like it's a reputable thing then go for it i've never done anything like that uh so i can't tell you personally but like my wife's doing a boot camp right now and she seems to be really happy with it so um without knowing more details that's just kind of my general advice uh all right so now let me get out of here i'm really hungry at this point so i actually do want to end the stream uh and get something to eat so thanks so much everyone for watching i'll be back tomorrow until then have a great day
