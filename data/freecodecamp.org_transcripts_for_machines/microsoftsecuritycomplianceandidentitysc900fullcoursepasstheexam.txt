hey this is andrew brown your cloud instructor at exam pro and i'm bringing you another complete study course and this time it's the microsoft security compliance and identity fundamentals made available to you here on freecodecamp so this course is designed to help you pass and achieve microsoft issued certification and the way we're going to do that is via lots of lecture content and cheat sheets so on the day your exam you have a high chance of passing so you can put that certification on your resume or linkedin to prove you have that azure security knowledge and get that cloud job or that promotion you've been looking for so just a bit about me i'm previously the cto of multiple ed tech companies with 15 years industry experience five years specializing cloud i'm an aws community hero i've published many many free cloud uh courses just like this one and i love star trek and coconut water so if you ever meet me and know what to buy me for a drink i just want to take a moment here to say thank you to viewers like you because it's you that make these cloud courses possible if you're looking for ways to support more free cloud courses just like this one the best way to do that is to buy our additional study materials at exam pro dot co for this course in particular it's forward slash sc900 and here you're going to get study notes flash cards quizlets downloadable lectures downloadable cheat sheets uh practice exams and you can even ask questions and get some learning support if you want to know what courses are coming up next uh the best way is to follow me on twitter i love hearing when people have passed their exam or what you want to see next for a free cloud certification course so there we go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are at the start of our journey asking the most important question which is what is the sc900 so it's the microsoft security compliance and identity fundamentals and it provides broad knowledge across microsoft security services so the certification will demonstrate a person can define and understand the xero trust model microsoft privacy m365 defender and azure defender azure active directory and a broad overview of microsoft and m365 security services and the certification is generally referred to by its course code the sc900 and it's an essential certification no matter your azure path this course in particular is very lecture heavy and greatly involves azure active directory so that is something we can look forward to this isn't an easy course to pass and they're great for those new to security and compliance so here's my azure roadmap and there's a lot more azure certifications but we just kept the ones on the board that actually are relevant to our possible paths and so here is some suggestions i have for you and the first thing is that you definitely want to take the ac 900 first the sc900 while being a fundamental certification is much longer than these other ones and how it has a lot of information so it makes it a little bit more digestible if you take the az900 first if you're taking a general pass such as the administrator developer onto your solutions architect or devops engineer this is going to really make it easier at the associate and expert level especially for the administrator because this particular certification has a lot to do with azure active directory now of course the security certifications should be the primary reason why you want to take this path and azure has four at the associate level this is the reason why we don't really do any lab content follow alongs within the fundamental course because if we did we'd just be making these courses because if you were to look into the exam guides for all these four certifications you're just going to be seeing the same information but us applying that knowledge and saying okay how do we do this for real okay so how long does it take to sta how long should you study to pass a certification well if you have one years of azure experience you're looking about six hours if you've passed your az 900 you're looking about 12 hours if you're completely new so you're not taking the a900 going straight for it you're looking at 20 hours okay this one is a longer than any of the other fundamental certifications and i recommend about 30 minutes a day for 14 days all right just keep it within the scope of two weeks if you can so where do you take this exam well you can do it in person at a test center or online from the convenience of your own home so there are two different uh data test centers that are partnered with uh microsoft and azure to uh deliver these the one is psi or pearson vue they both have in person and online uh i strongly recommend that you always do in person because it's a more controlled environment it's less stressful you don't have to worry about the internet going out uh or some other issue that might occur and so these are proctored exams that means that there's a supervisor somebody monitoring your progress as you take the certification so that you aren't cheating or things like that so what does it take to pass this exam well you got to watch the lecture videos you generally have to do handson labs for this one i'm going to cross this out because basically there's next to none in this course so uh you know it's more so watching the lecture videos you probably would like to get some paid online practice exams and if you do need one go to exampro.com and that's a great way to support these free courses that's how i'm able to make these for you at no cost okay for the content outline uh the breakdown is describe the concepts of security compliance and identity describe the capabilities of microsoft identity and access management solutions describe the capabilities of microsoft security solutions describe the capabilities of the microsoft compliant solutions and we will open up the exam guide in the next video here just to give you a more clear view what the contents of the course is for grading you have to get at least 70 percent to pass so around that because it's using scaled scoring the response types uh we're looking at here well first of all there's 40 to 60 questions so you can get about 12 to 18 questions wrong some questions are worth more than one points there is no penalty for wrong questions some questions cannot be skipped and the format of questions could be multiple choice multiple answer drag and drop hot area or case studies the duration of the course just like all the fundamental certifications is one hour so you roughly get about a minute per question uh the exam time is 60 minutes but your seat time is 90 minutes so your seat time refers to the amount of time you should allocate for the exam so this could include the time to review instructions read and accept the nda complete the exam provide feedback at the end and this certification well i normally say two two years because that's pretty much the standard but any fundamental certification just never expires and i i didn't put this in my other fundamental videos because i did not know that but apparently once you have it you have it forever so that's a pretty good benefit there so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and what i've done here is opened up the page where we can find the exam guide outline so if you type in sc900 certification it should bring it to this page you scroll on down to your skills measured and you download the outline now at the top of these documents this is a very new certification it's not even a year old from the time i'm making this but a lot of times you'll see red text in this document the top you'll say there has been changes it scares people because they think that maybe the course is out of date but i'm going to tell you that unless they change the number here unless it becomes the sc901 or 902 this course is going to be mostly relevant okay because they're only ever making my new changes they're never going to change huge sections of a course if they do then they're going to update the numbers so that's how you know whether my course is still relevant or not okay is whether the course number changes not if there's red text but going down below here we'll just quickly go through some of these sections and some of the thoughts i have about this course so we have the zero trust methodology is the first thing they want to learn xero trust model is super important it's the foundation of this entire course and ties over to azure active directory so you're definitely going to know that inside and out the shared responsibility model which we covered in the az900 nothing has changed there defense and depth that's like a sevenlayer thing not super important common threats which are going to lay the foundation for some other services um encryption which is pretty straightforward stuff we covered in the az104 the microsoft privacy principles this is a bit confusing because they have two different pages but i cover both of them here so you know both of them the service trust portal where we can download audit reports so that's a very simple thing there primary security perimeter this is a concept of the zero trust model really should be up in the top section there author authentication authorization ipd so identity providers think facebook google linkedin twitter uh active directory which is a huge component of this course federated services identity attacks uh and so then we have um the notice here it says service identities for azure id capabilities of azure id management capabilities of azure id identity protection and governance capabilities of azure id so there's a lot of azure ad stuff a good chunk of this is actually covered in the az104 so if you're taking that as your natural path like basically like half of this at least half of this is covered is actually the content's coming from there okay so that's going to be really great for you going down below here now we're into microsoft capability i guess still says azure so nsgs ddos azure firewall bastion web application firewall azure azure encryption data a lot of this covered again in the az104 so it was very easy easy for me to bring this over simplified it more to a business use case for you okay the azure security center azure security score azure defender cloud security posture management and there's a lot of these terms uh like a lot of initialisms and we go thoroughly through them in the primer i actually squeezed in a primer a security primer in the front of this course because uh they just lack a lot of that information to uh help you understand the stuff and so i just did that to round out the entire course overall so you have azure sentinel where you have siem soars and xtr's then there's microsoft 365 defender and there's a lot of stuff with defender because there's azure defender and 365 defender and there's all these sub services there's unbelievable amount of stuff in here so identity office 365 endpoints cloud app security uh then you have the microsoft 365 security center so you have a security score there reports dashboards things like that that's actually how you access azure azure defenders through the m365 or sorry through the um uh security center um and then through uh um at my m365 defender it's through uh well actually just go to the security panel that's how you get to it you have microsoft intune that's for managing remote devices that's part of microsoft endpoint manager so you can remotely control or or have security over devices tablets and computers then we have here um uh the microsoft compliant solution so there's the microsoft um or m365 compliance center and there's a ton of stuff in this course like tons and tons i would say like a good quarter of this entire well it says 25 percent here but 25 percent of the course is all about the compliance center there's tons of stuff in here for that and actually that's the end of the course so yeah it's mostly azure id and the compliance center a handful of azure uh services and a bunch of marketing resources okay so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are starting our journey for the sc900 talking about zero trust methodologies or the zero trust model in particular and this is super important because it really lays the foundation of the way we should be thinking about uh all of the security that we're gonna be doing within azure and actually in any cloud service providers because the xero trust model is really uh what is being adopted today and we'll talk about why that is so the zero trust model operates on the principles of trust no one and verify everything so you have malicious actors and they're being able to bypass conventional access controls and demonstrates traditional security measures that's no longer sufficient we need to come up with a new way to protect ourselves and so that's where azure or microsoft in particular has come up with their version of a zero trust model called the microsoft's zero trust model and this is based on three principles and six pillars so in the three principles we have verified explicitly uh least privileged access assume breach for our six pillars we have um identities endpoints uh an easier way of thinking about endpoints is just think of them as devices apps data infrastructure and networks and i would say that if you wanted to put an emphasis on anything it's going to be identities which comes down to azure ad that seems to be the largest focus here in this entire course and to really ensuring the zero trust methodology works the xerotrust model is not unique to microsoft gcp has its own zero trust model aws has its own zero trust model but the one here is just gonna really work for azure okay okay so let's review the three principles we said that are in the microsoft zero truss model the first is verify explicity and so this always authenticates and authorizes based on all the available data points um the next one is lease privilege access so limit user access with just in time and just enough access for riskbased adaptive policies and data protection assume breach so minimize blast radius and segment access verify endtoend encryption and use analytics to gain visibility drive threat detection improve defenses now you see me highlighting things in red and i'm not telling you what they are because we have a whole section on these things so don't worry if you see a bunch of terms and you're just getting overwhelmed uh we're going to cover them multiple times and so you just understand that we're going to front load you with a lot of terms you don't know but you will know them by the end this course okay all right so let's take a look here at the six pillars for the microsoft zero trust model starting with the most important one identities and this verifies and secures each identity with strong authentication across your entire digital estate and so for each of these pillars we're going to talk about some of the related services i'm not going to describe what they do because we're definitely going to be covering them all in this course in great detail but i want you to get some exposure so you see all these names again and again and again okay so the first is iam the next one is azure active directory and this one gets a lot of attention in this course they might as well call this the azure active directory security course we have single signon mfa password list authentication which is a subset of mfa riskbased policies identity secure score and you'll see like three different types of secure score in this course so something that is very useful uh throughout microsoft and azure we have endpoints and it's easy to think of these as devices because their endpoints are used to gain visibility into devices accessing the network ensuring compliance and health status before granting access the endpoint is what grants access for this we have azure ad device manager to register our devices with our identity provider generally the the controls underneath which is mobile device management and mobile application management is managed by intune and this service is now actually part of microsoft endpoint manager and if we want to get a protection around our endpoints then we have microsoft defender for endpoints but we got defender for everything in this course and you'll see that soon enough then you have dlps uh so data loss prevention policies so we do not lose our data so that we like it does not just get disclosed and we can keep our data our sensitive data protected right for apps we have discover shadow i.t so ensure appropriate inapp permissions gate access based on realtime analytics and monitor control user actions so there for this we have policy based access controls we can use the microsoft cloud app security azure 80 application proxy cloud discovery or i suppose that could have been ediscovery uh there's definitely a spelling mistake there so i think it's just supposed to be cloud discovery um we have just in time virtual machine access onto the last three pillars we have data so move from perimeterbased data protection to data driven protection use intelligence to classify and label data encrypt and restrict access based on organizational pro policies so here we can use sensitive sensitivity labels microsoft information protection data classification azure uh information protection so aip scanner decisionbased policies and data loss prevention all of this stuff is in the microsoft at the if you're doing it on the microsoft side it's the m3s can i type text in here no i can't but it's the m365 compliance center this is where all this stuff comes into play uh we'll see later on so infrastructure used telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies automatically block and flag risk behaviors and employ least privileged access principles so here we can use the azure security center azure ad managed identities user and resource segmentation vnets peering rules privileged identity management nsgs asgs azure firewall microsoft defender for endpoint microsoft defender for identity azure sentinel and the last one here is network i hate doing networking but it's a core to cloud you know so ensure devices and users aren't trusted just because they're on an internal network encrypt all internal communications limit access by policy and employ micro segmentation realtime threat detection so here we can do network segmentation azure ddos production service azure firewall the laugh vpn's proxies bastions ssl tls and so there you go that is all the pillars so we just defined what the zero trust uh model is and that's fine and dandy but how do we go ahead and start implementing it well they have a nice tool that can get us started here called uh the zero trust assessment tool and this is a free tool to assess your organization's degree of adoption towards the zero trust model and suggest uh to improve your current security implementations so it's basically a bunch of questions across the six pillars and then it'll give you a recommendations now we just ran over the six pillars and i actually went through this and extracted them all out for you so you basically just saw all them from the tool um but uh if you want to uh see more detailed steps uh that will be really useful okay i wanted to take a moment to actually show you the assessment tool because it's really easy to use you don't even need an account so all i did was i typed in zero trust assessment tool microsoft and i was brought to here and what the what you want to do here is just start at the beginning and we have identities and lasted some questions like have you enabled mfa authentication for internal users so i'll say some users because some of my users might not be good about it which forms of password list authentication are enabled so password list means you don't have to enter a password in so maybe we have phone call text phone microsoft authenticator i definitely use 502 security keys we'll go next which of your user groups are provisioned with single signon and like does anyone use it so maybe my customers are using single signon which of the following security policy engines are you using to make access decisions for enterprise resources and if you don't know any of these names and you wouldn't check box them i know mobile device management so we'll do that have you disabled legacy authentication i'm not sure what they mean here but maybe you have like an old system that's not part of you're not using azure id so we'd say yeah maybe i'm still using a legacy system i haven't migrated to the cloud yet are you using realtime user and sign in risk detection to evaluate request access if you're using azure id and you have it turned on you'd know but we'll say no for using a legacy system what's the following technologies have you integrated with your identity access management solution if you're again a small company you might have not done much or maybe you've only done mobile device management that's usually one that's pretty common which of the following context is used for access policies um so like access policies like access to things so what is the context and i would say most people are going to be doing the user like what user's allowed to use it and a lot of these are never ever thought about so we'll go next are you using identity security score for guidance um actually i do but let's just say you said no and so the idea here is we'll get our results and it will give you like instructions so this is where i extracted all these little details for you in the slides there so you have to go through it but it describes it multifactor helps you protect your applications by requiring requiring users to confirm the identity etc etc so explains them all right you could just answer no on everything it'll give you all the information at the end and it's very useful to read through this and and uh to understand it but again we cover this through the whole course so you don't have to read it here you just got to follow along okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at azure's shared responsibility model all the cloud service providers have a shared responsibility model they're more or less the same and so this is just to tell you like what you are responsible for what azure is responsible for this is covered in the az104 the az204 and the az900 and definitely we need to cover this again even if you know it we should go over it again for the sc900 so that we can think of it in the context of security so for responsibilities we have information data devices account identities identity directories applications network controls operating system physical host physical network physical data center and then we have saas paas iaas and on premise if you forget those terms the first is software as a service the software that uses that you use in the cloud so think 365. so word doc excel skype uh onedrive sharepoint dynamics crm you know if if imagine just allpurpose software but you access it via the cloud then you have platform as a service so deploy apps without worrying about the underlying infrastructure so azure app services you just have an app you put it up there it just works infrastructure is a service so the basic building blocks of cloud i.t so storage compute database is networking i call that the four uh you should always know that no matter what cloud service provider you're using on premise so data center owned and operated maintained by the customer so we'll do is just show you the blocks here and the blue represents the customer's responsibility okay i i know it's like you think like blue would be for azure but they made it blue and i should have really i should have really um uh put a legend on this because i always get confused by that as well but we're going to just do that and this is the customer okay so going down below here look at physical host networks and data center so azure is going to take responsibility if you're using ias paas or sas azure takes responsibility for all the physical stuff and there's a lot of work there if you had to secure that stuff now once you get you go up a bit more so if you're using an operating system at the pass or sas level you're still responsible or sir azure will take more responsibility here um but you know that's generally broadly how this works but if we just kind of break it down into three major categories i'm just going to clear our board here it's getting a little bit messy so and this this lines up to these lines i just didn't have lines in here but the idea here is this this is always the responsibility of the customer everything above here this is going to vary per service type the second tier and the bottom there the sp responsibility transfers by the cloud providers okay a few caveats here is that regardless of the type of deployment the following response responsibilities are always retained by you so data endpoints account access management so just remember those four there at the end okay let's take a look here at defense and depth and so there are seven layers of security that azure wants you to know it kind of maps up to the shared responsibility model a lot of times we see these things when um organizations or or cloud providers are talking about their security centers like the actual data centers and how they're secured but this is more general it doesn't necessarily have to apply to a data center but let's go and work our way through inside out okay so the core we have data so access to business and customer data encryption to protect our data then we have applications so um applications secure and free of security vulnerabilities then you have compute so access to vms ports on premise and cloud the network limit communications between resources using segmentation and access controls the perimeter so distribute denials of service protection to filter large scale attacks before they can cause the denial service for users identity and access so control controlling access to infrastructure and change controls and then you have physical security so limiting access to a data center to only authorize personnel so the idea is that if you really want to like if you want to get to data you got to go through all these steps here these are all the layers of defense um and so i just want to give extra emphasis to um this one here identity and access because this one's like the besides the physical security this one's the outermost one so they they will say like your your your perimeter like the modern perimeter is defined based on your i like your identity okay and we'll see that more here in this course hey it's andrew brown from exam bro we're looking at the cia triad and that stands for confidentiality integrity and availability and this model is used for describing the foundation to security principles and their tradeoffs and relationships uh and so just to look at it here quickly so we have confidentiality so is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers and practices can be using cryptographic keys to encrypt our data and using keys to encrypt our keys so known as envelope encryption you have integrity so maintaining ensuring the accuracy and completeness of your data over its entire life cycle and practice utilizing asset compliant databases for valid transactions utilizing tamper tamper evident or tamper proof uh hardware security modules so hsms or availability information needs to be made available when needed so in practice you want things to be highly available you want to mitigate ddos attacks you want to uh have decryption access that looks like there's a spell of mistake here something looks funny there but um the ca model was or triad was first mentioned in the nist publication in 1977 uh there have been efforts to expand and modernize or suggest alternatives to the cia triad because it is really old right so one was like in 1998 where we have the six atomic elements of information so confidence confidentiality possession integrity authentication availability utility and then 2004 we have this engineering principles for information technology security um and they that that has like 33 security principles so um the thing with this triad is that you kind of get like a tradeoff they say like if you go in full confidentiality you might have to make compromises here or there um to what degree i don't know but this is a very wellknown model and so it's just good for you to note okay let's talk about common threats and these are in particular what azure wants you to know there's definitely a lot more than just four here but these are the four main ones that azure wants you to focus on before we talk about let's just say what is a threat so a threat in cloud security is a potential negative action or event facilitated by the vulnerability that results in an unwanted impact to a computer system or application and so as you're watching you know the following four types so the first is a dictionary tax so attackers attempt to steal identity by brute forcing into a target account by enumerating over a large number of known passwords and i actually put the word numerating in there because it's very common to see this when you are doing uh pen testing enumeration is very common uh but throughout the entire course i never saw them ever use that term so i figured hey i'll insert it there so you get to see it disruptive attack so an attack which attempts to disrupt a computer system or computer network for various reasons so that could be ddos coin miners root kits trojans worms ransomware a type of malicious software that when installed holds data workstations are a network hostage until a ransom has been paid we've heard of entire like cities being ransomed you know what i mean like the mayor has to pay some person somewhere to to get something back you know data breach so when a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to a system in order to extract private data so those are the core four threats they want you to know okay hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at the concept of vulnerabilities so a vulnerability is a whole or weakness in the application that can beat a design flaw or implementation bug that allows an attacker to cause harm to stakeholders or an application the term is used throughout the sc900 course but they never describe it so here i'm describing it for you and i've actually pulled up a bunch of vulnerabilities from owasp owps is the open web application security project if you're in security you want to know what oh wasp is they have a lot of cool things there but i just got their big old list here so here's a big list and this is application focused uh but there's some that you might have seen before like buffer overflow ever heard of stack overflow that's kind of what they're talking about there take advantage of memory leaks least privilege violation so this is a very very common one where um uh the privileges aren't strict enough and that's where they can escalate their privileges uh or maybe we have like using a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm maybe like instead of using uh shaw you should be using bcryp things like that uh you know but i just want you to fundamentally understand what a vulnerability is it's a whole or weakness in an application okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at encryption and to understand this we need to know what cryptography is so this is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties which we'll call adversaries and so encryption is the process of encoding so scrambling information using a key and cipher to store sensitive data in an unintelligible format as a means of protection an encryption takes in plain text and produces a cipher text um and so a very famous example of an encryption machine was the enigma machine used during world war ii uh and the idea was that you'd have to get a daily key and this would set the position of the rotors and these rotors would determine what ciphers would be substituted for that day all right hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and we were just looking at encryption and we saw the word cipher so i want to dive in and describe what that is so a cipher is an algorithm that performs encryption or decryption and cipher is synonymous with code so a lot of times ciphering code just means the same thing notice that this has an i and this has a y both are valid spellings i put both of them in here just so that you're comfortable with it if you're in canada or the uk uh we like to use the y if you're in the states or other places they like to use the i so both are okay when you use a cipher the output is a cipher text and so basically it takes plain text and just looks like scrambled text and so here's an example and this is way back in the day it kind of makes the illustration pretty clear but this was a a code book and it would store different cryptographic codes so if we were to zoom in here if you're given the code 0 2 or 0 4 it could mean uh this or i suppose like the word canoe could also mean has the authority so there's a bit of an encoding there uh or sorry like a cipher there to understand that translation so hopefully that makes it clear so to complete the puzzle for encryption you have a cipher and a key so a cryptographic key is a variable used in conjunction with an encryption algorithm in order to encrypt or decrypt data and so we have two uh types of keys we have symmetric keys and this is when you use the same key for encoding decoding so here is my key right i have my plain text i use that key it turns it into cipher text notice the text is not human readable and then i use the same key to turn it back into plain text and the most common uh symmetric encryption is aes and you'll definitely see that when working with azure aws or any cloud service provider then you have symmetric encryption or say asymmetric encryption this is when you use two keys one key to encode and one key to decode and so very similar process but the keys are separated uh the most popular case here is rsa okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at the concepts of hashing and salting so hashing is a function that accepts an arbitrary size of values and maps it to a fixed size data structure and hashing can reduce the size of the stored value now that is a benefit of hashing but that's not necessarily why we're using hashing so hashing is a oneway process meaning once you turn that text into a hash it's basically unreadable at that point and it's deterministic meaning that um it's a it it's a process where the input will always produce the same output so if you always give it john smith it's always going to produce o2 all right now the hash can be whatever it doesn't necessarily mean john smith will be o2 it's just based on what the hashing function uh uh operates like how it works okay so the use case for hashing is for hashing passwords if you have a database you do not want them to reside in plain text because if a malicious actor gets in they can just see all the passwords so by hashing it it obscures what the password is now the way you would authenticate against the password because if a user inputs a password you have to match it against it you just have to hash the the inputted password and then match it against um the hash password right the hashed values and so popular hashing functions are md5 shot three 356 b b crypt is pretty popular that's what everyone uses because it's very long and good uh if an attacker knows what what function you are using so if it knows uh the hashing function then that's an issue because you know they might not be able to see the password but they can enumerate against uh enumerate means like iterate through a bunch of passwords they have to determine what the password is so a preventative measure so they can't enumerate uh using a dictionary a password dictionary is to salt the password so a salt is a random string not known to the attacker that the hash function accepts to mitigate the deterministic nature of hashing functions okay so that is hashing insulting hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at digital signatures and signings so what is a digital signature it's a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents and a digital signature gives us temper tamper evidence so imagine you had objects on your desk if you took something like baby powder which is a fine grain dust and spread it over your desk if someone were to move your items you would see clearly see that they have been moved because there'd be an outline between the powder and the area that had no powder underneath the objects and that's an example a real world example of tamper evidence so it's going to answer did someone mess or modify the data is this data not from the expected sender that's what these tamper evidence are telling us so there are three algorithms to digital signatures and so there is a visual example that i got from wikipedia i couldn't be bothered to make an image today but the idea is you have key generation so generates a public and private key so there are our two keys public and private and so we have the signing so this is the process of generating a digital signature with a private key and the inputted message so we have our private key and we have our inputted message and then you can see that it's attached to our message here you have signing verification so verify the authenticity of a message with a public key so when it's received by the other person we use the public key to determine that it is from the person we think that it's from and it hasn't been tampered with so a very famous example of this would be ssh so this is used for logging into remote virtual machines and we use a public and private key to authorize remote access to that machine uh and what you do is you'd probably use the ssh keygen command this is a very wellknown command and i haven't memorized because i i've used it so many times and so will you and notice that it has a hyphen t so it says that we want to take rsa as the input that is the type of algorithm that we are using um to generate out uh that okay and remember earlier on when we were talking about asymmetric keys where there was two keys and we mentioned rsa that's the same key here okay one other thing i want to mention is code signing just because when you hear signing you might see code signing what the difference is this is just when you use a digital signature to ensure computer code has not been tampered with all right so if you have a repository uh you know people might try to inject bad code into your repo and this is one way to prevent it okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are comparing in transit versus at rest encryption so encryption and transit is data that is secure when moving between locations and our algorithms that we'll see here is tls and ssl for encryption at rest this is data that's secure when residing on storage or within a database and so algorithms here could be used would be aes or ras all right we've covered aes and res but let's talk about tls and ssl so tls which stands for transport layer security is an encryption protocol for data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications tls is deprecated in favor of ssl that means that we don't use it anymore but every time you know we mention encryption transit or ssl everyone always mentions tls where ssl originates from so even though we don't use it you just see everyone always mentioning it so ssl stands for secure socket layers and it's an encryption protocol for data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications how it's different from tls i can't remember myself but i just want you to know that ssl is the one that is used today so when you connect to a website you see https that is using ssl hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at multifactor authentication also known as mfa and that's how i'll refer to it through the entire course and it's a security control where after you fill in your email and password you have to use a second device such as a phone to confirm that it's you that is logging in so mfa protects against people who have stolen your password mfa is an option in most cloud providers and even social media websites such as facebook so here it is example you see my email my password and that is called one factor so i've confirmed my identity like uh in this one case and then you have the second factor also known as multifactor that's usually what we call it and then that's going to let us get into the system okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at security information event management siem so to understand this we're just going to define a couple things so what is log management well this focuses on simple collection and storage of log messages and audit trails then you have event logs so system and applications generate events which are kept in event logs list of activities that occurred with records of new events being appended to the end of the logs as they occur so when we say what is a security information management sim this is the longterm storage as well as analysis and reporting of log data then you have an sem so this is for security event management so realtime monitoring correlation events and notifications of consoles notice here logs logs events events okay so there's a correlation between these two definitions for you so what is security information event management well it's simply the combination of a sim and a sem to provide realtime analysis of security alerts generated by the network hardware and applications so here we have our siem and we would have features like log collection log analysis uh event correlation log forensic it compliance application log monitoring object access auditing realtime alerting user activity monitoring dashboards reporting file integrity monitoring system and device monitoring or log monitoring and log retention so you can see that this tool does a lot and it's very important in your security tool belt hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at security orchestration and automated response also known as soar and this collects data about security threats and responds to security events without human assistance so the source system will trigger action driven automated workflows these are called playbooks and processes uh the process to run security tasks that mitigate the issue so for security orchestration there's two components here security orchestration and automated response so for security orchestration it connects various internal or external security tools via builtin or custom integration so possible connectors and this is not an exhaustive list but vulnerability scanners endpoint protection and user behavior analytics firewalls intrusion detection protection systems security information and event management so ciem threat intelligence feeds so for the security automation side it analyzes the injected data to create playbooks so these are repeatable automated processes to replace manual processes it'll be replacing things like vulnerability scanning log analysis ticket checking auditing and a sort can use ai and ml to provide recommendations and further automate responses hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at extended detection response of xdr and so this is a crosslayer detection and response security system and xdr uses a holistic approach detect and respond to threats that would normally evade detection in a single vector solution by collaborating multiple data sources into a multivector solution so here is our xcr and what we need is a data lake to store these various data so we get network data fire email endpoints cloud workloads and the xtr is going to allow us to do things like automated detection sweeping hunting root cause analysis and we can use that with our siem or soar so this can be used to uh to augment uh these other solutions here okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at endpoint detection in response to edr and this combines realtime continuous monitoring and collection of endpoint data with rules based on automated response and analysis capabilities i'm sure explained somewhere else in the course but an end point is an entry uh is an entry or gate on your security perimeter it's a way to enter the network okay and so ed edps are designed to detect apt so what is an apt it stands for advanced persistent threat and the idea here is that these threats will breach a security perimeter so through an endpoint and take up residence within a network to steal as much data as it can over a long period of time apts are threat actors so they're not software they're actually people behind them that engineer specific malware uh engineered for a particular target apts are slow acting and stealthy and common targets for apts are tier one manufacturers defense contractors government agencies so how an ed edr is going to help you is it's going to do detection so behavioral analysis advanced uh detection techniques ioc scans for response it has automated response on discovery quick response during the investigation multiple response options and for investigation it has it has root cause attack visualizations uh enriched attack data very similar it seems very similar to an xdr but the edrs are focused all around endpoints and xdrs are a lot more broader so um you know edr's just do a better job with endpoints okay but you can use both hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at cloud access security brokers also known as casb and this system sits between the cloud user and the cloud application and monitors all activity enforces security policies so on the left hand side you'd have your remote workforce maybe they're working from home maybe they're on the job like at a a remote location then you have your corporate office so this is where everyone would be in a very controlled environment but all that traffic is going to pass through the casb and the idea here is you'll get control of monitoring compliance management data security and threat protection for your cloud services whether it's software as a service platform as a service or infrastructure as a service so some of the features to help you think about what csb can do for you uh is it has monitoring user activity warning administrators about potential hazardous actions enforcing security policy compliance automatically preventing malware restricts unauthorized access identify account takeovers uncovers shadow cloud i.t or just shadow i.t is an easy way to say it cloud data loss prevention internal external data access controls records an audit trail of risky behavior cloud phishing malware threats and continuous monitoring of new cloud threats now i would say that if i had to highlight any of them out of here and i really should have put this in red here is i would say uncover shadow i t and if that doesn't make sense don't worry we explain it later hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are exploring the concept of security posture and in order to do that we're just going to have to set up some additional terms here this one is very term loaded so get ready for this the first one here is malicious actors also known as threat actors or attackers i like to call them malicious actors it is a person machine or entity of an event or incident that impacts or has the potential to impact the safety or security of another entity this is the bad person okay inventory so uptodate lists of uh assets software and hardware for your organization that can be accompanied with additional metadata there's a different kinds of assets in our inventory so we have perimeter assets assets exposed to the internet so public facing core assets assets within your private network private facing when we say attack vector this is the method of a malicious attack uses that they use to breach or infiltrate a network they could target infrastructure or a human for weakness and a lot of the cases we're seeing more human engineered attack vectors than going directly for infrastructure the attack surface is the sum of the attack factors the larger the inventory generally increases the amount of attack vectors the larger the attack surface the more difficult it is to mitigate attacks then you have security controls you'll hear this word security controls over and over again in this course controls are safeguards or counter measures to avoid detect counteract or minimize security risks and then we can answer what a security posture is so a formula to determine the overall effectiveness of a company's security overall defense we're talking about azure they call it a security score and it's basically a number and then you can go drill down and look at the security controls and the security controls can map out to your inventory so this is how you kind of see they're all tied together if we wanted to kind of describe how you would evaluate or assess the security posture uh here i got a little quick list here so we collect information by asking common questions so it could be what data do we collect how and where are we storing this data how do we protect uh we protect and document the data how long do we keep the data who has access to the internally external data is the place we are storing the data properly secured wipe that out there that's a bit of a mess um security ratings aka security scores so data driven objective and dynamic measurements of an organization security posture created by a trusted independent security rating platform so that is security posture and we'll definitely see it mentioned about like three times in this course okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at cloud security posture management also known as cspm and this identifies and remediates risks through security assessments and automated compliance and monitoring to give a kind of a visual for what this thing does so you have the cspm in the middle around it you got automation life cycle governance and brokerage and extending that a little bit further you got provisioning orchestration cost management resource optimization cloud migration backup disaster recovery identity security compliance uh packaging and delivery monitoring analytics inventory and classification and service requests so to reiterate you know a cspm assesses your system it automatically alerts security staff in your it departments when a vulnerability is found and so some security tools we can expect to see in here is zero trust based access controls realtime risk scoring threat and vulnerability management that is a very uh very useful cases of the tvms discover uh sharing risks technical policy threat modeling system and architecture teams that would use a ces pm would be your threat intelligence team your information technology your compliance and risk management teams your business leaders your smes uh your security architecture and operations and your audit team okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at just in time and just enough privileges these two terms come up a lot in microsoft and azure documentation but they don't fully explain them to you so i'm taking the time up front here so that you know it when you see the initialism so just in time also known as jit is giving access to resources only during the time when needed reducing the surface attack uh based on the range of time access so someone only needs something for two minutes uh give it to them and take it away right so and and give them access to things near the time that they need it so if they're not gonna use it from an hour from now don't give them give it to them so there's an hour window give it to them exactly when they're using it and when they're and take it away when they exactly aren't using it then you have just enough privilege so known as jep so giving access to only the specific actions reducing the surface attack by providing the least privileged principles this is pretty much uh the principle of least privilege which is another initialism i'm sure we'll see in the course but for some reason they call it this here but these are the two things you'll see throughout microsoft and azure documentation hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at ingress egress so very outdated but very clear graphic of how these two things work so ingress is traffic that's entering a network boundary and anger or egress is traffic exiting a network boundary and you're if you're wondering where these terms came from they're latin so ingressus and i don't i don't speak latin so i'm not pronouncing it properly and there's some variations on how to pronounce latin so who knows but ingress would mean to advance walk walking or an entry whereas egress is the opposite is it's to leave okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at the concept of shadow i.t which is a business agility process where departments can purchase and provision their own i.t resources without the approval of the organization's centralized i.t department so the advantage of shadow i.t systems allows organization to innovate and quickly prototype future solutions but the disadvantage of shadow i.t systems increase risk with organizational requirements for security controls compatibility with compliance programs loss of data or unexpected data exposure documentation reliability so uh you know you get great agility but then you need additional security services which we talked about earlier to make sure that there's no abuse of these shadow it systems hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at automation investigation and remediation so investigation is when you're gathering evidence from a digital system to uncover malicious intent or reduction in a security posture remediation is the action of remedying a as something to prevent or revert a disaster the act of changing a resource back to the desired state or state that does not cause a problem so in the context of cloud security a cloud resource is being remediated to stay compliant with our expected security controls so prevention would be something like turning the virtual machine off if the port 22 was exposed reverting would be turning back on encryption if a disk encryption is disabled so to revert so to put it back in the previous state so for the systems here we have automated investigation this is a service that uses an inspection algorithm that triggers an alert which in turn creates an incident and then we have automated remediation a service which watches for types of incidents uh incidents and matches it with a remediation action so it could be something like shutting off a server and so air so it's just the combination of these two systems so automated investigation and automated remediation okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at threat analysis and this is the practice of mitigating possible threats via threat modeling and threat modeling is a structured process for identifying attackers and cataloging past possible threats and so there's a lot of different methodologies for this and some to point out would be stride which is developed by microsoft uh pasta or pasta yeah i think that's how you'd say it process of attack simulation and threat analysis it's a seven uh seven step riskcentric methodology you have trike which is an open source threat modeling process mal which stands for mel meta attack language a domain specific language used for threat modeling and attack simulations uh and so you know that's that but we'll look at more detail here at stride okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at the stride methodology and so stride is for threat modeling as we just mentioned a moment ago and it can categorize different threats into the following so the first is spoofing so illegally accessing and then using another user's authentication information tampering some malicious modification of data repudiation so illegal operation in a system that lacks ability to trace the prohibited operation information disclosure so exposure of information to individuals who are not exposed to have access to it denial of service deny service to valid users and elevation of privileges unprivileged uh users gain privileged access so if you notice that spells stride all right so if we wanted to use stride we have the microsoft security development life cycle and it provides a tool to assist with this process and i believe they call it the microsoft threat modeling tool and it makes threat modeling easier for all developers through a standard notation for visualizing system components data flows and security boundaries all right so i wanted to actually show off the microsoft threat modeling tool so you get an idea what it can do so i typed in microsoft threat modeling tool and on the left hand side here there's a bunch of releases i actually didn't choose the latest one which i probably should have but if you scroll on down you'll see this thing that says microsoft threat modeling tool and i've opened it up and it looks like this and so they have an example model if we open it up we can see what we have here so basically it's a stenciling tool of generic things and so i mean you don't have to use this you could use something like lucidcharts or something else to do threat modeling but it's nice that this is a free program and it literally was like four megabytes to install if we wanted to see kind of an example that is more particular to azure we have threat model templates here and so um you can see that there are stencils for these particular resources so i guess the idea is that you know we might not have those stencils those azure stencils and so this one i guess adds it to the service so if we expand here we can see some threat modeling for um azure and so you know you have your your boundaries for your corporate net and then if we scroll on over we have our azure trust boundary and then our resource group trust boundary and you can see kind of where information flows between different services so like azure events data factory things like that so you know hopefully that gives you a visual idea what um threat modeling is uh but there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at intrusion detection and protection and so we have two systems here rolled into one so the first is ids intrusion detection system it monitors a network or system for malicious activity or policy violations and the idea is that uh once it detects something it's going to create an incident and so that you can go through an itemized list to take action then you have an ips so intrusion protection system this restricts or reacts to the the detected malicious activity taking action doing something about it if you roll these two into one you get an ids ips and this is how they are often offered in the market you're really going to see these things separated out as separate offerings okay if you're figuring out okay well how does an ids actually detect incidences it has three ways of doing it the first is signaturebased detection this is a simple technique where it uses a signature and a signature is a set of rules that an ids and an ips uses detect typical intrusion activity it compares signatures against observed events to identify possible incidents then you have anomalybased detection this is a more advanced technique and so it compares definitions of what is considered normal activity with observed events in order to identify significant deviations then you have stateful protocol analysis this is a profile technique it compares to predetermined profiles or generally accepted definitions of benign protocol activity for each protocol state against observed events in order to identify deviations no matter which one you're using whatever your provider is you want to turn this stuff on immediately because an ips ids is only useful if you have a baseline a a look at what normal activity looks like within your network so you cannot turn this stuff on late in the game you got to turn it on on day one okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at the mitre attack framework so first of all what is mitre it is a notforprofit organization supporting various us government agencies in the aviation defense healthcare homeland security and cyber security fields and then we have the mitre attack framework and this is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on realworld observations look down below you can see there's a lot of stuff in here if you're thinking about this knowledge base you might say well what is the purpose of it but it's used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector government and cyber security product and service community it has a website it's easy to view you just go to attack.miter.org and i think it's really great because if you look around it gives you kind of an idea of things that you have to be thinking about okay okay so i wanted to get you some exposure to the attack.miter.org just because i know you saw a screenshot but always helps to take a quicker look here if we scroll on down below we have categories across the top that are interested so maybe you're interested in privileged escalation but you know we can drill down here and say okay well what in particular are we interested in so let's say we want to look at exploitation of privileged escalation they have a full description on here and procedure examples of things that you can do so there is a lot of stuff in here okay so uh you know if you're wondering uh what it is that you need to do oh it just keeps on going you really drill down here and and read a lot of stuff but this really really does help you get a a full idea of the type of attacks that can happen on your system so definitely if you have more time check it out hey this is angie brown from exam pro we're going to look at the six microsoft privacy principles so the first being control which is we will put you in control of your privacy with easeofuse tools and clear choices second being transparency we'll be transparent about the data collection and and we use so you can make informed decisions number three we will protect the data you entrust uh to us through strong security encryption number four strong legal protection so we will respect your local privacy laws and fight for legal protection for your privacy as a fundamental human right number five no content based targeting so we will not use your email chat files or personal uh content to target ads that you uh have a hard time believing that fifth one but hey they say they don't do it number six benefits to you so we will uh when we do collect data we will use it to benefit you and make sure your experiences to make your experiences better so it's kind of funny because like it seems like number six could contradict number five but you know if they saw it as a benefit to you but yeah that's the microsoft privacy principle hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at microsoft privacy not to be confused with microsoft privacy principles and the reason why there's privacy again here it's just because microsoft is a big organization and sometimes they have marketing efforts that overlap or conflict and it gets kind of confusing which is which and that's just microsoft being microsoft for you but we're going to go through it anyway because regardless of which one is more important i think it's just good to get good coverage here and it's explained in a slightly different way so helps you understand how these providers think uh you know about your data so starting at the top here we have control your data so you your data belongs to you you can access modify or delete it at any time you're in control of your data it's reinforced by microsoft compliance so gdpr iso 2718 they have independent audit reports data processing only with consent neither shared or mined for market research and advertising subcon subcontractors data restrictions so aka sub processors can perform only the function that microsoft has hired them to provide and they are bound by the same contractual privacy commitments that microsoft makes to you for controlled data location you choose where your data is located so choice of data center data residency residency meaning like the boundaries of a country or a geographic boundary we're talking about securing your data so data at rest they use a aes 256 encryption dating transit ssl and tls encryption keys you have azure key vault for defending your data responding to data requests they will not disclose data to a government or a law enforcement agency unless required by law law enforcement requests so direct the requesting party to seek the data directly from the customer so they're not doing it uh on your behalf okay uh our they have contact contractual commitments so using the courts to challenge governments demands that are inconsistent with the rule of law so they're always fighting on your side they have gdr compliance so disclose their data in response to a government request in violation of uh eu's gdpr disclose their data in response so gdpr compliance that could have been worded better i'm taking it from their content by the way but gdpr is is like if you're a european citizen you can say hey i don't want you to hold on to my data so show me what you have about me and also can you uh delete it okay and that's what that is there hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at primary security perimeter this is a super important concept and has a lot to do with identity and azure id so pay close attention here so what is security perimeter so barriers are built fortifications to either keep intruders out or to keep captives contained within the area the boundary surrounds so when we're talking about a data center we're talking about the physical fence as the security perimeter that's just one mechanism of security perimeter for cloud network we're talking about protocol software hardware as the security perimeter so what is an entry point this is the point of entry to cross a security perimeter and then we have access controls and these are the security mechanisms at the point of access that allow or denies access when we're talking about permission to access a resource this is called authorization and so what is a primary security perimeter so traditional security focused on firewalls vpn since there were fewer employees or workstations outside the office but now that we have bring your own devices remote workstations it is much more common now to access controls via a zero trust model i really should have highlighted that in yellow or red like that support very important and uh zero trust models are being adopted so we see mfa and we see a shift towards user identity management becoming the primary security primary perimeter for security so the primary security perimeter is user identity management and so when we're talking about azure it's going to be azure active directory because this is the most common tool okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're taking a look here at ipd's so identity providers is a system entity that creates uh maintains and manages identity for information four principles and also provides authentication services to applications within a federation or distributed network a trusted provider or of uh your user identity that lets you use authentication to access other services is another way to put it so an ipd could be something like facebook amazon google twitter github linkedin if you've ever used some service that said log in with your facebook account or google account that's what an ipd is so federated identity is a method of linking a user's identity across multiple separate identity management systems so a federation is just a collection of identities uh we have a few different technologies that are involved with ipds so the first is open id this is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol so this allows you to log in with different social media platforms such as google or facebook open id is about providing who you are auth 2.0 or oauth 2.0 is an industry standard protocol for authorization of oauth doesn't share your password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between the consumer and service provider and so oauth is about granting access to functionality so you can use open id and oauth 2.0 together the last is saml security assertion mark markup language it's an open standard for exchanging authentication authorization between identity providers and service provider uh it's a use case for saml which is single signon with web browser whenever using azure id and you want to connect a web app you're going to be looking at using saml okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and this is our introduction into azu of active directory also known as azure ad and it's microsoft's cloudbased identity and access management service which helps your employees sign in and access resources it's going to help us both externally and with internal resources so on the external side we're looking at microsoft 365 the azure portal sas applications and for internal resources so those are apps that reside within your internal network uh access to workstations uh that may reside on premise uh and one of the best features of azure ad is single signon that's what a lot of companies want it for uh in terms of uh the types of azure active directory there are it's broken down to four editions with each uh subsequent tier having all the features of the previous tier and so we have the free tier where you get multifactor authentication single signon basic security usage reports user management you have office 365 apps so that will give you company branding sla to sync between onpremise and cloud and the last two which i want you to notice and take note of because we do mention a lot of the features in this course for these two tiers it's premium one and premium two als commonly abbreviated to p1 and p2 so you have hybrid architecture advanced group access conditional access and for premium two you have identity protection identity governance so again as we move up the tier each of the previous tier has all the features of the prior one so premium one has uh or so premium two has all the features of premium one in terms of uh the use case for azure id it's for uh authorizing and authenticating to multiple sources so whether it's onpremise your active directory to your web app uh to allow for identity like using identity providers or to connect to microsoft 365 or microsoft azure azure id takes care of all this stuff and so when we're looking at hybrid connections we're talking about azure ad connect when we're looking at integrating our applications that is through app registrations where we have uh the b2c service and we'll talk about that in greater detail then you have external identities so that's going to be for your ipds uh and then you can also uh easily integrate with cloud applications there's no particular service like sub service for that it's just azure id naturally does that okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are comparing active directory versus azure active directory because they're not the same thing so active directory has been around for quite a long time it's been around since windows 2000 and it was first introduced as active directory domain services to give organizations the ability to manage multiple onpremise infrastructure components and systems using a single identity per user and so azure ad takes this approach to the next level by providing organizations with an identity as a service so an ida solution for their apps across cloud and onpremise so both are still used today so there's active directory which is used for onpremise and there's azure ad which is the cloud version and so we see a lot of companies might want to migrate over to azure id or they might have a particular legacy licensing that makes it more cost effective or there might be certain security compliances where that's why they're not using azure id so both of these are still valid products just different use cases okay let's take a closer look here at azure ad for app registration so app registrations allow developers to integrate web applications to use azure id to authenticate users and request access to user resources such as email calendar and documents and this allows you to implement single signon into your web applications the way you access it is you just go to your azure id and there's a section under there called app registrations we're definitely going to cover a little bit more about app registrations when we talk about azure 80 b2c because that is the actual way of uh doing authentication and we'll cover more about app registration there but just a quick introduction here okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're taking a look here at azure id external identities and the idea here is that it allows people outside your organization to access your apps and resources while letting them sign in using whatever identity they prefer so whether it's your partners distributors suppliers vendors or other guest users you can bring your own identities so it supports logins like google and facebook there's so many more and i'll show you in a moment but the idea here is you can share your apps with external users develop apps intended for azure ad tenants develop white label apps for consumers and customers and there's two identity external identities so there's b2b and b2c so bw is when you're working with another organization and they probably have their own azure ad or their own identity service that they want to connect to your app or services and b2c is when you're dealing with customers they're not part of an identity service they're just individuals okay and so when we're talking about uh ipd support so identity providers it's a big old list here so you got adfs amazon apple azure id single tenant multitenant uh to b2c ebay facebook generic identity providers github id dot me google linkedin microsoft account qq salesforce salesforce sample protocol twitter wechat and weeboo and this is pretty darn thorough because when you look at amazon cognito which is aws is offering does not have linkedin does not have twitter does not have github i mean one of these might be able to be possible but it's very hard to implement on theirs and so this is where i feel that azure adb to c has a competitive advantage maybe not as great as uh okta uh which is a third party but i think that azure 80 b2c beats them on price for sure and meets most use cases if we're going to just do a quick comparison between the b2b and b2c offering just to really solidify the difference we break it down into scenario intended uh ipd support etc etc so let's just go through here and see what the difference is so looking at the scenario collaboration using microsoft applications this one is an i am for modern sas or custom developed applications for intended use cases uh collaborating with business partners for from external organizations and this is customers of your product for uh identity support you have work accounts school accounts any email address saml wsfed based identity providers gmail facebook and for a b2c you have local applications social identities users with corporate and gov identities et cetera b2c i believe it's more expensive between the two external user management managed in the same directory as employees and then for b2c managed separately from the organization employees and partner directories for sso uh azure the connected app is supported and for uh sso on b2c it's customer owned apps with azure adb 2c tenants is supported for policy and compliance managed by the host inviting organization and for b2c it's managed by the organizations via conditional access identity protection for branding the host inviting organization brand is used and for b2c it's fully customized branding per application or organization for billing models they're both based on monthly active users so m a use and there you go let's take a look here at service principles for azure id and this is a security identity used by applications or services to access specific azure resources so a service principle is created when a user from the tenant has consented to the applications or api use and so what you do is you go over to app registrations uh to be able to set up a service principle so this defines who can access the application and what resources the application can access so down below you can see we have a few different options here so whether it's the organizational directory from the current company or a different one or whether you're allowed to use a personal account so a service principle is created in each tenant where the application is used and references the global unique application object so after you've registered your application you're going to have an object id and an application id that's what i was talking about earlier when i said about application registration we come back to it well this is the part where we're seeing how that works so the application id represents the global applications across all tenants and the object id is a unique value for an application object so there you go so manage identities within azure id are used to manage the credentials for authenticating a cloud application with an azure service so using a managed identity you can authenticate to any service that supports azure id authentication without having credentials in your code that is why we want managed identities remember that there are two types of managed identities system assigns so an identity in an azure id tied to a life cycle for a service instance when the resource is deleted so is the system assigned to the manage identity for user assigned it's an identity assigned to one or more instance of services the identity is managed separately from the resource when a resource is deleted the identity remains i want to drill this in so let's do a quick table here between systems and user assigns so for creation created as part of the azure resource for user assign created as a standalone azure resource for life cycle shared life cycle with the azure resource for user assigned the independent it has an independent life cycle for deletion when you delete the resource so does the identity go with it for user assign it must be explicitly deleted for sharing across azure resources cannot be shared associated with a single azure resource for users assigned can be shared can be associated with more than one azure resource okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at device management for azure id so let's just define what device identity management is it is the management of physical devices such as phones tablets laptops desktops computers that are granted access to company resources such as printers and cloud resources via devicebased conditional access so here's what it would look like if you opened up device manager and you had connected some devices notice on the lefthand side we got ourselves um a whoops i use the highlight tool i want the pen tool but we have some desktops and laptops we could have phones in here as well and there are different types of join types which we'll talk about here in a moment and you can apply mdm and we'll talk about mdm and mam in the upcoming slides but for companies with a distributed workforce that allows remote employees and who are allowed to use their own personal equipment this is what we call bring your own device so you should know byod a company needs a way to protect their organization's assets such as access to cloud resources across the devices where they have less control over the physical securities of the work environment so device management this stuff really ties back to the zero truss model that we talked about all the way at the start of this course um and this really illustrates how the identity is really your your uh the first security perimeter okay for uh getting devices into device management there are three different ways we have azure id registered so this is where you have personally owned or mobile devices you're signed in with a personal microsoft or local account and you'd be using things like windows 10 ios android mac os for azure ad joined it's owned by an organization signed in with an azure id account belong to the organization they exist only in the cloud and you look at windows 10 windows server 2019 for hybrid azure ad joined it's owned by an organization uh you are signed in with azure director active directory not azure sorry active directory domain services accounts belonging to the organization and they exist in the cloud or onpremise you're looking at windows 7 8.110 windows server 2008 or newer they're not going to ask you about all these details in the exam but you should know broadly these three categories and that uh you know the hybrids for hybrid azure id join is for um uh is cloud only for organizations and this one top one here is for personal okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at mdm and mam so mobile device management allows you to control the entire device wipe data from it and also reset it to factory settings where mobile application management allows you to publish push configure secure monitor and update mobile apps for your users and both of these features are found under your azure ad so there you would add an application such as microsoft intune and that's what you'd be using to get mdm and mam features uh microsoft intune uh has to be to get access to it you have to upgrade to azure ad premium two and microsoft intune is now part of microsoft endpoint manager used to be a standalone service but now it's part of this and microsoft endpoint manager and intune are part of the microsoft enterprise mobility security uh ems it's just like a suite of services that work together so i know it's a bit confusing but in tune is is part of endpoint manager which is part of ems okay so windows hello gives windows 10 users an alternative way to log into their devices and application using fingerprint iris scan facial recognition so these are biometrics an authentication type with windows hello would include microsoft account active directory account azure ad identity provider services or something like 502 which is a security key so i think ubiki windows hello pin is backed by a trusted platform module tpm chip it has multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper resistant the windows hello pin is more secure than a standard pin because it is tied to a specific device so the pin is for that device and only for that device okay there's two offerings here we have windows hello windows hello for business there's a lot more details here but i'm just going to give you the the the main difference so windows hello is for individual consumers and windows solo for business is for business uh windows hello uses a pin backed by hashing where windows hello uses a pin backed by an asymmetric public and private key or certificatebased authentication if you're a member or primer you know that a public and private key is just a lot more secure with windows hello for business you can also use group policies so gpo and mdm okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're taking a look here at azure 80 connect which is a hybrid service to connect your onpremise active directory to your azure account azure 80 connect allows for seamless single signon from your onpremise workstation to microsoft azure and it allows you to connect in the in the following ways so we have password hash synchronization which is a sign in method that synchronizes the hash of users on premise 80 password azure id password through authentication this is a signin method that allows users to use the same password on premise and in the cloud federation integration this is a hybrid environment using onpremise adfs infrastructure for certificate renewal these three are the authentication types okay so you want to remember those three some additional features we should cover the synchronization so responsible for creating users groups other objects ensures onprem and cloud data matches and health monitoring robust monitoring and provides a central location in the azure portal to view activity this last one is called azure 80 connect health okay let's take a look here at selfservice password reset also known as sspr this allows users to change or reset their password without the help of an administrator free up your help desk support requests add an additional layer of security and keep users more productive so selfservice password scenarios include password change so when a user knows their password but wants to change it to something new password reset when a user can't sign in such as when they forget the password and want to reset account unlock when a user can't sign in because their account is locked out so authentication methods for ssrp would be like mobile app notifications mobile app codes email mobile phones office phones and security questions okay let's take a look at a feature called azure ad password protection and to understand this we need to know the concept of password spraying and this is a type of brute force dictionary attack uh and uh the idea here is that identity systems mitigate traditional brute force attacks by having lockout and after a lockout would be after a certain amount of attempts the user is locked out and has to wait a short period of time before they can try their password again you've seen this like five attempts and then you're locked out for like 30 minutes so password spraying circumvents lockout by spraying the same password across multiple accounts before trying another password while the lockout time cools down or resets and so azure id password protection is a feature of azure id to protect your passwords from identity tax such as password spray attacks okay the uh the mechanisms here is we have global uh global band password list so this is a password list with known weak passwords that is automatically updated and enforced by microsoft you don't have to do anything you just get that uh as you use the service then you have a custom banned password list this is where you're going to provide a custom list of passwords that are more specific to your business security needs to get banned passwords lists you need azure ad one or two for hybrid security azure id password protection can be integrated to onpremise active directory environments okay so here's just a quick list of azure identity management best practices it's nothing super fun here just a very simple list but it's good for us to go through it so we have where we keep these things in mind so azure identity management access control security best practices starting with treat identity as the primary security perimeter this all comes back to zero trust policies right a centralized identity management manage connected tenants enable single signon turn on conditional access plan for routine security improvements enable password management enable multifactor verification for users use rolebased access controls lower exposure of privileged accounts control locations when resources are located are located and use azure ad for storage authentication so there you go let's talk about the concept of emergency access or break glass so emergency access accounts prevent admins from being accidentally locked out of their azure ad account okay so you might have seen these kind of devices before think of like if there's a fire and there's ax behind it you break the glass so there's a key these are just in the case of emergencies that you can get access so you can mitigate the impact of accidental accidental lack of administrative access by creating two or more emergency access accounts in your organization so emergency access accounts are highly privileged and they are not assigned to a specific individuals they are limited to emergency or break glass scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used recommended to maintain a maintained goal of restricting emergency accounts used to only the times when it's absolutely necessary so these accounts should be cloud only accounts that use the onmicrosoft.com domain not federated or synchronized from an onpremise environment exclude at least one account from a phonebased multifactor authentication exclude one account from a conditional access policies store these account credentials safely and monitor sign in and audit logs all right so azure active directory using mfa allows multiple authentication methods some of them is sms so that's where you have a text message and that's how you get your pin a voice call that has a synthesized voice that speaks your pin we have the microsoft authenticator app where you can use the app and press a button so you can do passwordless login and you have hardware tokens so this is where you touch your security key and authorize it by generating it and it will automatically generate and enter a pin for you so we'll just kind of dive a little bit deeper into these methods okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a quick look here at microsoft authenticator so this is a web application or sorry a mobile application you can download for either your ios or android phone it allows for secure signins for all your online accounts using multifactor authentication passwordless authentication password autofill and it's both available in the apple app store and google play store okay okay so i made my way over to the google play store because i just want to give you a a closer look at this service it's not complicated but if you click into here you can kind of see uh what it allows you to do so here we have a new signin request for your microsoft account so you would just say approve or deny so this is an example of password list right you don't have to put in a password to do the mfa um you can see when there are new signins on your phone it will autofill passwords in so here it's doing for linkedin you can see you can manage uh multiple accounts and it has those um you know those the general mfa codes there it can connect to multiple services so you have your outlook your onedrive and office 65 in general or microsoft 365 so you know nothing too complicated but you should give it an install and go because it's pretty good hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're taking a look here at the concept of biometrics so biometrics are body measurements and calculations related to the human characteristics and biometric authentication or realistic authentication is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control so we have different kinds of characteristics there's physiological which we'll go through quickly here so like a fingerprint pawn veins face recognition dna palm print uh hand geometry iris recognition retina or odor or scent that last one sounds very interesting i've never heard of a system that can do that but it's on the list here behavioral characteristics so this would be like typing rhythm gait keystrokes signature behavioral profiling and voice so there you go so fido is a fast identity online alliance it's an open industry association whose mission is to develop and promote authentication standards that help reduce the world's over reliance on passwords so fido alliance has published three sets of open specifications for simpler stronger user authentication the first being universal second factor so u2f universal authentication framework so uaf client to authentication protocol so ctap and ctap is complementary to the w3c web authentication so web auth n and together those are known as fido 2. so the reason we're talking about fido 2 is this always comes down to security keys so a security key is a secondary device used as a second step in authentication process to gain access to a device workstation or application a security key can resemble a memory stick when your finger makes contact with a button or exposed metal on the device it will generate an auto filler security token a popular brand of security keys is the ub key it works out of the box with gmail facebook and hundreds more supports 502 auth and u2f and you just noticed we talked about all those things this particular device is waterproof and crest resistant works with usba nfc dual connectors on a single key it's going to vary based on the key you get they all have different features but this is a good baseline to understand security keys let's take a look here at open authentication also known as oath and i want you to know this is not to be confused with oauth very similar in names but not the same thing so oath is an open standard that specifies how timebased onetime passwords so totps codes are generated so timebased onetime passwords is a computer algorithm that generates a onetime password to otp which uses the current time as a source of uniqueness so uh oath totp is implemented using either software or hardware to generate code so for a software oath would be generated for something from like authenticator and hardware oath would be generated from a security key so this is an example actually in microsoft authenticator so just taking up my pen tool here this is the code you've you've seen these before so it's like three nine three eight one three there's a little wheel it spins and then it will reset the time here's more of a physical device i imagine that this is kind of the precursor to uh ubiki's or mobile apps the idea is that you'd have a physical device and it would count down it would change the times here okay so that's pretty much it password list authentication is a less frustrating authentication method than mfa and password list authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and replaced with something you have plus something you are or something you know so something you have could be windows 10 device phone security key something you are could be a biometric a biometric such as a fingerprint something you know could be a pin so or a password right so solutions for i guess not a password just be a pin but solutions for a password list authentication include windows hello for business the microsoft authenticator app 502 security key so just looking here we have kind of a four corners here inconvenient high security convenient low security so we put passwords on here generally they're very convenient everyone's used to using passwords however they don't have the highest amount of security from these other options sure you can make a very strong password but these other options are just passwordless authentication is a lot more powerful when you're using ufa or twofactor authentication multifactor authentication it's highly secure but the issue with this is that it can be kind of a pain to pull out your phone to get that otp that onetime password in order to complete that second step so password authentic passwordless authentication is both highly secure and convenient okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at azure ad conditional access which provides an extra layer of security before allowing authenticated users to access data or other assets so conditional access is implemented through conditional access policies and conditional access policy analyzes signals so signal could be user location device application realtime risk we'll talk about that in the next slide all the types of signals there are and the idea is you need to verify every access attempt via access control so you might have require mfa block or allow so just a visual here i got this graphic from the microsoft documentation the idea is you have your signal so user location application realtime risk devices and here we have our verification steps right to get access to our apps and data so let's take a quick or a a closer look at signals so signals is metadata associated with an identity attempting to gain access and so some examples or actually i guess the full list of signals that are possible conditional access starting with users or group memberships so policies target specific users and groups including admin roles giving admins fine grain control over access then you can have signals that are named location or ip location information so that's a range of ips used when making policy decisions so admins can opt to block or allow traffic from an entire country ip range as an example for devices users with devices of specific platforms are marked with a specific state can be used for applications users attempting to access specific applications can trigger different conditional access policies realtime realtime signin risk detection so signals integration with azure ad identity protection allows conditional access policies to identify risk signin behavior and policies can then force users to perform password changes mfa authentication to reduce the risk level or block or they're blocked from access until administrator takes manual action then you're do you have your cloud apps or cloud actions so cloud apps or actions can include or exclude cloud applications or user actions that will be subject to policy then there's user risk so from customers with access to identity protection user risk can be evaluated as part of conditional access policy user user risk represents the probability that a given identity or account is compromised user risk can be configured for high medium or low probability let's talk about common decisions so these define the access control that define what level of access based on the signal information and so this is when we were talking about you said that verifying steps these are those common decisions so we have block access so most restrictive decision then you have grant access and so this is the least restrictive decision but still requires one or more of the following options so require mfa require device to be marked as compliant require hybrid azure 80 join device require approved client app require app uh protection policy okay so there you go let's take a look here at azure 80 roles and these are used to manage azure ad resources in a directory such as create or edit users assign administrative roles to others reset user passwords manage user licenses manage domains so if you're an azure id you'd see roles and administrators on the righthand side and they have a bunch of prebuilt roles of course you can make your custom ones but a few ones that you should absolutely know is the global administrator this gives you full access to everything the user administrator this gives you full access to create and manage users the billing administrator which makes purchases manage descriptions to support tickets and you can create custom custom roles but you're going to need azure p1 or p2 okay let's take a look here at azure role based access controls or rbac so the idea here is that you have a security principle that represents identities requesting access to azure resources so that could be a user who has an individual profile in azure id a group of users uh created an azure id a service principle and this is a security identity used by applications or services to access specific azure resources or manage identity an identity in azure id that is automatically managed by azure so another thing that we that matters when we're talking about rolebased action controls is we have to determine the scope and so the scope is a set of resources that access for the role assignment applies to so scope access controls of the management subscription or group level right so you can apply it at this level a description level or the resource group level um just so you know okay the role definition is a collection of permissions a role definition lists the operations that can be performed such as read write and delete roles can be high level like owner specific like virtual machine reader and azure has builtin roles and you can define your own custom roles so the ones they have built in is owner contributor reader user admin access and these are the four fundamental builtin builtin roles that azure has so identity governance for azure id allows you to balance your organizational security versus employee productivity and that ensures the right people have the right access to the right resources so azure id and enterprise mobility plus security features allow you to mitigate asset access risks by protecting monitoring and auditing access to critical assets so identity governance gives organization the ability to do the following govern the identity life cycle govern the access life cycle secure privileges access for administration identity governance addresses these four questions so which users should have access to which resources what are those users doing with that access are there effective organizational controls for managing the access can auditors verify the controls uh that the the controls are working all right so human capital management also known as hcm is the practice of managing people as resources within an organization so an hcm system is an application that provides administrative and strategic support around human resources so for admins that's payroll benefits employee selfservice portals for strategic we're talking about workflows workforce planning competency management performance management time and expense management education training recruitment onboarding organizational visualizations and so some hcm systems out there would be um success factors from us from sas the sas hcm for some reason they they had original service and then i guess they have a newer version of the service uh workday oracle ebusiness suite oracle peoplesoft same thing we're seeing with uh sap where they have two sage people and i don't know how to pronounce it we'll say uzio so giving a little bit more attention to the different types of life cycles and identity governance we're first going to look at um identify identity life cycle management and this is the foundation of identity governance the goal is to achieve a balance between productivity and security so here we can kind of see an identity where they have no access they get their first job their second job and then they retire so productivity how quickly can a person have access to resources they need such as when they join my organization security how should their access change over time such as due to changes to the person's employment status so azure ad premium automatically maintains user identities for people represented in something like workday or sap success factors in both active directory and azure active directory azure id azure ad premium also includes microsoft identity manager so you can import records from onpremise hcm systems such as sap hcm oracle ebusiness or oracle peoplesoft azure adb2b collaboration enables you to securely share your organization's applications and services with guest users and external partners from an organization while maintaining control over your corporate data so azure ad entitlement management enables you to select which organizations users are allowed to request access and to be added to b2b guests to your organization directory ensure these guests are removed when they're no longer they no longer need access okay now we looked at identity lifecycle now let's take a look here at access lifecycle so access lifecycle is the process of managing user access throughout the life cycle of an organization so here uh you know before we saw that someone changed jobs well this one has uh context because they're accessing something like they have a contract so there's a particular set of things that they have to worry about so azure ad dynamic groups determine group membership based on user or device properties azure 80 access reviews enforce review or on a regular basis to make sure only the right people have continued access azure ad entitlement management enables you to define how users request access across packages of groups and team memberships application roles sharepoint online roles okay so we have one more life cycle here and this one is privileged access life cycle and it is the management of fine grade permissions over the life cycle of a user within an organization so here they might they might start as an admin then they get their first role their second roll and then they leave it so again these are they're also very similar but they're just a different scopes so azure ad privilege identity management so pim provides additional controls to securing access rights for resources across azure ad azure and other microsoft online services and so that's pretty much the only one that really is related to privileged access lifecycle okay so entitlement management is a feature of azure ad and is for identity governance feature that enables organizations to manage identity and access lifecycle at scale by automating access request workflows access assignments reviews and expiration so entitlement management is a feature of azure ad premium two it takes a and just to kind of give it a more simplified uh understanding what the service does you take a bunch of resources bundle them into an access package then apply it to internal or external users that for a specific range of time get just in time access so you accomplish this by creating a project catalog and access package so what is a project inside of entitlement entitlement management well it's a logical container for your catalog and access packages you have a catalog so resources are assigned to the project and resources could be things like groups and teams applications sharepoint sites talking about access packages here an access package is a bundle of all the resources with the access a user needs to work on a project or perform their task access packages are used to govern access for your internal employees and also users outside your organization access packages also include one or more policies a policy defines the rules or guard rails for assignments to access packages for access packages you can manage group memberships cloud app access and access rights sharepoint online sites organizational and technical roles so privileged identity management or pim is an azure ad service enabling you to manage control and monitor access to important resources in your organization you can manage resources from azure id azure 365 intune and more key features here is just in time privilege access to azure id and resources assign timebound access to resources using start and end dates require approval to activate privileged roles enforce mfa to activate any role use justice justification to understand why users activate get notifications when privileged rules are activated conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles download audit history for internal external audits so privilege identity management is a feature of azure 80 premium two but to get kind of an idea like i just pulled out a little screenshot of the interface there and so you can see you have requests and approval requests and review access so those are some of the things you're going to be doing in there okay so identity protection is a feature of azure id at the p2 level that you can use to detect investigate remediate export for future analysis identity based risks so microsoft analyzes 6.5 trillion signals per day to identify protect customers from threats so identity protection notices things like risky users risky signins and risky detections so here's an example i know the image is blurry but it was hard for me to procure an image for you but this example shows newly risky signins detected over a period of time and so then there might be these cards here that will show you um you know who are the high risk users the high resignins the identity score things like that okay let's take a more granular look to see what identity protection can actually detect so it can look for anonymous ip addresses so sign ins from anonymous ip addresses like a tor browser anomalizer vpns atypical travel so sign in from a atypical location based on the user's recent sign ins malware to ip addresses so sign in from a malware linked ip address unfamiliar sign in properties to sign in with properties we've not recently seen for a given user leak credentials site indicates that the user's valid credentials have may have been leaked password spray so multiple user names being attacked using common passwords in a unified brute force manner azure ad threat intelligence so microsoft internal external threat intelligence sources that have identified a known attack pattern so maybe new countries so this detection is discovered by microsoft cloud app security activity from anonymous ip addresses so the detection is discovered by the microsoft cloud app security so mcas suspicious inbox forwarding so this detection is discovered by microsoft cloud app security so mcas and the wrist signals can trigger remediation efforts such as requiring users to use azure 80 multifactor authentication reset their password using selfservice password reset so that's ss pr or blocking or blocking them until an administrator takes action let's take a look here at investigation for identity protection so identity protection categorized risks into three tiers low medium and high so key reports that the admins use for investigation and identity protection are risky users risky signins and risky detection so for risky users those are details about detections history of all risky signins risk history and then for risky risky signins we have which risk signins are classified at risks confirmed compromise confirmed sale dismissed or remediated we have realtime and aggregate risk levels with sign in attempts detection types triggered conditional access policies applied mfa details device apps location information and the last one here is risk detection so that contains filterable data for up to the past 90 days so we have information about each risk detection including the type other risk triggers at the same time sign in attempt location link out to more detail for mcas so admin followup actions reset the user password confirm user compromise dismiss user risk block user from signing in investigate further using azure atp so network security groups filter network traffic to and from the azure resource in a vnet and so an nsg is composed of many security rules and so here's an example of setting an inbound security rule and each security rule has the following properties so you can give it a unique name which is all the way at the bottom there uh you can set the source or destination so you're gonna set an ip address cider block service tag application group things like that then you set the port range so it could just be port 80 it could be all ports where it shows an asterisk it could be a range of ports you can set the protocol so you got tcp udp icmp you set the action whether it's allowed or denied and then you set the priority which is a number between 100 and 4096 and we have two types of security rules we got inbound rules which applies to traffic entering the nsg and outbound rules that apply to traffic leaving the nsg let's take a look at some of the default security rules that nsg sets for you so when you create an nsg you're going to have some created for you by default and that's going to be for outbound rules and inbound rules so for inbound rules uh you're going to be able to accept any virtual networks into your through the nsg uh it's going to allow azure load balancer to make its way in and it's going to deny everything else all right then for your outbound rules it's allowed to go to any other virtual network it's allowed to make its way out to the internet and then everything else is denied so there you go let's take a look here at the logic for security rules and there's a lot of logic here so we'll work our way through it unfortunately there's no fun way to visualize this so we just got to work through the text so you may not create two security rules with the same priority and direction you can have 5000 nsgs per subscription and 1 000 nsg's rules per nsg for priority rules are processed in priority order with lowest number uh processed before the higher number and network security groups uh rules are validated by priority using a five tuple information to allow or deny traffic based on source source ports destination destination ports and protocol honestly i don't know what they mean by that uh and i couldn't make any sense it's in the documentation so i'm just showing it to you here then there's flow records they don't exactly explain what they are but i assume the idea is that uh when a request throws uh flows through the nsg they're attaching additional information to it uh so the flow record allows a network security group to be stateful a flow record is created for existing connections uh communication is allowed or denied based on the connection state of the flow record and so let's talk about statefulness so if you specify an outbound security port you don't need to set the inbound port since it will be set for you you will need to specify an inbound security rule if the communication is initially externally initiated externally and the opposite is also true if inbound traffic is allowed over a port it's not necessary to specify an outbound security rule to respond to traffic over the port uh and the reason i know this when up when another port is set with another one that's when it's stateful if it didn't do that it then would be considered stateless but it's stateful let's talk about interruption so existing connections may not be interrupted when you remove a security rule that enabled the flow and traffic flows are interrupted when connections are stopped and no traffic is flowing in either direction for at least a few minutes so there's the rules uh a lot of stuff there honestly i won't even remember 90 of this stuff but i just wanted to go uh through it with you so there you go so the thing is is that when you have network security groups you can apply them at the subnet and or the nic and that's going to change how the rules work so let's look at these combination of scenarios so here we have the internet and let's set ourselves up with a virtual machine that has a nick but it has no network security group so what's going to happen in this case well when there is no nsg assigned to the subnet or nic then all traffic is allowed uh not something i recommend i think you should always have an nsg there uh but that's what's going to happen our next scenario here is that we have a virtual machine and then we have a neck and the network or the network security group is attached to that neck so when an nsg is assigned to the nick and no energy at the subnet then the rules are predictable based on the allow or deny rule so whatever you set your nsg is what you expect it to be then we have a scenario here where we have two virtual machines with their own nics and one has a security group and the other two uh you know the they have to pass through the security group that supplied the subnet level so let's look at the one the left first so the energy applied to a subnet applies to the rules and all the resources in that subnet and so basically on the left hand side it's going to just act like the the other one there where all the rules you have there are are normal but the last one is the interesting use case because if the first so the first thing is the the first nsg rules are evaluated at the subnet and then the rules in the nick are evaluated so the thing is is that if you want port 80 to be open you actually have to open it on both otherwise it's going to get stuck uh on the first one so if your subnet has port 80 closed and then your your nic has port 80 open it just can't reach it so they both have to be open so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at the azure network security group cheat sheet so nsgs filter network traffic to and from azure resources vnet an nsg is composed of many security rules you have a name a source and destination a port range and a protocol and an action a priority okay you have inbound rules which apply to traffic entering the nsg and then you have outbound rules applying to traffic leaving the nsg by default azure will set a bunch of inbound and outbound rules for you you may uh you may not create two security rules within the same priority and direction you can have 5 000 nsgs per subscription and 1 000 nsgs per rules per nsg that's a lot you have to be pretty big company run out of those rules are processed in priority order with lower numbers processed before higher numbers the flow record allows a network security group to be stateful if you specify an outbound security port you don't need to set the inbound port since it will be set for you the opposite is true if inbound traffic is allowed over a port it's not necessary to specify an outbound security rule to respond to the traffic over the port what i could not fit in this cheat sheet was the scenario where you have multiple nsgs based on whether they're on the nick or the virtual machine or etc there is graphics for that in the in the slides make sure you review those before you set your exam okay azure firewall is a managed cloudbased network security service that protects azure vnet's resources and it's a fully stateful firewall as a service so you're going to get built in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability and what you can do is essentially create enforce and log application network connectivity policies across subscription and virtual networks so azure firewall uses a static public ip address for your vnet resources allowing outside firewalls to identify or originating from your virtual network and the service is fully integrated with azure monitor for logging and analytics so here is a representation of azure firewall and so the idea is that you're going to launch an azure firewall into its own vnet and then other vnets and your onpremise or other things are going to pass through that central vnet onto wherever they want to go and the idea is that we're going to be able to do things like i utilize microsoft threat intelligence this is going to block known malicious ips and fqdns that it stands for fully qualified domain names and by default the traffic is uh set to deny but you can set connectivity policies to filter out traffic in a variety of ways to make sure that you are protected uh there so yeah that's all there is to it hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at ddos so this stands for distributed denial of service attack and it's a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic by flooding a website with large amounts of fake traffic so the idea is you have an attacker and a victim and the attacker is utilizing a remote machines and uh with a with some software that's going to generate out traffic uh directed towards your virtual machine over the cloud and the uh problem here is that what it's going to do is it's going to make your website unresponsive or just not work at all for the regular user but by having your compute within the azure network you're going to get free ddos protection and that's going to mitigate these attacks so let's talk about the types of ddos attacks that frequently happen the first is volumetric attacks so these are volumebased attacks that flood the network with legitimate looking traffic these will exhaust the available bandwidth and legitimate users cannot access the website these are measured in bits per second so bps then there are protocol attacks and these are exhausting server resources with false protocol requests that exploit weakness you're looking at udp and tcp flooding on the layer three and four measured in packages per second so psp then you have application layer attacks these are attacks that occur at the application layer uh that's between layer seven so you're looking at http floods sql injection crosssite scripting also known as xss parameter tampering solaris attacks here you're going to be wanting using a waff a web application firewall as a means of protection laughs are generally paired a lot a lot together with ddos services across the cloud service provider offerings okay so azure offers two tiers of ddos protection the first is uh the the basic tier this is free it's already turned on uh it's part of the global network and then you have the standard that starts at about two thousand nine hundred and uh about three thousand usd you get metrics alerts reporting ddos expert support application cost protections sla there's probably a difference in terms of the tier protection i cannot remember off the top my head but you know one will protect more likely against certain types of tax at like like three and four and the other one will do all all the layers three four and seven okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at azure bastion which is an intermediate hardened instance you can use to connect to your target server via ssh or rdp an easy way to think of it it's just a machine that sits between you and your server to give you an additional layer of security so it will provision a webbased rdp client or ssh terminal and some devices just cannot run the rdb client so this is where a google chromebook uh is really great fit for azure bastion because this will be the only way you'd be able to do it is through azure bastion so when you want to make an a bastion you'll have to create its own subnet with a very particular name but some of the key features here of bastion is rdp and ssh directly into azure portal remote session over tls and firewall transversal no public ip required on the azure vm no hassle managing nsgs protection against port scanning protection uh protection against zero day exploits hardening in one place only uh so yeah now if you want to connect to a windows server you would have to use rdp and you have to have the bastion in the same vnet you just enter your username and password as you normally would if you did rdp so rdp is remote desktop protocol and the idea is that you just log in and now it's like you're using a windows machine then you have ssh which is for linux and so the idea here is you'd have your ssh private key and password that you'd set when you create your vm and when you want to hit connect you just provide either your password or the private key and now you're in your server so that's as simple as ask your bastion is hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're going to take a look here at azure web application firewall so uh azure web application firewall also known as waf is a service that protects web application communication on the application layer that's layer seven by analyzing incoming http requests uh waff for cloud providers are generally attached to load balancers api gateways or cdns so here's kind of a visual um that i got from the docs but the idea is you have your your request it's gonna go into your application load balancer the waf is attached to the load bouncer it's going to decide whether it's allowed to go through or not uh so it's kind of a bit of a gatekeeper there okay so azure waff can be attached to the azure application gateway azure front a front door which is a cdn azure con content delivery network which is a different kind of cdn uh and so the idea here is that azure waff uses core rule sets crs by owasp to protect against common vulnerabilities if you've never heard of owasp they stand for open web application security project and basically it's an organization a nonprofit organization and they have all these resources on how to protect against different types of threats and they have basically this top ten a list of vulnerabilities so that's probably what they're using here um but anyway so a waff policy allows you to apply manage rules so the azure manage owasp rules and custom rules so there you go all right let's take a look here at the overview for azure encryption so we have three options here for encryption methods the first is azure storage service encryption also known as ssc and this protects data at rest by automatically encrypting before persisting it to the azure managed disks azure blob storage azure files azure queue storage it also is used to decrypt data on retrieval then you have azure disk encryption this encrypts windows and linux iaas virtual machine disks it can use bitlocker features on windows or dmcrypt on linux then you have transparent transparent data encryption tde which we'll talk about here in a moment all right so there are two available encryption options for azure managed disks the first is server side encryption ssc and azure disk encryption ade so for server side encryption it provides encryption at rest and safeguards your data to meet your organizational security compliance commitments it's enabled by default for all the managed snapshots and images except for temporary disks which are not encrypted by serverside encryption unless you enable encryption at the host level so keys can be managed uh two ways you have platform managed keys azure managers or keys or customer managed keys so you manage your keys then you have azure disk encryption ade this allows you to encrypt the os and data disks used by uh infrastructure as service vms so for windows you're going to be using bitlocker and for linux encryption you're going to be using dmcrypt so there you go so transparent data encryption also known as tde encrypts data rest for microsoft databases tde can be applied to sql server azure sql database azure synapse analytics and tde does realtime io encryption and decryption of data and log files encryption uses a database encryption key also known as a dek database boot record stores the key for availability during recovery the dek is a symmetric key so same cryptographic key uh for both the encryption or plain text cipher just an example there so you understand so the steps to apply to the database create the database master key create a certificate to support the tde create the database encryption key enable tde on the database so you just turn it on and there you go let's take a look here at azure key vault which helps you safeguard cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud apps and services so you have secrets management so store and tightly control access to tokens password certificates api keys and other secrets key management create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data certificate management easily provision manage and deploy public and private ssl certificates for use with azure and internal connected resources and hsms so secrets and keys can be protected either by software or a hardware one which would be fips 140 hyphen 2 level 2 validated hsm so when we're talking about hsm this is a hardware security module it's a piece of hardware designed to store encryption keys so there's one and they're really darn expensive you wouldn't want to buy one out right it's a lot better if you just kind of borrow one from the cloud and this all goes along with the federal information processing standard fips this is a us and government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information so hmn's hsms or multitenant are 142 hyphen compliant so the multiple customers virtually isolated on an hsm if you want a single tenant this is this will give you a fips 140 hive and three compliance uh and this is for a single customer dedicated hsm i believe one is temp tamper evident and the other one is tamper proof um but uh yeah so for key vault the the single tenant is just a separate offering okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at azure security benchmarks so these includes a collection of high impact security recommendations you can use to help secure the services you use in azure include security controls and service based lines so azure security benchmark is a holistic security guidance influenced by the cloud adoption framework the azure well architected framework and the microsoft security best practices so we're talking about security controls these are recommendations that are generally applicable across your azure tenant and azure services each recommendation identifies a list of stakeholders that are typically involved in planning approval or implementation of the benchmark then you have service baselines so these apply the controls to individual azure services to provide recommendations on that service uh security configuration let's take a look here at azure security center and this is a unified infrastructure security management system it strengthens the security posture of your data centers provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud so here is what it looks like and the idea here is that you have a regulatory compliance dashboard that shows you your compliance posture for a set of supported standards regulations based on continuous assessment of your azure environment so the compliance policies currently supported are the azure security benchmark ppci dss iso 22701 sock tsp so here you would see um a compliance policy and you can see that it has 32 out of 40 past controls if you drill down you could see those controls in detail uh then there there's the security score so security center continually assesses your resources descriptions and organization for security issues it then aggregates all the findings into a single score so you can tell at a glance your uh your current situation so the higher the score the lower the identified risk level so there you go you can see this one is at uh holding at 80 percent uh the security score helps with understanding your current security situation efficiently and effectively improving your security the security controls within azure security center are used to calculate the overall score so security controls are recommendations of actionable security items that will help improve your overall security score so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look at azure security benchmarks if you feel like you're having deja vu it's because i covered this earlier in the course but i wanted to give it a little bit more attention here so i described it in an alternate way here and digged a little bit deeper all right so before we can answer what the security benchmark is let's describe what a security baseline is so a security baseline is a set of minimum security controls defined for defined for low impact information systems moderate impact information systems and high impact information systems so security baselines for azure focus on cloud sensor control area uh control areas and these controls are consistent with wellknown security benchmarks such as described by the center of internet security cis so azure security benchmark asb is a security baseline for azure and the benchmark is part of a set of holistic security guide guidance that also includes the azure cloud adoption framework azure well architected framework and the microsoft security best practices so the azure security benchmark has the following controls and these are grouped so you have network security identity management privilege access data protection asset management logging threat detection incident response posture vulnerability management endpoint security backup and recovery governance and strategy and this whole thing the azure security benchmark is actually just an excel spreadsheet that you can download uh and what it includes are recommendations with the following fields so azure controls ids recommendations guidance responsibility azure security monitor center whether the azure security center monitors this control which is kind of weird because when i actually opened it up these fields didn't exactly match one to one but i do i did pull out one in particular for us so we can see what it looks like so they'll have general guidance here so notice that they're just kind of like describing it so they're just saying what it can do and then we have some links and notice that it's linking to um i'm not sure which stock this is but when they talked about those three uh resources that's what they talk about when they're saying that they're influenced by those three for azure control this would be the asset management then it has its id uh then there are um uh cis controls so like these or nist controls so the idea is they're saying like yeah we have this control in our system but they map over to these wellknown ones so you know you can trust them uh then there's the benchmark recommendation uh then there's responsibility so here's this customer and then there's customer stakeholders um and that points over to the cloud adoption framework so uh you know you can open it up and give it a read it's not super fun but this pretty much is the gist of it okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are taking a look here at azure defenders so azure defender provides advanced protection for your azure and onpremise workloads and azure defender can be found in the azure security center so with the security center there'll be a tab called azure defender and that's the way you find it so azure defender is composed of coverage security alerts insights and advanced protection so talking about coverage it allows you to see the resource types that are in your subscription and eligible for protection by azure defender so here take note that we can see things like virtual machines kubernetes services container registry app services sql vms vault key vaults sql servers and storage accounts for security alerts they describe details of the affected resources such as remediation steps and in some cases an option to trigger a logic app in response so here you can kind of see security alerts over time uh then there are insights this is a rolling pane of news suggested reading and high priority alerts that give security centers insights into pressing security matters that are relevant to you and your subscription for advanced protection within defender are additional security features that is driven by analytics so vm vulnerability assessments justintime vm access adaptive application control container image scanning adaptive network hardening sql vulnerability assessment file integrity monitoring network map iot security and so down below you can see all these options here whether they're turned on or not let's take a we'll take a look at network map here in a moment so scope of azure defender so it has a lot of different plans for specific azure resources so we have azure defender for servers app service storage sql kubernetes container registry key vault resource manager dns open source relational databases and when you turn on azure defender all plans are activated we saw that under the advanced protection tabs then just to kind of highlight network map because this one's really cool it's a network map that provides a graphical graphical view with security overlays giving you recommendations and insights for hardening your network resources so using the map you can see the network topology of your azure workloads uh connections between your virtual machines and subnets and the capabilities to drill down from the map into a specific resource resources and the recommendations of those resources and then just the last thing i want to touch on here is hybrid cloud protection so azure defender can protect vms residing in other cloud service providers such as aws and gcp via azure arc so azure arc if you've never heard of it is a control plane that can manage compute resources across cloud service providers on premise and at the stage or at the edge and so for infrastructure you'll notice that it can handle vms uh kubernetes clusters sql servers and azure stack hcis hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at azure sentinel so azure sentinel is a scalable cloud native security information event management so siem and security orchestration automated response so soar a soar so azure sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise providing a single solution for alert detection threat visibility uh proactive hunting and threat response so uh here's the big old wheel that azure sentinel likes to use to describe it and what's cool about this offering is it's both an siem and a source so you don't have to have two separate services talking about collect first so collect data at cloud scale across all users devices applications and infrastructure both on premise and in multiple clouds detect previously undetected threats and minimize false positives using microsoft analytics unparalleled threat intelligence investigate threats with artificial intelligence and hunt for suspicious activities at scale tapping into years of cyber security work at microsoft respond to incidents rapidly with builtin orchestration and automation of common tasks let's take a look at what azure sentinel can actually ingest from other data sources so we have a number of connectors here such as microsoft 365 defender office 365 or microsoft 365. that's how they like to call it now azure ad microsoft defender for identity microsoft cloud app security and common event formats would be syslog rest api windows event logs common event format so cef and trusted automated exchange for indicator information or also known as taxi let's take a look here at azure workbooks and this is really a feature of azure monitor but azure central allows you to create workbooks really easily so workbooks provide a flexible canvas for data analysis and creation of rich visual reports within the azure portal they allow you to tap into multiple data sources from across azure and combine them into unified interactive experiences it tells a story about the performance and availability about your applications and services so here's a big funny graph and uh here's another one but the idea is that these are kind of like living documents where you can uh visualize the monitoring stuff with like written text and visuals so workbooks are temporary workspaces to find a document like format with visualizations intertwined to help investigate and discuss performance if you've ever used jupiter notebooks it's kind of similar but for logging all right so let's take a look at some of the core features of azure sentinel so i'm just going to go through a bunch of them here so let's get to it so azure sentinel uses analytics to correlate alerts into incidents so over here we can see that we have a list of them and incidents are groups of related alerts that together create an actionable possible threat that you can investigate and resolve then there's automation orchestration so with sentinel you have solutions that provide a highly extensible architecture that enables scalable automation as new technologies and threat emerge and this is just using azure logic apps so it's a great way of not having to use any code but you can chain things over into different services and they have over 200 connectors so there's a lot you can do here for investigations uh the investigation tools help you understand the scope and find the root cause of a potential security threat and you can choose an entity on the interaction graph to ask interesting questions for a specific entity and drill down into that entity and its connections to get to the root cause that's root cause analysis should wrote that in there for you for hunting so azure sentinel's powerful hunting search query based tools is based on the miter framework now you know why i covered that earlier which enables you to proactively hunt for security threats across your organizational data sources before an alert is triggered after you discover which hunting query provides high value insights into the possible tax you can create custom detection rules based on your query and service those insights as alerts to your security instance responders while hunting you can create bookmarks from interesting events enabling you to return them later share them with others and group them with other coordinating events to create compelling incident investigations so there you go so just a quick description here of azure sentinel pricing so it has two pricing models capacity reservation this is build a fixed fee based on the selected tier enabling a predictive total cost for azure sentinel and pay as you go so build per gigabyte for the volume of data ingested for analysis in azure sentinel and stored in azure monitored log analytics workspace hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at microsoft 365 so it was formerly known as office 365 but you'll see me refer to it as office 365 because everyone's used to with that but it is a suite of business software packaged as soft as a sas offering so there are a bunch of services you probably recognize quite a few of them and you can access it at the portal.office.com most notable services would be sharepoint so that's a site collaboration shared company document drive outlook that's an email service word processor which is word powerpoint that's slideshows excel that's spreadsheets teams collaboration app for your organizations similar to slack so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at microsoft 365 defender which is a unified pre and post breach enterprise defense suite the natalie natively coordinates responses such as detection prevention investigation across endpoints identities emails and applications to provide integrated protection against sophisticated attacks so if you're looking for where the service is you'd open up portal.office.com you look at the the side menu and you're clicking on security that is where you will find microsoft 365 defender so defender is composed of the following services it has a secure score endpoint it's for office 365 identity app security and so that's just kind of a graphic to reiterate over those four okay so within microsoft 365 defender you get a secure score and this is a representation of your organization's security posture and your opportunity to improve it via improvement action so uh this is very similar to azure defenders secure score they just have a slightly different terminology to make it a little bit more uh company friendly people that aren't developers but over here we have the secure score and then you see the improvement actions looks very similar to what we saw before so within microsoft 365 we have endpoints and these are a set of destination ip addresses dns domain names and urls for microsoft 365 traffic on the internet so to optimize performance for m365 cloudbased services these endpoints need special handling by client browsers in the devices in your edge network and these devices include firewalls ssl brakes and inspect packet inspection devices and data loss protection dlp system so this is what it looks like again it's just ip addresses and dns domains so endpoints are grouped into four service areas exchange online sharepoint online and onedrive for business skype for business online and microsoft teams and uh m365 common office online so it's just a bunch of these things here on the left hand side but they specialize for those particular areas so now taking a look here at microsoft defender for endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent detect investigate and respond to advanced threats and so defender for endpoint uses the following combination of technology built into windows 10 and microsoft cloud service so we have endpoint behavioral sensors so embedded in windows 10 these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from os and send this sensor data to your private isolated cloud instances of microsoft defender for endpoint then you have cloud security analytics so this is leveraging big data device learning and unique microsoft optic optics across the windows ecosystem enterprise cloud products such as office 365 and online assets behavioral signals are translated into insights detections and recommended responses to advanced threats then we have threat intelligence this is generated by microsoft hunters security teams and augmented by by threat intelligence providers by partners threat intelligence enables defender for endpoint to identify attack attacker tools techniques procedures and generate alerts when they are observed in collected sensor data so within uh microsoft 365 defender you have security reports and these are general security dashboards about security trends for m365 identities device and apps information is organized into cards on the dashboard so you have identities where we'll have users at risk and global admins then you have devices so devices at risk device compliance devices with active malware types of malware on devices malware on devices devices with malware detection users with malware detection then you have apps which have risk levels and so all this information can be reorganized so right now we have identities devices and apps but we could also have risk detection threads and configuration health so just to kind of tell you a little bit more here it's just imagine you have a bunch of these cards and they're broken down by all these categories here so you can have a bird's eye view of what's going on okay uh one particular report that is interesting to show you is the office 625 exchange one so this is email collaboration reports so just kind of gives you statistics over time so that's a viewer to drill down into a particular type of report here um and so you can kind of see things like you know spam detection over time spoof detection things like that okay so m365 defender for identity is a cloudbased security solution that leverages your onpremise active directory signals to identify detect and investigate advanced threats compromise identities and malicious insider actions directed at your organization it detects advanced attacks in hybrid environments to monitor users entity behaviors and activities with learning based analytics protect user identities and credentials and stored in active directory identify investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain provide clear incident information on simple timeline for fast triage i had the hardest time trying to find any kind of screenshot for this and i just kind of gave up so i mean you have the gist of it but it's nice to have a visual you know so microsoft defender for identity monitors your domain controllers by capturing and parsing network traffic and leveraging windows events directly from your domain controllers then analyzes the data for attacks and threats so here is kind of the architecture of it so you know we have our domain controller over here then we have microsoft defender identity and then it's going to go to our cas mcas so that we can do some analysis and stuff later on and you could pass it off over to your siem or azure sentinel and things like that so utilizing profiling deterministic detection machine learning behavioral algorithms defender for identity learns about your network enables detection of anomalies and warns you of suspicious activities so microsoft defender for office 365 protects against advanced threats by email messages links teams sharepoint onedrive for business and other clients and protection is provided via reports threat investigations thread responses threat protection policies and there's three available subscriptions we have the exchange online protection the defender for office 365 plan one and plan two and office 365 security builds on the core protections offered by eop so eop is present in any subscription where exchange online mailboxes can be found so go in more detail here for eop cloudbased filtering service that protects your organizations against spam malware and other email threats defender office p1 safe attachments checks email attachments for malicious content safe links links are scanned for each click a safe link remains accessible but malicious links are blocked protection for sharepoint onedrive microsoft teams identifies and blocks malicious files in team sites and document libraries antiphishing protection so it detects attempts to impersonate your users internal or custom domains realtime detection a realtime report that allows you to identify and analyze recent threats for defender for office p2 i don't know why i didn't highlight that one but that's how it goes includes defender office p1 features so we have threat trackers latest intelligence and cyber security issues takes counter measurements before an actual threat threat explorer so realtime reports that allows you to identify and analyze recent threats automated investigation and response also known as air is a set of security playbooks that can be launched automatically start an automatic investigation provide detailed reports recommend action security teams can can approve i'm describing what a playbook is there so attack simulator so run realistic attack scenarios in your organization to identify vulnerabilities so you can see that p2 is very very good a bit more detail on the eop here is an on is a cloudbased filtering service that protects your organization from spam malware and other evil threats i know we just said it but here is kind of the graphic and so this has features for antimalware inbound antispam uh outbound spam connection filtering antifishing antispoofing zero outer auto purge zap for delivered malware spam and phishing messages preset security policies 10 allow block list allow block lists for message senders directory based edge blocking so dbeb mail flow rules accepted domains message training and more i just couldn't fit them all on the screen but i just wanted to show you how valuable exchange online protection is and that's one reason why you don't want to be using i mean you could but like this is one of the advantages of exchange over gmail okay so microsoft cloud app security mcas is a cloud access security broker so casb that sits between the user and the cloud service provider to gateway access in real time to cloud services if you're getting tired of the initialisms so am i because there's just so many uh mcas is built on top of the four principles of the microsoft cloud app security framework discover and control the the use of shadow it so identify cloud apps ias pass services used by your organization investigate usage patterns uh patterns assess uh and risk levels assesses and risk levels and business readiness for more than 16 000 sas apps against more than 80 risks starts managing them to ensure security and compliance then you have protect your sensitive information anywhere in the cloud understand classify protect the exposure of sensitive information at rest leverage out the box policies and automated processes to apply control in real time across all cloud apps protect against cyber threats and anomalies to detect unusual behavior across cloud apps to identify ransomware compromise croppers users or rogue applications analyze high risk usage and remediate automatically to limit the risks to your organization assess the compliance of your cloud apps so assesses if your cloud app meets relevant compliance requirements including regulatory compliance and industry standards prevent data leaks to noncompliant apps and limit access to regulated data more information we're not done cloud app security integrates visibly with your cloud by uh using cloud discovery to map and identify your cloud environment and the cloud apps using your organization so just take note over here okay sanctioning and unsanctioning apps in your cloud using easy to deploy app connectors that take advantage of provider apis for visibility governments of your apps that you connect to using conditional access uh app control protection to gain realtime visibility and control over access and activities within your cloud apps helping you have continuous control by setting and then continually finetuning policies office 365 cloud app security is a subset of microsoft cloud app security so there is a variant here for us and this has threat protection based on user activity logs discover shadow it for apps with similar functionality to office 65 offering yeah get this for no extra cost if you have azure premium one okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're going to take a look here at microsoft endpoint manager so microsoft intune and configuration manager were two separate products and they were merged into a single service called microsoft endpoint manager because they're so darn similar but they had different product uh marketing all this stuff and just got really confusing so they just rolled it into one so microsoft intune is used for managing the security of mobile devices configuration manager is used to manage desktop servers and laptops this can all be accessed via the endpoint.microsoft.com that's where the microsoft endpoint manager admin center is we'll just talk about intune configuration manager is pretty similar so we don't need to go into details about that but microsoft intune is a mobile device and mobile application manager so mdm mam found within the microsoft endpoint manager so it can manage devices manage security baselines use policies to manage device security use device compliance policies configure conditional access integration with microsoft defender endpoint role based access controls and it integrates with azure id mobile threat defenders admx templates win32 custom lob apps and more so microsoft intune can be used to manage onpremise infrastructure via intune connectors which i think that's pretty cool intune connectors for active directory intune certificate certificate connector and there we go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at the concept of regulatory compliance so what is compliance it's conforming to rules such as a specification policy standard or law and regulatory compliance is an organization that takes an effort to comply with relevant laws policies and regulations so regulatory compliance can vary at the following level so federal state political and economic union and international organization so why do we have regulatory compliance will governments want to protect its citizens data that is collected by companies and organizations what are compliance controls well those are internal control mechanisms that need to be in place to detect prevent and correct compliance issues so public standards and policies document procedures uh training monitoring internal audits so what can uh they do to uh enforce these things so they have or the idea is why like what will the measures of regulatory compliance enforce so citizens get the right to access their data anytime the right to correct or uh or delete their data if needed retention periods that for a minimum or maximum time data should be stored enabling governments and regulatory agencies the right to access and examine data when necessary defining rules for what data can be processed and how that should be done okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're going to take a look here at the m365 compliance center so this provides easy access to data and tools that you need to manage your organizational compliance needs so here is a screenshot and the way you get there is compliance.microsoft.com sometimes these things are hard to find so you got to know what these domains are so some of the features here would be compliance score audits activity alerts solution catalog data classification ediscovery insider risk management records management and that is not the definitive list there's a lot of stuff in here don't worry we are going to spend quite a bit of time around compliance center in this course so you know we're going to dive deeper on some of these things if you want to access compliance center you need to be either a global administrator compliance administrator or a compliance data administrator hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at the azure trust center and this is a public facing website portal providing easy access to privacy security regulatory compliance information so yeah it's just a simple website but one of the cool features here is audit reports so auto reports is an independent audit report for microsoft cloud services which provides information about compliance with data protection standards and regulatory requirements so you'll get reports for iso sock nist fedramp gdpr and so you've got a big old list there of docs and pdfs you can download you can open them up and then see how microsoft and azure is being compliant hey it's andrew brown from exam pro we're going to take a look here at compliance manager so this is an at a glance summary for of the shared responsibility model for microsoft and your organization now i got a bit confused because i use it in one place and i found it somewhere else but it turns out there's two versions of this there's one in the microsoft trust center or azure trust center which is the classic compliance manager and then there's the m365 compliance center the compliance manager the screenshots here from the classic but the information is the same okay so risk assessment workflow and management tools is one of the things you get with this so provides task assignment and verification to help governance risk compliance teams and iet departments work together to streamline internal compliance activities you get intelligent tracking this understands common similar compliance activities across multiple standards and regulations to reduce your organization costs and efforts from regulation to audit by applying a single activity to multiple assessments or controls each uh each assessed control will be labeled preventative detective or corrective and will be mandatory or discretionary as assessments for gdpr uh nist and iso for office 365 for azure we have gdbr iso 2718 and then 2701 and hipaa and so this is what it kind of looks like here is the card that shows the compliance you have a compliance score now i imagine and maybe we'll look at this moment but m365 compliance center will be all around uh m365 assets and maybe the classic one combines both azure and microsoft but we'll have to investigate that so clicking into an assessment will give you a detailed list of actionable controls so here you see the controls and it has a score and you can assign it to someone and etc so yeah there you go okay since compliance manager has two variants i figured just to avoid confusion we should take a closer look at it here i have the microsoft 65 compliance center open at the top here you see compliance manager and so you have an overview improvement action solution so here you can see a compliance score and then here it has the improved actions these are really slow loading so i just opened another tab here so down below you can see the improvement actions um you know they generally look the same you can assign it to a user etc i don't know what we get if we click into it let's take a look again very slow loading um yeah so how to implement and then more information you can make implement implementation notes they have testing standard regulation documents so there's stuff you can do here to collect an audit to make sure that you are doing what you're supposed to be doing over in the service trust center you can drop it down you see classic compliance manager this is where we just were so for classic you'd connect it to your azure account just scroll down you'd see these cards here so you can click into a card and just expand it and see what kind of things you need to do there so there you go that is the two variants of compliance manager hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at compliance programs and so there's a lot of different ones uh that are for azure but i figured we should go through some of them so you get a bit more familiarity with this same stuff we covered in the az900 but if you didn't take that certification this is a great opportunity to see them firsthand okay so the first one here is the criminal justice information services this stands for uh this initialism here is cjis so any state or local agency that wants access to the fbi's database is required to adhere to the uh cjis security policy then you have the cloud security alliance csa star certification this is an independent third party assessment of a cloud provider security posture then you have the gdpr this is a european privacy law imposes new rules on companies governments agencies nonprofits and other orgs that offer goods and services to people in the european union or that collect analyze data tied to eu residents this one is a very well known one because even if you don't live in the eu you still basically have to enforce this on your website this goes for everybody which is if people want to uh delete their data they should be able to they should know what kind of data is being collected etc we have the eu model clauses this is the contractual guarantees around transfers of personal data outside the eu you have hipaa so this is a u.s federal law that regulates patient protected health information you have the iso 27018 this is a code of practice covering the processing of personal information by cloud service providers you have um multitier cloud security this is operational singapore security management standard it's a common center that that cloud service providers can apply to address customer concerns about security and confidence confidential uh led of data in the cloud and impact of business of using cloud services then you have socks service organization controls there's sock one two and three so these are independent thirdparty examination reports that demonstrate how the company achieves key compliance controls and objectives generally uh tech companies are going for sock to compliance um so we'll go into the next section here we have nist cyber security framework this is a voluntary framework that consists of standards guidelines and best practices to manage cyber security related risks then you have like government specific ones so like there's one for canada there's one for all sorts of countries but this is a uk specific one it's called gcloud and it's a cloud computing certification for services used by government entities in the united kingdom and then you have fips so federal information processing standard this is a u.s and canada government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at microsoft information protection also known as mip and this is a collection of features within m365 compliance to help you discover classify and protect sensitive information wherever it travels or resides so the idea here is that we have this diagram and we have a four specific domains of things around our data and so the first is know your data the second is protect your data the third is prevent data loss and the fourth is govern your data which will be its own category here is kind of part of it so we'll get into it next okay all right so let's look at the three of the four domains here for the microsoft information protection these are features found within the microsoft compliance center so the first is know your data understand your data landscape and identify important data across your hybrid environment so one feature would be sensitive information types so identify sensitive data by using builtin or custom regular expressions or a function corroborative evidence includes keywords confidence levels and proximity we have builtin sensitive labels then there's and you have custom ones probably as well yeah so then there's train uh trainable classifiers so these identify sense of data by using examples of the data you're interested in rather than identifying elements in the item so pattern matching and you can use builtin classifiers or train a classifier with your own content so you have trainable classifiers here for data classification this is a graphical identification of items in your organization that have a sensitive label a retention label or have been classified you can also use this information to gain insights into the actions that your users are taking uh taking on these items so that's the content explorer the activity explorer all of these three features we will look at in granular detail okay so don't worry if they don't make sense right now the second part is protect your data so apply flexible protection actions that include encryption access restriction and visual markings so sensitivity labels the azure information protection unified labeling client double key encryption office 365 message encryption uh service encryption with customer key sharepoint information rights management irm rights management connector azure information protection unified labeling scanner microsoft cloud app security microsoft information protection sdk most of these you don't need to know but we will definitely cover sensitivity labels that's for sure then we have prevent data loss so these prevent accidental over sharing of sensitive information so that would be dlps endpoint data loss protection there is a chrome extension that does uh compliance compliance for you so it's built into your browser the m365 data loss prevention for onpremise scanner protection sensitive information in microsoft teams chat channel channels and messages we'll probably look at a more closer look at the last one there okay all right so out of the four domains the the last one here is for governance and this one particular one is actually more of a subset and so that's why we give it the microsoft information governance title here mig and it is a collection of features to govern your data for compliance or regulatory they have this nice graphic here to kind of show the scope of this here but we'll first talk about information governance so this is retention policies and retention labels import service archive third party data inactive mailboxes and then you have records management this is a single solution for email documents that incorporates retention schedules and requirements in a file plan that supports the full lifecycle of your content with records declaration retention and disposition so sensitive information types are classifications or categories of data by sensitivity so within the m365 compliance data classification feature you can get a breakdown of the distribution of sensitive info types so here imagine you have a bunch of documents and you said hey tell me what you found in these documents and there it gives it kind of a breakdown these types of identified base these are identified based on regular expressions or a function and there's hundreds of builtin uh information types so ip address eu passport number credit card number azure storage account key aba routing number canada health service number latvian driver license number netherlands tax identification number so it's a huge list these are used the sensitive information types are used in data loss retention so dlp policies sensitive labels retention labels insider risk management communication compliance auto labeling policies generally the first thing you're going to do with your data classification is get your sensitive information types okay and you can create your own too so if there's something that doesn't meet your needs you'll have to write your own regular expression but you can have whatever you want okay another feature found in data classification within the m365 compliance center are trainable classifiers let's talk about what training is and classifiers are so a classifier is a machine learning model that can take records of data and classify categorize by applying a label from a predetermined list of categories then you have training and this is the active teaching and machine learning model how to learn by providing it large amounts of data that is already labeled it uses the labeled data to tell if its predictions are similar to the ones provided so within m365 compliance center there are two kinds of trainable classifiers pretrained classifiers so ready to use classifiers with five pretrained classifiers we'll talk about those five in a moment you don't need to provide any data used for training meets any general use cases and you have custom trainable classifiers when you have your own kind of documents when you have specific business requirements but you'll have to provide the training data so the five are resumes source code harassment profanity and threat so here they are in the actual service itself okay another feature in the data classification within m365 compliance center is content explorer so this is a drill down to find emails or documents that have been labeled based on sensitive information types sensitivity labels or retention labels so the idea here is you have broad categories on the lefthand side where it says sensitive do you see the three categories information types labels and retention labels let me get out my pen here over here all right and then what you'll do is click into one and then they'll have more or specific actual items underneath and you'd click into one of those and then from there you can go and it's on the right hand pane over here which is this you can go and explore different documents and files to identify that kind of information okay the other explorer here is the activity explorer and this helps discover which file labels were changed and which files were modified so monitors label activity cross exchange sharepoint onedrive endpoint devices so here is a great visual just to get an idea so here you have filter so activity location user the type of filter you want and then you can just see so see it says labeled applied here so you can see that these labels were applied this gray is for files created files copy the cloud is a little orange here uh we have the green false copy to removable media is over here in the green so you get an idea of what this does okay so sensitivity labels allow you to apply a label to your document or email and the most common way is via builtin dropdowns within office 365 products i actually tried using these but i guess i'd have to do a lot of setup to get these and so i just had to grab previously existing screenshots but here's one for word here's one for excel and here's one from outlook so the idea is that you do do your business as per usual but you'd have to go ahead and classify that information into a particular sensitivity okay so sensitivity labeling makes it easy to apply uh or to do content marketing or encryption so content marketing would be like watermarks or warnings that are applied to the header and footer of a document so notice here you know you turn it on and you can say add this watermark with this customized text add this header add this footer i think you can even customize some of the colors very limited but it does the job okay the other one is encryption so apply encryption and specify which users and groups may decrypt and other finetuned permissions so the idea is you would turn the encryption on then you would select the users groups or et cetera who could do it then they have these broad categories and so this particular one is for email but here you can see that you know are you allowed to forward the email are you allowed to reply to the email can you save the email are you allowed to view it so it's very finetuned it's not just encryption even though that's what it's called so within the m365 compliance center under classifications you can see the distribution of sensitive labels applied to documents and emails or based on location so this gives you a visual as to understanding like where these labels are so here on the lefthand side is what has been applied and then here is where they are all right so sensitive labels can be used in providing protection settings that include encryption and content markings protect content in office apps across different platforms and devices protect content in thirdparty apps and services protect containers extend sensitive sensitivity labels to power bi extend sensitivity labels to assets in azure extend sensitivity labels to thirdparty apps and services and classify content without using any protection settings let's take a look here at label policies for sensitivity labels so in order to use sensitivity labels they need to be published alongside a label policy so a label policy determines who can use the label and other conditions so the idea is you say okay well which users can use these labels and then here are some of the settings here so notice below i'm going to get my pen out here so users must provide justification to remove a label or lower classification requires user to apply a label to the email or document provides user with a link to a custom help page so choose the users and groups that the label can see so labels can be published to specific users distribution groups m365 groups and azure ad and more so you apply default label a label to all the new emails and documents that can be specified for users and groups to create users can always change the default label if they believe the document or email has been mislabeled require justifications for label changes so if a user wants to remove a label or repeat it admins can require the user to provide a valid justification to complete the action the user will be prompted to provide an explanation for why the label should be changed then we have require user to apply a label some mandatory mandatory labeling it ensures a label is applied before users can save the documents send emails or create new sites or groups and we have link users to custom help pages so it helps users to understand what the different different labels mean and how they should be used let's take a look at retention labels and retention policies so retention labels ensure data is held for a specific duration to meet a regulatory compliance or industry best practice and retention policies are used to assign the same retention settings to content at the site level or mailbox level and we do have some nice visuals uh there the first one at the top just getting my pen out here top retention labels applied to content and then the locations of those labels not too different from sensitivity labels so we didn't have to spend too much time on it but it's pretty clear you're just holding on to data for a particular amount of time so what is records management well this is when an organization's process of managing uh their information throughout its life cycle and record management helps organization meet regulatory compliance legal requirements uh so a life cycle of a record would look something like identifying classifying storing securing retrieving tracking destroying and preserving and so a record represents labeled information or content and it's life cycle to be managed so uh within the n365 compliance center you have record management and this enables you to do label content as a record migrating managing retention plans and with file plan manager establishing retention and deletion policies within the record label triggering eventbased retention reviewing and validating disposition proof of record deletion exporting information about disposed items setting specific permissions for record manager functions and organizations for label content applies to the following so restrictions are put in place to block certain activities activities are logged proof of disposition is kept at the end of the retention period i could not find any screenshots for this and it was so hard to figure out how to even see it myself so i'm sorry but we're gonna have to deal with text for this okay so within m365 compliance center they have data loss protection dlp policies that prevent data loss so dlp policies allow you to identify and monitor and automatically protect sensitive information m365 help users learn how compliance works view dlp reports glp policies are composed of conditions so these are matching content before the rules enforced actions this is what action to take when the condition is found locations where the policy should be applied all right so not too complicated but there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at insider risk management and so this is another uh service that's underneath the m365 compliance center so insider risk management minimizes internal risks by enabling you to detect investigate and act on malicious and inadvertent activities in your organization so define the types of risk to identifying detecting organization including acting on cases and escalating cases to the microsoft advance ediscovery if needed so inside risk management is looking to detect leaks of sensitive data and data spillage confidentiality violations ip theft fraud insider trading regulatory compliance violations and so over here on the right we have the actual workflow for it and notice it is policy alerts triage investigate action the last three being all tied to an insider risk case and so the features we're going to cover literally maps to this workflow here these five things let's jump into it first looking at policies so policies are predefined templates and policy conditions that define what triggering events and risk indicators are examined in your organization so here's the here's the page itself you see you have warnings recommendations and policies and down below are your defined policies and we can drill down into those uh we'll be able to set alerts on them that's when they're talking about triggering events we're talking about alerts and so that's the next step here so alerts automatically generated by risk indicators that match policy conditions and are displayed in the alerts dashboard and so we can identify the status of an existing alerts and new alerts that need actions such as status severity time detected case and case status so down below you'll see the status the activity sense activity severity the case that it's part of the case status all right because these get grouped into case which we'll talk about here in a moment but if we want to uh dig deeper we can click in any into any of these alerts and this is where we're going to get triage so this allows reviewers uh to see detailed information about the activities identified within a policy and the user activity associated with the policy that was matched so you'll be able to see the severity alert and review the user profile information so it's a bit more information here but what's going to be really useful is actually investigate because that is a holistic view of all the alerts and information that have been tied under a case so the case dashboard provides an allup view of all active cases open cases over time and case statistics for organization reviewers can quickly filter case by study and the date the case was opened and the date the case was last updated cases are created for alerts that require deeper review and investigation of the activity details and the circumstances around the policy match so the primary investigation tools are user activity activity explorer content explorer and case notes so there you go another service that's within the m365 compliance center there's a lot of them in there is communication compliance and that helps minimize communication risks by helping you detect capture and act on inappropriate messages in your organization so you have predefined and custom policies that allow you to scan internal and external communications for policy matches so they can be examined by designated reviewers reviewers can investigate scanned email microsoft teams yammer or thirdparty communications in your organization and take appropriate action to make sure they're compliant with your organization's message standards so communication compliance can can scan increasing types of communication channels increasing the volume of message data regulatory enforcement of the risk of fines scenarios of communication compliance could be corporate policies so like acceptable use and ethical standards avoiding harassment or use of inappropriate offensive language then there's risk management so manage potential legal exposure and risk under authorized communications and conflicts of interest about confidential projects such as upcoming acquisitions mergers earnings disclosures reorganizations leader leadership team changes regulatory compliance so supervisory or oversight process of messaging that's inappropriate for the industry regulatory authority this one again it's hard to get screenshots of these services because they all require you to have trial and full information and microsoft was pretty sparse on this but this service does a lot but when you look at it doesn't seem like it does okay so it has this little workflow here where we have configure investigate and then there's the continuous monitoring so we'll quickly go through here so configure is identify your compliance requirements and configure application or applicable communication compliance policies so offensive or threatening language sensitive information regulatory compliance conflict of interest custom policy for investigate issues detected as matching your communication compliance policies alerts issue management document review reviewing user activity history filters so for remediate you have remediate communication compliance issues you've investigated to resolve tag a message notify the user escalate to another reviewer mark as a false positive remove messages in team and escalate for investigation then you have monitor and reports of communication compliance dashboard widgets export logs and event events record in the unified audit logs continually evaluate and improve your compliance posture so there you go that's communication compliance hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at the concept of information barriers so information barriers are policies that admins can configure to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other so information barriers can be applied to microsoft teams onedrive for business sharepoint online and more and information barriers only support twoway restrictions so maybe a use case would be like your school but you don't want one student to see the records of another student or a lawyer cannot obtain client data from another lawyer so you know for microsoft teams information barriers policies can restrict the following searching for a user adding a member to a team starting a chat session with someone and starting with a group chat and inviting someone to join a meeting sharing a screen placing a phone call sharing a file with another user uh access to the file through sharing links so there's a lot of restrictions and that's great for microsoft teams where you do this i think it's in the m365 compliance center i really tried hard to find this but it's just like this course like i can't find anything but it's something you need to know so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at privileged access management so it protects your organization from breaches and helps to meet compliance best practices by limiting sand limiting standing access to sensitive data or access to critical configuration settings so this gives you justintime access rules uh and there are uh that are implemented for tasks that need of elevated permissions and let an organization operate with zero standing access enabling privileged access management for exchange online in microsoft 365 allows your organization to operate with zero standing privileges and provides a layer of defense against standing administrative access vulnerabilities so here you can create approvers group enable privileged access management create an access policy submit approval privilege access requests and that's all the steps there if you just want to see it there again okay so customer lockbox protects sensitive data when working with microsoft support engineers by enforcing a request system to view custom private information to resolve an m365 related issue so customer lockbox supports requests to access data for exchange online sharepoint online onedrive for business and you need to turn on customer lock box in order for this uh to work and the support engineer must make an email request and a pr and it must be approved by you before they can access it and the support engineer only has access for the minimum amount of time that they need it for and an audit trail of access is maintained so that way you know if there was tampering stuff that evidence is there so here is an example of a request that is pending your approval so the support engineer is saying hey i need to get into whatever it is and and you say accept or deny okay so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look at ediscovery and this is again another service found within the m365 compliance center so ediscovery stands for electronic electronic discovery and this is the process of identifying and delivering electronic information that can be used as evidence in legal cases so ediscovery tools in m365 to search content in exchange online m365 groups and in teams in sharepoint online onedrive for business sites skype for business conversations yammer teams and so there are two uh options we have core in advance we'll definitely walk through those two but m365 provides the following ediscovery tools so content search core ediscovery advanced ediscovery okay so we will get into these now so core ediscovery in m365 provides a basic ediscovery tool that organizations can use to search and export content in m365 and office 365 so you can use query discovery to place an ediscovery hold on content locations such as your mailboxes sharepoint onedrive and microsoft teams so nothing is needed to deploy query discovery but there are some prerequisites that you have to do before you can complete for your organization okay so those would be things like verifying and assigning appropriate licensing assign ediscovery permissions create a core ediscovery case and then from there you can use the holds the search for content and export and download the search results okay let's take a closer look here at content search and holds for ediscovery workflows so to perform a content search you can create a new search specify the locations provide keywords and conditions and if you leave the keywords blank it will return all the items and conditions i just want you to notice a few things here you can also search by id list here we have our location so we have exchange point sharepoint exchange i think teams is supposed to show up there i'm not sure why it's not there for my use case you could also search within a hold so you have your keyword you can leave that blank and they have a lot of conditions like i cut this off but it's like super long okay so then we have holds and so the difference here is that a whole will preserve content uh for as long as the hold exists okay and so you are being you're able to basically search the exact same things um with the exception i think yammer groups is added there the con is preserved until you remove the content location from the hold or until you delete the hold after you create an ediscovery hold it may take up to 24 hours for the hole to take effect okay so let's take a look here at advanced ediscovery workflow so this workflow builds on the existing core discovery discovery workflow but it's just a lot more advanced it's an endtoend workflow to preserve collect review analyze and export content that's relevant to your organization's internal external investigation it also lets your legal teams manage the entire legal hold notification workflow to communicate with custodians involved in a case so the builtin workflow for advanced ediscovery just described below hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at m365 audit so what is an audit well that's an investigation uh into a security event forensic investigation internal investigation or compliance obligation an audit would involve capturing recording retaining unified audit log and uh m365 has two solutions so we have a basic audit so enabled by default thousands of searchable audited events 90day audit record retention expert audit records to a csv and this tool shows up in the compliance center it also comes with the activity api so it's just a way of interacting with it and you can also use it in powershell with the search unified audit log commandlet then there are is the uh advanced audit so this includes all the base basic features of audit features but it has retention policies longer retention periods high value and crucial events and higher bandwidth to the office 365 management activity api okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look at resource locks so as an admin you may need to lock a subscription resource group or resource to prevent other users from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources so this is within azure here i have a resource group and i can set it either to read only and so this will allow the authorized users to who can read a resource but they can't delete or update the resource and then you have the delete so authorized users can still read and modify resource but they can't delete the resource if you notice there's a bit of inconsistency with the naming where i have read only and cannot delete it's because this is what they are in the api and this is what they are in the actual portal okay let's take a look here at resource tags so a tag is a key and value pair that you can assign to azure resources so it's as simple as a name and a value or a key and a value and so some tag examples could be a department so a status a team an environment a project a location and so tags are really important because they allow you to filter your inventory in a lot of different ways so they allow you to organize based on resource management so specific workloads environments like developer environments maybe cost management and optimization so cost tracking budgets alerts operations management so business commitments sla operations mission uh critical services security which is the one we're interested in for this course so a classification of data and security impact governance and regulatory compliance another one we care about automation workflow automation okay let's take a look here at azure blueprints and this enables quick creation of governed subscription so you can compose artifacts based on common or organizational based patterns into reusable blueprints the service is designed to help with environment setup so blueprints are a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts such as role assignments policy assignments arm templates resource groups and so azure blueprints service is backed by the globally distributed azure cosmodb and blueprint objects are replicated to multiple azure regions a comparison is between arm templates and blueprints because they appear to do the same thing and so nearly everything you'd want to include for deployment in azure blueprint can be accomplished with an arm template but with arm templates they are stored either locally or in source control there's no active connection or relationship to the arm template but with blueprints the relationship between the blueprint definition what should be deployed in the blueprint assignment what was deployed is a huge um advantage here especially if you are care about this from the sense of compliance or security because then we have the exact idea what is going on with their stuff so you can also upgrade several subscriptions at once that are governed by the same blueprint so azure blueprint supports improved tracking and auditing of deployment so that is the difference there okay so azure policies enforces organizational standards to assess compliance at scale and policies do not restrict access but they only observe for compliance so here's a list of builtin policies that you use right away and if you can squint here i know it's a small screenshot but do we see fedramp nist things like that and notice that they map over to they might map over to specific services or maybe it's regulatory compliance it's going to vary for that stuff okay so the idea is that a policy is actually just a policy definition and this is just a json file users describe business rules to control access resources you have policy assignments so this is the scope of a policy effect so it can be assigned to a user resource group or management group then you have policy parameters these are values you can pass into a policy definition or so or or your policies are flexible for reuse then you have initiative definitions this is an initial definition is a collection of policy definitions that can assign so let's say you want a group of policies to enforce pci dss compliance so notice here the reason i have that arrows because we're looking at whoops we're looking at the policy type over here so that's just these are all just one policy definition files each of these are a single file and then the initiatives over here these are a collection okay now in terms of viewing noncompliant resources once the policy is assigned it will evaluate for the compliance state periodically so here you can see that we have a compliance tab and in this particular case this is the policy that we uh have here and we can see that it's not being compliant okay so it's not super complicated but there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at the microsoft cloud adoption framework for azure and the idea behind this white paper and i call it a white paper because that's what it is even if it's in this kind of website format but it's here to help organizations utilize a stepbystep process to migrate their workloads over to azure so if you scroll on down here i mean they describe all these uh categories here but this is the visual here so the idea is you're going to define a strategy you're going to create a plan you're going to get ready so ready would be setting up a landing zone then you'd have to adopt either by migrating or innovating and then up between these steps you're gonna govern and manage so where does security fit in this well on the lefthand side you'll notice there's a whole section it's weird that it doesn't show up in here but there's a whole section on security and so there's security and governance and that's generally what we're interested in but we just click into the secure section uh you can see here uh it talks about uh things in the security disciplines like risk insights security integrations business resilience and then the security disciplines that we need to have if you scroll on down and this is what i found the most useful is that this particular graph kind of shows you the type of roles uh in your community that you're gonna need so like uh when in the plan stage like who you're gonna need in your team in order to fulfill this to the end right so i guess you could say security happens throughout the entire cloud.option framework but yeah you're just going to need different kinds of people to help you for different sections okay they do emphasize on three things like the xero trust uh model which we all know about uh i don't know what open group is the security disciplines map closely to the zero trust components in the core principles white paper uh published by the open group where microsoft actively participates okay so it's based it's basically a white paper another white paper uh that is just more about uh zero trust models other than this cyber security framework which is a pretty standardized framework uh used across the board for all csps so you know um you just need to know what the cloud adoption framework is it is uh pretty useful to go through and read this but there's a lot of stuff okay and so we've covered a lot of this in the course so um you know it's up to you if you want to do it it's definitely an auxiliary read but there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at the azure well architecture framework and this describes the best practices for building workloads on azure categorized into five pillars so we have cost optimization operational excellence performance efficiency reliability and security uh if you've ever seen the aws well wellarcaded framework it's pretty similar like the pillars are onetoone okay so cost optimization is managing costs to maximize the value delivered operation processes that keep a system running in production the ability of the system to adapt changes in the load uh reliability the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function and the last pillar security protecting applications and data from threats so for the topics covered security pillar we have role of security security design principles regulatory compliance reduce organizational risk administration application services government risk and compliance identity access management network security and containment security operations and there's a lot in here and i actually went through all of these categories and i did summaries on them uh but like it's just not fun to read through all this stuff and i don't feel that uh the course is gonna test you on it but i just wanted to show you that i actually did do it i went through it all um and so you know maybe i'll include these in the downloadable um lecture notes so if you do want to go through it and you just want a quick summary of all these categories but i just went through it to see if there was something that seemed really really unnecessary but you know it's just it's just information overload so i'm not going to read through all this because we'd be here for like 1520 minutes uh but i just wanted to know that that resource is available to you and you might want to just skim through it to you know get a general sense of security in azure okay so the microsoft security best practices is a collection of best practices that provide clear actionable guidance for securityrelated decisions this was previously known as the azure security compass and so uh the best practices are packaged into a series of videos or you can download the powerpoint slides and so the pro the best practice covers the following governance risk compliance security operations identity and access management network security containment information protection and storage application services and this is about 150 slides now the videos are pretty dull i wouldn't watch them but the slides are amazing and i'm definitely going to show you after this video we're gonna go take a peek at that uh uh slideshow uh but you know there there's the best practices the well architect framework the cloud adoption framework there's a lot of coverage that's in the same place i feel that this one this particular resource should have been on the exam guide but anyway i'm going to show it to you because you're just going to see you're going to go wow i'm going to spend some time reading here and it's going to probably help you solidify all the knowledge you've learned in this course okay all right so what i did here is i just typed in microsoft security best practices and below you can see that there's these guidance if you click into them here's all the videos it would take forever to watch these things and they're really padded out they're just talking way too much but you know if you're looking to dive in a particular section you can go in there and check it out really good auxiliary resource for this course but i do cover everything so it's not necessary but if you're interested you should do it here you have a downloadable presentational slide that is what i did here i just want to show you how much they've done in this this is crazy like you go through it and so a lot of stuff we covered right but they just have really great visuals for the stuff and even stuff that we didn't covered so but there's like a lot of slides like i'm just going to click through here just to show you what i'm talking about a lot of these show up like you know the responsibility model we covered that uh these things i think i saw them in the cloud adoption framework so they're really pulling resources everywhere and creating very strong visuals for it uh but again you know it's a little bit overkill um for um you know if this was the the main study course material but yeah just browse through it and see what interests you okay hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at shared access signatures so sas is a url that grants restricted access rights to azure storage the share uh you can share the uri to grant client temporary access to specific set of permissions so you have a few different types of access signatures so account level sas so access to resources in one or more of the storage services service level sas so access to the single storage account by using the storage account key user delegated sas these are access to storage accounts using azure 80 credentials limited only to blob and containers microsoft considers this method the best practice for accessing via the sas so you know you use that one if that's the case a shared access signature comes in different formats so you have ad hoc sas the start time expiry time permissions are part of the uri any type of sas can be an ad hoc sas then you have service sas with stored access policies a stored access policy is defined on a resource container limited to the blob container table queues or file shares the stored access policy can be associated to multiple sas to manage constraints i know all these options seem really confusing but that's just what it is it's a lot more clear when you use it because you're just checkboxing stuff right um so the uri format itself is the blob your eye then there's the version number the start time the expiration the storage resources the permissions the signature they're not going to ask you to identify this stuff on the exam i'm just showing you the structure of it because it's a really long string and it's good to know what it looks like and yeah this is all those check boxes i'm talking about so you just go in here and you say i want to generate out a an sas you say what do i want it for what are the resource types what's the lab permissions what's the time frame what protocol do i want do i want particular ips you have your signing key and you generate it and it's that simple so let's take a look here at cores which stands for cross origin resource sharing it is an http header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins so whether it be a domain a scheme a report that it's owned from which a browser should permit loading of resources so you have a website and on your website you're going to have a piece of content so maybe it is a embedded script and so the thing is where does that script originate from so if it's from the same domain that's con then it's going to be of same origin as the server now you could also embed let's say an image and that image could come from a different domain and now it's technically cross origin and so unless you permit it using a special header such as access control allowed origin it would be automatically blocked because it's there to protect you right so cores restricts which websites may access data to be loaded onto a page and so the way it does that is through http headers so you'll have request headers like origin or access control request method request headers and for response you'd have access control allowed origin credentials headers max age allowed methods and headers the ones we see most common it'll be this one here the origin so where are you from i'm from domain one and then for the headers it would be like what do you want to allow so here it's a wild card but you could put in uh uh like wild card and then a domain name you could put multiple domain names in there to say these are the ones that are allowed to embed things on my website or be able to be loaded on my particular website and you have methods that's a very common one like is it allowed to do get post put patch options stuff like that okay let's take a look here at the microsoft security development life cycle the sdl and so this is an industryleading software security assurance process and it's a microsoft wide initiative and a mandatory process since 2004 the sdl has played a critical role in betting security and privacy in microsoft software and culture so building security into each stl phase of development lifecycle helps you catch issues earlier and it helps you reduce your developer development cost so this is all about pushing left we talked that in security it means doing things a lot earlier and so it has the face the phases of training requirements design implementation verification release response probably won't show up your exam but like you should know what stls are we're talking about security so i had included in here okay
