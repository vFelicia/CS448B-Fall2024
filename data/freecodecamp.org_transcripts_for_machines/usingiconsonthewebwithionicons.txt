how's it going guys my name is dom and today i want to show you how to use iconography on your websites or your web applications using the iron icons library so basically iron icons is a free and open source icon set containing over 700 icons for both the ios and material design styles so you can choose one of these two cells and use it for your icons so it actually comes packaged with the ionic framework itself but you can use it without the ionic framework so we're going to learn how to do that in this video so the first thing to do is to actually install the icon set in your html file so we can go to ionicons.com forward slash usage and then scroll down to the installation section we can now copy and paste this script tag inside our html file so for this file right here it looks like this we can just go down here and paste it right below the finishing sorry the end of the body tag so now we have the icon set installed inside the html file we can now use it very simply okay so the way this works is that each icon has its own web component so to use an icon below the h1 tag we can create a new tag it'll be the ion dash icon tag so this is a custom web component for the iron icon framework sorry the iron icon icon set or library okay so to specify what icon you want you can do so using the name attribute so inside here we're going to type out name equal to an empty string for now we're going to fill this with a prefix of the design to use followed by the actual icon name so back to the iron icons website we can go over to the icons section and then choose one of these icons let's choose the apps icon as an example right so if i choose this we get the name of the icon it's called apps so i can simply put apps inside here so if you're using the iron icons icon set with the ionic framework you can simply do this and you're done the design style is going to automatically be chosen based on the the os of the device it's running on but in this video we're looking at using it without the ionic framework so we have to actually specify the type of design to use so we have we have the material design or the ios design or style so we can see the difference between these two designs right here so to specify the actual design style we can prefix it with either md or ios so for example let's type out md dash apps just like that so now this will generate an svg of the apps icon for a material design so i can save this and refresh my browser and we get this right here an svg for the apps icon in material design okay perfect so we can simply change this to ios to achieve the ios version of that apps icon i can save this and refresh and we get this right here okay so pretty cool to actually customize this size and the color of these icons we can do so using a css or in the case of the the size we can use an attribute so for example i can say space and say size is equal to large to create a large icon i can save this and refresh and we get a bigger icon right there okay so to actually do that using css it's quite straightforward as well i'll get rid of this and go inside a new style tag and we're going to target every iron icon element inside the web page so we'll type our ion dash icon inside here we can put a font size property so we can say font size and the documentation recommends you use font sizes in multiples of eight so for example 8 16 32 or 64 and so on so let's say 64 pixels for this particular size i can save this and refresh and we get a much larger icon okay perfect we can also customize the color by using the css color property color and then blue okay i can save this and refresh and now we get this right here and that's how you can use the iron icons framework or sorry the iron icons library to achieve iconography inside your websites or your web applications right thanks for watching and i'll see you later
