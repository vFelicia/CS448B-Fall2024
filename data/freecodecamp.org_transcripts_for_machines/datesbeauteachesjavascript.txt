a javascript's date constructor helps with parsing managing and displaying dates there are a few ways to make a date object the quickest is to make the object for the current date and time so here's how you would do that do var v1 just do new date and i can log that to see what that's going to look like just do two string to convert it to a string and then if i run that you'll see in the console the date down below now i can also convert that to a date string and then it's just going to show if you look in the console it's just going to show the date or i can do to time string if i run down the console you can see it's just going to show the time or i can do two utc string and it's going to show it without my time zone in gmt so if you look back to the two time string it's always going to show the time zone of the browser so i am in the edt time zone so that's what it's going to show the time in okay we can also make a the object a different way so we can pass in the year month day hours minutes seconds and milliseconds so let's try that in javascript the months start at zero so um january is going to be zero february is going to be one march is going to be two so all the dates are just off by one and here i didn't even have to put two string you can just log the the date and it's going to give this format but if we do to to string it's going to be a little more readable and you can see we have the month as one and then it's showing february like i was saying it starts at zero now we can also create dates with a time value so we can do new date and then we're going to just insert a time value such as and this is a time that's the number of milliseconds since january 1st 1970. and that's that's when you when you're entering a time value that's what that time that number is okay let's try a bigger number there and i'm gonna run that okay so you can insert these milliseconds and you can see the date down below now the last way you can create a date is with a date time string there are a lot of options for that so let me show you a few so you can put in a date in a lot of different formats so i'm going to try it this way you can see i have the month day year and time and we can console.log that if i run that you can see below well here's a few other ways you can change this you can just put just the numbers 201503 for the month and then the the day at the end and then we can do it that way or we can only put the year and month we don't need the day right here or we can just put the year or we can do in a different format we can do it with some slashes like that so that's the month and the day and then you can put the year after it or you can actually type out the the month so we can do mar 25 now with this the month and the day can be in any order also the commas don't matter you can put commas or you cannot put commas or you can spell out the month completely so it takes a lot of different formats here so after you've created a date you can um there's a lot of methods to get information console.log and then i'm going to do get date i forgot to pass on the date they're going to get the date from so d4 dot get date and look at the the console the date when you do get dates can be the day of the month so it's gonna be 25 or you can do get day which is going to be the weekday as a number so six means it's going to be the sixth day sunday starts at zero and then the sixth day is gonna be saturday there's a lot of other ones you can do get full year get hours get milliseconds get minutes get month get seconds get time yeah if you get time it's going to be the millisecond since january 1st 1970. for all those things i just mentioned there are setters so we have the getters and setters so we can do um d4 set year and we can set a new year so i'm going to set that to 2020 and now we can do console dot log beef before dot to string and we run that oh i forgot to put the parentheses at the end okay so we have the the day has a new year now you can set the day the full year the hours the milliseconds the minutes anything like that and now lastly i'm just going to show you how you can use the date object to figure out elapsed time so let's do a program here first we have to figure out what the the start time is so i'm just going to create a new date and then we are going to call a function here which i'm just going to call do something which i have to create in a minute here now we have to get the end time so what's what's the time after we've done something and then we just have to figure out the elapsed time between the start and the end time so var elapsed so we're going to use one of those getters get time and we're going to subtract start dot time time from the end time minus the start time is going to be the elapsed time console.log the the elapsed time and this is going to be in milliseconds so now i just have to create the do something function and the point of this is just to do something that takes time here so we're going to create a for loop and we're just going to do some number in here while i is less than that number we're going to just increment i and this for loop isn't going to have anything in it so let's run this and see what happens and we have an error so let's see oh i forgot to put my curly braces after the for loop that was a pretty easy thing here okay let's run that again okay so you can see that took one millisecond you can see at the bottom there so let's create add a few more zeros to that and run that again and now we're down to 15 milliseconds you can see that's 15 milliseconds they had a few more zeros the elapsed time was 1235 milliseconds so that's the way you can just use the date object to find out elapsed time okay thanks for watching my name is
